"This video can not be played Schools moving online at short-notice could be 'confusing' for students All secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales will move classes online from Monday, the education minister has announced. Kirsty Williams said it was part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". However, the Children's Commissioner for Wales has criticised the decision as disruptive to education. A number of counties have also said primary schools will close earlier, including Cardiff and Swansea. Ms Williams said it was important to take a ""clear, national direction"" to ease the pressure from schools, colleges, local councils and parents and carers. ""Every day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms,"" she added. ""The virus is putting our health service under significant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission."" Teaching will move online from Monday in Wales She said the advice from Wales' Chief Medical Officer, Dr Frank Atherton, was to implement the online learning plan ""as soon as is practicable"". ""Having spoken to local education leaders, I am confident that schools and colleges have online learning provision in place,"" added Ms Williams. ""This will also be important in ensuring that students are at home during this time, learning and staying safe. ""Critically, and this is very important, children should be at home. ""This is not an early Christmas holiday, please do everything you can to minimise your contact with others."" Christmas fears sees parents pull children from school Mass testing in schools considered The latest data shows the infection rate across Wales is averaging more than 370 cases for 100,000 people, with 17% of tests now coming back positive. It means the reproduction (R) number in Wales has now reached 1.27, with infections doubling in 11.7 days. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland says she does not support closing schools early But Children's Commissioner Sally Holland said the move was ""not the right decision"" for children and young people in Wales and had yet to see any scientific advice to support the move. ""Whilst accepting the severity of the public health emergency and the responsibilities all of us have to keep each other safe, this decision compounds the disruption to our children's education over the last few months,"" she said. The announcement does not extend to primary or special schools, with the education minister ""encouraging"" them to remain open. However, a number of local authorities have announced they will also be halting face-to-face learning early. Schools in Swansea will all move to online blended learning on Monday, so Friday is the last day in the classroom for primary school pupils. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion parents have been sent emails telling them classrooms will close after Monday. Carmarthenshire council has said primary and special schools will be given the choice to move to online learning or stay open from Tuesday. Cardiff council said the final day in class will be Tuesday. ""The move is designed to enable students to remain at home in the run up to Christmas to try to halt the rise in infection rates,"" said a statement from Cardiff city officials on Thursday evening. The neighbouring Vale of Glamorgan will close primary schools on Wednesday, 16 December. Several local authorities have already announced they would shut schools early Some local authorities had already announced plans to close schools early. Blaenau Gwent shut classrooms on Wednesday, with infection rates in the county now standing at nearly 600 cases for 100,000 people. Record high Covid rates in Welsh council areas Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet In north Wales, Flintshire and Wrexham had decided to shut schools on Friday, with infection rates running at 175 and 230 cases per 100,000. Bridgend, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils had also planned to shut early next Wednesday. The teaching union NAHT hadcalled for schools in Wales to shut this Friday, and be replaced with online classes. But the union said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" the move did not include primary or special schools. ""This decision ignores Welsh Government's own advice on pre-isolating before seeing extended family over the Christmas holidays,"" said Laura Doel from the union. ""Many parents will simply vote with their feet and keep children at home anyway."" The Association of School and College Leaders has supported the Welsh Government's announcement. ""This is obviously a difficult decision but the public health advice is very clear that this needs to happen to tackle Covid infection rates in Wales and reduce transmission of the virus,"" said its director in Wales, Eithne Hughes. ""However, we urge the Welsh Government and local authorities to keep a close eye on the situation in primary schools and take appropriate action if needed."" The decision has also been welcomed by the National Education Union Cymru and Unison. But the move has been criticised by the education leader at one north Wales council. Huw Hilditch-Roberts, of Denbighshire council, said the announcement was a ""blanket approach based on what is happening in the south"". The rate of infection in the county is 101.4 per 100,000. ""Any decision to close schools should be made on the data, and the data in our area doesn't support the decision,"" he told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. ""I feel this could result in a community spike because it will be harder to manage with more children in the community for longer."" Responding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian said on-site provision must be made for all younger learners, and children of key workers ""who can't make alternative arrangements"". She said every secondary school pupilmust also have suitable devices for accessing online lessons, adding: ""Accessing education through Xboxes and mobiles phones is not good enough."" The Welsh Conservatives said the decision was another instance of ""confusing messages"" from the Welsh Government. ""There is no doubt that the situation is grave in parts of Wales, but I would have preferred targeted interventions where needed, not another blanket ban,"" said their education spokeswoman in the Senedd, Suzy Davies.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there is a âstrong possibilityâ the UK will not reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Boris Johnson says there is a ""strong possibility"" the UK will fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Speaking for the first timesince a crunch meeting in Brussels, the PM said ""now is the time"" for firms and people to prepare for a no deal outcome. Talks continue between the two sides but Mr Johnson said they were ""not yet there at all"" in securing a deal. Time is running out to reach an agreement before the UK stops following EU trade rules on 31 December. Weeks of intensive talks between officials have failed to overcome obstacles in key areas, including competition rules and fishing rights. Mr Johnson met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday, but the pair failed to make a breakthrough. What is an 'Australia-style deal'? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Mr Johnson pledged British negotiators, who earlier resumed talks with their EU counterparts in Brussels, would ""go the extra mile"" to reach a deal. But he said the EU wanted to keep the UK ""locked"" into its legal system, or face punishments such as taxes on imports, which had ""made things much more difficult"". The PM added that the EU's proposals would mean, despite leaving the bloc earlier this year, the UK would be forced to remain a ""twin"" of the 27-country organisation. ""At the moment, I have to tell you in all candour, the treaty is not there yet and that was the strong view of our cabinet,"" he said. Mr Johnson said that ""looking at where we are,"" it was vital the UK prepares for the ""Australian-style option"" of not having a free trade deal with the EU. ""There's a strong possibility that we will have a solution much more like Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,"" he said. Mr Johnson has insisted the country will ""prosper"" on these terms, but former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm said the UK should be ""careful what you wish for"". Mr Turnbull told BBC's Question Time there were some ""very large barriers to Australian trade with Europe"", adding: ""Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one."" Will there be no deal? Right now it is just too hard to say. But is Boris Johnson only trying to send messages to his opposite numbers? The answer is no. On Wednesday we saw this whole saga move closer to what both sides would consider a failure - an inability to agree on a trade deal that had been in reach and is still in their mutual interest. It may yet come to pass that the prime minster or the EU leadership will have a change of heart. Of course the rhetoric does not tell us everything that's going on. But the PM's warning tonight is far from just a message designed to be heard in EU capitals - whatever the merits of the decision he may take, Downing Street is preparing the ground for a choice to leave the status quo without firm arrangements in place. Australia is negotiating a free trade deal with the EU but currently does not have one. It largely does business with the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but has a few arrangements in place, such as co-operation on science and trade on wine. Moving to WTO rules on 31 December could result in tariffs being imposed leading to higher prices for the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU, among other changes. Canadafinalised a deal with the EU in 2017. Mr Johnson said he ""tried very hard to make progress"" at his dinner with Mrs von der Leyen, but the EU was making things ""unnecessarily difficult"". Meanwhile, the EU hasset out the contingency measuresit would take in the event of no trade agreement being reached with the UK. The plans aim to ensure that UK and EU air and road connections still run after the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. They also allow the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters for up to a year, or until an agreement is reached. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. EU leaders are meeting in the Belgian capital for a two day-summit of their own, although Brexit will not be the main focus. A spokesman said they discussed the situation on Friday morning, but only for 10 minutes. Arriving at the summit, Mrs von der Leyen said the conditions for a trade deal would have to be ""fair for our workers and our companies."" ""This fine balance of fairness has not been achieved so far,"" she said, adding that a decision would be taken on Sunday. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said the EU leaders had been preoccupied with disputes about their own budget, a maritime row with Turkey in the Mediterranean and coronavirus as they talked into the early hours of Friday morning. ""Brexit has not been the only priority here - perhaps not even the main one,"" he said. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer tells Boris Johnson to âget the dealâ and his party will then look at it. Before the PM's remarks, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Mr Johnson to ""get on and deliver"" a deal, adding the outstanding issues ""are capable of resolution"". Asked whether his party would back a deal in a vote in the Commons, he said: ""We will look at it - and we will act in the national interest."" ""But on a straight choice between no deal and deal, then deal is clearly in the national interest,"" he added. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"There were 75 Covid patients in critical care - slightly more than the week before - but units are working over normal capacity The number of Covid patients in hospital in Wales is the highest yet recorded. There were 1,936 Covid-19 patients in hospital beds on Wednesday, this was 153 more patients than the week before - according to the latest NHS Wales figures. It has risen in all areas, with Aneurin Bevan seeing the biggest increase and it has the most patients too - 592. They include a record number - 585 - who are recovering from the virus. Recovering patients were not counted until the end of May but the numbers in hospital are now at the highest levels since then. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Apology to hospital Covid outbreak patient NHS England long waits 100 times higher than before Covid Record high Covid rates in Welsh council areas Covid-19 patients make up about 24% of all patients in hospital. This compares with about 18% at the end of May and the proportion has been slowly increasing. But hospital admissions are holding steady - at an average of 71 a day over the past week. NHS Wales said Covid admissions had ""generally decreased"" since the start of November although there was volatility and fluctuations. There were 75 patients in critical care - slightly more than the week before. With new records being set each day, it's easy to understand why the NHS, especially in parts of Wales, is struggling. Staff are facing a triple whammy of pressures. Firstly, they're having to deal with the increasing burden of Covid - with rates of new infections surging across the country. Secondly, many of their own colleagues are either off work because they have Covid or having to isolate because of infections in their households - withone in 10 NHS staff herenow estimated to be off work. The impact of stress and exhaustion is also having an effect. And thirdly, the NHS having approaching the time of year when usual winter pressures are at their most severe. In a typical winter, hospitals struggle when people medically fit enough to leave can't because of delays in arranging social care. It means hospitals quickly fill up, because patients are flowing in more quickly than beds are becoming available. This year there's an added pressure of course - with hundreds (record numbers) of hospital beds now filled with patients who are taking a long time - several weeks or more -  to recover from the virus.

"With time running out for the UK and EU to reach a trade agreement - and with the prospect of no deal looming - the government has been talking about an ""Australian-style"" relationship with the EU in the future. Boris Johnson has frequently mentioned Australia, and has also said the UK should ""get ready to trade on WTO terms"". Whichever form of words you use, they are euphemisms for the same thing: a no-deal outcome. Australia trades with the EU under the basic rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it does not currently have a free trade agreement with the EU. But it is trying to negotiate one. ""Australians wouldn't regard our trade relationship with Europe as a satisfactory one,"" the former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull told the BBC. He warned the UK to""be careful what you wish for"". Under WTO rules, tariffs (or taxes) are automatically applied to the trade in goods between Australia and the EU. But even though there is no overall free trade deal, the two sides do have a series of agreements on things like wine exports and product standards, which make trade a little easier. If the UK's talks with the EU were to break down abruptly, the UK would not have any such agreements. With no deal, in other words, the UK would be facing an even more limited trading relationship with the EU than Australia has (the strictest limits would be on trade involving Great Britain - Northern Ireland would be treated differently). On top of that, it is important to remember that trade between Australia and the EU is very different to trade between the UK and the EU. Australia is on the other side of the world, whereas the UK is the EU's next-door neighbour. That means Australia doesn't do nearly as much trade with the EU as the UK does. And it doesn't rely on the EU, in the way the UK does, for the operation of just-in-time supply chains in sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals and food. So, border checks and delays - which happen much more when you don't have trade deals - have far less impact on EU-Australia trade than they would on EU-UK trade. Even so, Australia is trying to upgrade its relationship with the EU - the two sides have been negotiating a free trade deal since 2018. Mr Turnbull told BBC Question Time, ""Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one...there are very big barriers to Australian exports of agriculture products in particular and a lot of friction in the system in terms of services."" The EU is the UK's biggest single trading partner.In 2019, it accounted for:,external 43% of UK exports 51% of UK imports As an EU member state, the UK was part of its trading system - the customs union and the single market. This means there are no tariffs on goods, and minimal border checks. Because of the post-Brexit transition period, the UK is still in this system until the end of December. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Both sides have until then to reach a new free-trade agreement, which would get rid of tariffs and quotas (limits on the number of goods traded) but not new border bureaucracy. If they can't, then they'd have to trade on WTO rules - as Australia does. The WTO is the place where countries negotiate the rules of international trade - there are 164 members and if they don't have free-trade agreements with each other, they trade under basic ""WTO rules"". The WTO headquarters are in Geneva Every member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries with which they don't have a deal. These are known as WTO schedules. Yes, examples include the United States, China and Brazil. In fact, it's any country with which the EU has not signed a free-trade deal. That's when WTO rules kick in. But, like Australia, those big economies don't just rely on basic WTO rules - they have all done other deals with the EU to help facilitate trade. The US, for example, has at least 20 agreements with the EU that help regulate specific sectors, covering everything from wine and bananas to insurance and energy-efficiency labelling. The government has said repeatedly that it wants a free-trade deal along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? But the UK and the EU have been trying to negotiate an agreement that would have no tariffs or quotas at all. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Whereas the EU's deal with Canada does include tariffs and quotas (on some agricultural produce for example) and it had to be negotiated line by line over a long period of time. What happens if there's no trade deal? Under WTO rules, tariffs would be imposed on all imported goods, apart from in Northern Ireland, which is subject to a separate agreement with the EU. The average EU tariff is pretty low (about 2.8% for non-agricultural products) but in some sectors tariffs can be quite high. Cars coming from manufacturers in the UK would be taxed at 10%, with some agricultural tariffs even higher - rising to an average of more than 35% for dairy products. This would have a big impact on some UK businesses selling their goods to the EU. The UK would do the same, and impose its tariffs on imported EU goods which would have a big impact on some European companies. The government has alreadyreleased details,externalof the tariffs it will charge from January 2021 to countries with which there is no free trade deal. In some areas, they will be imposed to protect British producers - in the car sector, for example, and on most agricultural products, to avoid ""additional disruption for UK farmers and consumers"". That will lead to higher prices in the UK for some EU goods. But the government is also removing some of the tariffs it has been charging as part of the EU - in areas, for example, where there isn't that much domestic UK production that needs protecting. Here are some items that are having their tariffs cut to zero. It's important to remember that the WTO's ""most favoured nation"" rules limit room for manoeuvre in the event of no deal. The UK couldn't for example lower tariffs for the EU alone, in order to keep trade going. It would have to treat the rest of the world in the same way, which could lead to cheap imports flooding the UK economy, and harming domestic businesses. It's not just about tariffs - there are also what are called ""non-tariff barriers"". In many areas of the economy they are far more important. Non-tariff barriers include things like product standards, safety regulations and sanitary checks on food and animals. Many of them will apply with or without a deal, but businesses that trade with Europe fear that no deal in particular would lead to lengthy delays and extra costs. Eventually negotiations on some kind of deal would have to begin again, but that could take some time. All of this refers only to the trade in goods. The trade in services between the UK and the EU is also of critical importance. The kind of trade deal the two sides have been trying to negotiate wouldn't say very much about services anyway. But no deal would be an even greater challenge. And companies on both sides would be having to adjust to an abrupt change at the same time as trying to deal with the impact of coronavirus.

"A report from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group says families with children should consider ""pre-isolating"" for 10 days ahead of Christmas A union leader says she is hopeful schools will close after Friday so children can isolate before Christmas. Director of NAHT Cymru Laura Doel said she was hoping to meet with Education Minister Kirsty Williams on Thursday afternoon ""as a matter of urgency"". Families with children have been told to consider ""pre-isolating"" at homefor 10 days before Christmas if they are planning to see elderly relatives. The Welsh Government said its priority was ensuring education continues. Pupils in Blaenau Gwent had their last day in the classroom on Wednesday. Bridgend currently plans to follow Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils in closing schools early on 16 December. In Wrexham, secondary schools will switch to online learning for the whole of next week, while primary schools will do the same for the last two days of term. Conwy, Anglesey, Merthyr Tydfil, Pembrokeshire, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan councils said schools would remain open until 18 December as planned. All 22 councils in Wales have been asked for a response. Most councils in Wales say schools should stay open Christmas fears sees parents pull children from school A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Our priority remains ensuring education continues for all children and young people with as little disruption as possible. ""We will continue to hold regular discussions with local authorities and unions on these matters, as we have done throughout the pandemic."" Most Welsh local authorities have said schools should remain open until 18 December, despite calls from some unions to end lessons early. Ms Doel told BBC Radio Wales: ""I think we'll have the conversation this afternoon and I am hopeful that the minister who has, up until this point, always acted on the government health and safety guidance, will act upon this guidance today... ""I think parents are going to vote with their feet anyway."" Most local authorities plan to keep schools open until the end of term Following areport,externalby the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Tuesday, NAHT Cymru wrote to Kirsty Williams calling for blended or distance learning for the final week of term (14-18 December) for all school pupils. ""Self-isolation remains of paramount importance for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms,"" it said. ""The best way to protect older family members is not to expose them to potential infection, no matter how well-intended the reason for contact... ""No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with LAs making their own decisions based on local circumstances."" On 3 December union Unison Cymru Wales also wrote to Ms Williams asking her to close school sites and move schools to a home-schooling model from Friday. Whilesome parents have already taken the decision to pull their children out of schoolbefore the end of term, others say closing schools early is problematic. This video can not be played Split opinion among parents on removing children from school in the run up to Christmas NHS worker and mother-of-three Kimberley Lloyd, lives in Swffrydd in Blaenau Gwent where schools have already closed, said: ""It's left us in a  really difficult situation... ""Nobody wants to self-isolate over Christmas but my job doesn't stop tomorrow, my husband's job doesn't stop tomorrowâ¦ I really don't understand where the decision has come from and why it's been made."" Daniel and Samantha Pearce said the news their daughter Hazel, 10, would be at home after Wednesday came ""totally out of the blue"". Mrs Pearce, 34, who is a self-employed cleaner, said: ""There'll be parents that either can't or won't ask for their family's help to look after the children because they are frightened they could be giving them Covid just before Christmas."" SiÃ¢n Gwenllian, education spokeswoman for Plaid Cymru, called for the Welsh Government to shut all schools next week. She said those who can keep children at home should be encouraged to do so and a skeleton staff should be put in place for children who still need to attend. She said: ""The latest advice from the Technical Advisory Cell to the Welsh Government has shone a light on the risk associated with schools remaining open, and must be taken seriously."" The Welsh Government says school attendance is compulsory. However, it said it recognised Covid meant some families would have anxiety about their children's attendance at school so it would""not be appropriate"" to issue fixed penalty notices.,external There is no specific stipulation in law but the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty against Children (NSPCC) does not advocate children aged 12 and under being left home alone. The Welsh Government said all children had different needs and it was an offence to leave children of any age alone if it places them at risk. You could get a payment of Â£500 to help with loss of earnings if you or you child has been told to self-isolate and you cannot work from home. To qualify, you must have a child attending a school or childcare setting up to and including in year eight - or up to age 25 if the learner has multiple and complex additional needs. You must also be claimingone of a number of benefits.,external People will be able to apply for the payment through their local authority website from 14 December and payments will be backdated to 23 October.

"This video can not be played Split opinion among parents on removing children from school in the run up to Christmas Fears of families having to self-isolate over Christmas has prompted some parents to pull their children out of school before the end of term. Most Welsh local authorities have said schools should remain openuntil 18 December, despite calls from some unions to end lessons early. However Bridgend will followCaerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils in closingschools early on 16 December. Pupils in Blaenau Gwentwill have their last day in the classroom on Wednesday. The area recorded the highest Covid-19 infection rates in Wales last week, with pupils set to be taught online until 18 December. Victoria Rosser said there was ""a lot of pressure on parents"" Families with children have been toldthey should consider ""pre-isolating"" at home for 10 days before Christmasif they are planning to see elderly relatives, in areport,externalby the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Tuesday. But Health Minister Vaughan Gething said harm had been done to children when schools were closed, particularly vulnerable children, highlighting the mental health impact particularly among secondary school age children. Former primary school teacher Victoria Rosser, 34, from Cwmbran, is taking her children, aged five and eight, out of school a week early. ""There is a lot of pressure on parents. I feel the pressure immensely,"" she said. ""The children would be devastated if they came into contact with another child next week who was positive. It would mean isolating throughout the Christmas period. School pupils 'home-learning on games consoles' People advised to put off Christmas get-togethers Most councils to keep schools open to end of term ""It would mean they couldn't see their grandparents over Christmas. I'm also worried they could pass it on to their grandparents."" The mother-of-four said she was also worried about her own auto-immune condition and her newborn daughter's health. She said she informed her children's school she would not be sending them in next week, despite schools in Torfaen remaining open until 18 December. ""It's enough time to make sure they don't come into contact with any positive cases over the next two weeks and make sure they're nice and safe on Christmas Day to see family,"" she added. ""I've heard of a lot of families doing this. At the moment I think lots of parents would like to take their children out for the final week."" Samantha and Daniel Pearce said news their daughter Hazel, 10, would be at home after Wednesday came ""totally out of the blue"" Nic Cooke, 35, also from Cwmbran, has made the same decision for her seven and 11-year-old. ""We've had a lot of things spoiled for us and have had adapt to new ways of life this year due to Covid. I'm not letting them spoil Christmas,"" she said. ""If I sent my children in the last week of term and they needed to isolate then Christmas wouldn't be the same as we couldn't spend it with our family."" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said schools were among the safest places for children to be during the pandemic. Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils are planning to close schools a few days before the end of term. Schools in Blaenau Gwent will be the earliest in Wales to stop physical teaching, nine days before the end of term. Kimberley Lloyd is an NHS worker and mother-of-three from Swffrydd in Blaenau Gwent. She said her children's school was not providing a hub for keyworker's children which had created a childcare problem. ""It's left us in a  really difficult situation,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. ""I do understand the teachers' welfare and welfare of students - nobody wants to self-isolate over Christmas but my job doesn't stop tomorrow, my husband's job doesn't stop tomorrowâ¦ ""I really don't understand where the decision has come from and why it's been made."" Daniel and Samantha Pearce said the news their daughter Hazel, 10, would be at home after Wednesday came ""totally out of the blue"". Mrs Pearce, 34, who is a self-employed cleaner, said: ""There'll be parents that either can't or won't ask for their family's help to look after the children because they are frightened they could be giving them Covid just before Christmas."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We are having conversations all the time with local authorities and we've agreed that face-to-face teaching can continue until the end of next week. ""If this local public health situation is so significant that schools can't operate because they've got staff who aren't there, they may need to make different choices. There isn't a significant public health case that suggests that we need to close our primary schools."" He said school closures would have a ""direct impact"" on front-line services, adding: ""These are really difficult choices. These are presented as a simple and obvious choice - 'close schools and all will be well' - but it isn't that simple at all."" Mr Gething added: ""We review the evidence that comes to us pretty much each and every day. There's nothing simple and there's certainly nothing glib in the way that we make our choices."" The National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) Cymru is urging the Education Minister to close schools early before Christmas. In a letter to Kirsty Williams, NAHT Cymru called for blended or distance learning for the final week of term (14-18 December) for all school pupils. ""Self-isolation remains of paramount importance for anyone with COVID-19 symptoms,"" it said.. ""The best way to protect older family members is not to expose them to potential infection, no matter how well-intended the reason for contact.""

"Food and drink supplies in the UK face more disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period than they did from Covid, the industry has said. ""There are 14 [working] days to go,"" the Food and Drink Federation's (FDF) chief executive, Ian Wright, told MPs. ""How on earth can traders prepare in this environment?"" he added. Noting that rules for sending goods from Welsh ports to Northern Ireland had only just been published, he said: ""It's too late, baby."" Uncertainty over a deal and new border checks would make it difficult to guarantee the movement of food through ports without delays, he said. Mr Wright was giving evidence to the Commons business committee on Brexit preparedness. He said there was a big concern that the problems would ""erode the confidence of shoppers in the supply chain"", adding: ""It has done very well over Covid and shoppers will expect the same thing over Brexit, and they may not see it."" PM: 'Sweet reason' can get us to post-Brexit deal NI food supply warnings 'taken very seriously' ""We can't be absolutely certain about the movement of food from the EU to the UK from 1 January for two reasons,"" Mr Wright said. ""One is checks at the border. The other is tariffs, and the problem with tariffs is, we don't know what they will be."" Mr Wright added: ""With just 14 working days to go, we have no clue what's going to happen in terms of whether we do or don't face tariffs. ""And that isn't just a big imposition. It's a binary choice as to whether you do business in most cases. My members will not know whether they're exporting their products after 1 January, or whether they'll be able to afford to import them and charge the price that the tariff will dictate."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Wright warned that while he expected Kent and Operation Brock to work ""reasonably well"", he was less confident about ports such as Holyhead, with goods heading to Northern Ireland. He called the Northern Ireland protocol a ""complete shambles"", adding: ""The idea that you can prepare for something as big as the change that's going to happen is ridiculous, it's a massive toll."" Mr Wright added that 43% of FDF members who supply Northern Ireland have said they were not going to do so in the first three months of next year. He told MPs that many companies had lost some of their customer base in the EU. ""The problem is, if there's any disruption to supply, you lose your customer pretty quickly and you do not get them back,"" he added. Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, told the committee that up to a quarter of the UK's financial activity was EU-related and that in the worst-case scenario, about 40% of that business could be lost. However, he added: ""We've not seen this vast shift in jobs and activity."" Instead, Brexit had acted as a ""strategic accelerator"", with firms taking action such as restructuring EU-based offices as standalone operations. Even so, he warned: ""This all comes ultimately at a cost."" Lloyd Mulkerrins of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that if tariffs were levied on parts and finished vehicles, the UK's car industry was likely to see a sales decline of 20% to 30%. Production would decline from as much as 1.6 million to just 800,000, he told the MPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Mass testing will be rolled out to secondary school children in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent and Essex, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said ""by far"" the fastest rise in coronavirus infection rates in these areas was in 11 to 18-year-olds. This age group in these areas should be tested regardless of symptoms, he said. ""We need to do everything to stop the spread in school-age children now,"" Mr Hancock said, adding that more details will be set out on Friday. It comes after Londonerswere urged to ""stick by the rules""this week amid fears the capital - in tier two - may be put under tier--three restrictions following a rise in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, all secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales willmove classes online from Monday, Welsh education minister Kirsty Williams has announced. Secondary schools 'move online' over Covid Canary Islands added to UK quarantine travel list Speaking at a Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the government was ""particularly concerned"" about coronavirus cases in parts of London, Kent and Essex, which were rising and were often ""already high"". He said the government must not wait until the next review of the tiered restrictions on 16 December but must ""take targeted action immediately"". Mr Hancock said ""in particular"" there was a ""very specific rise"" among the secondary school age group and specifically in north-east London, while the rate among adults in London was ""broadly flat"". He said: ""We know from experience that a sharp rise in case in younger people can lead to a rise among more vulnerable age groups later."" East London and the parts of Kent and Essex that border it have become one of the major Covid hotspots in England. Rates have been rising in recent weeks with some areas seeing well over 300 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. To put that in perspective, it's close to double the rate seen in Manchester which is currently in tier three. The data shows cases are being driven by young people but the concern is that that will then lead to high rates among older age groups who are susceptible to serious illness. The government's hope is by flooding the areas with testing they will be able to break the chains of transmission. But that will be too late in terms of the difficult call that has to be made by Wednesday when the government decides whether areas move up or down in the system of tiers. Ministers have wanted to treat London as a whole, but with some of the southern boroughs seeing below average rates there is a growing argument the capital should be split when it comes to restrictions. The mass testing plan will apply in the seven worst-affected boroughs of London, plus parts of Essex that border London and parts of Kent. Mr Hancock said it was ""right"" to keep schools open ""for education and for public health"". ""We are therefore surging mobile testing units and will be working with schools and local authorities to encourage these children and their families to get tested over the coming days,"" he said. Mr Hancock said both PCR (a standard coronavirus test) and lateral flow testing - which takes about half an hour to show a result - would be used. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters London and Essex are currently in tier two - the second highest level - meaning there is no household mixing allowed anywhere indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Kent is in tier three, the highest level, in which you can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces such as parks, where the rule of six applies. Four London boroughs were among the 20 places with the highest case rates in England in the week ending 6 December, according to Public Health England. They are Havering (400.7 cases per 100,000 people), Barking and Dagenham (333.5), Waltham Forest (327.1) and Redbridge (310.3). Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia's school of medicine, told the BBC it ""does sadly look like"" the capital would be moved into tier three. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said on Thursday that London was facing ""a tipping point"" - but that placing it under tier three restrictions would be ""catastrophic"". However, Mr Hancock said he ""didn't want to pre-empt"" any decision that might be made about moving London and parts of the South East into tier three. He said it was ""not inevitable"" that the capital would have to face tighter rules. Mr Hancock also told the briefing it was important not to ""blow"" the progress made so far in controlling coronavirus and urged everyone to ""stay on our guard now and through Christmas"". He said tens of thousands of people had been vaccinated with the Pfzier/BioNTech jab in 73 UK hospital hubs. GP-led sites will begin vaccinations next week, Mr Hancock said, with jabs administered in some care homes by Christmas. Asked whether people would be able to spend New Year's Eve with their close family members, he said there would be no special set of rules for the occasion. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said a third wave was ""not inevitable"" but warned people must be ""very, very sensible"" over Christmas. ""The way we prevent it [a third wave] is everybody, all of us, coming together and deciding we want to try and stick to the guidance that's there,"" he said. Last week, Scotland's education secretary saidthere would be no extension to the nation's school Christmas holidays, despite talks about potentially shutting all schools on 18 December and reopening them again on 11 January. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's education minister has repeatedly said there wereno plans to close schools earlyfor the Christmas break. The latest coronavirus daily figures show 20,964 new coronavirus infections have been recorded across the UK, and another 516 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 63,082.

"This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered The US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. The agency said the authorisation was a ""significant milestone"" in the pandemic, which taken more than 295,000 lives in the US. The vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, was deemed safe and effective by the FDA. President Donald Trump said the first vaccinations will take place ""in less than 24 hours"". ""Today our nation has achieved a medical miracle,"" Mr Trump said. ""We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months."" Before the announcement on Friday night, the FDA had come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to approve the vaccine's use. The head of the agency, Stephen Hahn, was told to approve it for emergency use by Friday or quit, US media reported, although he called this ""untrue"". In further comments at a news conference on Saturday, Mr Hahn said he was ready to be vaccinated as soon as the vaccine was available and stressed that the agency had not compromised safety in its testing. The issue of allergies was also addressed after testing in the UK produced a small number of allergic reactions. Dr Peter Marks, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said the few reactions in the UK ""were not seen in the larger trial data sets, but we still need to know more and we'll be taking precautions"". He added that the FDA was ""comfortable giving the vaccine to patients who have had other allergic reactions other than severe allergic reactions to a vaccine or one of its components"". His advice was that those with a history of allergies should consult a doctor. Covid: When can I get vaccinated in the US? Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, told reporters earlier on Friday that his department would work with Pfizer to get the mass vaccination programme started by Monday or Tuesday. The Pfizer vaccine has already received regulatory approval in the UK, Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Like those countries, the US will give its first doses of the vaccine to the elderly, health workers and emergency crew. Coronavirus deaths have been rising sharply since November in the US. On Wednesday, the country recorded more than 3,000 deaths - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world. ""The FDA's authorisation for emergency use of the first Covid-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,"" said Mr Hahn. He said the authorisation came after ""an open and transparent review process"" that ensured the vaccine met the ""FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality"". The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the coming days On Thursday, medical experts advising the FDA recommended the emergency-use authorisation. A 23-member panel concluded the vaccine's benefits outweighed its risks. Emergency use, the FDA said, is not the same as full approval, which would require Pfizer to file a separate application to secure. ""While not an FDA approval, today's emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,"" said Dr Marks. On Friday, President Trump sent out an angry tweet calling the FDA a ""big, old, slow turtle"", adding: ""Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr Hahn. Stop playing games and start saving lives."" The Washington Post said that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows had ordered Mr Hahn to approve the vaccine on Friday or submit his resignation, citing three sources. US media reported that FDA Commissioner Hahn had been ordered to approve the vaccine's use by Friday But Mr Hahn told US media he had only been ""encouraged to continue working expeditiously"" on the vaccine's approval, and that the media representation of the chief of staff's phone call was ""untrue"". Amid the reports of White House pressure, President-elect Joe Biden said he wanted to make it clear to the public that they should have confidence in the vaccine, adding: ""There is no political influence."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus jab to show promising results in the latter stages of its testing process. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. ""The vaccine contains a small piece of the [Covid-19] virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive 'spike' protein,"" the FDA said. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? ""When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against [Covid-19]."" The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Operation Warp Speed says that vaccine deliveries will begin within 24 hours of approval. ""We have made sure that this vaccine will be free, for all Americans,"" Mr Trump said in a recorded video posted to Twitter. ""We have already begun shipping the vaccine to every state and zip code in the country. The first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours."" Allow Twitter content?

Pfizer plans to have 6.4 million doses ready for the US in its first rollout round in late December. Because two injections are required per person, that is enough for three million people, out of a total US population of 330 million. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the nation's 21 million healthcare workers should be prioritised first, as well the three million elderly Americans living in long-term care homes. But there is less consensus on how states should distribute it to other groups. The nation's approximately 87 million essential workers are expected to be next in line for the jab, but it will be up to states to decide which industries to prioritise. Mr Trump said vaccines ""will vanquish the virus and return life back to normal"". But officials say vaccinations for groups that are not at a high risk are expected to take place in the spring of 2021. A second vaccine, developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, is also seeking emergency approval in the US. Like the Pfizer vaccine it requires a second round of injections.

"Travellers returning to the UK from Spain's Canary Islands from Saturday morning must self-isolate for two weeks, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps said this was because of rising infection rates on the islands. The Canary Islands are popular with winter holidaymakers, being one of the few parts of Europe warm enough for beach holidays. Travellers to mainland Spain already have to isolate.

The restrictions will be in place from 04:00 GMT on Saturday 12 December. Industry body Airlines UK has previously said the islands were ""hugely important"" for winter travel and represent ""over 50% of bookings for some tour operators"". Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Botswana have been added to the UK's safe travel corridor list, meaning travellers will not need to self isolate if arriving from these places after 04:00 on Saturday. The Department for Transport said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in the number of positive coronavirus tests in the Canary Islands, which had been added to the government's safe travel list in October. More than 800 people are waiting to find out if their Tui holidays to Tenerife tomorrow morning will be cancelled, because the Foreign Office has not yet decided whether to also advise against travel to the islands. Between 06:00 and 11:00 on Friday morning, six flights from various English airports are due to fly out to Tenerife with package holidaymakers. If the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advises against travel to the Canary Islands, Tui will cancel all holidays immediately as this change invalidates travel insurance. It also expects to cancel its entire Christmas holiday schedule. That would be a blow for the operator which announced losses of â¬3bn (Â£2.74bn) on Thursday. At the moment, Tui has received no guidance on how to proceed. Why won't some business travellers have to quarantine? Travellers can cut quarantine if they pay for test For UK airlines and tour operators, the winter gloom has just deepened. The Canary Islands are a vital market for winter travel, a magnet for holidaymakers trying to escape the chill back home. With the industry in the throes of an unprecedented crisis that trade is badly needed. So the removal of the canaries from the list of safe travel corridors so soon before the Christmas holidays will come as a bitter blow. Returning passengers will now have to self-isolate. New rules that come into force next week will allow them to reduce the isolation period if they take a negative test after five days - but the test will have to be done privately, and will come at a cost. The quarantine change comes ahead of the government's new ""Test and Release"" programme next week, which will allow travellers arriving into England to reduce their quarantine by more than half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. England has also introduced a quarantine exemption for certain categories of travellers, including people making high-value business trips, sports stars and performing arts professionals. The Canary Islands and the Maldives were added to the government's safe travel list in October. The reversal of this decision will come as a blow to UK travel businesses, who have pinned hope on a revival in holidays and revenue for Christmas and winter holidays to the Canaries. A number of operators saw a large uplift in bookings to places such as Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria when the Canaries were reopened for safe travel. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said: ""It's utterly devastating news for the thousands of British travellers who booked to go to the Canaries for Christmas and New Year. ""It's also a body blow for travel firms who'd seen an uplift in bookings for the winter after the Canaries were added to the travel corridor list. ""It now means thousands of refunds and lost bookings for a sector that needed the Canaries to help them recover."" Airline Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said that the news would be ""disappointing for many customers booked to travel to the Canary Islands from the UK in the coming weeks."" Customers wishing to transfer their flights without a fee must do so within a week, he said.

"The infection rates are not falling as fast as the government had hoped France will delay the reopening of cultural venues and introduce a night-time curfew as it struggles to curb the spread of Covid-19. Prime Minister Jean Castex said the infection rates were not falling as fast as the government had hoped after a lockdown was imposed in late October. A stay-at-home order will be lifted as planned on 15 December, when the daily 20:00-06:00 curfew will begin. The measure will not be waived on New Year's Eve, to prevent big gatherings. The government had conditioned the easing of restrictions on the number of new cases falling to around 5,000 a day. But that number remains well above 10,000 - on Thursday, there were 13,750 infections. ""We aren't yet at the end of this second wave, and we won't reach the objectives we had set for 15 December,"" Mr Castex told a news conference. ""We can't let down our guard. We have to stay focused, and find our way through the next few weeks with lots of vigilance."" Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Unlikely friendships forged through Covid Museums, cinemas and theatres as well as sports venues, which were expected to reopen on Tuesday, will remain closed for an extra three weeks. The decision was criticised by some in the cultural world, with actor and director Phillipe Lellouche telling BFM TV: ""We're tired of not being given more consideration. Once more culture is being left on the side of the road."" This video can not be played Europe's streets empty Mr Castex has also announced that: People will again be allowed to travel across the country The curfew will start an hour earlier than previously planned and will be waived for Christmas Eve Families are allowed to celebrate Christmas but with no more than six adults together The night-time curfew will not be lifted on 31 December as initially announced because the date has ""all the ingredients for a rebound"" of the virus Bars and restaurants will remain closed at least until 20 January. Some non-essential shops had already reopened on 28 November. France has confirmed more than 2.3 million cases and nearly 57,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic.

"The new options could see outpatient clinics close and non-urgent cancer treatment cancelled 'Difficult choices' will have to be made by the NHS this winter, the health minister has admitted. Vaughan Gething said Covid is spreading at an ""alarming rate"" as latest figures show arecord number of patientsin Welsh hospitals with Covid-19. In a written statement, the minister set out a range of options which local health boards could implement if the pressures continue to rise. These include postponing outpatient and non-urgent cancer treatments. Other options include closing community dental services and postponing other planned treatments. Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet Record high Covid rates in Welsh council areas By issuing a written statement, the health minister has given permission for health boards to take these actions if there is a risk of becoming overwhelmed in the coming weeks - and so that staff can be redeployed to prioritise emergency care. In March, the Welsh Governmentsuspended almost all non-emergency carein anticipation of the first Covid wave. During the second wave, the NHS has been trying to keep as many of those services going in so far as possible. However some non-urgent treatments may soon be put on hold. Vaughan Gething said: ""We are collectively growing increasingly concerned about the potential risk of harm to patients who require access to essential healthcare services. ""The framework of actions for local consideration by NHS organisations is intended to mitigate the potential risk of harm in the system. ""These actions will ease the pressures on the NHS by allowing for services and beds to be reallocated and for staff to be redeployed to priority areas. ""As well as taking individual actions set within a local context, I also expect NHS organizations to work together to ensure the resilience of the emergency response beyond their own boundaries."" The Welsh Ambulance Service is asking for the public to ""play their part"" and only call 999 or attend A&E if they are seriously sick or injured. Chief Executive Jason Killens said: ""Winter is our busiest period, and this year we also have a global pandemic to contend with, and now rising rates of infection in our communities. ""We need to manage people's expectations about what service they'll get if they call for an ambulance."" Trade unions said staff are 'exhausted' In a joint statement unions representing, doctors, nurses and other front-line health care staff said they have significant concerns about the impact the five-day relaxation ofrules over the Christmas periodwill have on infection rates and the NHS's ability to cope. They said staff are 'beyond exhausted' and a potential third wave of the virus could prove too much for staff. The Joint Health Trade Unions said: ""If pressure on the service continues to increase, we must be realistic about what it will mean for patients in hospitals where every bed is full - making treatment difficult and waiting lists longer. Nurses at hotspot hospital 'emotionally attacked' Dozens of health staff abused 'for wearing PPE' ""We are not seeking to change the decision that has been made about Christmas, but we have a responsibility to help minimise any impact on the health service and its staff and patients. ""Staff are truly exhausted, mentally and physically, and they are extremely concerned about what January will bring. ""All we ask, as we have done throughout the pandemic, is that when you make your choices about Christmas, you take the risk seriously and minimise contact as much as possible. Covid-19 has not gone away."" However the Wales Cancer Alliance said cancelling of non-urgent cancer treatment was worrying time for patients. Tenovus Cancer Care charity has urged the Welsh Government to explore ""all options"" to avoid delays to diagnostic and treatment. Judi Rhys, chief executive, said: ""We risk swapping COVID-19 deaths avoided today for unnecessary cancer deaths in a few years' time.""

"This video can not be played Jacqueline Mason visiting her mother Eileen McGrugan in the care home A bus driver has said his detour to let a passenger visit her mother in a care home was ""just the right thing to do"". Jacqueline Mason had accidentally got on the wrong bus on her way to the home and could have missed her visiting slot. Driver Alec Bailey said it ""hit his heart"" when Jacqueline broke down in tears at that prospect. He told his other passengers he would take a detour to get her as close to the home as possible. ""When the woman said to me she hadn't seen her mum in a long time, it just hit my heart,"" he said. ""A lot of people have suffered this year and you've seen on the news, people not able to see their mother or their father in the homes and it just struck a chord with me. ""I just said to myself, I have to get this woman as close as I can to that home."" Alec Bailey said Jacqueline's plight struck a chord with him Jacqueline, was due to visit her 79-year-old mother in Bradley Manor nursing home in north Belfast on Wednesday. Due to coronavirus restrictions, she only had a 30-minute slot to visit her mum. When she arrived, media crews were there to interview residents and staff as they received the Covid-19 vaccine. Jacqueline told Sky's Ireland correspondent about the driver's kind gesture and how she wanted to thank him. But all she knew was that his first name was Alec and that he drove a Translink Metro bus along the 11B route. ""I don't know this side of town at all,"" she explained. ""He asked people on the bus did they mind if he took a short detour and he took me to the roundabout just at the top here and then I was able to get here on time to see Mummy."" Speaking to BBC News NI on Thursday, Jacqueline said: ""I can't get over the other passengers as well, but especially Alec. ""He's made my Christmas and he's made my year, I can't thank him enough."" Jacqueline promised Alec a hug when it is safe Alec said he had not told anyone about the incident and spent the day worrying about whether the woman had got to see her mum. It was only later when his daughter showed him the clip of Jacqueline that he was able to see the impact his kind gesture had had. ""My daughter sent me the clip and I looked at it and when I viewed it, I saw how happy the woman was to see her mum. ""The smile and the joy on her face just said it all and I was just so pleased. ""It was just a nice, magical moment. It was just the right thing to do."" Jacqueline's mother Eileen McGrugan was among the residents who were vaccinated at Bradley Manor nursing home In a statement to BBC News NI, Translink's chief executive Chris Conway said: ""I am proud of Alec Bailey for going above and beyond to help Jacqueline. ""Alec exemplifies the spirit and resilience of the Translink team. ""He is a long-serving member of staff who has been working throughout the pandemic, going out of his way to ensure key and essential workers, education and communities stay connected. ""I'm delighted that we were able to help in this case,"" Mr Conway added. Jacqueline's story was retweeted by Stormont's Transport Minister Nichola Mallon, and also by her department's official Twitter account, which described it as ""a real winter warmer"". Jacqueline's mother, Eileen McGrugan, was among the residents who received their first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday. Mrs McGrugan is a retired care home assistant.

"Rhiannon Davies, pictured with daughter Kate, campaigned for a review into maternity care Mothers were blamed for their babies' deaths and a large number of women died in labour at a scandal-hit maternity unit, a review has found. The inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS (SaTH) trust found deaths were often not investigated and an induction drug was repeatedly misused. Rhiannon Davies said she never doubted what happened with her daughter Kate. Seven ""immediate and essential"" actions have been made for all maternity services across England. The chief executive of SaTH said they ""commit to implementing all of the report's actions"". The review began in 2018 following campaigns led by two families. Richard Stanton and Ms Davies' daughter Kate died hours afterher birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from aGroup B Streptococcus infection. This video can not be played WATCH: The parents of babies Kate and Pippa talk about the pain of losing their child The interim report lists numerous traumatic birth experiences including the deaths of babies due to excessive force of forceps and stillbirths that could have been avoided. Others recount repeated failures by staff to recognise mothers and babies in deteriorating conditions, including one mother whose baby died because staff were ""too busy"" to monitor her during labour. 'She knows it makes Mummy sad' Baby deaths trust 'normalises poor care' Investigation of maternity deaths 'too late' It found letters and records ""which often focused on blaming the mothers"" rather than considering whether the trust's systems were at fault. This was exacerbated by the attitude of staff, the report said. It said: ""One of the most disappointing and deeply worrying themes that has emerged is the reported lack of kindness and compassion from some members of the maternity team. ""The fact that this was found to be lackingâ¦ is unacceptable and deeply concerning."" In Junepolice launched an investigationto examine if there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved. Following the publication of the report, Geoff Wessell, Assistant Chief Constable for West Mercia Police, said their investigation has been running concurrently with the review and remains ongoing. Donna Ockenden, a senior midwife, is leading the review The inquiry - the largest ever of NHS maternity care - is being led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden and is looking into 1,862 cases and initially examined 250 cases. It looked at a selection of cases between 2000 and 2018 and found there were 13 maternal deaths, a rate that is disproportionately high. While the report said the women were often correctly identified as being ""high risk"" due to existing medical conditions, little concrete action appeared to follow with junior doctors conducting assessments and no team working to ensure best care. After each death ""in some cases, no investigation was initiated"" whilst in others ""no learning appears to have been identified."" The report said ""inappropriate language had been used at times causing distress,"" and there were cases ""where women were blamed for their loss and this further compounded their grief."" Ms Davies' daughter Kate was born ""pale and floppy"" at Ludlow Community Hospital and died after delays in transferring her from Ludlow to a doctor-led maternity unit. She has fought for a review for 11 years and said: ""I may sound arrogant but I've never doubted my surety of what happened with Kate. ""I knew I was right. The interim findings will hopefully bring this essential change, critically required change, change this trust has not been able to see it needs to embed and that will hopefully ensure patient safety improves and that is the only reason we've continued."" Pippa Griffiths died at one day old after contracting meningitis from a Group B Strep infection Her husband Richard said: ""I think it's really important that the interim findings go someway to imposing emergency recommendations which are clearly needed at this point to improve maternity care, no family should have to go through what me and Rhiannon and all the others have gone through. ""We just wanted to get to the truth."" The reports lists 27 actions the trust must immediately carry out. Ms Ockenden said: ""Today we are explaining in this first report local actions for learning and immediate and essential actions which we believe will improve maternity care, not only at this trust but across England so that the experiences women and families have described to us are not replicated elsewhere. The work that follows ""owes its origins to Kate Stanton-Davies and her parents"", Ms Ockenden said. She added Kate and Pippa's parents have shown ""an unrelenting commitment in ensuring their daughter's short lives made a difference to the safety of maternity care"". Mrs Griffiths, Pippa's mother said: ""It's not acceptable... you have to pick those failures up, you have to own them and you have to make improvements."" This is not a dry report - its pages scream with the voices of the families who have been needlessly harmed. I've heard many of these stories over the years, having spoken to dozens of families, but to read it in black and white, was still a sobering moment. The review's publication also draws a firm line under the pretence that successive poor, weak leaders of the organisation maintained until recently, namely that the trust was no worse than others. They are worse, much worse, and have been for years. The alphabet soup of NHS organisations that were meant to protect these families - the inspectors, the regulators, the commissioners - have a lot of questions to answer too. Their repeated refusal to see what was happening, despite being told of the problems, is just as shaming as the trust's stance. Their moment of reckoning will come next year, when the final report is published. Conservative MP for Telford Lucy Allan said the findings of the review were ""deeply harrowing"". Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who ordered an inquiry in 2017, tweeted: ""This is a tragic day for families across Shropshire who've had it confirmed in black & white that hundreds of babies died needlessly.""

"Royal Mail has acknowledged delays to its deliveries amid ""exceptionally high volumes"" of post and anti-Covid measures. Despite ""exhaustive planning"", some customers may be experiencing ""slightly longer delivery timescales"" than normal, the postal group said. It came as people complained of late or missed deliveries. Retailers including John Lewis, Boots and HMV have also blamed Royal Mail for delivery delays. On Thursday, online shoppers messaged Royal Mail, as well as contacting retailers directly, to complain about parcels failing to arrive in time - in some cases weeks after they were expected. People also complained their post was arriving less frequently. Others expressed sympathy for postal workers having to meet a surge in demand during the pandemic. Price of first class stamps to rise 9p to 85p Ending Saturday post could save Royal Mail Â£225m Royal Mail parcels overtake letters for first time Mariusz Luczakowski runs a small chocolate company in Worcestershire and uses Royal Mail to send out orders to customers via first class delivery. Over the past few days he says he has received emails from customers complaining of delays - sometimes of seven or more days. ""I am feeling frustration, but at least it's not only me,"" he told the BBC. ""It is a really scary and uncertain time for a small business owner and so easy to destroy the reputation of your own company by not delivering on time as promised."" Business owner Mariusz Luczakowski says he is frustrated with Royal Mail after customers complained about not receiving their deliveries on time Neil Watts, 58, from Edinburgh, told the BBC he ordered a Christmas present online for his wife on 27 November and he still has not received it despite paying for next day special delivery. ""It's the frustration of trying to resolve it,"" Mr Watts said. ""Tomorrow is two weeks before Christmas. Do I cancel the order or wait?"" A postman from Manchester, who did not want to be named, said their delivery office was short-staffed and had lost ""around 20 staff"" over the last two years. ""On top of that we're also receiving a far greater number of both parcels and letters than normal even for the time of year and are being told to prioritise tracked packets over everything else,"" the postman said. ""Everyone I speak to in the office feels awful that people aren't getting their Christmas cards and presents and many of us are working several hours overtime every day to try and prevent things backing up too much."" In a statement, the postal group said there had been a ""greatly increased uptake of online Christmas shopping"", driven ""in no small part"" by the lockdown. This meant all delivery companies were experiencing ""exceptionally high volumes"" of post, it said. The company said it had hired about 33,000 temporary workers to support its 115,000 permanent postmen and women and had expanded its seasonal sites to help manage the anticipated growth in parcel volumes. Coronavirus-related absences had also affected services, the Royal Mail'scustomer service account,externalsaid. ""Despite our best efforts, exhaustive planning and significant investment in extra resource, some customers may experience slightly longer delivery timescales than our usual service standards. ""This is due to the exceptionally high volumes we are seeing, exacerbated by the coronavirus-related measures we have put in place in local mail centres and delivery offices. ""In such cases, we always work hard to get back to providing our usual level of service as quickly as we can."" The company advised customers to visit theservice update page of its website,external.

"This video can not be played Schools moving online at short-notice could be 'confusing' for students All secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales will move classes online from Monday, the education minister has announced. Kirsty Williams said it was part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". However, the Children's Commissioner for Wales has criticised the decision as disruptive to education. A number of counties have also said primary schools will close earlier, including Cardiff and Swansea. Ms Williams said it was important to take a ""clear, national direction"" to ease the pressure from schools, colleges, local councils and parents and carers. ""Every day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms,"" she added. ""The virus is putting our health service under significant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission."" Teaching will move online from Monday in Wales She said the advice from Wales' Chief Medical Officer, Dr Frank Atherton, was to implement the online learning plan ""as soon as is practicable"". ""Having spoken to local education leaders, I am confident that schools and colleges have online learning provision in place,"" added Ms Williams. ""This will also be important in ensuring that students are at home during this time, learning and staying safe. ""Critically, and this is very important, children should be at home. ""This is not an early Christmas holiday, please do everything you can to minimise your contact with others."" Christmas fears sees parents pull children from school Mass testing in schools considered The latest data shows the infection rate across Wales is averaging more than 370 cases for 100,000 people, with 17% of tests now coming back positive. It means the reproduction (R) number in Wales has now reached 1.27, with infections doubling in 11.7 days. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland says she does not support closing schools early But Children's Commissioner Sally Holland said the move was ""not the right decision"" for children and young people in Wales and had yet to see any scientific advice to support the move. ""Whilst accepting the severity of the public health emergency and the responsibilities all of us have to keep each other safe, this decision compounds the disruption to our children's education over the last few months,"" she said. The announcement does not extend to primary or special schools, with the education minister ""encouraging"" them to remain open. However, a number of local authorities have announced they will also be halting face-to-face learning early. Schools in Swansea will all move to online blended learning on Monday, so Friday is the last day in the classroom for primary school pupils. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion parents have been sent emails telling them classrooms will close after Monday. Carmarthenshire council has said primary and special schools will be given the choice to move to online learning or stay open from Tuesday. Cardiff council said the final day in class will be Tuesday. ""The move is designed to enable students to remain at home in the run up to Christmas to try to halt the rise in infection rates,"" said a statement from Cardiff city officials on Thursday evening. The neighbouring Vale of Glamorgan will close primary schools on Wednesday, 16 December. Several local authorities have already announced they would shut schools early Some local authorities had already announced plans to close schools early. Blaenau Gwent shut classrooms on Wednesday, with infection rates in the county now standing at nearly 600 cases for 100,000 people. Record high Covid rates in Welsh council areas Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet In north Wales, Flintshire and Wrexham had decided to shut schools on Friday, with infection rates running at 175 and 230 cases per 100,000. Bridgend, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils had also planned to shut early next Wednesday. The teaching union NAHT hadcalled for schools in Wales to shut this Friday, and be replaced with online classes. But the union said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" the move did not include primary or special schools. ""This decision ignores Welsh Government's own advice on pre-isolating before seeing extended family over the Christmas holidays,"" said Laura Doel from the union. ""Many parents will simply vote with their feet and keep children at home anyway."" The Association of School and College Leaders has supported the Welsh Government's announcement. ""This is obviously a difficult decision but the public health advice is very clear that this needs to happen to tackle Covid infection rates in Wales and reduce transmission of the virus,"" said its director in Wales, Eithne Hughes. ""However, we urge the Welsh Government and local authorities to keep a close eye on the situation in primary schools and take appropriate action if needed."" The decision has also been welcomed by the National Education Union Cymru and Unison. But the move has been criticised by the education leader at one north Wales council. Huw Hilditch-Roberts, of Denbighshire council, said the announcement was a ""blanket approach based on what is happening in the south"". The rate of infection in the county is 101.4 per 100,000. ""Any decision to close schools should be made on the data, and the data in our area doesn't support the decision,"" he told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. ""I feel this could result in a community spike because it will be harder to manage with more children in the community for longer."" Responding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian said on-site provision must be made for all younger learners, and children of key workers ""who can't make alternative arrangements"". She said every secondary school pupilmust also have suitable devices for accessing online lessons, adding: ""Accessing education through Xboxes and mobiles phones is not good enough."" The Welsh Conservatives said the decision was another instance of ""confusing messages"" from the Welsh Government. ""There is no doubt that the situation is grave in parts of Wales, but I would have preferred targeted interventions where needed, not another blanket ban,"" said their education spokeswoman in the Senedd, Suzy Davies.

"Campaigners had sought to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution Death row inmate Brandon Bernard has been executed in Indiana after last-minute clemency pleas were rejected by the US Supreme Court. Bernard, 40, was convicted of murder in 1999 when he was a teenager, and is the youngest offender to be executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Bernard told the family of the couple he killed he was sorry, before dying by lethal injection on Thursday. Four more executions are planned before the end of Donald Trump's presidency. In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US executes federal inmate for 1994 murder If all five take place, Mr Trump will have overseen the most executions by a US president in more than a century. It would bring to 13 the total of federal executions since July. They break with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. Joe Biden becomes president on 20 January. Bernard was pronounced dead at 21:27 local time on Thursday (02:27 GMT Friday) at a penitentiary in the city of Terre Haute. Before that he directed his last words to the victims' family, speaking calmly for more than three minutes. ""I'm sorry. That's the only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day,"" he said, according to the Associated Press. The execution was delayed for more than two hours after Bernard's lawyers asked in vain for the Supreme Court to halt it. He was given the death penalty for his involvement in the murder of Todd and Stacie Bagley in June 1999. He was one of five teenagers accused of robbing the pair and forcing them into the boot of their car in Texas. They were shot as they lay in the boot by 19-year-old accomplice Christopher Vialva before Bernard set the car alight. Defence lawyers say both of the Bagleys probably died before the car was set on fire, and an independent investigator hired by the defence saidStacie had been ""medically dead"" before the fire.,external However, government testimony during the trial said that although Todd Bagley had died instantly, Stacie had had soot in her airway, signalling that she had died from smoke inhalation and not the gunshot wound. Bernard's lawyers say he feared what would happen to him if he refused to follow the orders of Vialva, who was executed in September. Others involved in the incident were given prison sentences as they were under 18 and classed as juveniles. Bernard's lawyers argued that he should be given life in prison without parole, as, throughout his time in jail, he maintained a good record and worked with outreach programmes to stop people from getting involved in crime. The federal prosecutor who defended Bernard's death sentence had called forBernard to see out his sentence in prison,external. In an opinion piece published in the Indianapolis Star, Angela Moore wrote: ""Having learned so much since 2000 about the maturation of the human brain and having seen Brandon grow into a humble, remorseful adult fully capable of living peacefully in prison, how can we say he is among that tiny group of offenders who must be put to death?"" The resumption of federal executions has drawn protests in Terre Haute this year Five of the surviving nine jurors called for Mr Trump tocommute Bernard's death sentence,external. Tens of thousands of other people urged the president to grant Bernard clemency, includingsenators Richard J Durbin and Cory Brooker,external. On Thursday, leading lawyers Allen Dershowitz and Ken Starr also joined his defence team. Reality television star Kim Kardashian West sent numerous tweets about Bernard's case to her followers in the run-up to the execution, urging them to get behind the cause and raise awareness.

Todd Bagley's family said it had been ""very difficult"" to wait 21 years for the sentence imposed ""on those who cruelly participated in the destruction of our children, to be finally completed"". ""The lives of family and friends were shattered and we all have grieved for 21 years waiting for justice to finally be served,"" the statement said. ""Thank you to all who were involved in this process of getting justice for Todd and Stacie."" Stacie and Todd Bagley Stacie Bagley's family said their lives had been changed forever by the murders. They said Stacie still had the chance of survival until the car was set on fire. ""God will forgive us of our sins, but the consequences of our sin will always play out,"" the statement read.

"DeGeneres speaks from her living room during a Fox concert programme in March US chat show host Ellen DeGeneres has announced that she tested positive for Covid-19. ""Fortunately, I'm feeling fine right now,"" she posted online. Her daytime programme - the Ellen DeGeneres Show - will pause production until January, according to a statement from her producers. The show returned in September amid allegations of misconduct by senior staff. Three top producers were fired. DeGeneres, 62, herself apologised on air, pledging ""necessary changes"". On Thursday, DeGeneres wrote that she was following the government's Covid guidelines, and had notified those with whom she had been in close contact. ""I'll see you all again after the holidays,"" she wrote. ""Please stay healthy and safe."" Her last guest, who appeared in-person with her on Wednesday, was Hamilton musical actor Leslie Odom Jr. In October, the programme became one of the first in the US to resume filming in-studio, according to USA Today. Forty audience members - rather than the normal capacity of 300 seats - have been allowed to attend tapings each day. Other December guests to her studio included singers Justin Bieber and Lil Nas X, and actors Bryan Cranston and Diane Keaton. Over the summer, DeGeneres  faced criticism on social media amid reports that she had created a toxic work environment for her staff. Appearing for her 18th season premiere in September, she addressed the allegations of racism, sexism and bullying made by her employees. Ellen DeGeneres returns to screens with apology ""I am so sorry to the people who were affected,"" she said into the camera. ""I know that I'm in a position of privilege and power. I realised that with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show."" In the aftermath, she has continued to apologise to her staff and has increased leave time and health insurance packages for her employees, according to Entertainment Weekly.

"The infection rates are not falling as fast as the government had hoped France will delay the reopening of cultural venues and introduce a night-time curfew as it struggles to curb the spread of Covid-19. Prime Minister Jean Castex said the infection rates were not falling as fast as the government had hoped after a lockdown was imposed in late October. A stay-at-home order will be lifted as planned on 15 December, when the daily 20:00-06:00 curfew will begin. The measure will not be waived on New Year's Eve, to prevent big gatherings. The government had conditioned the easing of restrictions on the number of new cases falling to around 5,000 a day. But that number remains well above 10,000 - on Thursday, there were 13,750 infections. ""We aren't yet at the end of this second wave, and we won't reach the objectives we had set for 15 December,"" Mr Castex told a news conference. ""We can't let down our guard. We have to stay focused, and find our way through the next few weeks with lots of vigilance."" Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Unlikely friendships forged through Covid Museums, cinemas and theatres as well as sports venues, which were expected to reopen on Tuesday, will remain closed for an extra three weeks. The decision was criticised by some in the cultural world, with actor and director Phillipe Lellouche telling BFM TV: ""We're tired of not being given more consideration. Once more culture is being left on the side of the road.""

"An update to England and Wales's NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app is adding a way to apply for a Â£500 grant if it gives a self-isolation order. Until now, those on low incomes were only offered the payment if they had been told to stay at home by human Test and Trace operators. The move comes at a time when thenumber of people testing positive for the coronavirus is on the rise again,external. Experts have suggested following the app's guidance could help reverse that. ""People are not isolating because they can't afford to or because they don't realise that they have to - the whole system is not working,"" Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there is ample evidence that many people who should be isolating don't feel they can for whatever reason, and I think that has to be fixed if this is going to be effectively controlled until we've had adequate rollout of the vaccine."" New figures reveal that the NHS Covid-19 apphas been downloaded 20,361,253 times as of 2 December,external, representing about 40% of eligible adults. That only represents a 0.7% gain since the previous week, suggesting that installations have plateaued. But by offering financial support, more people might be willing to use it. And that in turn would help the system become more effective at identifying those at high risk of being infected by someone they were recently in close proximity to. However, officials say the key aim is to encourage and make it easier for more people to self-isolate. England and Wales have both allowed people on low incomes, who cannot work from home, to apply for financial help if they have received a phone call, email, letter or text message telling them to self-isolate. Previously, that did not cover people who had received the app notification to isolate. This was in part because the app is designed to keep the identity of anyone receiving an alert private. So, the challenge was to find a way to add the facility while still being able to prevent fraudulent claims. The solution involves a new financial support button that only appears on the app's home screen if the user has been told to self-isolate. If tapped, the user is taken out of the app to a webpage that asks them to select if they live in England or Wales. In the case of England, they will then need to fill in an eligibility criteria check. If accepted, they are next asked to supply their email address and phone number to get a security code to register with NHS Test and Trace. The NHS Test and Trace team then provides an account number that the user supplies to their local authority to get the payment. In doing so, the user must reveal their identity and accept a legal obligation to stay at home for the duration of the order. If they then break the self-isolation rulesthey can be fined Â£1,000 or more,external. Wales's NHS Test, Trace, Protect service has a parallel system, which first asks users which of the country's 22 local authorities they live in. Each council has its own claims process, which must then be completed. The system has been set up in such a way that the process only works once, and the external webpage checks it has been accessed in an authorised way via use of a token. All data stored within the app, including locations checked in via QR barcode scans, remains anonymous to the authorities. NHS Covid-19 rides high in Apple's iPhone 2020 apps chart Call to expand Â£500 grant for Covid self-isolators Is the UK's NHS Covid-19 app too private? Northern Ireland's StopCovid NI apprecently deployed a similar solution,external, generating a Self-Isolation Certificate that can be used to apply for a grant from its Department for Communities. But at this point, the NHS Scotland Protect Scotland app lacks a similar facility to let users apply forhelp from the Scottish Welfare Fund,external. ""Currently we are not able to provide direct eligibility from an app-only request to isolate as it maintains the anonymity of the user so we cannot confirm that the applicant is the person who has been contacted,"" said a spokeswoman for the Scottish government. ""We are looking at possible solutions if a user chooses to be identified when asked to isolate. ""In the meantime, local authorities are being flexible and looking further into the individual circumstances of these types of applications on a case by case basis to determine whether the request to isolate can be verified by other means and an award made.""

"Rhiannon Davies, pictured with daughter Kate, campaigned for a review into maternity care Mothers were blamed for their babies' deaths and a large number of women died in labour at a scandal-hit maternity unit, a review has found. The inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS (SaTH) trust found deaths were often not investigated and an induction drug was repeatedly misused. Rhiannon Davies said she never doubted what happened with her daughter Kate. Seven ""immediate and essential"" actions have been made for all maternity services across England. The chief executive of SaTH said they ""commit to implementing all of the report's actions"". The review began in 2018 following campaigns led by two families. Richard Stanton and Ms Davies' daughter Kate died hours afterher birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from aGroup B Streptococcus infection. This video can not be played WATCH: The parents of babies Kate and Pippa talk about the pain of losing their child The interim report lists numerous traumatic birth experiences including the deaths of babies due to excessive force of forceps and stillbirths that could have been avoided. Others recount repeated failures by staff to recognise mothers and babies in deteriorating conditions, including one mother whose baby died because staff were ""too busy"" to monitor her during labour. 'She knows it makes Mummy sad' Baby deaths trust 'normalises poor care' Investigation of maternity deaths 'too late' It found letters and records ""which often focused on blaming the mothers"" rather than considering whether the trust's systems were at fault. This was exacerbated by the attitude of staff, the report said. It said: ""One of the most disappointing and deeply worrying themes that has emerged is the reported lack of kindness and compassion from some members of the maternity team. ""The fact that this was found to be lackingâ¦ is unacceptable and deeply concerning."" In Junepolice launched an investigationto examine if there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved. Following the publication of the report, Geoff Wessell, Assistant Chief Constable for West Mercia Police, said their investigation has been running concurrently with the review and remains ongoing. Donna Ockenden, a senior midwife, is leading the review The inquiry - the largest ever of NHS maternity care - is being led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden and is looking into 1,862 cases and initially examined 250 cases. It looked at a selection of cases between 2000 and 2018 and found there were 13 maternal deaths, a rate that is disproportionately high. While the report said the women were often correctly identified as being ""high risk"" due to existing medical conditions, little concrete action appeared to follow with junior doctors conducting assessments and no team working to ensure best care. After each death ""in some cases, no investigation was initiated"" whilst in others ""no learning appears to have been identified."" The report said ""inappropriate language had been used at times causing distress,"" and there were cases ""where women were blamed for their loss and this further compounded their grief."" Ms Davies' daughter Kate was born ""pale and floppy"" at Ludlow Community Hospital and died after delays in transferring her from Ludlow to a doctor-led maternity unit. She has fought for a review for 11 years and said: ""I may sound arrogant but I've never doubted my surety of what happened with Kate. ""I knew I was right. The interim findings will hopefully bring this essential change, critically required change, change this trust has not been able to see it needs to embed and that will hopefully ensure patient safety improves and that is the only reason we've continued."" Pippa Griffiths died at one day old after contracting meningitis from a Group B Strep infection Her husband Richard said: ""I think it's really important that the interim findings go someway to imposing emergency recommendations which are clearly needed at this point to improve maternity care, no family should have to go through what me and Rhiannon and all the others have gone through. ""We just wanted to get to the truth."" The reports lists 27 actions the trust must immediately carry out. Ms Ockenden said: ""Today we are explaining in this first report local actions for learning and immediate and essential actions which we believe will improve maternity care, not only at this trust but across England so that the experiences women and families have described to us are not replicated elsewhere. The work that follows ""owes its origins to Kate Stanton-Davies and her parents"", Ms Ockenden said. She added Kate and Pippa's parents have shown ""an unrelenting commitment in ensuring their daughter's short lives made a difference to the safety of maternity care"". Mrs Griffiths, Pippa's mother said: ""It's not acceptable... you have to pick those failures up, you have to own them and you have to make improvements."" This is not a dry report - its pages scream with the voices of the families who have been needlessly harmed. I've heard many of these stories over the years, having spoken to dozens of families, but to read it in black and white, was still a sobering moment. The review's publication also draws a firm line under the pretence that successive poor, weak leaders of the organisation maintained until recently, namely that the trust was no worse than others. They are worse, much worse, and have been for years. The alphabet soup of NHS organisations that were meant to protect these families - the inspectors, the regulators, the commissioners - have a lot of questions to answer too. Their repeated refusal to see what was happening, despite being told of the problems, is just as shaming as the trust's stance. Their moment of reckoning will come next year, when the final report is published. Conservative MP for Telford Lucy Allan said the findings of the review were ""deeply harrowing"". Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who ordered an inquiry in 2017, tweeted: ""This is a tragic day for families across Shropshire who've had it confirmed in black & white that hundreds of babies died needlessly.""

""We commit to implementing all of the actions in this report and I can assure the women and families who use our service that if they raise any concerns about their care they will be listened to and action will be taken.""

"This video can not be played Jacqueline Mason visiting her mother Eileen McGrugan in the care home A bus driver has said his detour to let a passenger visit her mother in a care home was ""just the right thing to do"". Jacqueline Mason had accidentally got on the wrong bus on her way to the home and could have missed her visiting slot. Driver Alec Bailey said it ""hit his heart"" when Jacqueline broke down in tears at that prospect. He told his other passengers he would take a detour to get her as close to the home as possible. ""When the woman said to me she hadn't seen her mum in a long time, it just hit my heart,"" he said. ""A lot of people have suffered this year and you've seen on the news, people not able to see their mother or their father in the homes and it just struck a chord with me. ""I just said to myself, I have to get this woman as close as I can to that home."" Alec Bailey said Jacqueline's plight struck a chord with him Jacqueline, was due to visit her 79-year-old mother in Bradley Manor nursing home in north Belfast on Wednesday. Due to coronavirus restrictions, she only had a 30-minute slot to visit her mum. When she arrived, media crews were there to interview residents and staff as they received the Covid-19 vaccine. Jacqueline told Sky's Ireland correspondent about the driver's kind gesture and how she wanted to thank him. But all she knew was that his first name was Alec and that he drove a Translink Metro bus along the 11B route. ""I don't know this side of town at all,"" she explained. ""He asked people on the bus did they mind if he took a short detour and he took me to the roundabout just at the top here and then I was able to get here on time to see Mummy."" Speaking to BBC News NI on Thursday, Jacqueline said: ""I can't get over the other passengers as well, but especially Alec. ""He's made my Christmas and he's made my year, I can't thank him enough."" Jacqueline promised Alec a hug when it is safe Alec said he had not told anyone about the incident and spent the day worrying about whether the woman had got to see her mum. It was only later when his daughter showed him the clip of Jacqueline that he was able to see the impact his kind gesture had had. ""My daughter sent me the clip and I looked at it and when I viewed it, I saw how happy the woman was to see her mum. ""The smile and the joy on her face just said it all and I was just so pleased. ""It was just a nice, magical moment. It was just the right thing to do."" Jacqueline's mother Eileen McGrugan was among the residents who were vaccinated at Bradley Manor nursing home In a statement to BBC News NI, Translink's chief executive Chris Conway said: ""I am proud of Alec Bailey for going above and beyond to help Jacqueline. ""Alec exemplifies the spirit and resilience of the Translink team. ""He is a long-serving member of staff who has been working throughout the pandemic, going out of his way to ensure key and essential workers, education and communities stay connected. ""I'm delighted that we were able to help in this case,"" Mr Conway added. Jacqueline's story was retweeted by Stormont's Transport Minister Nichola Mallon, and also by her department's official Twitter account, which described it as ""a real winter warmer"". Jacqueline's mother, Eileen McGrugan, was among the residents who received their first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday. Mrs McGrugan is a retired care home assistant.

"Tesco and Morrisons will open their shops on Boxing Day despite calls to give staff the day off. Unions say supermarket staff should not have to go in on 26 December as a thank you for their work during the pandemic Asda, Marks & Spencer, Pets at Home, and toy store The Entertainer have all said they will close. But Tesco and Morrisons have joined Sainsbury's in saying they would open on Boxing Day for a limited number of hours. Tesco said it wouldreward frontline staff with an extra 10% bonus,externalover the Christmas and New Year period. Morrisons said that working on the day would be voluntary with staff getting double pay. Sainsbury's will open but has reduced the hours after requests from staff. It said most workers would have Boxing Day off. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas Supermarkets, which have been are classed as ""essential"" retailers during the pandemic, have seen their sales boom this year. As part of a thank you to staff for their work during the pandemic, Asda said that all of its 631 shops would close for two days over the Christmas break. Frontline staff will also get 100% of their bonus entitlement regardless of whether they have reached sales quotas. Covid: Christmas comes early as grocery sales 'hit record' in November Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said in a message to staff it had been a ""challenging year"" and they had ""done an incredible job"". He also said that many staff would have missed out on spending time with their families and friends due to Covid restrictions. ""This is of course our busiest time of year but it was important for us to give as many of you as possible the opportunity to spend this time with those loved ones that you may not have not seen for many months so, uniquely for this year, we will not reopen our stores until 27 December."" The GMB union said it had been ""requesting Asda to allow their key worker heroes family time over the Christmas period, so we are really pleased they have agreed to our calls."" GMB national officer Roger Jenkins, said: ""It's a shame this is not extra holiday - workers will have to book a day of their annual leave entitlement. ""But it's a step in the right direction and GMB now calls on the rest of the retail sector to follow suit and repay these key workers with a chance to spend Boxing Day with their loved ones."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Usdaw, the union which represents shop workers, has also been calling on all retailers to close their doors on Boxing Day. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said at the end of November: ""With the country facing a crisis unlike any in our lifetime, retail and distribution workers have stepped up and kept food on all of our tables. ""When others stay safe at home, they go out to work. ""The only way they will be guaranteed a decent break at Christmas is if food retailers close for Boxing Day,"" he said. However, supermarket giant Sainsbury's, which has a large network of convenience shops as well as larger outlets, said on Wednesday that its supermarkets would remain open, albeit with reduced hours. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""For colleagues that have requested it, we have made sure they are able to take at least two consecutive days off over Christmas."" Tesco said: ""Our stores are open for reduced hours on Boxing Day. Many of our customers rely on their local stores over Boxing Day - from families in search of essentials, to key workers needing access to food."" A Morrisons spokeswoman said it would open its stores for a limited number of hours on Boxing Day but it was ""working hard to ensure all colleagues get a meaningful break during the Christmas period"". It said anyone who worked on Boxing Day would also get time back in lieu. In November, Marks & Spencer said it would reverse its decision to open on Boxing Day so staff could spend more time with their families. Poundland said earlier in the year that it would stay closed on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, while retailers including Wickes, Pets and Home and the Entertainer have also said they will be closed.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns of a ""worrying"" rise in cases in London, Kent and Essex Mass testing will be rolled out for secondary school-aged children in that age group in the worst affected parts of those regions He warns at a Downing Street press conference that ""the fight is not over"" and urges: ""Don't blow it now"" The UK's economic recovery slowed in October - rising 0.4% on the month against a backdrop of rising Covid cases Canada joins the UK in approving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine The United States records more than 3,000 deaths in the latest 24-hour period - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world South Africa, the worst hit country in Africa, enters a second wave of the pandemic as it registers 7,000 new cases on Wednesday Ministers in Northern Ireland are due to meet later before the end of a two-week lockdown on Friday There have been 68.9m cases and 1.56m deaths worldwide, figures from Johns Hopkins University show Edited by Rob Corp We are now closing our live coverage. Today's live coverage was brought to you by: Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Lauren Turner, Jennifer Scott, Sarah Fowler and Rob Corp. Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest in coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. We'll be closing the live page for the day shortly. But before we do, here's a recap of the main headlines. Cabin crews in China are being advised to wear diapers for flights to high-risk coronavirus countries and to avoid using the toilet to reduce the chance of infection. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.76557493
"This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs As President Donald Trump's days in the White House wane, his administration has been racing through a string of federal executions. Five people have been executed in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's 20 January inauguration - breaking with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. They make Mr Trump the country's most prolific execution president in more than a century, overseeing the executions of 13 death row inmates since July of this year. The five executions began with convicted killer 40-year-old Brandon Bernard who was put to death at a penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. They ended with the death of Dustin Higgs, 48, at the same site on 16 January. Bernard apologises to victims' family before execution Attorney General William Barr has said his justice department is simply upholding existing law. But critics have said the move is concerning, coming just weeks before Mr Biden - who has said he will seek to end the death penalty - takes office. Attorney General Barr has ordered five executions during the presidential transition period ""This is really outside the norm, in a pretty extreme way,"" said Ngozi Ndulue, director of research at the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center. US resumption of federal executions criticised How many countries still have the death penalty? US inmate has 'no right to painless death' Here's what you need to know about President Trump's last-minute rush of executions. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1988, executions carried out by the national or federal government in the US have remained rare. Before Mr Trump took office, only three federal executions had taken place in this period. All were carried out under Republican President George W Bush, and included inmate Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. Since 2003, there have been no federal executions at all. Most federal executions take place here, at the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex in Indiana US states have continued to execute inmates in state prisons, putting 22 death row inmates to death last year. But state executions are also on a downward trend. A growing number have moved to abolish capital punishment altogether, and the majority have either formally banned the practice or have not put any inmates to death in more than a decade. Popular opinion, too, has shifted away from capital punishment. A November 2019 Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans supported life in prison over the death penalty for the first time since the survey began more than 30 years ago. ""Public support for the death penalty is at a decades-long low,"" Ms Ndulue said. Further problems have emerged with the methods of execution, sourcing drugs used for lethal injections, and the costs of decades-long court battles and appeals. In July 2019, Mr Barr announced the scheduled executions of five death row prisoners, despite prevailing practices and public opinion. ""Congress has expressly authorised the death penalty,"" the country's top legal official said in a statement at the time. ""The justice department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."" The selected inmates had been convicted of murdering or raping children and the elderly, Mr Barr said. The move drew fierce criticism from top Democrats and human rights groups. ""We feel [the death penalty] is an unconstitutionally arbitrary punishment that should have been abolished decades ago,"" said Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NCAAP Legal Defense Fund. This video can not be played The women who write to death row inmates And the particular selection of inmates fuelled charges that the decision was politically motivated. The first set of executions this summer - during a wave of anti-racism protests and demonstrations - were all of white men. Four of these five prisoners put to death were African American. Ms Ndulue said she didn't think it was ""coincidental"" that no black prisoners were scheduled for execution during a period of ""enhanced awareness of the racial disparities around the federal death penalty"". Research suggests the death penalty has been enforced differently according to race. ""One of the most robust findings of study after study, in jurisdictions across the country, is that the race of your victim is a serious factor in determining whether or not you will have the death penalty,"" Ms Ndulue said. The 10 inmates executed in 2020 have led to a single-year total unmatched in modern history. ""We'd have to go back to 1896 to find another year where there were 10 or more executions,"" Ms Ndulue said. Campaigners are seeking to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution The Trump administration has also chosen to carry out federal executions in the midst of a political transition, with a lame-duck president, for the first time in more than a century. Incumbent presidents have typically deferred to their successors, allowing presidents-elect to set the course. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr Barr defended the post-election executions. ""I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,"" he said. ""But if you ask juries to impose it, then it should be carried out."" But it is a controversial choice, especially as the incoming Biden administration has said it will work to end the death penalty. Bernard's execution had drawn particular attention. Convicted of murder and kidnapping in 1999, Bernard was 18 at the time of his offence, and would be the youngest offender executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Five of the nine surviving jurors in the case, as well as the US attorney who defended the death sentence on appeal, had publicly called for his execution to be stopped. Kim Kardashian also weighed in, making a direct appeal to Mr Trump on Twitter. Mr Trump has been a long-time, vocal advocate of the death penalty. The Biden team is opposed. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, in particular, has been a consistent critic of the practice. She took a stand against capital punishment in her successful 2003 campaign for San Francisco District Attorney and declined to seek the death penalty in the murder of a 29-year-old police officer, killed in the line of duty - despite pressure from within her party. Then-Senator Joe Biden expressed support for the death penalty in the 1990s. The president-elect's record is more uneven. Mr Biden's 1994 crime bill added some 60 federal crimes for which someone could be put to death. Some of those on death row today were convicted under provisions of his legislation. Now, he has promised to push for legislation eliminating federal executions entirely, and to encourage states to do the same. The Biden team has noted that more than 160 individuals sentenced to death in the US since 1973 have later been exonerated. Mr Biden has yet to name his choice for US attorney general. Alfred Bourgeoiswas on death row for torturing and beating his two-year-old daughter to death. He was executed on 11 December. An earlier execution date was stayed by a federal judge due to evidence from Bourgeois' legal team showing he had an intellectual disability. This ruling was overturned in October. Lisa Montgomerystrangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. She was executed on 12 January. Her lawyers said she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and suffers from serious mental illness. She was the first woman to face federal execution in the US since 1953. Cory Johnsonwas convicted for the murder of seven people, related to his involvement with the drug trade in Richmond, Virginia. Johnson's legal team argued that he suffered from an intellectual disability, related to physical and emotional abuse he experienced as a child. He was executed on 14 January. Dustin John Higgswas convicted in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three young women in the Washington, DC area. Higgs did not kill any of his victims. His co-defendant Willis Haynes did, after being instructed to by Higgs. Haynes has said in court documents that Higgs did not threaten him, or force him to shoot. Higgs was executed on 15 January.

"Folklore is the best-reviewed album of Taylor Swift's career Taylor Swift is releasing her second surprise album of 2020 at midnight, she has revealed on Twitter. Evermore is described as a ""sister album"" to the delicate, escapist Folklore, which itself arrived out-of-the-blue in July. Recorded remotely in quarantine, that record topped the US and UK charts and earned Swift nominations for six Grammy awards, including album of the year. Swift said the new 17-track collection featured songs from the same sessions. ""To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing,"" she said. ""To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: To turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""In the past I've always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. ""There was something different with Folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. ""I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them."" Taylor Swift's Folklore sees the singer go indie Taylor Swift's Folklore is a record-breaker Swift shares first clip of re-recorded Love Story As with Folklore, the new album will contain collaborations with indie artists Bon Iver and Aaron Dessner, as well as female rock trio Haim - who are one of Swift's competitors in the Grammys' album of the year category.

"Tesco and Morrisons will open their shops on Boxing Day despite calls to give staff the day off. Unions say supermarket staff should not have to go in on 26 December as a thank you for their work during the pandemic Asda, Marks & Spencer, Pets at Home, and toy store The Entertainer have all said they will close. But Tesco and Morrisons have joined Sainsbury's in saying they would open on Boxing Day for a limited number of hours. Tesco said it wouldreward frontline staff with an extra 10% bonus,externalover the Christmas and New Year period. Morrisons said that working on the day would be voluntary with staff getting double pay. Sainsbury's will open but has reduced the hours after requests from staff. It said most workers would have Boxing Day off. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas Supermarkets, which have been are classed as ""essential"" retailers during the pandemic, have seen their sales boom this year. As part of a thank you to staff for their work during the pandemic, Asda said that all of its 631 shops would close for two days over the Christmas break. Frontline staff will also get 100% of their bonus entitlement regardless of whether they have reached sales quotas. Covid: Christmas comes early as grocery sales 'hit record' in November Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said in a message to staff it had been a ""challenging year"" and they had ""done an incredible job"". He also said that many staff would have missed out on spending time with their families and friends due to Covid restrictions. ""This is of course our busiest time of year but it was important for us to give as many of you as possible the opportunity to spend this time with those loved ones that you may not have not seen for many months so, uniquely for this year, we will not reopen our stores until 27 December."" The GMB union said it had been ""requesting Asda to allow their key worker heroes family time over the Christmas period, so we are really pleased they have agreed to our calls."" GMB national officer Roger Jenkins, said: ""It's a shame this is not extra holiday - workers will have to book a day of their annual leave entitlement. ""But it's a step in the right direction and GMB now calls on the rest of the retail sector to follow suit and repay these key workers with a chance to spend Boxing Day with their loved ones."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Usdaw, the union which represents shop workers, has also been calling on all retailers to close their doors on Boxing Day. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said at the end of November: ""With the country facing a crisis unlike any in our lifetime, retail and distribution workers have stepped up and kept food on all of our tables. ""When others stay safe at home, they go out to work. ""The only way they will be guaranteed a decent break at Christmas is if food retailers close for Boxing Day,"" he said. However, supermarket giant Sainsbury's, which has a large network of convenience shops as well as larger outlets, said on Wednesday that its supermarkets would remain open, albeit with reduced hours. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""For colleagues that have requested it, we have made sure they are able to take at least two consecutive days off over Christmas."" Tesco said: ""Our stores are open for reduced hours on Boxing Day. Many of our customers rely on their local stores over Boxing Day - from families in search of essentials, to key workers needing access to food."" A Morrisons spokeswoman said it would open its stores for a limited number of hours on Boxing Day but it was ""working hard to ensure all colleagues get a meaningful break during the Christmas period"". It said anyone who worked on Boxing Day would also get time back in lieu. In November, Marks & Spencer said it would reverse its decision to open on Boxing Day so staff could spend more time with their families. Poundland said earlier in the year that it would stay closed on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, while retailers including Wickes, Pets and Home and the Entertainer have also said they will be closed.

"Easing restrictions in Edinburgh would have posed a ""significant risk"" of the virus running out of control again, the first minister has insisted. Council leaders say they were told the capital was likely to move from level three to level two this week. But Nicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday that it would instead be remaining in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the data suggested it would not be safe or sensible to ease the restrictions. The first minister was speaking as she faced questions in the Scottish Parliament over the controversial decision, which has sparked anger from many politicians and businesses in Edinburgh. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the city council had been told by officials from Public Health Scotland and the National Incident Management Team that Edinburgh should be downgraded to level two. Council 'fury' over Edinburgh's level 3 status What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? He said Edinburgh was ""well within"" the level two thresholds, adding: ""If you look at the five indicators that were published on Tuesday, one stayed at moderate, three remained at low and one was moved from law to very low. ""So why was Edinburgh treated in this way?"" Mr Leonard said the issue was also about public trust in the decision-making process, adding: ""The government too often appears to assume that people will act in an irresponsible way, and that assumption is bringing businesses in Edinburgh and across the country to breaking point. ""The five-tier system was supposed to give people and businesses certainty and clarity but we are seeing a return to arbitrary and ad hoc decision making."" Ms Sturgeon said the number of cases per 100,000 in the city had gone up by 14% over the past week, and test positivity by 0.5%. And she said test positivity had increased in five of the past seven days, and case levels in four of the past seven. The first minister said there was no reason for her to keep Edinburgh in level three unless it was absolutely necessary The first minister added: ""If you have a situation where you have in any area case numbers rising slightly, or not declining significantly enough, then there is a real risk in easing restrictions. ""The danger is the situation runs very quickly out of control, and the judgement the Cabinet reached was that to take Edinburgh down a level at this stage would have posed a significant risk to the overall situation - which is why we didn't do it."" Ms Sturgeon said she understood the impact on businesses of remaining in level three, but said people in Edinburgh ""deserve a government that will take decisions to try to keep them safe"". And she asked: ""Why on earth would I want to keep Edinburgh, or any part of the country, in a higher level of protection when I didn't think there was a need to do that?"" Council leader Adam McVey, who also leads the authority's SNP group, said on Wednesday that he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision, which he said would make the ""dire"" situation for local businesses even worse in the lead up to Christmas. He added: ""Our numbers are stable and have now been consistently within the rates of level two for some time. ""I've been strongly pressing for Edinburgh's case to move to a lower level of restrictions when safe to do so. The data suggests that time should have been now."" And Cammy Day, the leader of the council's Labour group, questioned why Edinburgh was being kept in level three when it had lower numbers of cases than some level two areas. Edinburgh's case numbers began to rise fast in the second half of September and peaked at about 160 weekly cases per 100,000 people at the beginning of October. However, by the time the Covid levels system was introduced on 2 November, the rate had declined to about half that and well below the level three threshold rate of 150. It has since gone below the level two threshold, though the figure was rising slightly at the end of last week. The Scottish government also considers the percentage of tests coming back positive when judging what level a local authority should be in, and Edinburgh's ""positivity rate"" has been lower than the Scotland-wide rate since mid-October. According tothe latest Scottish government evidence paper,external, the number of Covid-19 patients is forecast to rise in the coming weeks, but not to go above capacity.

The commission said the application of the proposed measures would, in some cases, depend on the UK reciprocating and accepting certain terms. 'Large gaps' remain after crucial Brexit talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? The prime minister's spokesman said such a statement from the EU had been expected and it was similar to what had been proposed in September 2019, adding that the government had already set out its own plans in the event a trade deal could not be reached. The main obstacles for an agreement continue to be access to fishing waters, rules about subsidising businesses and how any new deal would be policed. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A statement by the European Commission - the EU executive - published on Thursday said there was currently ""significant uncertainty"" about whether a deal would be in place by 1 January. ""Our responsibility is to be prepared for all eventualities, including not having a deal in place,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Some sectors would be disproportionately affected, the commission said, adding that it was proposing four contingency measures ""to mitigate some of the significant disruptions"" if a deal were not in place: To ensure the provision of ""certain air services"" between the UK and EU for six months, provided the UK does the same To allow aviation safety certificates to be used in EU aircraft without disruption to avoid grounding To ensure basic connectivity for road freight and passenger transport for six months, provided the UK does the same To allow the possibility of reciprocal fishing access for UK and EU vessels in each other's waters for one year, or until an agreement is reached The commission also said its offers on road and air transportwould depend on the UK providing ""fair and equal opportunities"",,externaladding: ""A level playing field requires that, even after the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards."" The idea of level playing field measures is to ensure businesses on one side do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. The EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to a number of its rules but the UK argues Brexit means breaking free from them. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains why the level playing field matters in Brexit talks The aviation plans would allow UK-registered carriers to keep flying to and from the EU, the trade body Airlines UK said, but they would not be allowed to fly routes within the EU. Industry group ADS called the proposals ""bare bones arrangements"" that would still leave issues to be resolved, including over aviation safety regulations. Reacting to the EU's contingency plans, Boris Johnson's spokesman said the UK government would look ""very closely at the details"" and that negotiators were ""continuing to work to see if the two sides could bridge the remaining gaps"". The spokesman added that the government ""had been clear throughout it would not agree to anything that did not respect UK sovereignty"". The European Commission has until now resisted calls from EU member states to publish these plans, partly because it did not want to jeopardise further the already perilous trade talks. The thinking was that the UK may view any EU contingency plans as rather palatable and encourage them to pursue a path to no deal. Certainly, the proposal that planes and lorries would keep moving would appear to remove an element of drama from what happens on 1 January. And on fishing - such a totemic issue in the wider talks - the message is that this would protect coastal communities in the face on growing uncertainty. But dig deeper, and the EU olive branch is dependent on the UK accepting key terms, including agreements on the increasingly famous ""level playing field"" - the very subject which is proving so divisive in the seemingly deadlocked trade talks. The UK government says it will be studying the EU's proposals but has reiterated its determination to ""take back control"" - including of its waters. The promise is that Britain would never accept fishing terms that contradicted its new status as ""an independent coastal state"". In the puzzle that is Brexit, it may prove hard to find even a deal on how to cope with no deal. Negotiations on a trade deal are continuing, but Downing Street said following Wednesday's talks between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen that ""very large gaps remain"". UK Foreign SecretaryDominic Raab said it was ""unlikely"" the negotiations would be extended beyond Sunday, while Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt said the UK was ""working tirelessly to get a deal"" but could not accept an agreement at any cost. Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January Ms von der Leyen said the EU was willing to grant the UK access to the single market ""but the conditions have to be fair... for our workers and our companies"", adding: ""This fine balance of fairness has not been achieved so far. We will take a decision on Sunday."" EU leaders will be briefed about the talks at a summit in Brussels later on Thursday, although Brexit is not on the official discussion agenda. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""Our negotiators are still working and we will take a decision on Sunday"" Separately, the European Commission has confirmed reports thata ban on travel to the EU because of Covid-19 levels, currently applying to non-EU countries, could be extended to UK visitorsfrom 1 January. Currently only eight countries with low Covid rates are on the approved list for free travel and there are no plans to add the UK to that list. But EU member states have control over their own border restrictions and could choose to have their own individual travel corridors and allow British visitors in. Meanwhile, France's minister for Europe, ClÃ©ment Beaune, warned that visas might be required for UK citizens who plan to stay in the EU for more than three months. But, he added, the matter was still being negotiated. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit? TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL: What happens if these talks fail?

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns of a ""worrying"" rise in cases in London, Kent and Essex Mass testing will be rolled out for secondary school-aged children in that age group in the worst affected parts of those regions He warns at a Downing Street press conference that ""the fight is not over"" and urges: ""Don't blow it now"" The UK's economic recovery slowed in October - rising 0.4% on the month against a backdrop of rising Covid cases Canada joins the UK in approving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine The United States records more than 3,000 deaths in the latest 24-hour period - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world South Africa, the worst hit country in Africa, enters a second wave of the pandemic as it registers 7,000 new cases on Wednesday Ministers in Northern Ireland are due to meet later before the end of a two-week lockdown on Friday There have been 68.9m cases and 1.56m deaths worldwide, figures from Johns Hopkins University show Edited by Rob Corp We are now closing our live coverage. Today's live coverage was brought to you by: Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Lauren Turner, Jennifer Scott, Sarah Fowler and Rob Corp. Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest in coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. We'll be closing the live page for the day shortly. But before we do, here's a recap of the main headlines. Cabin crews in China are being advised to wear diapers for flights to high-risk coronavirus countries and to avoid using the toilet to reduce the chance of infection. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.38563332
"Mass testing will be rolled out to secondary school children in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent and Essex, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said ""by far"" the fastest rise in coronavirus infection rates in these areas was in 11 to 18-year-olds. This age group in these areas should be tested regardless of symptoms, he said. ""We need to do everything to stop the spread in school-age children now,"" Mr Hancock said, adding that more details will be set out on Friday. It comes after Londonerswere urged to ""stick by the rules""this week amid fears the capital - in tier two - may be put under tier--three restrictions following a rise in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, all secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales willmove classes online from Monday, Welsh education minister Kirsty Williams has announced. Secondary schools 'move online' over Covid Canary Islands added to UK quarantine travel list Speaking at a Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the government was ""particularly concerned"" about coronavirus cases in parts of London, Kent and Essex, which were rising and were often ""already high"". He said the government must not wait until the next review of the tiered restrictions on 16 December but must ""take targeted action immediately"". Mr Hancock said ""in particular"" there was a ""very specific rise"" among the secondary school age group and specifically in north-east London, while the rate among adults in London was ""broadly flat"". He said: ""We know from experience that a sharp rise in case in younger people can lead to a rise among more vulnerable age groups later."" East London and the parts of Kent and Essex that border it have become one of the major Covid hotspots in England. Rates have been rising in recent weeks with some areas seeing well over 300 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. To put that in perspective, it's close to double the rate seen in Manchester which is currently in tier three. The data shows cases are being driven by young people but the concern is that that will then lead to high rates among older age groups who are susceptible to serious illness. The government's hope is by flooding the areas with testing they will be able to break the chains of transmission. But that will be too late in terms of the difficult call that has to be made by Wednesday when the government decides whether areas move up or down in the system of tiers. Ministers have wanted to treat London as a whole, but with some of the southern boroughs seeing below average rates there is a growing argument the capital should be split when it comes to restrictions. The mass testing plan will apply in the seven worst-affected boroughs of London, plus parts of Essex that border London and parts of Kent. Mr Hancock said it was ""right"" to keep schools open ""for education and for public health"". ""We are therefore surging mobile testing units and will be working with schools and local authorities to encourage these children and their families to get tested over the coming days,"" he said. Mr Hancock said both PCR (a standard coronavirus test) and lateral flow testing - which takes about half an hour to show a result - would be used. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Kent is in tier three, the highest level, in which you can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces such as parks, where the rule of six applies. Four London boroughs were among the 20 places with the highest case rates in England in the week ending 6 December, according to Public Health England. They are Havering (400.7 cases per 100,000 people), Barking and Dagenham (333.5), Waltham Forest (327.1) and Redbridge (310.3). Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia's school of medicine, told the BBC it ""does sadly look like"" the capital would be moved into tier three. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said on Thursday that London was facing ""a tipping point"" - but that placing it under tier three restrictions would be ""catastrophic"". However, Mr Hancock said he ""didn't want to pre-empt"" any decision that might be made about moving London and parts of the South East into tier three. He said it was ""not inevitable"" that the capital would have to face tighter rules. Mr Hancock also told the briefing it was important not to ""blow"" the progress made so far in controlling coronavirus and urged everyone to ""stay on our guard now and through Christmas"". He said tens of thousands of people had been vaccinated with the Pfzier/BioNTech jab in 73 UK hospital hubs. GP-led sites will begin vaccinations next week, Mr Hancock said, with jabs administered in some care homes by Christmas. Asked whether people would be able to spend New Year's Eve with their close family members, he said there would be no special set of rules for the occasion. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said a third wave was ""not inevitable"" but warned people must be ""very, very sensible"" over Christmas. ""The way we prevent it [a third wave] is everybody, all of us, coming together and deciding we want to try and stick to the guidance that's there,"" he said. Last week, Scotland's education secretary saidthere would be no extension to the nation's school Christmas holidays, despite talks about potentially shutting all schools on 18 December and reopening them again on 11 January. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's education minister has repeatedly said there wereno plans to close schools earlyfor the Christmas break. The latest coronavirus daily figures show 20,964 new coronavirus infections have been recorded across the UK, and another 516 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 63,082.

"This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""Our negotiators are still working and we will take a decision on Sunday"" UK-EU talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are ""unlikely"" to continue after Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. His comments come after a meeting between Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the Brexit trade deadlock. Mrs von der Leyen said she had a ""good conversation but it is difficult"". The EU has set out the measuresit would take in the event of a no-deal scenario with the UK. The plans aim to ensure that UK and EU air and road connections still run after the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. They also allow the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters for up to a year, or until an agreement is reached. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state."" EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Britons could be barred from EU entry on 1 January Talks between the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier resumed in Brussels on Thursday. The main obstacles continue to be access to fishing waters, rules about subsidising businesses and how any new deal would be policed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. Speaking in the House of Commons, minister Penny Mordaunt insisted that the UK would ""leave no stone unturned"" and will ""carry on negotiating until there is no hope"". Later on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the PM to ""get on and deliver"" a deal, adding the outstanding issues ""are capable of resolution"". Asked whether his party would back a deal in a vote in the Commons, he said: ""We will look at it - and we will act in the national interest."" ""But on a straight choice between no deal and deal, then deal is clearly in the national interest,"" he added. Addressing MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""deeply and increasingly concerned"" about a ""lack of clarity"" on what arrangements will apply after 31 December. Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""We are willing to grant access to the single market to our British friends - the largest single market in the world - but the conditions have to be fair and they have to be fair for our workers and our companies."" ""This fine balance of fairness has not been achieved so far,"" she said, adding that negotiators were still working and that a decision would be taken on Sunday. The Irish PM, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, said that no one understated the challenges that lie ahead. ""But it's important for the citizens of Europe that we do everything we can to get an agreement here,"" he said. Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said he was more ""gloomy"" about the trade talks following Wednesday night's meeting. This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt told MPs the UK ""cannot accept a deal at any cost"" with the EU. Speaking to the BBC earlier, Mr Raab said: ""We are rapidly approaching the point where we need some finality."" And asked if talks would go beyond Sunday, he said it was ""unlikely"" but added ""never quite say never when you are negotiating with the EU"". Responding toa warning from the Tesco chair that food prices could rise were a deal not to be agreed,Mr Raab acknowledged there could be ""some bumps along the road"" but said he was ""not concerned about either supermarket cupboards running bare or food prices"". What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January The EU statement, published on Thursday morning, outlines some of the plans in place if there is no deal, and it says some sectors would be more affected than others. Provision for air travel, allowing aviation safety certificates, connectivity for road freight and passenger transport for six months, and reciprocal fishing access are included in the document. After 31 December, many things will change regardless of whether or not a deal is reached. UK travellerscould be barredfrom entering the EU from 1 January as travel rules associated with being part of the EU expire and Covid restrictions block entry. In the event of a no-deal scenario, prices of goods could go up - that's because the UK and EU are likely to impose import taxes (known as tariffs) on products crossing the border. There could also be delays at the border as, without an agreement on food standards, freight is more likely to be stopped for checks. A Downing Street spokesman said that the government had put ""extensive preparations"" in place for the end of the transition period to secure supply chains. Asked whether families should ensure their fridges were well stocked at the end of December, the spokesman said: ""We have a resilient supply chain, that will continue to be the case after the transition period ends, whether that's with a free-trade agreement or otherwise.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there is a âstrong possibilityâ the UK will not reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Boris Johnson says there is a ""strong possibility"" the UK will fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Speaking for the first timesince a crunch meeting in Brussels, the PM said ""now is the time"" for firms and people to prepare for a no deal outcome. Talks continue between the two sides but Mr Johnson said they were ""not yet there at all"" in securing a deal. Time is running out to reach an agreement before the UK stops following EU trade rules on 31 December. Weeks of intensive talks between officials have failed to overcome obstacles in key areas, including competition rules and fishing rights. Mr Johnson met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday, but the pair failed to make a breakthrough. What is an 'Australia-style deal'? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Mr Johnson pledged British negotiators, who earlier resumed talks with their EU counterparts in Brussels, would ""go the extra mile"" to reach a deal. But he said the EU wanted to keep the UK ""locked"" into its legal system, or face punishments such as taxes on imports, which had ""made things much more difficult"". The PM added that the EU's proposals would mean, despite leaving the bloc earlier this year, the UK would be forced to remain a ""twin"" of the 27-country organisation. ""At the moment, I have to tell you in all candour, the treaty is not there yet and that was the strong view of our cabinet,"" he said. Mr Johnson said that ""looking at where we are,"" it was vital the UK prepares for the ""Australian-style option"" of not having a free trade deal with the EU. ""There's a strong possibility that we will have a solution much more like Australian relationship with the EU than a Canadian relationship with the EU,"" he said. Mr Johnson has insisted the country will ""prosper"" on these terms, but former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm said the UK should be ""careful what you wish for"". Mr Turnbull told BBC's Question Time there were some ""very large barriers to Australian trade with Europe"", adding: ""Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one."" Will there be no deal? Right now it is just too hard to say. But is Boris Johnson only trying to send messages to his opposite numbers? The answer is no. On Wednesday we saw this whole saga move closer to what both sides would consider a failure - an inability to agree on a trade deal that had been in reach and is still in their mutual interest. It may yet come to pass that the prime minster or the EU leadership will have a change of heart. Of course the rhetoric does not tell us everything that's going on. But the PM's warning tonight is far from just a message designed to be heard in EU capitals - whatever the merits of the decision he may take, Downing Street is preparing the ground for a choice to leave the status quo without firm arrangements in place. Australia is negotiating a free trade deal with the EU but currently does not have one. It largely does business with the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but has a few arrangements in place, such as co-operation on science and trade on wine. Moving to WTO rules on 31 December could result in tariffs being imposed leading to higher prices for the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU, among other changes. Canadafinalised a deal with the EU in 2017. Mr Johnson said he ""tried very hard to make progress"" at his dinner with Mrs von der Leyen, but the EU was making things ""unnecessarily difficult"". Meanwhile, the EU hasset out the contingency measuresit would take in the event of no trade agreement being reached with the UK. The plans aim to ensure that UK and EU air and road connections still run after the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. They also allow the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters for up to a year, or until an agreement is reached. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months.

If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. EU leaders are meeting in the Belgian capital for a two day-summit of their own, although Brexit will not be the main focus. A spokesman said they discussed the situation on Friday morning, but only for 10 minutes. Arriving at the summit, Mrs von der Leyen said the conditions for a trade deal would have to be ""fair for our workers and our companies."" ""This fine balance of fairness has not been achieved so far,"" she said, adding that a decision would be taken on Sunday. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said the EU leaders had been preoccupied with disputes about their own budget, a maritime row with Turkey in the Mediterranean and coronavirus as they talked into the early hours of Friday morning. ""Brexit has not been the only priority here - perhaps not even the main one,"" he said.

"Travellers returning to the UK from Spain's Canary Islands from Saturday morning must self-isolate for two weeks, the transport secretary has said. Grant Shapps said this was because of rising infection rates on the islands. The Canary Islands are popular with winter holidaymakers, being one of the few parts of Europe warm enough for beach holidays. Travellers to mainland Spain already have to isolate.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The restrictions will be in place from 04:00 GMT on Saturday 12 December. Industry body Airlines UK has previously said the islands were ""hugely important"" for winter travel and represent ""over 50% of bookings for some tour operators"". Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Botswana have been added to the UK's safe travel corridor list, meaning travellers will not need to self isolate if arriving from these places after 04:00 on Saturday. The Department for Transport said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in the number of positive coronavirus tests in the Canary Islands, which had been added to the government's safe travel list in October. More than 800 people are waiting to find out if their Tui holidays to Tenerife tomorrow morning will be cancelled, because the Foreign Office has not yet decided whether to also advise against travel to the islands. Between 06:00 and 11:00 on Friday morning, six flights from various English airports are due to fly out to Tenerife with package holidaymakers. If the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office advises against travel to the Canary Islands, Tui will cancel all holidays immediately as this change invalidates travel insurance. It also expects to cancel its entire Christmas holiday schedule. That would be a blow for the operator which announced losses of â¬3bn (Â£2.74bn) on Thursday. At the moment, Tui has received no guidance on how to proceed. Why won't some business travellers have to quarantine? Travellers can cut quarantine if they pay for test For UK airlines and tour operators, the winter gloom has just deepened. The Canary Islands are a vital market for winter travel, a magnet for holidaymakers trying to escape the chill back home. With the industry in the throes of an unprecedented crisis that trade is badly needed. So the removal of the canaries from the list of safe travel corridors so soon before the Christmas holidays will come as a bitter blow. Returning passengers will now have to self-isolate. New rules that come into force next week will allow them to reduce the isolation period if they take a negative test after five days - but the test will have to be done privately, and will come at a cost. The quarantine change comes ahead of the government's new ""Test and Release"" programme next week, which will allow travellers arriving into England to reduce their quarantine by more than half if they pay for a Covid test after five days. The rules will come into force from 15 December and the tests from private firms will cost between Â£65 and Â£120. England has also introduced a quarantine exemption for certain categories of travellers, including people making high-value business trips, sports stars and performing arts professionals. The Canary Islands and the Maldives were added to the government's safe travel list in October. The reversal of this decision will come as a blow to UK travel businesses, who have pinned hope on a revival in holidays and revenue for Christmas and winter holidays to the Canaries. A number of operators saw a large uplift in bookings to places such as Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria when the Canaries were reopened for safe travel. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said: ""It's utterly devastating news for the thousands of British travellers who booked to go to the Canaries for Christmas and New Year. ""It's also a body blow for travel firms who'd seen an uplift in bookings for the winter after the Canaries were added to the travel corridor list. ""It now means thousands of refunds and lost bookings for a sector that needed the Canaries to help them recover."" Airline Easyjet chief executive Johan Lundgren said that the news would be ""disappointing for many customers booked to travel to the Canary Islands from the UK in the coming weeks."" Customers wishing to transfer their flights without a fee must do so within a week, he said.

"Joe Anderson, who has been mayor since 2012, was arrested on Friday The mayor of Liverpool has stepped aside following his arrest on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. Joe Anderson said he was ""stepping away from decision-making"" and would take unpaid leave while the investigation continued. He said his arrest on Friday was a ""painful shock"" and he believed ""time would make it clear that I have no case to answer"". He wasreleased on conditional bail. Mr Anderson and four others,including Derek Hatton, the former deputy leader of the council, were held as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts in the city. The year-long police inquiry, Operation Aloft, focussed on a number of property developers. Liverpool City Council's chief executive Tony Reeves met Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick on Monday and the government laterrequested the authority reveal its planned commercial property deals. In a statement, Mr Anderson said: ""I have always done what I believe is best for the city, and I am taking the following action with those best intentions in mind."" He said it was ""important"" that everyone in Liverpool knew leaders were ""focussed on what is most important to the people, their livelihoods and, with a pandemic still in force, their lives"". Liverpool City Council was asked to reveal all its proposed property deals to the government Mr Anderson added: ""For this reason, I believe it is important that the city, and government, are reassured that our city is indeed operating in the correct way. ""I am, therefore, stepping away from decision-making within the council through a period of unpaid leave, until the police make clear their intentions with the investigation on the 31 December."" Deputy mayor Wendy Simon will now become interim mayor. The council's Liberal Democrat opposition leader Richard Kemp said Mr Anderson had made ""almost the right decision"" to step away from the city's affairs. He added: ""His resignation would have been an even cleaner break"". Mr Kemp alsotweeted,external: ""Relationships with the government and the private sector would be very difficult whilst the city's political leader is under a cloud."" He said the situation had shown up the ""worst of the mayoral system"" and his party would submit a motion to end that system and return to a modern committee system ""in which there are checks and balances"". Derek Hatton, the former deputy leader of the council, was also arrested on Friday Local Green Party leader Tom Crone said he welcomed Mr Anderson's decision. Hetweeted:,external""Stand-in mayor Wendy Simon must act swiftly to restore trust in local democracy. Share power across a cabinet of all the parties to see us out of this health, financial and political crisis."" Ms Simon said her ""number one"" priority was ""steering this great city and its people through the pandemic and preparing for the recovery"". She said while she was acting mayor she wanted to ""create a city that has equal opportunities for all"" and ""establish a platform of confidence"" to reassure investors. Father-of-four Mr Anderson was elected in 2012, having been a Labour councillor since 1998. He said he was ""very grateful"" for messages of support and had ""faith"" that Liverpool's future was ""bright"" and the city's ""best days"" lay ahead.

"Mass testing will be rolled out to secondary school children in the worst-affected areas of London, Kent and Essex, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said ""by far"" the fastest rise in coronavirus infection rates in these areas was in 11 to 18-year-olds. This age group in these areas should be tested regardless of symptoms, he said. ""We need to do everything to stop the spread in school-age children now,"" Mr Hancock said, adding that more details will be set out on Friday. It comes after Londonerswere urged to ""stick by the rules""this week amid fears the capital - in tier two - may be put under tier--three restrictions following a rise in Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, all secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales willmove classes online from Monday, Welsh education minister Kirsty Williams has announced. Secondary schools 'move online' over Covid Canary Islands added to UK quarantine travel list Speaking at a Downing Street press briefing, Mr Hancock said the government was ""particularly concerned"" about coronavirus cases in parts of London, Kent and Essex, which were rising and were often ""already high"". He said the government must not wait until the next review of the tiered restrictions on 16 December but must ""take targeted action immediately"". Mr Hancock said ""in particular"" there was a ""very specific rise"" among the secondary school age group and specifically in north-east London, while the rate among adults in London was ""broadly flat"". He said: ""We know from experience that a sharp rise in case in younger people can lead to a rise among more vulnerable age groups later."" East London and the parts of Kent and Essex that border it have become one of the major Covid hotspots in England. Rates have been rising in recent weeks with some areas seeing well over 300 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. To put that in perspective, it's close to double the rate seen in Manchester which is currently in tier three. The data shows cases are being driven by young people but the concern is that that will then lead to high rates among older age groups who are susceptible to serious illness. The government's hope is by flooding the areas with testing they will be able to break the chains of transmission. But that will be too late in terms of the difficult call that has to be made by Wednesday when the government decides whether areas move up or down in the system of tiers. Ministers have wanted to treat London as a whole, but with some of the southern boroughs seeing below average rates there is a growing argument the capital should be split when it comes to restrictions. The mass testing plan will apply in the seven worst-affected boroughs of London, plus parts of Essex that border London and parts of Kent. Mr Hancock said it was ""right"" to keep schools open ""for education and for public health"". ""We are therefore surging mobile testing units and will be working with schools and local authorities to encourage these children and their families to get tested over the coming days,"" he said. Mr Hancock said both PCR (a standard coronavirus test) and lateral flow testing - which takes about half an hour to show a result - would be used. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters London and Essex are currently in tier two - the second highest level - meaning there is no household mixing allowed anywhere indoors and the rule of six applies outdoors. Kent is in tier three, the highest level, in which you can only meet other households in outdoor public spaces such as parks, where the rule of six applies. Four London boroughs were among the 20 places with the highest case rates in England in the week ending 6 December, according to Public Health England. They are Havering (400.7 cases per 100,000 people), Barking and Dagenham (333.5), Waltham Forest (327.1) and Redbridge (310.3). Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia's school of medicine, told the BBC it ""does sadly look like"" the capital would be moved into tier three. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said on Thursday that London was facing ""a tipping point"" - but that placing it under tier three restrictions would be ""catastrophic"". However, Mr Hancock said he ""didn't want to pre-empt"" any decision that might be made about moving London and parts of the South East into tier three. He said it was ""not inevitable"" that the capital would have to face tighter rules. Mr Hancock also told the briefing it was important not to ""blow"" the progress made so far in controlling coronavirus and urged everyone to ""stay on our guard now and through Christmas"". He said tens of thousands of people had been vaccinated with the Pfzier/BioNTech jab in 73 UK hospital hubs. GP-led sites will begin vaccinations next week, Mr Hancock said, with jabs administered in some care homes by Christmas. Asked whether people would be able to spend New Year's Eve with their close family members, he said there would be no special set of rules for the occasion. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said a third wave was ""not inevitable"" but warned people must be ""very, very sensible"" over Christmas. ""The way we prevent it [a third wave] is everybody, all of us, coming together and deciding we want to try and stick to the guidance that's there,"" he said. Last week, Scotland's education secretary saidthere would be no extension to the nation's school Christmas holidays, despite talks about potentially shutting all schools on 18 December and reopening them again on 11 January. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's education minister has repeatedly said there wereno plans to close schools earlyfor the Christmas break. The latest coronavirus daily figures show 20,964 new coronavirus infections have been recorded across the UK, and another 516 people have died within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 63,082.

"The number of patients in England waiting over a year for routine hospital care is now 100 times higher than before the pandemic, figures show. Nearly 163,000 out of the 4.4 million on the waiting list at the end of October had waited over 12 months for operations such as hip replacements. There were just 1,600 year-long waiters in February, NHS England data shows. The Royal College of Surgeons warned patients were being left in pain unable to carry on with ""day-to-day life"". ""Yet again, these waiting time figures drive home the devastating impact Covid has had on wider NHS services,"" RCS president Prof Neil Mortensen said. It  was a ""national crisis"" that could take two to three years to tackle, he added. The number of long waits is now at its highest level since 2008. Although there are signs elsewhere in the figures that things may be starting to improve. The number of operations being done is on the increase, while average waits are falling. The data also shows accident-and-emergency attendances dropped during lockdown. There were 1.49 million visits to A&E in November - a quarter down on normal levels, raising concerns people with serious illnesses may not be receiving the help they need. At the peak of the pandemic, attendances dropped to 900,000 a month before climbing during the summer and reaching a peak of 1.72 million. The numbers of urgent cancer checks and patients starting cancer treatment, however, have returned to their normal levels. An NHS England spokesman said: ""Although Covid hospitalisations almost doubled during November, for every Covid inpatient the NHS treated, hospitals managed to treat five other inpatients for other health conditions. ""With cancer referrals and treatments now back above usual levels, our message remains that people should continue to come forward for care when they need it."" There is mounting concern, however, about the current trends for Covid. The number of Covid patients in hospital in England - currently 12,600, accounting for one in seven of all beds available - has shown a slight increase in recent days after several weeks of falls. And the number of cases being diagnosed has also stopped falling. They peaked at just above 25,000 on average in mid-November but have been around the 15,000 mark for the past two weeks. On Thursday, 20,964 more people tested positive for coronavirus and 516 people died in the UK. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"An update to England and Wales's NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app is adding a way to apply for a Â£500 grant if it gives a self-isolation order. Until now, those on low incomes were only offered the payment if they had been told to stay at home by human Test and Trace operators. The move comes at a time when thenumber of people testing positive for the coronavirus is on the rise again,external. Experts have suggested following the app's guidance could help reverse that. ""People are not isolating because they can't afford to or because they don't realise that they have to - the whole system is not working,"" Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there is ample evidence that many people who should be isolating don't feel they can for whatever reason, and I think that has to be fixed if this is going to be effectively controlled until we've had adequate rollout of the vaccine."" New figures reveal that the NHS Covid-19 apphas been downloaded 20,361,253 times as of 2 December,external, representing about 40% of eligible adults. That only represents a 0.7% gain since the previous week, suggesting that installations have plateaued. But by offering financial support, more people might be willing to use it. And that in turn would help the system become more effective at identifying those at high risk of being infected by someone they were recently in close proximity to. However, officials say the key aim is to encourage and make it easier for more people to self-isolate. England and Wales have both allowed people on low incomes, who cannot work from home, to apply for financial help if they have received a phone call, email, letter or text message telling them to self-isolate. Previously, that did not cover people who had received the app notification to isolate. This was in part because the app is designed to keep the identity of anyone receiving an alert private. So, the challenge was to find a way to add the facility while still being able to prevent fraudulent claims. The solution involves a new financial support button that only appears on the app's home screen if the user has been told to self-isolate. If tapped, the user is taken out of the app to a webpage that asks them to select if they live in England or Wales. In the case of England, they will then need to fill in an eligibility criteria check. If accepted, they are next asked to supply their email address and phone number to get a security code to register with NHS Test and Trace. The NHS Test and Trace team then provides an account number that the user supplies to their local authority to get the payment. In doing so, the user must reveal their identity and accept a legal obligation to stay at home for the duration of the order. If they then break the self-isolation rulesthey can be fined Â£1,000 or more,external. Wales's NHS Test, Trace, Protect service has a parallel system, which first asks users which of the country's 22 local authorities they live in. Each council has its own claims process, which must then be completed. The system has been set up in such a way that the process only works once, and the external webpage checks it has been accessed in an authorised way via use of a token. All data stored within the app, including locations checked in via QR barcode scans, remains anonymous to the authorities. NHS Covid-19 rides high in Apple's iPhone 2020 apps chart Call to expand Â£500 grant for Covid self-isolators Is the UK's NHS Covid-19 app too private? Northern Ireland's StopCovid NI apprecently deployed a similar solution,external, generating a Self-Isolation Certificate that can be used to apply for a grant from its Department for Communities. But at this point, the NHS Scotland Protect Scotland app lacks a similar facility to let users apply forhelp from the Scottish Welfare Fund,external. ""Currently we are not able to provide direct eligibility from an app-only request to isolate as it maintains the anonymity of the user so we cannot confirm that the applicant is the person who has been contacted,"" said a spokeswoman for the Scottish government. ""We are looking at possible solutions if a user chooses to be identified when asked to isolate. ""In the meantime, local authorities are being flexible and looking further into the individual circumstances of these types of applications on a case by case basis to determine whether the request to isolate can be verified by other means and an award made.""

"Joe Anderson, who has been mayor since 2012, was arrested on Friday The mayor of Liverpool has stepped aside following his arrest on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. Joe Anderson said he was ""stepping away from decision-making"" and would take unpaid leave while the investigation continued. He said his arrest on Friday was a ""painful shock"" and he believed ""time would make it clear that I have no case to answer"". He wasreleased on conditional bail. Mr Anderson and four others,including Derek Hatton, the former deputy leader of the council, were held as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts in the city. The year-long police inquiry, Operation Aloft, focussed on a number of property developers. Liverpool City Council's chief executive Tony Reeves met Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick on Monday and the government laterrequested the authority reveal its planned commercial property deals. In a statement, Mr Anderson said: ""I have always done what I believe is best for the city, and I am taking the following action with those best intentions in mind."" He said it was ""important"" that everyone in Liverpool knew leaders were ""focussed on what is most important to the people, their livelihoods and, with a pandemic still in force, their lives"". Liverpool City Council was asked to reveal all its proposed property deals to the government Mr Anderson added: ""For this reason, I believe it is important that the city, and government, are reassured that our city is indeed operating in the correct way. ""I am, therefore, stepping away from decision-making within the council through a period of unpaid leave, until the police make clear their intentions with the investigation on the 31 December."" Deputy mayor Wendy Simon will now become interim mayor. The council's Liberal Democrat opposition leader Richard Kemp said Mr Anderson had made ""almost the right decision"" to step away from the city's affairs. He added: ""His resignation would have been an even cleaner break"". Mr Kemp alsotweeted,external: ""Relationships with the government and the private sector would be very difficult whilst the city's political leader is under a cloud."" He said the situation had shown up the ""worst of the mayoral system"" and his party would submit a motion to end that system and return to a modern committee system ""in which there are checks and balances"". Derek Hatton, the former deputy leader of the council, was also arrested on Friday Local Green Party leader Tom Crone said he welcomed Mr Anderson's decision. Hetweeted:,external""Stand-in mayor Wendy Simon must act swiftly to restore trust in local democracy. Share power across a cabinet of all the parties to see us out of this health, financial and political crisis."" Ms Simon said her ""number one"" priority was ""steering this great city and its people through the pandemic and preparing for the recovery"". She said while she was acting mayor she wanted to ""create a city that has equal opportunities for all"" and ""establish a platform of confidence"" to reassure investors. Father-of-four Mr Anderson was elected in 2012, having been a Labour councillor since 1998. He said he was ""very grateful"" for messages of support and had ""faith"" that Liverpool's future was ""bright"" and the city's ""best days"" lay ahead.

"If at first you don't succeed you can try and try. But eventually, sometimes, failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the country towards a different future - a deal that, in theory, would ease the junction from membership of a huge trading bloc to a world outside. There is a chance still that a couple of frantic days could result in a change. The prime minister could decide that after all, the potential disruption of no deal is just too great to risk. The EU president might be able to persuade continental leaders to budge, as they gather in Brussels today. But the chance of reassessing and refreshing the efforts seem now remote. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? The talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen were difficult - the gaps between them no slimmer at the end than the start. The hoped-for mutual understanding, the nudge or wink to pursue compromise, did not come. The only agreement was on when they might call a halt. For the first time in a world of highly moveable deadlines,they announced that a final decisionmust be taken by the end of the weekend. Both sides want to stick to their principles. But that determination right now has set them on the path to the practical outcome they both wanted to avoid - and, if nothing changes, the chance of significant disruption at least in the short term for the country in many different ways. And for both sides, failing to agree would be a real political accident - something they don't want, and that didn't have to happen. One diplomat told me: ""It's dystopian - the UK wants to have the absolute freedom to do things it will probably never do - apart from some tinkering. The EU wants to protect itself from things that will probably never come."" People involved in the negotiations believed that there was a way through that could protect each part. But unless one side, or more likely both, are willing to give up some of their principles very fast, or the negotiators come up with a sudden miracle, then for all his optimism, Boris Johnson may fail to achieve the trade deal that Brexiteers boasted would be easy. A result that he always said he would be ready for, but no doubt what he wanted to avert. TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL YET: What are the sticking points in trade talks?

The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

"This video can not be played Schools moving online at short-notice could be 'confusing' for students All secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales will move classes online from Monday, the education minister has announced. Kirsty Williams said it was part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". However, the Children's Commissioner for Wales has criticised the decision as disruptive to education. A number of counties have also said primary schools will close earlier, including Cardiff and Swansea. Ms Williams said it was important to take a ""clear, national direction"" to ease the pressure from schools, colleges, local councils and parents and carers. ""Every day, we are seeing more and more people admitted to hospital with coronavirus symptoms,"" she added. ""The virus is putting our health service under significant and sustained pressure and it is important we all make a contribution to reduce its transmission."" Teaching will move online from Monday in Wales She said the advice from Wales' Chief Medical Officer, Dr Frank Atherton, was to implement the online learning plan ""as soon as is practicable"". ""Having spoken to local education leaders, I am confident that schools and colleges have online learning provision in place,"" added Ms Williams. ""This will also be important in ensuring that students are at home during this time, learning and staying safe. ""Critically, and this is very important, children should be at home. ""This is not an early Christmas holiday, please do everything you can to minimise your contact with others."" Christmas fears sees parents pull children from school Mass testing in schools considered The latest data shows the infection rate across Wales is averaging more than 370 cases for 100,000 people, with 17% of tests now coming back positive. It means the reproduction (R) number in Wales has now reached 1.27, with infections doubling in 11.7 days. The Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland says she does not support closing schools early But Children's Commissioner Sally Holland said the move was ""not the right decision"" for children and young people in Wales and had yet to see any scientific advice to support the move. ""Whilst accepting the severity of the public health emergency and the responsibilities all of us have to keep each other safe, this decision compounds the disruption to our children's education over the last few months,"" she said. The announcement does not extend to primary or special schools, with the education minister ""encouraging"" them to remain open. However, a number of local authorities have announced they will also be halting face-to-face learning early. Schools in Swansea will all move to online blended learning on Monday, so Friday is the last day in the classroom for primary school pupils. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion parents have been sent emails telling them classrooms will close after Monday. Carmarthenshire council has said primary and special schools will be given the choice to move to online learning or stay open from Tuesday. Cardiff council said the final day in class will be Tuesday. ""The move is designed to enable students to remain at home in the run up to Christmas to try to halt the rise in infection rates,"" said a statement from Cardiff city officials on Thursday evening. The neighbouring Vale of Glamorgan will close primary schools on Wednesday, 16 December. Several local authorities have already announced they would shut schools early Some local authorities had already announced plans to close schools early. Blaenau Gwent shut classrooms on Wednesday, with infection rates in the county now standing at nearly 600 cases for 100,000 people. Record high Covid rates in Welsh council areas Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet In north Wales, Flintshire and Wrexham had decided to shut schools on Friday, with infection rates running at 175 and 230 cases per 100,000. Bridgend, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf councils had also planned to shut early next Wednesday. The teaching union NAHT hadcalled for schools in Wales to shut this Friday, and be replaced with online classes. But the union said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" the move did not include primary or special schools. ""This decision ignores Welsh Government's own advice on pre-isolating before seeing extended family over the Christmas holidays,"" said Laura Doel from the union. ""Many parents will simply vote with their feet and keep children at home anyway."" The Association of School and College Leaders has supported the Welsh Government's announcement. ""This is obviously a difficult decision but the public health advice is very clear that this needs to happen to tackle Covid infection rates in Wales and reduce transmission of the virus,"" said its director in Wales, Eithne Hughes. ""However, we urge the Welsh Government and local authorities to keep a close eye on the situation in primary schools and take appropriate action if needed."" The decision has also been welcomed by the National Education Union Cymru and Unison. But the move has been criticised by the education leader at one north Wales council. Huw Hilditch-Roberts, of Denbighshire council, said the announcement was a ""blanket approach based on what is happening in the south"". The rate of infection in the county is 101.4 per 100,000. ""Any decision to close schools should be made on the data, and the data in our area doesn't support the decision,"" he told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. ""I feel this could result in a community spike because it will be harder to manage with more children in the community for longer."" Responding to the announcement, Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian said on-site provision must be made for all younger learners, and children of key workers ""who can't make alternative arrangements"". She said every secondary school pupilmust also have suitable devices for accessing online lessons, adding: ""Accessing education through Xboxes and mobiles phones is not good enough."" The Welsh Conservatives said the decision was another instance of ""confusing messages"" from the Welsh Government. ""There is no doubt that the situation is grave in parts of Wales, but I would have preferred targeted interventions where needed, not another blanket ban,"" said their education spokeswoman in the Senedd, Suzy Davies.

"UK travellers could be barred from entering the EU from 1 January as travel rules associated with being part of the EU expire and pandemic restrictions block entry. Unrestricted travel to countries within the bloc will no longer automatically apply to UK residents from then. This means entry into the EU would then be based on essential travel only. Currently only countries with low coronavirus infection rates qualify for non-essential travel. There are only eight countries with low Covid rates that are on the approved list for free travel and there are currently no plans to add the UK to that list. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme that Covid restrictions would depend on what the EU and its member states decide. He added that ""restrictions on travel, inevitably, is going to be something that's kept under review"". EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Brexit talks 'unlikely' to go beyond Sunday - Raab With talks about a trade deal between the UK and the EU still continuing, there is a possibility this could change. Alternatively, individual member state countries could decide to override the EU rules and create a corridor with the UK. At the moment, the UK is considered to have the same status by the EU as countries such as Norway and Switzerland, which are members of the European Free Trade Association, travel expert Simon Calder told the BBC. Mr Calder said that many regions dependent on tourism, such as the Canary Islands, may well make an exemption for British tourists, ""but there's no obligation to at the moment"". Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, agreed, saying: ""Cool heads need to prevail at this politically difficult time as travel and tourism is such a key contributor to economic growth in Europe.

"UK travellers could be barred from entering the EU from 1 January as travel rules associated with being part of the EU expire and pandemic restrictions block entry. Unrestricted travel to countries within the bloc will no longer automatically apply to UK residents from then. This means entry into the EU would then be based on essential travel only. Currently only countries with low coronavirus infection rates qualify for non-essential travel. There are only eight countries with low Covid rates that are on the approved list for free travel and there are currently no plans to add the UK to that list. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme that Covid restrictions would depend on what the EU and its member states decide.

"If the number of coronavirus cases rises sharply, restrictions may need to be reimposed before the new year Stormont ministers have appealed to people in NI not to ""get caught up in the Christmas spirit"" with Covid-19 lockdown restrictions set to be eased. A two-week lockdown ends at 23:59 GMT, meaning hairdressers, shops and some hospitality businesses can reopen. First Minister Arlene Foster urged people to be ""sensible"" about limiting their social contacts. She said the executive was ""disappointed"" that transmission of the virus had not reduced significantly. Another 14 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Thursday. It brings the total number of deaths to 1,099. A further 441 people have also tested positive for the virus. A further 15 deaths have been reported in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's total to 2,117. There have been 75,203 confirmed cases of Covid-19 after another 310 were recorded. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont, Mrs Foster said in the past week all 11 councils in Northern Ireland had seen a rise in the number of recorded cases of Covid-19. She warned that an easing of restrictions did not mean ""any easing of the need to follow public health guidelines"". ""We are disappointed to see the number of hospital admissions where they are, people need to cut down their contacts and take personal responsibility,"" she added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill warned: ""If people want to have a nice Christmas, don't ruin it by being reckless over the next couple of weeks. ""We need people to be so careful, this is a crucial period."" Ministers said Northern Ireland's R-number - which measures the coronavirus infection rate - is around one. R represents how many extra people each infected person passes the virus onto: the goal is to keep it below one. Last week the executive was advised that if the R-number rises sharply in the next few weeks, restrictionswould need to be reimposed before the new year. Mrs Foster said just because restrictions were being eased, it did not mean people needed to take advantage of them. The first minister added that Covid 'ambassadors' would be appearing on the High Streets to provide advice on queuing and ensuring people can safely shop in the run-up to Christmas. While Ms O'Neill said she accepted that some businesses unable to open under the new regulations still faced challenges. ""We've tried to mitigate but it can't replace all the financial loss that businesses have experienced,"" she said, adding that she recognised it would not be enough for all those sectors affected. With the easing of the restrictions, many hospitality businesses, including restaurants, cafes and hotels, can reopen their doors on Friday but must be closed at 23:00 each day. What do NI's Covid-19 restrictions mean for you? Pubs that do not serve food will have to remain shut. On Thursday night theNI Executive's new Covid-19 regulations were published.,external The regulations, which come into force just before midnight on Thursday, provided further details on the latest rules. They state that any food served must have been prepared ""in a static and permanent kitchen on the premises of the bar, hotel, pub or club and which is eaten by a person seated at a table"". They also outline that every person who visits hospitality must provide their name and telephone number. The end of the lockdown also means: Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons can reopen but visits to them are by appointment only Churches can resume services, while weddings and funerals will have their cap of 25 people lifted Gyms can reopen for individual training but not for classes Outdoor sports training and matches can resume at all levels Up to 500 spectators can attend outdoor sporting events Meanwhile, Justice Minister Naomi Long has said restrictions on visiting arrangements at prisons will be relaxed for Christmas. However, she said a scheme to allow some prisoners leave to return home over the holiday season would remain paused to ""help protect the entire prison community"", with more than 2,000 virtual visits scheduled between now and the New Year. ""People in custody will also be able to receive Christmas packages from their loved ones, and additional support will be provided to those who remain in the care of the Prison Service,"" she added. Some publicans have decided not to reopen their premises until the new year Bars that offer meals - that have been cooked in their own kitchen - can reopen from Friday, but the owners of some venues have decided to keep their premises closed until next year. The family which owns Belfast's well-known Lavery's Bar and the Pavilion Bar said they made that decision ""with the greatest regret"". ""This has been an incredibly difficult decision to make and we are so sorry for any disappointment it causes,"" they added. The owners of the John Hewitt Bar in the city said that although ""this time of year is the time we look forward to the most"" the safety measures the hospitality sector must adhere to under the terms of reopening were ""just too heavy for us to operate"". Three bars in Omagh, County Tyrone, have also decided to remain closed after 11 December. Bogan's, Sally's of Omagh and the Blind Cobbler, which all offer meals, said they would not be reopening for the festive period. In a post on facebook, Bogan's said the decision was ""incredibly difficult to make, but ultimately we feel this is the right thing to do, for the safety of our staff and for our customers"". The Blind Cobbler team said they realised the announcement would be ""disheartening and disappointing"", but looked ""forward to brighter times ahead"". Sally's said it looked forward to 2021 ""when we can reopen and provide everyone with a night out free from restrictions"". Ciaran Breslin, who owns the Primrose cafÃ© on the Quay in Londonderry, has said he, like many other businesses in the city, has a number of safety measures in place in order to re-open safely on Friday. ""Like all hospitality industries and restaurants we make customer safety the number one focus. ""We have made it a really safe environment and it will be fantastic to have the doors back open again. ""There is 2m distancing, we have got screens in place,  track and trace in place, sanitiser stations, and we have all customers and staff wearing face coverings,"" Mr Breslin said. The Derry business owner said he cannot rule out any potential future closures and said he can only focus on the here and now. ""We will take it every day as it comes, we have pivoted a few times and all we can do is make a safe environment for our staff and our customers.""

"This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs As President Donald Trump's days in the White House wane, his administration has been racing through a string of federal executions. Five people have been executed in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's 20 January inauguration - breaking with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. They make Mr Trump the country's most prolific execution president in more than a century, overseeing the executions of 13 death row inmates since July of this year. The five executions began with convicted killer 40-year-old Brandon Bernard who was put to death at a penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. They ended with the death of Dustin Higgs, 48, at the same site on 16 January. Bernard apologises to victims' family before execution Attorney General William Barr has said his justice department is simply upholding existing law. But critics have said the move is concerning, coming just weeks before Mr Biden - who has said he will seek to end the death penalty - takes office. Attorney General Barr has ordered five executions during the presidential transition period ""This is really outside the norm, in a pretty extreme way,"" said Ngozi Ndulue, director of research at the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center. US resumption of federal executions criticised How many countries still have the death penalty? US inmate has 'no right to painless death' Here's what you need to know about President Trump's last-minute rush of executions. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1988, executions carried out by the national or federal government in the US have remained rare. Before Mr Trump took office, only three federal executions had taken place in this period. All were carried out under Republican President George W Bush, and included inmate Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. Since 2003, there have been no federal executions at all. Most federal executions take place here, at the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex in Indiana US states have continued to execute inmates in state prisons, putting 22 death row inmates to death last year. But state executions are also on a downward trend. A growing number have moved to abolish capital punishment altogether, and the majority have either formally banned the practice or have not put any inmates to death in more than a decade. Popular opinion, too, has shifted away from capital punishment. A November 2019 Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans supported life in prison over the death penalty for the first time since the survey began more than 30 years ago. ""Public support for the death penalty is at a decades-long low,"" Ms Ndulue said. Further problems have emerged with the methods of execution, sourcing drugs used for lethal injections, and the costs of decades-long court battles and appeals. In July 2019, Mr Barr announced the scheduled executions of five death row prisoners, despite prevailing practices and public opinion. ""Congress has expressly authorised the death penalty,"" the country's top legal official said in a statement at the time. ""The justice department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."" The selected inmates had been convicted of murdering or raping children and the elderly, Mr Barr said. The move drew fierce criticism from top Democrats and human rights groups. ""We feel [the death penalty] is an unconstitutionally arbitrary punishment that should have been abolished decades ago,"" said Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NCAAP Legal Defense Fund. This video can not be played The women who write to death row inmates And the particular selection of inmates fuelled charges that the decision was politically motivated. The first set of executions this summer - during a wave of anti-racism protests and demonstrations - were all of white men. Four of these five prisoners put to death were African American. Ms Ndulue said she didn't think it was ""coincidental"" that no black prisoners were scheduled for execution during a period of ""enhanced awareness of the racial disparities around the federal death penalty"". Research suggests the death penalty has been enforced differently according to race. ""One of the most robust findings of study after study, in jurisdictions across the country, is that the race of your victim is a serious factor in determining whether or not you will have the death penalty,"" Ms Ndulue said. The 10 inmates executed in 2020 have led to a single-year total unmatched in modern history. ""We'd have to go back to 1896 to find another year where there were 10 or more executions,"" Ms Ndulue said. Campaigners are seeking to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution The Trump administration has also chosen to carry out federal executions in the midst of a political transition, with a lame-duck president, for the first time in more than a century. Incumbent presidents have typically deferred to their successors, allowing presidents-elect to set the course. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr Barr defended the post-election executions. ""I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,"" he said. ""But if you ask juries to impose it, then it should be carried out."" But it is a controversial choice, especially as the incoming Biden administration has said it will work to end the death penalty. Bernard's execution had drawn particular attention. Convicted of murder and kidnapping in 1999, Bernard was 18 at the time of his offence, and would be the youngest offender executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Five of the nine surviving jurors in the case, as well as the US attorney who defended the death sentence on appeal, had publicly called for his execution to be stopped. Kim Kardashian also weighed in, making a direct appeal to Mr Trump on Twitter. Mr Trump has been a long-time, vocal advocate of the death penalty. The Biden team is opposed. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, in particular, has been a consistent critic of the practice. She took a stand against capital punishment in her successful 2003 campaign for San Francisco District Attorney and declined to seek the death penalty in the murder of a 29-year-old police officer, killed in the line of duty - despite pressure from within her party. Then-Senator Joe Biden expressed support for the death penalty in the 1990s. The president-elect's record is more uneven. Mr Biden's 1994 crime bill added some 60 federal crimes for which someone could be put to death. Some of those on death row today were convicted under provisions of his legislation. Now, he has promised to push for legislation eliminating federal executions entirely, and to encourage states to do the same. The Biden team has noted that more than 160 individuals sentenced to death in the US since 1973 have later been exonerated. Mr Biden has yet to name his choice for US attorney general. Alfred Bourgeoiswas on death row for torturing and beating his two-year-old daughter to death. He was executed on 11 December. An earlier execution date was stayed by a federal judge due to evidence from Bourgeois' legal team showing he had an intellectual disability. This ruling was overturned in October. Lisa Montgomerystrangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. She was executed on 12 January. Her lawyers said she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and suffers from serious mental illness. She was the first woman to face federal execution in the US since 1953. Cory Johnsonwas convicted for the murder of seven people, related to his involvement with the drug trade in Richmond, Virginia. Johnson's legal team argued that he suffered from an intellectual disability, related to physical and emotional abuse he experienced as a child. He was executed on 14 January. Dustin John Higgswas convicted in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three young women in the Washington, DC area. Higgs did not kill any of his victims. His co-defendant Willis Haynes did, after being instructed to by Higgs. Haynes has said in court documents that Higgs did not threaten him, or force him to shoot. Higgs was executed on 15 January.

"Folklore is the best-reviewed album of Taylor Swift's career Taylor Swift is releasing her second surprise album of 2020 at midnight, she has revealed on Twitter. Evermore is described as a ""sister album"" to the delicate, escapist Folklore, which itself arrived out-of-the-blue in July. Recorded remotely in quarantine, that record topped the US and UK charts and earned Swift nominations for six Grammy awards, including album of the year. Swift said the new 17-track collection featured songs from the same sessions. ""To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing,"" she said. ""To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: To turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""In the past I've always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. ""There was something different with Folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. ""I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them."" Taylor Swift's Folklore sees the singer go indie Taylor Swift's Folklore is a record-breaker Swift shares first clip of re-recorded Love Story As with Folklore, the new album will contain collaborations with indie artists Bon Iver and Aaron Dessner, as well as female rock trio Haim - who are one of Swift's competitors in the Grammys' album of the year category.

"Easing restrictions in Edinburgh would have posed a ""significant risk"" of the virus running out of control again, the first minister has insisted. Council leaders say they were told the capital was likely to move from level three to level two this week. But Nicola Sturgeon announced on Tuesday that it would instead be remaining in level three. Ms Sturgeon said the data suggested it would not be safe or sensible to ease the restrictions. The first minister was speaking as she faced questions in the Scottish Parliament over the controversial decision, which has sparked anger from many politicians and businesses in Edinburgh. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the city council had been told by officials from Public Health Scotland and the National Incident Management Team that Edinburgh should be downgraded to level two. Council 'fury' over Edinburgh's level 3 status What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? He said Edinburgh was ""well within"" the level two thresholds, adding: ""If you look at the five indicators that were published on Tuesday, one stayed at moderate, three remained at low and one was moved from law to very low. ""So why was Edinburgh treated in this way?"" Mr Leonard said the issue was also about public trust in the decision-making process, adding: ""The government too often appears to assume that people will act in an irresponsible way, and that assumption is bringing businesses in Edinburgh and across the country to breaking point. ""The five-tier system was supposed to give people and businesses certainty and clarity but we are seeing a return to arbitrary and ad hoc decision making."" Ms Sturgeon said the number of cases per 100,000 in the city had gone up by 14% over the past week, and test positivity by 0.5%. And she said test positivity had increased in five of the past seven days, and case levels in four of the past seven. The first minister said there was no reason for her to keep Edinburgh in level three unless it was absolutely necessary The first minister added: ""If you have a situation where you have in any area case numbers rising slightly, or not declining significantly enough, then there is a real risk in easing restrictions. ""The danger is the situation runs very quickly out of control, and the judgement the Cabinet reached was that to take Edinburgh down a level at this stage would have posed a significant risk to the overall situation - which is why we didn't do it."" Ms Sturgeon said she understood the impact on businesses of remaining in level three, but said people in Edinburgh ""deserve a government that will take decisions to try to keep them safe"". And she asked: ""Why on earth would I want to keep Edinburgh, or any part of the country, in a higher level of protection when I didn't think there was a need to do that?"" Council leader Adam McVey, who also leads the authority's SNP group, said on Wednesday that he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision, which he said would make the ""dire"" situation for local businesses even worse in the lead up to Christmas. He added: ""Our numbers are stable and have now been consistently within the rates of level two for some time. ""I've been strongly pressing for Edinburgh's case to move to a lower level of restrictions when safe to do so. The data suggests that time should have been now."" And Cammy Day, the leader of the council's Labour group, questioned why Edinburgh was being kept in level three when it had lower numbers of cases than some level two areas. Edinburgh's case numbers began to rise fast in the second half of September and peaked at about 160 weekly cases per 100,000 people at the beginning of October. However, by the time the Covid levels system was introduced on 2 November, the rate had declined to about half that and well below the level three threshold rate of 150. It has since gone below the level two threshold, though the figure was rising slightly at the end of last week. The Scottish government also considers the percentage of tests coming back positive when judging what level a local authority should be in, and Edinburgh's ""positivity rate"" has been lower than the Scotland-wide rate since mid-October. According tothe latest Scottish government evidence paper,external, the number of Covid-19 patients is forecast to rise in the coming weeks, but not to go above capacity.

"Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf during a debate on the Hate Crime and Public Order Bill The Scottish government has been urged to make further changes to its controversial Hate Crime Bill. Plans to amend the legislation had already been announced. It followed an outcry over proposals to create a new offence of ""stirring-up hatred"", which critics fear will stifle freedom of expression. After scrutinising the Scottish government's plans, MSPs on Holyrood's Justice Committee say they believe additional changes are needed. The committee has now recommended the Scottish Parliament back the general principles of the bill ""subject to those amendments being made"". Convener Adam Tomkins said the committee is unanimous in calling for more changes. The Scottish government introduced the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill after a review of current legislation. Existing hate crime legislation was reviewed by Lord Bracadale The government asked a senior judge, Lord Bracadale, to examine all of the country's existing hate crime legislation to make sure it was still fit for purpose in the 21st Century. The bill was introduced in response to his recommendations. Despite Mr Yousaf pledging to make amendments to the bill, MSPs on the Justice Committee want provisions concerning the safeguarding of free speech to be ""deepened and strengthened"". .Why is the Hate Crime Bill so controversial? Controversial hate crime legislation to be changed In a new report on the bill, the committee demand clarification of the ""reasonableness"" defence available to those who are charged with ""stirring-up"" offences. MSPs also argued that for behaviour to be considered ""abusive"" under the terms of legislation, prosecutors must be required to show a ""reasonable person"" would consider this to be the case - claiming this would set a higher bar for prosecutions. While the committee said ""hate crime offences are no more acceptable if they are committed inside a person's home than in public places"", MSPs added care should be taken to ensure people are not prosecuted for expressing their views in a private space if there is ""no public element"". The report is clear the bill is ""not intended to prohibit speech which others may find offensive"" - stressing the ""right to freedom of speech includes the right to offend, shock or disturb"". MSPs said education - and not just legislation - is ultimately what is needed to tackle hate crime. The report states: ""Hate crime legislation will not, of itself, rid Scotland of prejudice. ""In pursuing that goal, education is likely to be far more important than necessarily creating new criminal offences. ""As such, the committee seeks further information from the Scottish government on what further steps it proposes to take and what additional resources it intends to provide, including in relation to education, to tackle prejudice in Scottish society."" Adam Tomkins is convenor of the justice committee Mr Tomkins said ""balancing freedom of expression and legislating to ensure hateful actions can be prosecuted is a difficult task"". He added: ""We believe that, if amended in line with our unanimous recommendations, this bill should be fit to protect the communities it affords extra protections to without encroaching on the ability of citizens to have robust debates, hold views others find unpalatable and express themselves freely."" Mr Tomkins said it is ""testament to the open-mindedness of all members"" that the committee had ""found such consensus on what has undoubtedly been a contentious piece of legislation"". Mr Yousaf, the justice secretary, said the Scottish government would give the recommendations ""full consideration"" ahead of Holyrood debating the bill on Tuesday. He said he hopes MSPs ""can listen to the voices of those affected by hate crime and come together to support the general principles of this legislation"". The minister added: ""The parliamentary debate will provide the opportunity for MSPs to find consensus on how we collectively and effectively tackle hate crime, working together to ensure Scotland is an inclusive and forward-thinking society that safeguards all of its people and communities.""

"If the number of coronavirus cases rises sharply, restrictions may need to be reimposed before the new year Stormont ministers have appealed to people in NI not to ""get caught up in the Christmas spirit"" with Covid-19 lockdown restrictions set to be eased. A two-week lockdown ends at 23:59 GMT, meaning hairdressers, shops and some hospitality businesses can reopen. First Minister Arlene Foster urged people to be ""sensible"" about limiting their social contacts. She said the executive was ""disappointed"" that transmission of the virus had not reduced significantly. Another 14 coronavirus-related deaths were recorded by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Thursday. It brings the total number of deaths to 1,099. A further 441 people have also tested positive for the virus. A further 15 deaths have been reported in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's total to 2,117. There have been 75,203 confirmed cases of Covid-19 after another 310 were recorded. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont, Mrs Foster said in the past week all 11 councils in Northern Ireland had seen a rise in the number of recorded cases of Covid-19. She warned that an easing of restrictions did not mean ""any easing of the need to follow public health guidelines"". ""We are disappointed to see the number of hospital admissions where they are, people need to cut down their contacts and take personal responsibility,"" she added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill warned: ""If people want to have a nice Christmas, don't ruin it by being reckless over the next couple of weeks. ""We need people to be so careful, this is a crucial period."" Ministers said Northern Ireland's R-number - which measures the coronavirus infection rate - is around one. R represents how many extra people each infected person passes the virus onto: the goal is to keep it below one. Last week the executive was advised that if the R-number rises sharply in the next few weeks, restrictionswould need to be reimposed before the new year. Mrs Foster said just because restrictions were being eased, it did not mean people needed to take advantage of them. The first minister added that Covid 'ambassadors' would be appearing on the High Streets to provide advice on queuing and ensuring people can safely shop in the run-up to Christmas. While Ms O'Neill said she accepted that some businesses unable to open under the new regulations still faced challenges. ""We've tried to mitigate but it can't replace all the financial loss that businesses have experienced,"" she said, adding that she recognised it would not be enough for all those sectors affected.

"Tesco and Morrisons will open their shops on Boxing Day despite calls to give staff the day off. Unions say supermarket staff should not have to go in on 26 December as a thank you for their work during the pandemic Asda, Marks & Spencer, Pets at Home, and toy store The Entertainer have all said they will close. But Tesco and Morrisons have joined Sainsbury's in saying they would open on Boxing Day for a limited number of hours. Tesco said it wouldreward frontline staff with an extra 10% bonus,externalover the Christmas and New Year period. Morrisons said that working on the day would be voluntary with staff getting double pay. Sainsbury's will open but has reduced the hours after requests from staff. It said most workers would have Boxing Day off. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas Supermarkets, which have been are classed as ""essential"" retailers during the pandemic, have seen their sales boom this year. As part of a thank you to staff for their work during the pandemic, Asda said that all of its 631 shops would close for two days over the Christmas break. Frontline staff will also get 100% of their bonus entitlement regardless of whether they have reached sales quotas. Covid: Christmas comes early as grocery sales 'hit record' in November Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said in a message to staff it had been a ""challenging year"" and they had ""done an incredible job"". He also said that many staff would have missed out on spending time with their families and friends due to Covid restrictions. ""This is of course our busiest time of year but it was important for us to give as many of you as possible the opportunity to spend this time with those loved ones that you may not have not seen for many months so, uniquely for this year, we will not reopen our stores until 27 December."" The GMB union said it had been ""requesting Asda to allow their key worker heroes family time over the Christmas period, so we are really pleased they have agreed to our calls."" GMB national officer Roger Jenkins, said: ""It's a shame this is not extra holiday - workers will have to book a day of their annual leave entitlement. ""But it's a step in the right direction and GMB now calls on the rest of the retail sector to follow suit and repay these key workers with a chance to spend Boxing Day with their loved ones."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Usdaw, the union which represents shop workers, has also been calling on all retailers to close their doors on Boxing Day. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said at the end of November: ""With the country facing a crisis unlike any in our lifetime, retail and distribution workers have stepped up and kept food on all of our tables. ""When others stay safe at home, they go out to work. ""The only way they will be guaranteed a decent break at Christmas is if food retailers close for Boxing Day,"" he said. However, supermarket giant Sainsbury's, which has a large network of convenience shops as well as larger outlets, said on Wednesday that its supermarkets would remain open, albeit with reduced hours. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""For colleagues that have requested it, we have made sure they are able to take at least two consecutive days off over Christmas."" Tesco said: ""Our stores are open for reduced hours on Boxing Day. Many of our customers rely on their local stores over Boxing Day - from families in search of essentials, to key workers needing access to food."" A Morrisons spokeswoman said it would open its stores for a limited number of hours on Boxing Day but it was ""working hard to ensure all colleagues get a meaningful break during the Christmas period"". It said anyone who worked on Boxing Day would also get time back in lieu. In November, Marks & Spencer said it would reverse its decision to open on Boxing Day so staff could spend more time with their families. Poundland said earlier in the year that it would stay closed on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, while retailers including Wickes, Pets and Home and the Entertainer have also said they will be closed.

"Google has been fined 100 million euros (Â£91m) in France for breaking the country's rules on online advertising trackers known as cookies. It is the largest fine ever issued by the French data privacy watchdog CNIL. US retail giant Amazon was also fined 35 million euros for breaking the rules. CNIL said Google and Amazon's French websites had not sought visitors' consent before advertising cookies were saved on their computers. Google and Amazon also failed to provide clear information about how the online trackers would be used, and how visitors to the French websites could refuse the cookies, the regulator said. It has given the tech giants three months to change the information banners displayed on their websites. If they do not comply, they will be fined a further 100,000 euros per day until the changes are made. In a statement published by Reuters, Google said: ""We stand by our record of providing upfront information and clear controls, strong internal data governance, secure infrastructure, and above all, helpful products. ""Today's decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn't account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving."" Amazon said it disagreed with the CNIL decision, ""We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators and fully comply with all applicable laws in every country in which we operate,"" it said in a statement. In a separate case, Google is being probed by a UK regulator over its plans to change the way the Chrome browser handles cookies. Google wants to stop advertisers using cookies to track users as they move around the web from one site to another when using Chrome, in a bid to improve privacy. It plans to introduce an alternative system know as the Privacy Sandbox that will only provide anonymised feedback. A group of about a dozen small tech companies and publishers has lodged a complaint with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) claiming this would damage their businesses. The CMA is expected to announce whether it will intervene over the coming weeks.

"The European bison was driven to the edge of extinction in the early twentieth century by hunting and habitat loss The European bison has moved a step back from the brink of extinction, according to an update of the official extinction list. Europe's largest land mammal was almost wiped out by hunting and deforestation a century ago,  but numbers have now risen to over 6,000 in wild herds across the continent. The recovery is regarded as a ""conservation success"" story. But 31 species of plants and animals have gone extinct in the latest tally. They include frogs, fish, several plants and a bat. The extinction list by the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation for Nature) assesses the survival prospects of plants, animals and fungi. In the third and final update for this year, Dr Bruno Oberle, director general of the IUCN, said the recovery of the European bison and 25 other species demonstrated ""the power of conservation"". But the growing list of extinct species ""is a stark reminder that conservation efforts must urgently expand"", he added. Extinction crisis: Leaders say it is time to act Extinction 'existential threat to civilisation' Five key things about the extinction crisis From the 1950s onwards, European bison began to be reintroduced into the wild The IUCN has now assessed almost 130,000 species of plants and animals, of which more than a quarter are threatened with extinction. In the latest update of the ""RedList"", there is good news and bad news for a range of mammals, birds and amphibians. Despite good news for animals such as the European bison, a total of 31 species have been declared extinct, including three frogs of Central America, 17 freshwater fish of the Philippines, the Lord Howe long-eared bat and 11 plant species. The frogs have been hit by a deadly fungal disease, while the fish have disappeared due to predation by introduced species and over-fishing. A dolphin found in the Amazon river, the tucuxi, has been classed as endangered. All the world's freshwater dolphins are now threatened. The tucuxi dolphin found in the Amazon river is endangered The small grey dolphin is in trouble due to accidental capture in fishing gear, pollution and the damming of rivers. The IUCN says its survival rests on eliminating the use of gillnets - curtains of fishing net that hang in the water - and reducing the number of dams in the waters where they live. In the bird kingdom, the Andean condor, secretary bird, bateleur and martial eagle are now at high risk of extinction. The Andean condor is one of the world's largest flying birds Ian Burfield of BirdLife International, which compiles the extinction list for birds, said while any species being listed as threatened was obviously bad news, ""it doesn't have to be a tragedy"". ""For many, the road to recovery begins here, as listing brings visibility to their plight and helps to raise their conservation priority,"" he explained. The benefits of conservation action are being seen for a number of animals. They include an upturn in numbers for the European bison and another 25 species of plants and animals, including skates, amphibians and birds. The ""conservation successes"" announced on Thursday ""provide living proof that the world can set, and meet, ambitious biodiversity targets"", said Dr Jane Smart, global director of IUCN's Biodiversity Conservation Group. Species: The European Bison (Bison bonasus) Status:Moved from Vulnerable to Near Threatened Large herds of wild bison once roamed across Europe, as recorded in ancient cave paintings. But human pressures and hunting caused their downfall, and by the 1920s, the large mammal was extinct, except in zoos. By the end of the 1920s, less than 60 individual European bisons were alive in zoo and private parks Efforts to return the bison to its natural landscape started in Poland in the 1950s. Numbers have grown from around 1,800 in 2003 to more than 6,000 last year, mainly found in Poland, Belarus and Russia. The bison are scattered in almost 50 herds, most of which are too small to survive without continued conservation work. Dr Rafal Kowalczyk, a bison expert from the Polish Academy of Sciences, told BBC News: ""The species is very vulnerable to extinction but with this international effort we were able to save the species, to increase its number of herds and increase its distribution. and I hope the future of the species is bright."" Species:The red kite Status:Moved from near threatened to least concern (the lowest category of extinction risk) The red kite is increasing in number The red kite was declining across Europe, due to poisoning from pesticides, persecution and loss of natural spaces. But legal protection led to an action plan, including large-scale reintroduction projects. The bird is now recovering and has become a common sight in many areas, although poisoning and persecution are still a problem in some places. Species: The Oaxaca treefrog Status:Moved from Critically Endangered to Near Threatened Many amphibians are in trouble, but actions by local communities in Mexico have helped to protect this frog's habitat.

"This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs As President Donald Trump's days in the White House wane, his administration has been racing through a string of federal executions. Five people have been executed in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's 20 January inauguration - breaking with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. They make Mr Trump the country's most prolific execution president in more than a century, overseeing the executions of 13 death row inmates since July of this year. The five executions began with convicted killer 40-year-old Brandon Bernard who was put to death at a penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. They ended with the death of Dustin Higgs, 48, at the same site on 16 January. Bernard apologises to victims' family before execution Attorney General William Barr has said his justice department is simply upholding existing law. But critics have said the move is concerning, coming just weeks before Mr Biden - who has said he will seek to end the death penalty - takes office. Attorney General Barr has ordered five executions during the presidential transition period ""This is really outside the norm, in a pretty extreme way,"" said Ngozi Ndulue, director of research at the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center. US resumption of federal executions criticised How many countries still have the death penalty? US inmate has 'no right to painless death' Here's what you need to know about President Trump's last-minute rush of executions. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1988, executions carried out by the national or federal government in the US have remained rare. Before Mr Trump took office, only three federal executions had taken place in this period. All were carried out under Republican President George W Bush, and included inmate Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. Since 2003, there have been no federal executions at all. Most federal executions take place here, at the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex in Indiana US states have continued to execute inmates in state prisons, putting 22 death row inmates to death last year. But state executions are also on a downward trend. A growing number have moved to abolish capital punishment altogether, and the majority have either formally banned the practice or have not put any inmates to death in more than a decade. Popular opinion, too, has shifted away from capital punishment. A November 2019 Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans supported life in prison over the death penalty for the first time since the survey began more than 30 years ago. ""Public support for the death penalty is at a decades-long low,"" Ms Ndulue said. Further problems have emerged with the methods of execution, sourcing drugs used for lethal injections, and the costs of decades-long court battles and appeals. In July 2019, Mr Barr announced the scheduled executions of five death row prisoners, despite prevailing practices and public opinion. ""Congress has expressly authorised the death penalty,"" the country's top legal official said in a statement at the time. ""The justice department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."" The selected inmates had been convicted of murdering or raping children and the elderly, Mr Barr said. The move drew fierce criticism from top Democrats and human rights groups. ""We feel [the death penalty] is an unconstitutionally arbitrary punishment that should have been abolished decades ago,"" said Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NCAAP Legal Defense Fund. This video can not be played The women who write to death row inmates And the particular selection of inmates fuelled charges that the decision was politically motivated. The first set of executions this summer - during a wave of anti-racism protests and demonstrations - were all of white men. Four of these five prisoners put to death were African American. Ms Ndulue said she didn't think it was ""coincidental"" that no black prisoners were scheduled for execution during a period of ""enhanced awareness of the racial disparities around the federal death penalty"". Research suggests the death penalty has been enforced differently according to race. ""One of the most robust findings of study after study, in jurisdictions across the country, is that the race of your victim is a serious factor in determining whether or not you will have the death penalty,"" Ms Ndulue said. The 10 inmates executed in 2020 have led to a single-year total unmatched in modern history. ""We'd have to go back to 1896 to find another year where there were 10 or more executions,"" Ms Ndulue said. Campaigners are seeking to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution The Trump administration has also chosen to carry out federal executions in the midst of a political transition, with a lame-duck president, for the first time in more than a century. Incumbent presidents have typically deferred to their successors, allowing presidents-elect to set the course. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr Barr defended the post-election executions. ""I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,"" he said. ""But if you ask juries to impose it, then it should be carried out."" But it is a controversial choice, especially as the incoming Biden administration has said it will work to end the death penalty. Bernard's execution had drawn particular attention. Convicted of murder and kidnapping in 1999, Bernard was 18 at the time of his offence, and would be the youngest offender executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Five of the nine surviving jurors in the case, as well as the US attorney who defended the death sentence on appeal, had publicly called for his execution to be stopped. Kim Kardashian also weighed in, making a direct appeal to Mr Trump on Twitter. Mr Trump has been a long-time, vocal advocate of the death penalty. The Biden team is opposed. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, in particular, has been a consistent critic of the practice. She took a stand against capital punishment in her successful 2003 campaign for San Francisco District Attorney and declined to seek the death penalty in the murder of a 29-year-old police officer, killed in the line of duty - despite pressure from within her party. Then-Senator Joe Biden expressed support for the death penalty in the 1990s. The president-elect's record is more uneven. Mr Biden's 1994 crime bill added some 60 federal crimes for which someone could be put to death. Some of those on death row today were convicted under provisions of his legislation. Now, he has promised to push for legislation eliminating federal executions entirely, and to encourage states to do the same. The Biden team has noted that more than 160 individuals sentenced to death in the US since 1973 have later been exonerated. Mr Biden has yet to name his choice for US attorney general. Alfred Bourgeoiswas on death row for torturing and beating his two-year-old daughter to death. He was executed on 11 December. An earlier execution date was stayed by a federal judge due to evidence from Bourgeois' legal team showing he had an intellectual disability. This ruling was overturned in October. Lisa Montgomerystrangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. She was executed on 12 January. Her lawyers said she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and suffers from serious mental illness. She was the first woman to face federal execution in the US since 1953. Cory Johnsonwas convicted for the murder of seven people, related to his involvement with the drug trade in Richmond, Virginia. Johnson's legal team argued that he suffered from an intellectual disability, related to physical and emotional abuse he experienced as a child. He was executed on 14 January. Dustin John Higgswas convicted in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three young women in the Washington, DC area. Higgs did not kill any of his victims. His co-defendant Willis Haynes did, after being instructed to by Higgs. Haynes has said in court documents that Higgs did not threaten him, or force him to shoot. Higgs was executed on 15 January.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns of a ""worrying"" rise in cases in London, Kent and Essex Mass testing will be rolled out for secondary school-aged children in that age group in the worst affected parts of those regions He warns at a Downing Street press conference that ""the fight is not over"" and urges: ""Don't blow it now"" The UK's economic recovery slowed in October - rising 0.4% on the month against a backdrop of rising Covid cases Canada joins the UK in approving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine The United States records more than 3,000 deaths in the latest 24-hour period - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world South Africa, the worst hit country in Africa, enters a second wave of the pandemic as it registers 7,000 new cases on Wednesday Ministers in Northern Ireland are due to meet later before the end of a two-week lockdown on Friday There have been 68.9m cases and 1.56m deaths worldwide, figures from Johns Hopkins University show Edited by Rob Corp We are now closing our live coverage. Today's live coverage was brought to you by: Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Lauren Turner, Jennifer Scott, Sarah Fowler and Rob Corp. Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest in coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. We'll be closing the live page for the day shortly. But before we do, here's a recap of the main headlines. Cabin crews in China are being advised to wear diapers for flights to high-risk coronavirus countries and to avoid using the toilet to reduce the chance of infection. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The number of patients in England waiting over a year for routine hospital care is now 100 times higher than before the pandemic, figures show. Nearly 163,000 out of the 4.4 million on the waiting list at the end of October had waited over 12 months for operations such as hip replacements. There were just 1,600 year-long waiters in February, NHS England data shows. The Royal College of Surgeons warned patients were being left in pain unable to carry on with ""day-to-day life"". ""Yet again, these waiting time figures drive home the devastating impact Covid has had on wider NHS services,"" RCS president Prof Neil Mortensen said. It  was a ""national crisis"" that could take two to three years to tackle, he added. The number of long waits is now at its highest level since 2008. Although there are signs elsewhere in the figures that things may be starting to improve. The number of operations being done is on the increase, while average waits are falling. The data also shows accident-and-emergency attendances dropped during lockdown. There were 1.49 million visits to A&E in November - a quarter down on normal levels, raising concerns people with serious illnesses may not be receiving the help they need. At the peak of the pandemic, attendances dropped to 900,000 a month before climbing during the summer and reaching a peak of 1.72 million. The numbers of urgent cancer checks and patients starting cancer treatment, however, have returned to their normal levels. An NHS England spokesman said: ""Although Covid hospitalisations almost doubled during November, for every Covid inpatient the NHS treated, hospitals managed to treat five other inpatients for other health conditions. ""With cancer referrals and treatments now back above usual levels, our message remains that people should continue to come forward for care when they need it."" There is mounting concern, however, about the current trends for Covid. The number of Covid patients in hospital in England - currently 12,600, accounting for one in seven of all beds available - has shown a slight increase in recent days after several weeks of falls. And the number of cases being diagnosed has also stopped falling. They peaked at just above 25,000 on average in mid-November but have been around the 15,000 mark for the past two weeks. On Thursday, 20,964 more people tested positive for coronavirus and 516 people died in the UK. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Tesco and Morrisons will open their shops on Boxing Day despite calls to give staff the day off. Unions say supermarket staff should not have to go in on 26 December as a thank you for their work during the pandemic Asda, Marks & Spencer, Pets at Home, and toy store The Entertainer have all said they will close. But Tesco and Morrisons have joined Sainsbury's in saying they would open on Boxing Day for a limited number of hours. Tesco said it wouldreward frontline staff with an extra 10% bonus,externalover the Christmas and New Year period. Morrisons said that working on the day would be voluntary with staff getting double pay. Sainsbury's will open but has reduced the hours after requests from staff. It said most workers would have Boxing Day off. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas Supermarkets, which have been are classed as ""essential"" retailers during the pandemic, have seen their sales boom this year. As part of a thank you to staff for their work during the pandemic, Asda said that all of its 631 shops would close for two days over the Christmas break. Frontline staff will also get 100% of their bonus entitlement regardless of whether they have reached sales quotas. Covid: Christmas comes early as grocery sales 'hit record' in November Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said in a message to staff it had been a ""challenging year"" and they had ""done an incredible job"". He also said that many staff would have missed out on spending time with their families and friends due to Covid restrictions. ""This is of course our busiest time of year but it was important for us to give as many of you as possible the opportunity to spend this time with those loved ones that you may not have not seen for many months so, uniquely for this year, we will not reopen our stores until 27 December."" The GMB union said it had been ""requesting Asda to allow their key worker heroes family time over the Christmas period, so we are really pleased they have agreed to our calls."" GMB national officer Roger Jenkins, said: ""It's a shame this is not extra holiday - workers will have to book a day of their annual leave entitlement. ""But it's a step in the right direction and GMB now calls on the rest of the retail sector to follow suit and repay these key workers with a chance to spend Boxing Day with their loved ones."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Usdaw, the union which represents shop workers, has also been calling on all retailers to close their doors on Boxing Day. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said at the end of November: ""With the country facing a crisis unlike any in our lifetime, retail and distribution workers have stepped up and kept food on all of our tables. ""When others stay safe at home, they go out to work. ""The only way they will be guaranteed a decent break at Christmas is if food retailers close for Boxing Day,"" he said. However, supermarket giant Sainsbury's, which has a large network of convenience shops as well as larger outlets, said on Wednesday that its supermarkets would remain open, albeit with reduced hours. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""For colleagues that have requested it, we have made sure they are able to take at least two consecutive days off over Christmas."" Tesco said: ""Our stores are open for reduced hours on Boxing Day. Many of our customers rely on their local stores over Boxing Day - from families in search of essentials, to key workers needing access to food."" A Morrisons spokeswoman said it would open its stores for a limited number of hours on Boxing Day but it was ""working hard to ensure all colleagues get a meaningful break during the Christmas period"". It said anyone who worked on Boxing Day would also get time back in lieu. In November, Marks & Spencer said it would reverse its decision to open on Boxing Day so staff could spend more time with their families. Poundland said earlier in the year that it would stay closed on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, while retailers including Wickes, Pets and Home and the Entertainer have also said they will be closed. John Lewis and Waitrose stores are normally shut on Boxing Day, and will remain so this year.

"Owners of weapons such as knives, knuckle-dusters and rifles are being offered cash to hand them in to police. The Offensive Weapons Act comes into force next year, and items banned under it can be surrendered undera three-month scheme in England and Wales.,external Compensation for lawful owners ranges from Â£2 to Â£5,105 for each item - but the total value of a claim must be at least Â£30. The National Police Chiefs Council said the scheme would make streets safer. It was already illegal to possess a knife or offensive weapon in public, but the new law makes it unlawful to possess certain rapid-firing rifles, specific types of knives and other offensive weapons in private. While the overall scheme applies to England and Wales, compensation will also be offered in Scotland and Northern Ireland but only firearms will be covered by those schemes. The compensation available includes: Â£2 for a knuckle-duster Â£5 for a disguised knife Â£10 for a zombie knife Â£14 for a blowpipe Â£20 for a telescopic truncheon Â£5,105 for a lever release .308 rifle Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse said the weapons in question had ""a high potential for causing harm"". ""Every item surrendered is one which can no longer fall into the hands of criminals,"" he added. Half of calls to Met victim helpline unanswered Police wrongly cancelled serious crime records The Offensive Weapons Act was introduced by the government in response to a spike in serious violence, including knife crime. As well as prohibiting the possession of dangerous weapons in private, it also made it a criminal offence to sell bladed products online without verifying the buyer was aged over 18. Graham McNulty, deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police - who also acts as lead officer on knife crime for the NPCC - said: ""The surrender scheme will enable us to remove dangerous weapons off the streets and assist in keeping our communities safe. ""Every weapon removed is possibly a life saved and I urge people to please help us make our streets safer."" Patrick Green, CEO of the Ben Kinsella Trust, said he welcomed the initiative and urged owners to come forward ""so that these knives can be disposed of in a safe and responsible way"". ""Knuckle-dusters, disguised knives, and zombie knives serve no useful purpose other than to cause harm or kill,"" he said.

"A coalition of news providers and tech companies has pledged to work together to tackle harmful misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. The Trusted News Initiative's members include the BBC, Reuters, Facebook, Google/YouTube and Twitter. The project was set up last year to combat fake news around elections. BBC director general Tim Davie said: ""Whether it's a threat to our health or a threat to our democracy, there is a human cost to disinformation."" He said 2020 had seen ""the rapid spread of harmful disinformation and a growing number of conspiracy theories online"". The project would not prevent ""legitimate concerns"" about vaccines being aired, but would attempt to stop ""harmful disinformation myths"", Mr Davie added. Tim Davie has expressed concerns about disinformation False claims about the vaccines have been rife on social media. The World Health Organization has said the world is fighting an ""infodemic"" as well as a pandemic, with an overload of information - some of it false - making it difficult for people to make decisions about their health. The Trusted News Initiative said its members would alert each other to ""disinformation which poses an immediate threat to life so content can be reviewed promptly by platforms, whilst publishers ensure they don't unwittingly republish dangerous falsehoods"". YouTube, Facebook and Twitter already say they will remove harmful and misleading claims, and the companies are part of another group with fact-checkers, governments and researchers to come up with a new way of tackling misinformation.

"GMP faced ""unprecedented challenges"" during the first Covid lockdown, a senior officer said England's second-largest police force failed to record about 80,000 crimes in a year and closed cases without proper investigation, a watchdog has found. Inspectors said Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"". HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said about 220 crimes a day went unrecorded in the year up to June 2020. Victim support charities said it was ""shocking"" while the Greater Manchester mayor apologised on GMP's behalf. In the 12-month period reviewed by inspectors, it was estimated the force had recorded 77.7% of reported crimes, a drop of 11.3% from 2018. HMIC's report,externalsaid about one in five of all crimes and one in four violent crimes reported to GMP were not recorded. The review also found officers prematurely closed some investigations on the basis the victim did not support police action. Police wrongly cancelled serious crime records Inspector Zoe Billingham said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the frequency of closed cases without a full investigation. ""In too many of these cases, the force did not properly record evidence that the victim supported this decision,"" she said. Inspector Zoe Billingham said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the number of cases closed without full investigation This was particularly evident in cases of domestic abuse, where seven in 10 were closed on this basis, Ms Billingham said. She said it was ""simply not good enough"" that, despite being urged by the watchdog to improve in 2016, ""concerns have not been addressed for over four years"". Ms Billingham did, however, acknowledge the force was taking action and had made a ""marked improvement"" in its recording of serious sexual offences and rapes. A further inspection will take place in six months. Charity Independent Choices said victims of domestic violence were ""extremely vulnerable"" Independent Choices in Greater Manchester said: ""It's extremely shocking for us, as a domestic abuse charity, to hear that 70% of all domestic abuse cases were closed prematurely by GMP."" Jo Roberts, manager of the charity, said: ""Victims of domestic abuse are extremely vulnerable and it takes so much courage to seek help in the first place so it is vital they get the right support and help when they report cases to the police. ""This could discourage victims from reporting incidents in future, potentially putting their lives in danger."" Women's Aid said it was alarmed by the findings too. It was ""crucial"" police and wider justice system listen and respond to the wishes and needs of survivors of domestic violence, Lucy Hadley, head of policy and campaigns said. ""Survivors and our member services continue to make clear that perpetrators of coercive and controlling behaviour are still not being held accountable - and, as today's report shows, a very high proportion of unrecorded crimes in the Greater Manchester Police region involved coercive control."" ""This means that patterns of abuse and harm are not being investigated, and opportunities to support survivors are missed."" Failing to report domestic abuse has ""a knock-on effect for future victims,"" Jane Gregory from the Salford Survivor Project said. The abuse will not be recorded onClare's Law register, she said, ""it may put other victims at risk"". The scheme - named after Clare Wood, 36, from Salford who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend with a record of violence against women in 2009 - allows the police to disclose information on request about a partner's previous history of domestic violence. Sarah Lewis, Greater Manchester Victim Support manager, said: ""We want victims to know we are here to support them regardless of whether they have reported an incident to the police. ""More needs to be done to strengthen victims' trust in the process so that they are not suffering in silence and feel supported and listened to when reporting crimes."" GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the force had ""robust plans"" to address the issues Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said the force was ""disappointed... particularly where we have let victims down"". He said GMP had a long-term ""robust"" strategic plan to address the issues raised and ""secure the best possible outcomes for victims"". The inspection had coincided withthe implementation of a troubled computer systemand ""unprecedented challenges posed by the first Covid lockdown"", he added. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham apologised on behalf of GMP. He said: ""I would like to say sorry to all of the victims of crime who have found that the service has not been good enough. ""We owe it to them to improve and we will and we will do it fast."" The region's deputy mayor for policing Bev Hughes said the findings were ""extremely disappointing"". She added that she had ""communicated my feelings"" to the force's Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, ""who must now move quickly to make improvements"".

"This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""Our negotiators are still working and we will take a decision on Sunday"" UK-EU talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are ""unlikely"" to continue after Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. His comments come after a meeting between Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the Brexit trade deadlock. Mrs von der Leyen said she had a ""good conversation but it is difficult"". The EU has set out the measuresit would take in the event of a no-deal scenario with the UK. The plans aim to ensure that UK and EU air and road connections still run after the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. They also allow the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters for up to a year, or until an agreement is reached. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state."" EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Britons could be barred from EU entry on 1 January Talks between the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier resumed in Brussels on Thursday. The main obstacles continue to be access to fishing waters, rules about subsidising businesses and how any new deal would be policed. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. Speaking in the House of Commons, minister Penny Mordaunt insisted that the UK would ""leave no stone unturned"" and will ""carry on negotiating until there is no hope"". Later on Thursday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the PM to ""get on and deliver"" a deal, adding the outstanding issues ""are capable of resolution"". Asked whether his party would back a deal in a vote in the Commons, he said: ""We will look at it - and we will act in the national interest."" ""But on a straight choice between no deal and deal, then deal is clearly in the national interest,"" he added. Addressing MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""deeply and increasingly concerned"" about a ""lack of clarity"" on what arrangements will apply after 31 December. Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, Mrs von der Leyen said: ""We are willing to grant access to the single market to our British friends - the largest single market in the world - but the conditions have to be fair and they have to be fair for our workers and our companies."" ""This fine balance of fairness has not been achieved so far,"" she said, adding that negotiators were still working and that a decision would be taken on Sunday. The Irish PM, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, said that no one understated the challenges that lie ahead. ""But it's important for the citizens of Europe that we do everything we can to get an agreement here,"" he said. Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said he was more ""gloomy"" about the trade talks following Wednesday night's meeting. This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt told MPs the UK ""cannot accept a deal at any cost"" with the EU. Speaking to the BBC earlier, Mr Raab said: ""We are rapidly approaching the point where we need some finality."" And asked if talks would go beyond Sunday, he said it was ""unlikely"" but added ""never quite say never when you are negotiating with the EU"". Responding toa warning from the Tesco chair that food prices could rise were a deal not to be agreed,Mr Raab acknowledged there could be ""some bumps along the road"" but said he was ""not concerned about either supermarket cupboards running bare or food prices"". What happens if there's no trade deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January The EU statement, published on Thursday morning, outlines some of the plans in place if there is no deal, and it says some sectors would be more affected than others. Provision for air travel, allowing aviation safety certificates, connectivity for road freight and passenger transport for six months, and reciprocal fishing access are included in the document. After 31 December, many things will change regardless of whether or not a deal is reached. UK travellerscould be barredfrom entering the EU from 1 January as travel rules associated with being part of the EU expire and Covid restrictions block entry. In the event of a no-deal scenario, prices of goods could go up - that's because the UK and EU are likely to impose import taxes (known as tariffs) on products crossing the border. There could also be delays at the border as, without an agreement on food standards, freight is more likely to be stopped for checks. A Downing Street spokesman said that the government had put ""extensive preparations"" in place for the end of the transition period to secure supply chains. Asked whether families should ensure their fridges were well stocked at the end of December, the spokesman said: ""We have a resilient supply chain, that will continue to be the case after the transition period ends, whether that's with a free-trade agreement or otherwise.""

"From 1 January, the free movement of people and goods and services between the UK and the EU will end. This means significant differences to how people live, work and travel. Here are some of the most important things that are changing. From January, UK nationals will only be able to travel without a visa toSchengen area countries,externalfor up to 90 days in any 180-day period (this includes most EU nations and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). In addition, you will need to: Have at least six months left on your passport, except for trips to Ireland. Have travel insurance with health cover. Your current EHIC cardwill be valid until its expiry dateand will be replaced by a new scheme in the future, but the government still advises you to get travel insurance with health cover. Make sure you've checked roaming charges with your mobile provider, as theguarantee of free roaming will end. Have obtained an animal health certificate from your vet at least 10 days before you travel -if you are travelling with your pet- including from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The current EU pet passport scheme will no longer apply. Use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens at border control. Significantly, because of the Covid pandemic, travellers from non-EU countries - including the UK - will not be able to visit the EU at the moment, except for a certain number of essential reasons. When the UK was an EU member, you were allowed to bring unlimited amounts of alcohol and tobacco back from an EU country without paying any duty at the border, as long as duty had been paid in the country where you bought it and you could prove it was for your own use. From 2021, duty-free shopping will be available if you travel to the EU, although there will now be limits to the amount you can bring in duty-free from the EU, as there are for arrivals from non-EU countries. The permitted amount of duty-free tobacco and alcoholwill increase,externalhowever. So you will be able, for example, to bring 18 litres of still wine and 42 litres of beer. If you're already living in an EU country, you will have certain protections under thewithdrawal agreement.,external But even then, you shouldcheck that country's specific rules.,externalYou may need to register or apply for residency, get new documents, or meet specific requirements - like having a job. For example, UK nationalsliving in France,externalwill need to obtain new residents' permits. If you plan to move to the EU in 2021, you willno longer have an automatic rightto live, work, study or retire there. You will need a visa if you are going there for any reason other than tourism. The rules will depend on the country you want to move to, and the reason for your move. You shouldcheck the rules,externalfor the country that you are intending to move to. People planning tomove to Ireland,externalwill be largely unaffected. If you're an EU citizen living in the UK by 31 December 2020 - or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland - your rights remain the same until 30 June 2021. But you shouldcheck if you can stay,externalafter that. If you have ""indefinite leave to remain"" or ""indefinite leave to enter"" the UK there's no need for you to do anything. If you don't, you'll need to apply for theEU Settlement Scheme,externalor become aUK citizen,externalif you qualify. Again, because of theCommon Travel Area,,externalrights of Irish citizens will not change. From January, there'll be a newpoints-based system,externalfor foreign citizens (except Irish nationals) wanting to move to the UK. The government says it'll treat EU and non-EU citizens equally and will aim to attract people who can contribute to the UK economy. People wanting to move to the UK to work, live or study will have to apply and pay for a visa. It will costÂ£348 to apply for a student visa from outside the UK,external, or Â£475 to extend or switch one from inside the UK. Applying for a visa as a skilled workerwill cost between Â£610 and Â£1,408 per person,external- unless an individual has skills the country is short of. People applying for visas will also have to pay a health surcharge of Â£624 per person per year, unless they are healthcare workers. How will the UK points-based immigration system work? The UK and the EU have agreed there'll be no taxes on each other's goods when they cross borders and no limits on the amount of things that can be traded. However, traders in England, Wales and Scotland (for the case of Northern Ireland, see below) will need to make customs declarations as if they were dealing with countries elsewhere in the world - this means a lot of paperwork. Some products, including plants, live animals and some foods, will also needspecial licences and certificates,external. Others will have to be labelled in specific ways. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications - people will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualifications are still recognised. And while the UK government has chosen to delay - by six months - the imposition of full controls, the EU will be carrying out checks from 1 January. Even though trade with the EU will become trickier,the UK is free to negotiate its own trade deals with other countries, like the US. Brexit supporters say this will benefit the economy in the long run, although critics say it's more important to remain close to the EU. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal The UK and EU have agreed to keep an all-but-invisible border, without checkpoints, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (which remains in the EU). Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, meaning that lorries can continue to drive across the border without having to be inspected. However, some new checks will be needed on certain goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales) instead. Food products - such as meat, fish and eggs - will need to be checked to ensure they comply with EU standards. However, in order to reduce any potential disruption,supermarkets will be given an initial three-month ""grace period""where the rules will not be enforced on the food they bring into Northern Ireland. Certain meat products will have a longer, six-month grace period. What happens after this period is unclear and will be the subject of future negotiations. An agreement has also been reached to eliminate tariffs - extra charges on goods - for most trade between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland. Some new paperwork will nevertheless be required from 1 January and businesses will need be ready for the changes. What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit?

"The UK economy grew by just 0.4% in October as the recovery continued to slow in the face of tougher coronavirus restrictions. The economy remains well below the size it was before the crisis,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external The UK has been recovering from a record slump earlier this year induced by the first coronavirus lockdown. But output is expected to shrink again in November after England's second shutdown forced businesses to close. October was the sixth consecutive month of growth for the UK after the economy contracted by a record 19.5% in April amid the first lockdown. The economy initially rebounded at a record rate, but growth has now begun to slow - with October's growth figure down from the 1.1% seen in September. The economy also remains fragile, with unemployment continuing to rise. The ONS said there had been some areas of growth during October but the UK economy ""still remains around 8% below its pre-pandemic peak"". Areas of the economy such as education, retail and car manufacturing grew strongly in October, the ONS said. But the reintroduction of some coronavirus restrictions saw services growth almost grind to a halt as pubs and restaurants were hit by the 10pm curfew and other measures. Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak UK unemployment rate continues to surge As services are such a big part of the economy, it meant the UK overall ""grew only modestly"",  the ONS said. Dr Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC, said the latest data ""confirms what we already knew - the economy was slowing ahead of the second national lockdown in November"". ""Overall, there is still a lack of confidence in the economy, with sectors such as accommodation and food the worst affected."" Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. What is GDP and why does it matter? Oliver Conger says 2021 will be challenging Oliver Conger runs Rototherm, a high-end manufacturing firm in Port Talbot with 200 staff. He says Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown, from 23 October to 9 November, was challenging from a mental health perspective as many staff had to start working from home again. ""We have had to take extra care with our people and really think about how we look after them,"" he said. The business itself did not face the supply issues it saw back in March and April and orders have continued to ""creep back up"". But Mr Conger thinks 2021 will be challenging, adding: ""We don't see a lot of things picking back up again until the following year."" The latest figures from the ONS pre-date England's second national lockdown in November, which is likely to have had a big impact on the economy, although less so than the first shutdown. Much of England also remains subject to tough coronavirus curbs, which could affect growth into the new year. ""While a vaccine offers real hope, failure to avoid a disorderly end to the [Brexit] transition period or further lockdown restrictions before a mass vaccine rollout is achieved would severely drag on any economic recovery,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Official forecasts predict the UK economy willshrink by 11.3% this year - the biggest decline in 300 years. The Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster, expects the economy will not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. The UK economy is expected to shrink 11.3% this year, the most in 300 years. Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the recovery could take even longer if the UK fails to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by 31 December. The two sides haveso far failed to break the deadlock in talksand Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was ""unlikely"" the negotiations would be extended beyond Sunday. ""GDP could rise by 6.1% next year in the event we get a Brexit deal, while growth could prove lower at 3.3% if there is no deal with a small recession at the start of the year,"" said Ms Selfin. The government has extended the furlough wage support until the end of March in a bid to avert a jobs crisis, but unemployment is still expected to rise to 2.6 million - or 7.5% - by mid-next year. The most recent unemployment rate - for July to September - was 4.8%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - an increase of 0.7% over the previous three months. Commenting on the October figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""I know people are worried about the winter months, but we will continue to support people through our Plan for Jobs to ensure nobody is left without hope or opportunity."" Anneliese Dodds, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the UK has had the sharpest recession of any G7 economy and was on course for the slowest recovery. ""This is down to the government's irresponsible choices. Its failure to fix test, trace and isolate and chopping and changing over economic support has led to unnecessary job losses and businesses going to the wall."" Growth in economic activity of 0.4% in a month wouldn't be bad in another context; if repeated every month that would mean stellar annual growth (such as we haven't seen in decades) of 4.8%. But we have to remember, the economy this year has done a terrifying bungee jump. After plummeting in the spring, it's bounced since May. In the autumn the bungee cord was slackening. While manufacturing grew in October, services were up just 0.2% - with more activity in sectors such as healthcare offset by accommodation and food, where hotels and restaurants were struggling with the tiering system and 10pm closing. A huge 79% of businesses in that sector reported worse business than last year and in the hardest hit sectors - the travel sector and creative arts and entertainment - business was still less than half its pre-pandemic level. And that's before the renewed lockdown of November in England that is set to cause the UK economy to shrink again. Business lobby group the CBI is now forecasting the economy won't get back to pre-pandemic levels of activity until the end of 2022 - echoing the official OBR projections, which also anticipate that if there's a no-deal Brexit, the economy won't recover fully until 2024.

"A coalition of news providers and tech companies has pledged to work together to tackle harmful misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. The Trusted News Initiative's members include the BBC, Reuters, Facebook, Google/YouTube and Twitter. The project was set up last year to combat fake news around elections. BBC director general Tim Davie said: ""Whether it's a threat to our health or a threat to our democracy, there is a human cost to disinformation."" He said 2020 had seen ""the rapid spread of harmful disinformation and a growing number of conspiracy theories online"". The project would not prevent ""legitimate concerns"" about vaccines being aired, but would attempt to stop ""harmful disinformation myths"", Mr Davie added. Tim Davie has expressed concerns about disinformation False claims about the vaccines have been rife on social media. The World Health Organization has said the world is fighting an ""infodemic"" as well as a pandemic, with an overload of information - some of it false - making it difficult for people to make decisions about their health. The Trusted News Initiative said its members would alert each other to ""disinformation which poses an immediate threat to life so content can be reviewed promptly by platforms, whilst publishers ensure they don't unwittingly republish dangerous falsehoods"". YouTube, Facebook and Twitter already say they will remove harmful and misleading claims, and the companies are part of another group with fact-checkers, governments and researchers to come up with a new way of tackling misinformation.

"""Very large gaps remain"" between the UK and EU, despite a meeting between Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the Brexit trade deadlock, No 10 has said. And Mrs von der Leyen said the two sides were still ""far apart"". Talks between the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost and the EU's Michel Barnier will resume in Brussels. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was ""unlikely"" the negotiations would be extended beyond Sunday. After their meeting, the prime minister and European Commission president ""agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"", a No 10 spokesperson added. And on Thursday morning,the EU set out the measuresit would implement in the event of a no-deal scenario. The plan includes allowing aviation safety certificates to continue to apply to avoid the grounding of aircraft. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Seven things that will change from 1 January The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the evening discussions between Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen had ""plainly gone badly"" and the chances of the UK leaving the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year without a firm arrangement was a ""big step closer"". Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. The dinner was seen as a last-ditch opportunity to work through the main sticking points and for the two sides to try and find some common ground. If at first you don't succeed you can try and try. But eventually, sometimes failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the country towards a different future - a deal that, in theory, would ease the junction from membership of a huge trading bloc to a world outside. There is a chance still that a couple of frantic days could result in a change. The prime minister could decide that after all, the potential disruption of no deal is just too great to risk. The EU president might be able to persuade continental leaders to budge, as they gather in Brussels today. But the chance of reassessing and refreshing the efforts seem now remote. Read more from Laura In a statement, the UK side said there had been ""a frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations"". ""Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged,"" a No 10 spokesperson said. They said the two sides had agreed to further discussions over the next few days, and the PM did ""not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested"". The two negotiators, Lord Frost and Mr Barnier, also attended the three-hour dinner meeting between the two leaders. Who is EU's powerful head Ursula von der Leyen? Brexit food supply fears grow Mrs von der Leyensaid the discussions,externalhad been ""lively and interesting"", and the two sides fully ""understand each other's positions"" but they ""remain far apart"". ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,"" she said. Meanwhilethe UK has signeda free trade deal with Singapore. The agreement is broadly similar to the Southeast Asian country's current arrangement with the EU and will cover a trade relationship worth more than Â£17bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss is now travelling to Vietnam to conclude a trade agreement with that country. The EU, taken as a whole is the UK's largest trading partner, with UK exports to the EU totalling Â£294bn - or 43% of all UK exports - in 2019. Dinner between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen ended as predicted in Brussels - with neither a breakdown, nor a breakthrough in the trade talks impasse. EU diplomats say the bloc is ready to go the extra mile during the next days of negotiations but contrary to the UK government view, the EU thinks the decision - deal or no deal - lies primarily in Downing Street. Brexit isn't on the official discussion agenda at an EU summit starting in Brussels later today, though leaders will be briefed on the negotiations. Attitudes seem to be hardening. ""No deal is better than a bad deal"" is a sentiment you hear both sides of the Channel now. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab said: ""I think we are rapidly approaching the point where we need some finality."" Asked if talks would go beyond Sunday, he said it was ""unlikely"" but added ""never quite say never when you are negotiating with the EU"". Responding toa warning from the Tesco chair that food prices could rise were a deal not to be agreed,Mr Raab acknowledged there could be ""some bumps along the road"" but said he was ""not concerned about either supermarket cupboards running bare or food prices"". The Confederation of British Industry said the cost of no deal was ""significant"". Its director-general, Tony Danker, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The difference between a deal and no deal is incredibly real in GDP [gross domestic product] terms, it's incredibly real for businesses - particularly in certain sectors - so we have to be in 'getting to yes' mode."" This video can not be played Dominic Raab says it's 'unlikely' negotiations will be extended beyond Sunday Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the prime minister had ""completely failed"" to deliver the ""oven-ready"" deal he had promised at the last election. ""The failure to deliver the deal he promised is his and his alone,"" she said. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson said the oven-ready deal he was referring to was the withdrawal agreement, or divorce deal, rather than a trade deal. SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford tweeted: ""A no deal would be a massive failure of diplomacy and leadership which Boris Johnson has to take ownership of."" Meanwhile, Tory Brexiteer MP John Baron said the PM deserved praise for ""standing firm"" rather than compromising in a rush to agree a deal. ""We must remember a trade deal is for keeps, not just for Christmas,"" he said. ""We all want a deal, but it has to be a good deal because as we've said many times before, no deal is better than a bad deal."" Speaking before he left for Brussels, Mr Johnson said the EU was insisting on terms ""no prime minister could accept"" in relation to access to UK fishing waters and retaliatory measures if the UK diverged from EU standards. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. Any deal also has to be ratified by the European Parliament and win the backing of MPs at Westminster.

"""Very large gaps remain"" between the UK and EU, despite a meeting between Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the Brexit trade deadlock, No 10 has said. And Mrs von der Leyen said the two sides were still ""far apart"". Talks between the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost and the EU's Michel Barnier will resume in Brussels. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was ""unlikely"" the negotiations would be extended beyond Sunday. After their meeting, the prime minister and European Commission president ""agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"", a No 10 spokesperson added. And on Thursday morning,the EU set out the measuresit would implement in the event of a no-deal scenario. The plan includes allowing aviation safety certificates to continue to apply to avoid the grounding of aircraft. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Seven things that will change from 1 January The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the evening discussions between Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen had ""plainly gone badly"" and the chances of the UK leaving the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year without a firm arrangement was a ""big step closer"". Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. The dinner was seen as a last-ditch opportunity to work through the main sticking points and for the two sides to try and find some common ground. If at first you don't succeed you can try and try. But eventually, sometimes failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the country towards a different future - a deal that, in theory, would ease the junction from membership of a huge trading bloc to a world outside. There is a chance still that a couple of frantic days could result in a change. The prime minister could decide that after all, the potential disruption of no deal is just too great to risk. The EU president might be able to persuade continental leaders to budge, as they gather in Brussels today. But the chance of reassessing and refreshing the efforts seem now remote. Read more from Laura In a statement, the UK side said there had been ""a frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations"". ""Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged,"" a No 10 spokesperson said. They said the two sides had agreed to further discussions over the next few days, and the PM did ""not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested"". The two negotiators, Lord Frost and Mr Barnier, also attended the three-hour dinner meeting between the two leaders. Who is EU's powerful head Ursula von der Leyen? Brexit food supply fears grow Mrs von der Leyensaid the discussions,externalhad been ""lively and interesting"", and the two sides fully ""understand each other's positions"" but they ""remain far apart"". ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,"" she said. Meanwhilethe UK has signeda free trade deal with Singapore. The agreement is broadly similar to the Southeast Asian country's current arrangement with the EU and will cover a trade relationship worth more than Â£17bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss is now travelling to Vietnam to conclude a trade agreement with that country. The EU, taken as a whole is the UK's largest trading partner, with UK exports to the EU totalling Â£294bn - or 43% of all UK exports - in 2019. Dinner between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen ended as predicted in Brussels - with neither a breakdown, nor a breakthrough in the trade talks impasse. EU diplomats say the bloc is ready to go the extra mile during the next days of negotiations but contrary to the UK government view, the EU thinks the decision - deal or no deal - lies primarily in Downing Street. Brexit isn't on the official discussion agenda at an EU summit starting in Brussels later today, though leaders will be briefed on the negotiations. Attitudes seem to be hardening. ""No deal is better than a bad deal"" is a sentiment you hear both sides of the Channel now. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab said: ""I think we are rapidly approaching the point where we need some finality."" Asked if talks would go beyond Sunday, he said it was ""unlikely"" but added ""never quite say never when you are negotiating with the EU"". Responding toa warning from the Tesco chair that food prices could rise were a deal not to be agreed,Mr Raab acknowledged there could be ""some bumps along the road"" but said he was ""not concerned about either supermarket cupboards running bare or food prices"". The Confederation of British Industry said the cost of no deal was ""significant"". Its director-general, Tony Danker, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The difference between a deal and no deal is incredibly real in GDP [gross domestic product] terms, it's incredibly real for businesses - particularly in certain sectors - so we have to be in 'getting to yes' mode."" This video can not be played Dominic Raab says it's 'unlikely' negotiations will be extended beyond Sunday Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the prime minister had ""completely failed"" to deliver the ""oven-ready"" deal he had promised at the last election. ""The failure to deliver the deal he promised is his and his alone,"" she said. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson said the oven-ready deal he was referring to was the withdrawal agreement, or divorce deal, rather than a trade deal. SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford tweeted: ""A no deal would be a massive failure of diplomacy and leadership which Boris Johnson has to take ownership of."" Meanwhile, Tory Brexiteer MP John Baron said the PM deserved praise for ""standing firm"" rather than compromising in a rush to agree a deal. ""We must remember a trade deal is for keeps, not just for Christmas,"" he said. ""We all want a deal, but it has to be a good deal because as we've said many times before, no deal is better than a bad deal."" Speaking before he left for Brussels, Mr Johnson said the EU was insisting on terms ""no prime minister could accept"" in relation to access to UK fishing waters and retaliatory measures if the UK diverged from EU standards. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. Any deal also has to be ratified by the European Parliament and win the backing of MPs at Westminster. The House of Commons could sit as late as Christmas Eve should it be required to look at a Brexit deal, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said. Under current plans, the Commons will stop sitting on 21 December, but he told Sky News the recess could be delayed. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns of a ""worrying"" rise in cases in London, Kent and Essex Mass testing will be rolled out for secondary school-aged children in that age group in the worst affected parts of those regions He warns at a Downing Street press conference that ""the fight is not over"" and urges: ""Don't blow it now"" The UK's economic recovery slowed in October - rising 0.4% on the month against a backdrop of rising Covid cases Canada joins the UK in approving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine The United States records more than 3,000 deaths in the latest 24-hour period - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world South Africa, the worst hit country in Africa, enters a second wave of the pandemic as it registers 7,000 new cases on Wednesday Ministers in Northern Ireland are due to meet later before the end of a two-week lockdown on Friday There have been 68.9m cases and 1.56m deaths worldwide, figures from Johns Hopkins University show Edited by Rob Corp We are now closing our live coverage. Today's live coverage was brought to you by: Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Lauren Turner, Jennifer Scott, Sarah Fowler and Rob Corp. Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest in coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. We'll be closing the live page for the day shortly. But before we do, here's a recap of the main headlines. Cabin crews in China are being advised to wear diapers for flights to high-risk coronavirus countries and to avoid using the toilet to reduce the chance of infection. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"GMP faced ""unprecedented challenges"" during the first Covid lockdown, a senior officer said England's second-largest police force failed to record about 80,000 crimes in a year and closed cases without proper investigation, a watchdog has found. Inspectors said Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"". HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said about 220 crimes a day went unrecorded in the year up to June 2020. Victim support charities said it was ""shocking"" while the Greater Manchester mayor apologised on GMP's behalf. In the 12-month period reviewed by inspectors, it was estimated the force had recorded 77.7% of reported crimes, a drop of 11.3% from 2018. HMIC's report,externalsaid about one in five of all crimes and one in four violent crimes reported to GMP were not recorded. The review also found officers prematurely closed some investigations on the basis the victim did not support police action. Police wrongly cancelled serious crime records Inspector Zoe Billingham said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the frequency of closed cases without a full investigation. ""In too many of these cases, the force did not properly record evidence that the victim supported this decision,"" she said. Inspector Zoe Billingham said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the number of cases closed without full investigation This was particularly evident in cases of domestic abuse, where seven in 10 were closed on this basis, Ms Billingham said. She said it was ""simply not good enough"" that, despite being urged by the watchdog to improve in 2016, ""concerns have not been addressed for over four years"". Ms Billingham did, however, acknowledge the force was taking action and had made a ""marked improvement"" in its recording of serious sexual offences and rapes. A further inspection will take place in six months. Charity Independent Choices said victims of domestic violence were ""extremely vulnerable"" Independent Choices in Greater Manchester said: ""It's extremely shocking for us, as a domestic abuse charity, to hear that 70% of all domestic abuse cases were closed prematurely by GMP."" Jo Roberts, manager of the charity, said: ""Victims of domestic abuse are extremely vulnerable and it takes so much courage to seek help in the first place so it is vital they get the right support and help when they report cases to the police. ""This could discourage victims from reporting incidents in future, potentially putting their lives in danger."" Women's Aid said it was alarmed by the findings too. It was ""crucial"" police and wider justice system listen and respond to the wishes and needs of survivors of domestic violence, Lucy Hadley, head of policy and campaigns said. ""Survivors and our member services continue to make clear that perpetrators of coercive and controlling behaviour are still not being held accountable - and, as today's report shows, a very high proportion of unrecorded crimes in the Greater Manchester Police region involved coercive control."" ""This means that patterns of abuse and harm are not being investigated, and opportunities to support survivors are missed."" Failing to report domestic abuse has ""a knock-on effect for future victims,"" Jane Gregory from the Salford Survivor Project said. The abuse will not be recorded onClare's Law register, she said, ""it may put other victims at risk"". The scheme - named after Clare Wood, 36, from Salford who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend with a record of violence against women in 2009 - allows the police to disclose information on request about a partner's previous history of domestic violence. Sarah Lewis, Greater Manchester Victim Support manager, said: ""We want victims to know we are here to support them regardless of whether they have reported an incident to the police. ""More needs to be done to strengthen victims' trust in the process so that they are not suffering in silence and feel supported and listened to when reporting crimes."" GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the force had ""robust plans"" to address the issues Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said the force was ""disappointed... particularly where we have let victims down"". He said GMP had a long-term ""robust"" strategic plan to address the issues raised and ""secure the best possible outcomes for victims"". The inspection had coincided withthe implementation of a troubled computer systemand ""unprecedented challenges posed by the first Covid lockdown"", he added. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham apologised on behalf of GMP. He said: ""I would like to say sorry to all of the victims of crime who have found that the service has not been good enough. ""We owe it to them to improve and we will and we will do it fast."" The region's deputy mayor for policing Bev Hughes said the findings were ""extremely disappointing"". She added that she had ""communicated my feelings"" to the force's Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, ""who must now move quickly to make improvements"".

"A teenager given a tent to live in, and a child denied the chance to say ""goodbye"" to his dying mother feature in a report revealing heart-breaking decisions about children in care. The watchdog report also includes a case of siblings abruptly removed from a foster family wanting to adopt them. Another details how a fostered girl returned home to find her bags packed and a taxi to a hostel waiting for her. The cases are revealed by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman. Ombudsman Michael King said even one case like this was one too many, and urged all councils, when making decisions about children in their care, to ask: ""Would this decision be good enough for my child?"" None of the councils in England are named in the report. Cathy Ashley, of the Family Rights Group, said such poor decisions could be ""so damaging at a critical moment in the lives of children in care or at risk of care"". With the number of children in care at its highest for 35 years, and the pandemic increasing the pressure and strain on families and on children's services, this was very concerning, she said. The report - Careless: Helping to improve council services to children in care -  looks at the journey of children coming into care, creating stability, contact arrangements and eventually leaving care. It uses a litany of real life case studies. whose names have been changed to protect their identities, to show where things have gone wrong. One case featured was Albert who was 11 and living with foster parents, when he was told his birth mother had died. Four years later, during a review meeting, Albert learned his mother had been seriously ill and on life support. This was switched off without him being told, thus denying him the opportunity to visit her before she died. He also complained about the use of insensitive language and the way in which the information was shared with him. The council upheld the complaint. The ombudsman said young children needed to be able to understand the decisions being made by their corporate parents. The case of Billy, a vulnerable and troubled 17-year-old who was thrown out of his home by his father, is also highlighted The unnamed council offered him accommodation, but far from where he usually lived. Then rather than consider whether it should accommodate Billy nearer, the council gave him a tent to live in, followed by a static caravan. Billy's mental and physical health seriously deteriorated during his ordeal, and shortly afterwards, he was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 where he remained for nearly a year, the ombudsman said. It added: ""The council had seriously failed Billy by not offering him suitable accommodation under section 20 of the Children Act 1989."" The council awarded Billy Â£2,500 for the distress they caused and for placing him at risk. In another case, Tim and Nikki fostered two particularly vulnerable children when their birth parents were no longer able to look after them. After two years, the couple told the council they wished to adopt the children. But the council questioned the amount of money the couple requested to help them support these needy children, and they were also concerned about the children's academic progress. The council decided the children should be removed from Tim and Nikki's care without notice. There was no statutory meeting or evidence to support the council's claim about the foster parents. Social workers then collected the children from school and told them Tim and Nikki had gone on holiday. The ombudsman said: ""In this case, we used our powers to also consider the injustice the children suffered.  We found the children would have been harmed by the sudden removal from the home. ""While, happily, they were found another foster placement which became long term, the way the council acted denied them the chance to voice their own wishes on the matter,"" it said. Ms Ashley added: ""Putting the voices and experiences of children and families at the centre is key to getting this right."" President of the Association of Directors of Children's Services Jenny Coles said there had been a 34% increase in the number of children in care over the past decade, and that the availability of placements for children in care was a key issue for the majority of councils. He said; ""It is important that local authorities learn from their successes and also where things have gone wrong. ""The case studies in the report provide an opportunity for the sector to learn and subsequently improve practice.""

"Google has been fined 100 million euros (Â£91m) in France for breaking the country's rules on online advertising trackers known as cookies. It is the largest fine ever issued by the French data privacy watchdog CNIL. US retail giant Amazon was also fined 35 million euros for breaking the rules. CNIL said Google and Amazon's French websites had not sought visitors' consent before advertising cookies were saved on their computers. Google and Amazon also failed to provide clear information about how the online trackers would be used, and how visitors to the French websites could refuse the cookies, the regulator said. It has given the tech giants three months to change the information banners displayed on their websites. If they do not comply, they will be fined a further 100,000 euros per day until the changes are made. In a statement published by Reuters, Google said: ""We stand by our record of providing upfront information and clear controls, strong internal data governance, secure infrastructure, and above all, helpful products. ""Today's decision under French ePrivacy laws overlooks these efforts and doesn't account for the fact that French rules and regulatory guidance are uncertain and constantly evolving."" Amazon said it disagreed with the CNIL decision, ""We continuously update our privacy practices to ensure that we meet the evolving needs and expectations of customers and regulators and fully comply with all applicable laws in every country in which we operate,"" it said in a statement. In a separate case, Google is being probed by a UK regulator over its plans to change the way the Chrome browser handles cookies. Google wants to stop advertisers using cookies to track users as they move around the web from one site to another when using Chrome, in a bid to improve privacy. It plans to introduce an alternative system know as the Privacy Sandbox that will only provide anonymised feedback. A group of about a dozen small tech companies and publishers has lodged a complaint with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) claiming this would damage their businesses.

"This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs As President Donald Trump's days in the White House wane, his administration has been racing through a string of federal executions. Five people have been executed in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's 20 January inauguration - breaking with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. They make Mr Trump the country's most prolific execution president in more than a century, overseeing the executions of 13 death row inmates since July of this year. The five executions began with convicted killer 40-year-old Brandon Bernard who was put to death at a penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. They ended with the death of Dustin Higgs, 48, at the same site on 16 January. Bernard apologises to victims' family before execution Attorney General William Barr has said his justice department is simply upholding existing law. But critics have said the move is concerning, coming just weeks before Mr Biden - who has said he will seek to end the death penalty - takes office. Attorney General Barr has ordered five executions during the presidential transition period ""This is really outside the norm, in a pretty extreme way,"" said Ngozi Ndulue, director of research at the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center. US resumption of federal executions criticised How many countries still have the death penalty? US inmate has 'no right to painless death' Here's what you need to know about President Trump's last-minute rush of executions. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1988, executions carried out by the national or federal government in the US have remained rare. Before Mr Trump took office, only three federal executions had taken place in this period. All were carried out under Republican President George W Bush, and included inmate Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. Since 2003, there have been no federal executions at all. Most federal executions take place here, at the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex in Indiana US states have continued to execute inmates in state prisons, putting 22 death row inmates to death last year. But state executions are also on a downward trend. A growing number have moved to abolish capital punishment altogether, and the majority have either formally banned the practice or have not put any inmates to death in more than a decade. Popular opinion, too, has shifted away from capital punishment. A November 2019 Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans supported life in prison over the death penalty for the first time since the survey began more than 30 years ago. ""Public support for the death penalty is at a decades-long low,"" Ms Ndulue said. Further problems have emerged with the methods of execution, sourcing drugs used for lethal injections, and the costs of decades-long court battles and appeals. In July 2019, Mr Barr announced the scheduled executions of five death row prisoners, despite prevailing practices and public opinion. ""Congress has expressly authorised the death penalty,"" the country's top legal official said in a statement at the time. ""The justice department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."" The selected inmates had been convicted of murdering or raping children and the elderly, Mr Barr said. The move drew fierce criticism from top Democrats and human rights groups. ""We feel [the death penalty] is an unconstitutionally arbitrary punishment that should have been abolished decades ago,"" said Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NCAAP Legal Defense Fund. This video can not be played The women who write to death row inmates And the particular selection of inmates fuelled charges that the decision was politically motivated. The first set of executions this summer - during a wave of anti-racism protests and demonstrations - were all of white men. Four of these five prisoners put to death were African American. Ms Ndulue said she didn't think it was ""coincidental"" that no black prisoners were scheduled for execution during a period of ""enhanced awareness of the racial disparities around the federal death penalty"". Research suggests the death penalty has been enforced differently according to race. ""One of the most robust findings of study after study, in jurisdictions across the country, is that the race of your victim is a serious factor in determining whether or not you will have the death penalty,"" Ms Ndulue said. The 10 inmates executed in 2020 have led to a single-year total unmatched in modern history. ""We'd have to go back to 1896 to find another year where there were 10 or more executions,"" Ms Ndulue said. Campaigners are seeking to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution The Trump administration has also chosen to carry out federal executions in the midst of a political transition, with a lame-duck president, for the first time in more than a century. Incumbent presidents have typically deferred to their successors, allowing presidents-elect to set the course. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr Barr defended the post-election executions. ""I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,"" he said. ""But if you ask juries to impose it, then it should be carried out."" But it is a controversial choice, especially as the incoming Biden administration has said it will work to end the death penalty. Bernard's execution had drawn particular attention. Convicted of murder and kidnapping in 1999, Bernard was 18 at the time of his offence, and would be the youngest offender executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Five of the nine surviving jurors in the case, as well as the US attorney who defended the death sentence on appeal, had publicly called for his execution to be stopped. Kim Kardashian also weighed in, making a direct appeal to Mr Trump on Twitter. Mr Trump has been a long-time, vocal advocate of the death penalty. The Biden team is opposed. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, in particular, has been a consistent critic of the practice. She took a stand against capital punishment in her successful 2003 campaign for San Francisco District Attorney and declined to seek the death penalty in the murder of a 29-year-old police officer, killed in the line of duty - despite pressure from within her party. Then-Senator Joe Biden expressed support for the death penalty in the 1990s. The president-elect's record is more uneven. Mr Biden's 1994 crime bill added some 60 federal crimes for which someone could be put to death. Some of those on death row today were convicted under provisions of his legislation. Now, he has promised to push for legislation eliminating federal executions entirely, and to encourage states to do the same. The Biden team has noted that more than 160 individuals sentenced to death in the US since 1973 have later been exonerated. Mr Biden has yet to name his choice for US attorney general. Alfred Bourgeoiswas on death row for torturing and beating his two-year-old daughter to death. He was executed on 11 December. An earlier execution date was stayed by a federal judge due to evidence from Bourgeois' legal team showing he had an intellectual disability. This ruling was overturned in October. Lisa Montgomerystrangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. She was executed on 12 January. Her lawyers said she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and suffers from serious mental illness. She was the first woman to face federal execution in the US since 1953. Cory Johnsonwas convicted for the murder of seven people, related to his involvement with the drug trade in Richmond, Virginia. Johnson's legal team argued that he suffered from an intellectual disability, related to physical and emotional abuse he experienced as a child. He was executed on 14 January. Dustin John Higgswas convicted in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three young women in the Washington, DC area. Higgs did not kill any of his victims. His co-defendant Willis Haynes did, after being instructed to by Higgs. Haynes has said in court documents that Higgs did not threaten him, or force him to shoot. Higgs was executed on 15 January.

"Rhiannon Davies, pictured with daughter Kate, campaigned for a review into maternity care Mothers were blamed for their babies' deaths and a large number of women died in labour at a scandal-hit maternity unit, a review has found. The inquiry into Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS (SaTH) trust found deaths were often not investigated and an induction drug was repeatedly misused. Rhiannon Davies said she never doubted what happened with her daughter Kate. Seven ""immediate and essential"" actions have been made for all maternity services across England. The chief executive of SaTH said they ""commit to implementing all of the report's actions"". The review began in 2018 following campaigns led by two families. Richard Stanton and Ms Davies' daughter Kate died hours afterher birth in March 2009, while Kayleigh and Colin Griffiths' daughter Pippa died in 2016 from aGroup B Streptococcus infection. This video can not be played WATCH: The parents of babies Kate and Pippa talk about the pain of losing their child The interim report lists numerous traumatic birth experiences including the deaths of babies due to excessive force of forceps and stillbirths that could have been avoided. Others recount repeated failures by staff to recognise mothers and babies in deteriorating conditions, including one mother whose baby died because staff were ""too busy"" to monitor her during labour. 'She knows it makes Mummy sad' Baby deaths trust 'normalises poor care' Investigation of maternity deaths 'too late' It found letters and records ""which often focused on blaming the mothers"" rather than considering whether the trust's systems were at fault. This was exacerbated by the attitude of staff, the report said. It said: ""One of the most disappointing and deeply worrying themes that has emerged is the reported lack of kindness and compassion from some members of the maternity team. ""The fact that this was found to be lackingâ¦ is unacceptable and deeply concerning."" In Junepolice launched an investigationto examine if there was evidence to support a criminal case against the trust or any individuals involved. Following the publication of the report, Geoff Wessell, Assistant Chief Constable for West Mercia Police, said their investigation has been running concurrently with the review and remains ongoing. Donna Ockenden, a senior midwife, is leading the review The inquiry - the largest ever of NHS maternity care - is being led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden and is looking into 1,862 cases and initially examined 250 cases. It looked at a selection of cases between 2000 and 2018 and found there were 13 maternal deaths, a rate that is disproportionately high. While the report said the women were often correctly identified as being ""high risk"" due to existing medical conditions, little concrete action appeared to follow with junior doctors conducting assessments and no team working to ensure best care. After each death ""in some cases, no investigation was initiated"" whilst in others ""no learning appears to have been identified."" The report said ""inappropriate language had been used at times causing distress,"" and there were cases ""where women were blamed for their loss and this further compounded their grief."" Ms Davies' daughter Kate was born ""pale and floppy"" at Ludlow Community Hospital and died after delays in transferring her from Ludlow to a doctor-led maternity unit. She has fought for a review for 11 years and said: ""I may sound arrogant but I've never doubted my surety of what happened with Kate. ""I knew I was right. The interim findings will hopefully bring this essential change, critically required change, change this trust has not been able to see it needs to embed and that will hopefully ensure patient safety improves and that is the only reason we've continued."" Pippa Griffiths died at one day old after contracting meningitis from a Group B Strep infection Her husband Richard said: ""I think it's really important that the interim findings go someway to imposing emergency recommendations which are clearly needed at this point to improve maternity care, no family should have to go through what me and Rhiannon and all the others have gone through. ""We just wanted to get to the truth."" The reports lists 27 actions the trust must immediately carry out. Ms Ockenden said: ""Today we are explaining in this first report local actions for learning and immediate and essential actions which we believe will improve maternity care, not only at this trust but across England so that the experiences women and families have described to us are not replicated elsewhere. The work that follows ""owes its origins to Kate Stanton-Davies and her parents"", Ms Ockenden said. She added Kate and Pippa's parents have shown ""an unrelenting commitment in ensuring their daughter's short lives made a difference to the safety of maternity care"". Mrs Griffiths, Pippa's mother said: ""It's not acceptable... you have to pick those failures up, you have to own them and you have to make improvements."" This is not a dry report - its pages scream with the voices of the families who have been needlessly harmed. I've heard many of these stories over the years, having spoken to dozens of families, but to read it in black and white, was still a sobering moment. The review's publication also draws a firm line under the pretence that successive poor, weak leaders of the organisation maintained until recently, namely that the trust was no worse than others. They are worse, much worse, and have been for years. The alphabet soup of NHS organisations that were meant to protect these families - the inspectors, the regulators, the commissioners - have a lot of questions to answer too. Their repeated refusal to see what was happening, despite being told of the problems, is just as shaming as the trust's stance. Their moment of reckoning will come next year, when the final report is published. Conservative MP for Telford Lucy Allan said the findings of the review were ""deeply harrowing"". Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who ordered an inquiry in 2017, tweeted: ""This is a tragic day for families across Shropshire who've had it confirmed in black & white that hundreds of babies died needlessly.""

Louise Barnett, the trust's chief executive, said: ""I want to say how very sorry we are for the pain and distress that has been caused to mothers and their families due to poor maternity care at our trust. ""We commit to implementing all of the actions in this report and I can assure the women and families who use our service that if they raise any concerns about their care they will be listened to and action will be taken."" The seven actions outlined for maternity services across England include: Enhanced safety, listening to women and families, staff training and working together, managing complex pregnancy, risk assessment throughout pregnancy and Monitoring fetal wellbeing.

"Joe Biden (right) is ""deeply proud"" of Hunter Biden (left), the president-elect's transition team says US President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter has said his tax affairs are under investigation. The investigation is being conducted by federal prosecutors in Delaware. US media quote sources saying it relates to business dealings with foreign countries including China. Hunter Biden said he was confident he would be shown to have done no wrong. The Biden-Harris transition team said the president-elect was ""deeply proud of his son"". A statement from the team said Hunter had ""fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger"". The 50-year-old said he had learned of the investigation on Tuesday. He did not disclose any further details. ""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisers,"" he said. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Hunter Biden's Ukraine work 'problematic', says report Reports say the investigation was begun in 2018, before Joe Biden announced his bid for the presidency. Hunter Biden was a frequent target of Republican criticism during the 2020 election campaign, focusing on his business dealings in Ukraine and China when Joe Biden was vice-president in the Barack Obama administration. Last December, President Donald Trump was impeached by the Democratic-run House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. But Mr Trump was cleared by the Republican-held Senate in February. The new investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs comes as his father assembles his cabinet. If the case is still ongoing when Mr Biden is sworn into office next month, his pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation, AP notes. The presidential election is over, but it seems President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter - a regular target of Republican attacks during the campaign - is going to stay in the news. The revelation that Hunter is under tax investigation is not entirely surprising. There have been hints of such an inquiry for months. With official confirmation, however, comes further scrutiny - and potential political headaches for the president-elect. If Republicans maintain control of the US Senate, hearings into Hunter's finances - and any ties to President Biden - are a foregone conclusion. And if the investigation turns into formal charges, political concerns for the Biden family could turn into very real legal ones. While Donald Trump's critics will be quick to accuse the outgoing president of orchestrating this investigation as political reprisal, the US attorney behind it - David Weiss of Delaware - is a veteran prosecutor. Although he was appointed by the current president, Weiss also worked as a deputy in the office, and as interim US attorney, during Democrat Barack Obama's presidency. Hunter Biden, in a statement, says he acted ""legally and appropriately"". If so, this matter will eventually fade from view. Being under the federal criminal microscope, however, is never a pleasant affair.

"UK travellers could be barred from entering the EU from 1 January as travel rules associated with being part of the EU expire and pandemic restrictions block entry. Unrestricted travel to countries within the bloc will no longer automatically apply to UK residents from then. This means entry into the EU would then be based on essential travel only. Currently only countries with low coronavirus infection rates qualify for non-essential travel. There are only eight countries with low Covid rates that are on the approved list for free travel and there are currently no plans to add the UK to that list. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Today programme that Covid restrictions would depend on what the EU and its member states decide. He added that ""restrictions on travel, inevitably, is going to be something that's kept under review"". EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Brexit talks 'unlikely' to go beyond Sunday - Raab With talks about a trade deal between the UK and the EU still continuing, there is a possibility this could change. Alternatively, individual member state countries could decide to override the EU rules and create a corridor with the UK. At the moment, the UK is considered to have the same status by the EU as countries such as Norway and Switzerland, which are members of the European Free Trade Association, travel expert Simon Calder told the BBC. Mr Calder said that many regions dependent on tourism, such as the Canary Islands, may well make an exemption for British tourists, ""but there's no obligation to at the moment"". Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, agreed, saying: ""Cool heads need to prevail at this politically difficult time as travel and tourism is such a key contributor to economic growth in Europe. ""I'm sure that individual countries who need UK tourism will be sensible and override any EU-bloc decision which prevents entry. It is so important now for countries to work together globally to create a consistent approach."" A spokesperson for airline EasyJet said: ""There is no EU blanket law which requires individual states to limit entry from those arriving from outside the EU and so just as they do today, we expect individual European countries to continue to apply their own rules."" British Airways declined to comment. By Simon Browning, BBC business reporter It might come as a big surprise that UK travellers could be barred from entering the EU after 31 December. Remember - Europe is our top holiday destination with more of us going to Spain than any other country. But with infection rates still rising, countries have to do what they can to protect themselves and now we're out of the EU, we have to follow new rules. Travel corridors, set up in the summer to help travellers bypass quarantine with countries with low infection rates, could come back. They've operated between individual EU countries like Spain, France and Italy before, and could return so individual countries can welcome lucrative UK holidaymakers to spend their pounds in hotels, bars and restaurants. But for now, yes, we could be barred. However, this scenario could also be negotiated away as part of the talks that go on until Sunday. A spokesman for ABTA, the travel industry trade body, said: ""The EU has sought to adopt a common approach to travel restrictions, but this is only a recommendation and individual countries are able to implement their own measures, including options like travel corridors and testing."" ""It is too early to say what restrictions might be in place on 1 January given the uncertain nature of the pandemic, but we know that UK travellers are hugely important to a number of EU destinations, including some winter sun favourites like the Canary Islands and Madeira."" A spokesman for Airlines UK said: ""We expect EU member states that gain enormously from the tourism and air travel from the UK, and the billions of pounds it generates, to continue to apply their own rules, in order to provide certainty to consumers and families looking to travel to the EU from January onwards."" Norway, which is part of the EU travel arrangement, said British citizens who do not live in the country will be barred from entering the country from 1 January, theFinancial Times,externalnewspaper reported.

"Singapore and the UK signed a free trade deal in the Southeast Asian city-state on Thursday. The deal will cover a trade relationship worth more than $22bn (Â£17bn). The agreement largely mirrors an existing deal between Singapore and the European Union (EU). It is part of a broader set of trade negotiations for the UK, as it tries to replicate trade pacts which will cease when the EU transition period ends. Explaining the world's biggest trade deal Covid forces Davos forum to move to Singapore How many trade deals has the UK done so far? Britain's secretary of state of international trade, Liz Truss, and Singapore's trade minister, Chan Chun Sing, signed the deal at a ceremony in Singapore. The deal comes as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the European Union's chief executive gave themselves until the end of the weekend to seal a new trade pact, following a three-hour dinner that left the two sides ""far apart"". The agreement removes tariffs and gives both countries access to each other's markets in services. It will also cut non-tariff barriers for electronics, cars and vehicle parts, pharmaceutical products, medical devices and renewable energy generation. Duties will be eliminated by November 2024, the same timeline as the pact between the EU and Singapore. ""Beyond the significant benefits to our respective businesses, the (deal) is a strong statement against protectionism and nativism,"" said Mr Chan. He added that it will be ""crucial in ensuring a strong and resilient post-pandemic recovery for the world"". This video can not be played A deal with the EU can't come ""at any price,"" says Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove The deal will be important for Singapore, which counts Britain among its top trading partners for goods and services globally, and its top investment destination in Europe. The agreement is also the UK's first with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The 10-country bloc is home to 650 million people and, prior to the pandemic, was a key growth region.

"Hilda Hubbard, known as Frances, was found dead at the retirement bungalow she shared with her husband of 50 years A woman killed by her husband was believed to have never experienced domestic abuse before, a report found. Hilda Hubbard was repeatedly stabbed by her husband Michael, who had dementia, at their Norfolk bungalow in September 2018. The pair had been happy, riding in a scooter and sidecar they had called ""Wallace and Gromit"", the report said. The Domestic Homicide Review,externalsaid there were ""many examples of good practice"" by professionals involved with them. Mr Hubbard was later detained in a secure mental health unit after he was found to beunfit to stand trial over the death of his wife, to whom he had been married for 50 years. Neighbours rang 999 after they saw Mr Hubbard standing in the doorway of their home in Brooke, near Norwich, with his wife, known as Frances, lying on the ground. Police fired a rubber bullet at the pensioner, who was 81 at the time, before taking him to hospital and later charging him with murder. The review into her death, which does not use the couple's real names, was carried out to examine what could be learned from the case. It looked at the roles of organisations involved with the couple from July 2014, when Mr Hubbard first raised concerns about his memory loss. Floral tributes were left for Mrs Hubbard, who, with her husband was described as ""community-minded"" The ""community-minded"" and ""traditional"" couple were described as ""very private"", ""self-sufficient"" and ""proud"" of their children who both achieved master's degrees. Mr Hubbard was forced to retire at the age of 43 after suffering health problems from breaking his back when he was 20. ""Life didn't turn out for either of them as they had expected, but they eventually won through and made an enviable life for themselves,"" their daughter told the report's author. The couple became even more private following Mr Hubbard's diagnosis in 2014, and Mrs Hubbard - as her husband 's carer - had refused offers of support, the report said. In summary, it found there had been ""notable practice"" by their GP, social housing provider and police, after an officer was called to them the day before Mrs Hubbard's death regarding a theft allegation. It said the examples should be reinforced and shared across Norfolk and made a number of other recommendations.

"Talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen failed to break the deadlock The EU has published contingency plans in case of the possible collapse of Brexit trade talks with the UK. The plans aim to ensure smooth UK-EU air and road travel,external, as well as allowing the possibility of fishing access to each other's waters. They come aftertalks between UK PM Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyenaimed at ending a deadlock over the deal ended without agreement. The UK is due to stop following EU trading rules on 31 December. The UK left the EU at the end of January this year, but a transition period of 11 months followed to allow the two sides to try to negotiate a deal. The commission said the application of the proposed measures would, in some cases, depend on the UK reciprocating and accepting certain terms. 'Large gaps' remain after crucial Brexit talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? The prime minister's spokesman said such a statement from the EU had been expected and it was similar to what had been proposed in September 2019, adding that the government had already set out its own plans in the event a trade deal could not be reached. The main obstacles for an agreement continue to be access to fishing waters, rules about subsidising businesses and how any new deal would be policed. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A statement by the European Commission - the EU executive - published on Thursday said there was currently ""significant uncertainty"" about whether a deal would be in place by 1 January. ""Our responsibility is to be prepared for all eventualities, including not having a deal in place,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Some sectors would be disproportionately affected, the commission said, adding that it was proposing four contingency measures ""to mitigate some of the significant disruptions"" if a deal were not in place: To ensure the provision of ""certain air services"" between the UK and EU for six months, provided the UK does the same To allow aviation safety certificates to be used in EU aircraft without disruption to avoid grounding To ensure basic connectivity for road freight and passenger transport for six months, provided the UK does the same To allow the possibility of reciprocal fishing access for UK and EU vessels in each other's waters for one year, or until an agreement is reached The commission also said its offers on road and air transportwould depend on the UK providing ""fair and equal opportunities"",,externaladding: ""A level playing field requires that, even after the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards."" The idea of level playing field measures is to ensure businesses on one side do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. The EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to a number of its rules but the UK argues Brexit means breaking free from them. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check explains why the level playing field matters in Brexit talks The aviation plans would allow UK-registered carriers to keep flying to and from the EU, the trade body Airlines UK said, but they would not be allowed to fly routes within the EU. Industry group ADS called the proposals ""bare bones arrangements"" that would still leave issues to be resolved, including over aviation safety regulations. Reacting to the EU's contingency plans, Boris Johnson's spokesman said the UK government would look ""very closely at the details"" and that negotiators were ""continuing to work to see if the two sides could bridge the remaining gaps"". The spokesman added that the government ""had been clear throughout it would not agree to anything that did not respect UK sovereignty"". The European Commission has until now resisted calls from EU member states to publish these plans, partly because it did not want to jeopardise further the already perilous trade talks. The thinking was that the UK may view any EU contingency plans as rather palatable and encourage them to pursue a path to no deal. Certainly, the proposal that planes and lorries would keep moving would appear to remove an element of drama from what happens on 1 January. And on fishing - such a totemic issue in the wider talks - the message is that this would protect coastal communities in the face on growing uncertainty. But dig deeper, and the EU olive branch is dependent on the UK accepting key terms, including agreements on the increasingly famous ""level playing field"" - the very subject which is proving so divisive in the seemingly deadlocked trade talks. The UK government says it will be studying the EU's proposals but has reiterated its determination to ""take back control"" - including of its waters. The promise is that Britain would never accept fishing terms that contradicted its new status as ""an independent coastal state"". In the puzzle that is Brexit, it may prove hard to find even a deal on how to cope with no deal. Negotiations on a trade deal are continuing, but Downing Street said following Wednesday's talks between Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen that ""very large gaps remain"". UK Foreign SecretaryDominic Raab said it was ""unlikely"" the negotiations would be extended beyond Sunday, while Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt said the UK was ""working tirelessly to get a deal"" but could not accept an agreement at any cost. Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January Ms von der Leyen said the EU was willing to grant the UK access to the single market ""but the conditions have to be fair... for our workers and our companies"", adding: ""This fine balance of fairness has not been achieved so far. We will take a decision on Sunday."" EU leaders will be briefed about the talks at a summit in Brussels later on Thursday, although Brexit is not on the official discussion agenda. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen: ""Our negotiators are still working and we will take a decision on Sunday"" Separately, the European Commission has confirmed reports thata ban on travel to the EU because of Covid-19 levels, currently applying to non-EU countries, could be extended to UK visitorsfrom 1 January. Currently only eight countries with low Covid rates are on the approved list for free travel and there are no plans to add the UK to that list. But EU member states have control over their own border restrictions and could choose to have their own individual travel corridors and allow British visitors in. Meanwhile, France's minister for Europe, ClÃ©ment Beaune, warned that visas might be required for UK citizens who plan to stay in the EU for more than three months. But, he added, the matter was still being negotiated. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit? TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL: What happens if these talks fail?

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns of a ""worrying"" rise in cases in London, Kent and Essex Mass testing will be rolled out for secondary school-aged children in that age group in the worst affected parts of those regions He warns at a Downing Street press conference that ""the fight is not over"" and urges: ""Don't blow it now"" The UK's economic recovery slowed in October - rising 0.4% on the month against a backdrop of rising Covid cases Canada joins the UK in approving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine The United States records more than 3,000 deaths in the latest 24-hour period - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world South Africa, the worst hit country in Africa, enters a second wave of the pandemic as it registers 7,000 new cases on Wednesday Ministers in Northern Ireland are due to meet later before the end of a two-week lockdown on Friday There have been 68.9m cases and 1.56m deaths worldwide, figures from Johns Hopkins University show Edited by Rob Corp We are now closing our live coverage. Today's live coverage was brought to you by: Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Lauren Turner, Jennifer Scott, Sarah Fowler and Rob Corp. Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest in coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. We'll be closing the live page for the day shortly. But before we do, here's a recap of the main headlines. Cabin crews in China are being advised to wear diapers for flights to high-risk coronavirus countries and to avoid using the toilet to reduce the chance of infection. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched the latest prototype of his Starship vehicle from Texas. Codenamed SN8, the uncrewed rocket lifted away from the Boca Chica R&D facility on what had been billed as a brief flight to 12.5km (41,000ft). The 50m-tall vehicle crashed on touchdown but Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved. Before the flight, the tech billionaire had dampened expectations, warning his fans that some mishap was likely. Nonetheless, Musk has big hopes for the Starship when it is fully developed. He says it is the future for his SpaceX company. Starship will launch people and cargo into orbit, and the entrepreneur also envisages the vehicle travelling to the Moon and Mars. The SpaceX CEO praised his team, adding that the demonstration had acquired ""all the data we needed"". ""Mars, here we come!!"" he tweeted. The crash landing: Mr Musk calls it ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" SpaceX: Musk's 'Mars ship' prototype aces 150m test flight Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronaut crew heads to orbit Elon Musk becomes world's second richest person The SN8 was given a nosecone and flaps for the flight The Boca Chica facility has developed a line of ever-more complex prototypes. The philosophy has been to test each iteration until it fails. Sometimes explosively. SN8 was the first to attempt a high-altitude suborbital flight. The plan had been to demonstrate some manoeuvres that mimicked a belly-facing re-entry to Earth's atmosphere, ending up with a flip back to the vertical just before touchdown. Most of this was achieved: a clean launch off the pad, a steady climb to altitude, followed by a horizontal descent. But it was when the Starship tried to flip back to the vertical that things started to go wrong. The vehicle came into its landing pad with too much speed, and promptly exploded on impact. ""Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high & RUD,"" Mr Musk explained on Twitter. ""RUD"" stands for ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"". A crash, in other words. Mr Musk will move swiftly on. He already has other prototypes at Boca Chica ready to take SN8's place. Allow Twitter content?

Visually, SN8 looked quite different from the test articles that had gone before it. The new vehicle was given three of SpaceX's latest methane-burning Raptor engines, a nose cone and aerodynamic control surfaces - the large flaps at its top and base. Just three Raptors today, but eventually the Starship will fly with six The Starship will eventually launch atop a booster called the Super Heavy. This will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust. That's much more than even the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon. Both parts of the new SpaceX system - Starship and Super Heavy booster - will stand 118m tall on the launch pad. The two elements are being designed to be fully reusable, making propulsive landings at the end of each mission. Mr Musk is in a hurry to get to Mars In June this year, Mr Musk stated that Starship was now his number-one priority, beyond the Falcon rockets he currently routinely flies for satellite companies, the US Air Force and the US space agency (Nasa). He believes the Starship concept can transform the economics of spaceflight. The specifications call for more than 100-tonnes to be lifted into low-Earth orbit. This mass could include satellites, people and even hardware to build bases on the Moon and Mars. Nasa has already asked Mr Musk to examine the possibility of landing a Starship on the lunar surface in the next few years. The entrepreneur has in mind a higher objective and a faster timeline, however. Receiving an award last week from the Germany digital publishing group Axel Springer SE, he said he aimed to have people at Mars in the next four to six years. The SpaceX CEO is famous for his aggressive and overly optimistic schedules. He does, however, have a habit of proving critics wrong by eventually attaining his goals.

"This video can not be played The five ways the US executes - in 45 secs As President Donald Trump's days in the White House wane, his administration has been racing through a string of federal executions. Five people have been executed in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's 20 January inauguration - breaking with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition. They make Mr Trump the country's most prolific execution president in more than a century, overseeing the executions of 13 death row inmates since July of this year. The five executions began with convicted killer 40-year-old Brandon Bernard who was put to death at a penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. They ended with the death of Dustin Higgs, 48, at the same site on 16 January. Bernard apologises to victims' family before execution Attorney General William Barr has said his justice department is simply upholding existing law. But critics have said the move is concerning, coming just weeks before Mr Biden - who has said he will seek to end the death penalty - takes office. Attorney General Barr has ordered five executions during the presidential transition period ""This is really outside the norm, in a pretty extreme way,"" said Ngozi Ndulue, director of research at the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center. US resumption of federal executions criticised How many countries still have the death penalty? US inmate has 'no right to painless death' Here's what you need to know about President Trump's last-minute rush of executions. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated by the US Supreme Court in 1988, executions carried out by the national or federal government in the US have remained rare. Before Mr Trump took office, only three federal executions had taken place in this period. All were carried out under Republican President George W Bush, and included inmate Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing. Since 2003, there have been no federal executions at all. Most federal executions take place here, at the Terre Haute Federal Correctional Complex in Indiana US states have continued to execute inmates in state prisons, putting 22 death row inmates to death last year. But state executions are also on a downward trend. A growing number have moved to abolish capital punishment altogether, and the majority have either formally banned the practice or have not put any inmates to death in more than a decade. Popular opinion, too, has shifted away from capital punishment. A November 2019 Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans supported life in prison over the death penalty for the first time since the survey began more than 30 years ago. ""Public support for the death penalty is at a decades-long low,"" Ms Ndulue said. Further problems have emerged with the methods of execution, sourcing drugs used for lethal injections, and the costs of decades-long court battles and appeals. In July 2019, Mr Barr announced the scheduled executions of five death row prisoners, despite prevailing practices and public opinion. ""Congress has expressly authorised the death penalty,"" the country's top legal official said in a statement at the time. ""The justice department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."" The selected inmates had been convicted of murdering or raping children and the elderly, Mr Barr said. The move drew fierce criticism from top Democrats and human rights groups. ""We feel [the death penalty] is an unconstitutionally arbitrary punishment that should have been abolished decades ago,"" said Lisa Cylar Barrett, director of policy at the NCAAP Legal Defense Fund. This video can not be played The women who write to death row inmates And the particular selection of inmates fuelled charges that the decision was politically motivated. The first set of executions this summer - during a wave of anti-racism protests and demonstrations - were all of white men. Four of these five prisoners put to death were African American. Ms Ndulue said she didn't think it was ""coincidental"" that no black prisoners were scheduled for execution during a period of ""enhanced awareness of the racial disparities around the federal death penalty"". Research suggests the death penalty has been enforced differently according to race. ""One of the most robust findings of study after study, in jurisdictions across the country, is that the race of your victim is a serious factor in determining whether or not you will have the death penalty,"" Ms Ndulue said. The 10 inmates executed in 2020 have led to a single-year total unmatched in modern history. ""We'd have to go back to 1896 to find another year where there were 10 or more executions,"" Ms Ndulue said. Campaigners are seeking to prevent Brandon Bernard's execution The Trump administration has also chosen to carry out federal executions in the midst of a political transition, with a lame-duck president, for the first time in more than a century. Incumbent presidents have typically deferred to their successors, allowing presidents-elect to set the course. In an interview with the Associated Press, Mr Barr defended the post-election executions. ""I think the way to stop the death penalty is to repeal the death penalty,"" he said. ""But if you ask juries to impose it, then it should be carried out."" But it is a controversial choice, especially as the incoming Biden administration has said it will work to end the death penalty. Bernard's execution had drawn particular attention. Convicted of murder and kidnapping in 1999, Bernard was 18 at the time of his offence, and would be the youngest offender executed by the federal government in nearly 70 years. Five of the nine surviving jurors in the case, as well as the US attorney who defended the death sentence on appeal, had publicly called for his execution to be stopped. Kim Kardashian also weighed in, making a direct appeal to Mr Trump on Twitter. Mr Trump has been a long-time, vocal advocate of the death penalty. The Biden team is opposed. Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, in particular, has been a consistent critic of the practice. She took a stand against capital punishment in her successful 2003 campaign for San Francisco District Attorney and declined to seek the death penalty in the murder of a 29-year-old police officer, killed in the line of duty - despite pressure from within her party. Then-Senator Joe Biden expressed support for the death penalty in the 1990s. The president-elect's record is more uneven. Mr Biden's 1994 crime bill added some 60 federal crimes for which someone could be put to death. Some of those on death row today were convicted under provisions of his legislation. Now, he has promised to push for legislation eliminating federal executions entirely, and to encourage states to do the same. The Biden team has noted that more than 160 individuals sentenced to death in the US since 1973 have later been exonerated. Mr Biden has yet to name his choice for US attorney general. Alfred Bourgeoiswas on death row for torturing and beating his two-year-old daughter to death. He was executed on 11 December. An earlier execution date was stayed by a federal judge due to evidence from Bourgeois' legal team showing he had an intellectual disability. This ruling was overturned in October. Lisa Montgomerystrangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. She was executed on 12 January. Her lawyers said she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and suffers from serious mental illness. She was the first woman to face federal execution in the US since 1953. Cory Johnsonwas convicted for the murder of seven people, related to his involvement with the drug trade in Richmond, Virginia. Johnson's legal team argued that he suffered from an intellectual disability, related to physical and emotional abuse he experienced as a child. He was executed on 14 January. Dustin John Higgswas convicted in the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three young women in the Washington, DC area. Higgs did not kill any of his victims. His co-defendant Willis Haynes did, after being instructed to by Higgs. Haynes has said in court documents that Higgs did not threaten him, or force him to shoot. Higgs was executed on 15 January.

"Hilda Hubbard, known as Frances, was found dead at the retirement bungalow she shared with her husband of 50 years A woman killed by her husband was believed to have never experienced domestic abuse before, a report found. Hilda Hubbard was repeatedly stabbed by her husband Michael, who had dementia, at their Norfolk bungalow in September 2018. The pair had been happy, riding in a scooter and sidecar they had called ""Wallace and Gromit"", the report said. The Domestic Homicide Review,externalsaid there were ""many examples of good practice"" by professionals involved with them. Mr Hubbard was later detained in a secure mental health unit after he was found to beunfit to stand trial over the death of his wife, to whom he had been married for 50 years. Neighbours rang 999 after they saw Mr Hubbard standing in the doorway of their home in Brooke, near Norwich, with his wife, known as Frances, lying on the ground. Police fired a rubber bullet at the pensioner, who was 81 at the time, before taking him to hospital and later charging him with murder. The review into her death, which does not use the couple's real names, was carried out to examine what could be learned from the case. It looked at the roles of organisations involved with the couple from July 2014, when Mr Hubbard first raised concerns about his memory loss. Floral tributes were left for Mrs Hubbard, who, with her husband was described as ""community-minded"" The ""community-minded"" and ""traditional"" couple were described as ""very private"", ""self-sufficient"" and ""proud"" of their children who both achieved master's degrees. Mr Hubbard was forced to retire at the age of 43 after suffering health problems from breaking his back when he was 20. ""Life didn't turn out for either of them as they had expected, but they eventually won through and made an enviable life for themselves,"" their daughter told the report's author. The couple became even more private following Mr Hubbard's diagnosis in 2014, and Mrs Hubbard - as her husband 's carer - had refused offers of support, the report said. In summary, it found there had been ""notable practice"" by their GP, social housing provider and police, after an officer was called to them the day before Mrs Hubbard's death regarding a theft allegation. It said the examples should be reinforced and shared across Norfolk and made a number of other recommendations.

"Tesco and Morrisons will open their shops on Boxing Day despite calls to give staff the day off. Unions say supermarket staff should not have to go in on 26 December as a thank you for their work during the pandemic Asda, Marks & Spencer, Pets at Home, and toy store The Entertainer have all said they will close. But Tesco and Morrisons have joined Sainsbury's in saying they would open on Boxing Day for a limited number of hours. Tesco said it wouldreward frontline staff with an extra 10% bonus,externalover the Christmas and New Year period. Morrisons said that working on the day would be voluntary with staff getting double pay. Sainsbury's will open but has reduced the hours after requests from staff. It said most workers would have Boxing Day off. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas Supermarkets, which have been are classed as ""essential"" retailers during the pandemic, have seen their sales boom this year. As part of a thank you to staff for their work during the pandemic, Asda said that all of its 631 shops would close for two days over the Christmas break. Frontline staff will also get 100% of their bonus entitlement regardless of whether they have reached sales quotas. Covid: Christmas comes early as grocery sales 'hit record' in November Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said in a message to staff it had been a ""challenging year"" and they had ""done an incredible job"". He also said that many staff would have missed out on spending time with their families and friends due to Covid restrictions. ""This is of course our busiest time of year but it was important for us to give as many of you as possible the opportunity to spend this time with those loved ones that you may not have not seen for many months so, uniquely for this year, we will not reopen our stores until 27 December."" The GMB union said it had been ""requesting Asda to allow their key worker heroes family time over the Christmas period, so we are really pleased they have agreed to our calls."" GMB national officer Roger Jenkins, said: ""It's a shame this is not extra holiday - workers will have to book a day of their annual leave entitlement. ""But it's a step in the right direction and GMB now calls on the rest of the retail sector to follow suit and repay these key workers with a chance to spend Boxing Day with their loved ones."" Asda joins rivals to pay back Covid rates relief Usdaw, the union which represents shop workers, has also been calling on all retailers to close their doors on Boxing Day. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said at the end of November: ""With the country facing a crisis unlike any in our lifetime, retail and distribution workers have stepped up and kept food on all of our tables. ""When others stay safe at home, they go out to work. ""The only way they will be guaranteed a decent break at Christmas is if food retailers close for Boxing Day,"" he said. However, supermarket giant Sainsbury's, which has a large network of convenience shops as well as larger outlets, said on Wednesday that its supermarkets would remain open, albeit with reduced hours. A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: ""For colleagues that have requested it, we have made sure they are able to take at least two consecutive days off over Christmas."" Tesco said: ""Our stores are open for reduced hours on Boxing Day. Many of our customers rely on their local stores over Boxing Day - from families in search of essentials, to key workers needing access to food."" A Morrisons spokeswoman said it would open its stores for a limited number of hours on Boxing Day but it was ""working hard to ensure all colleagues get a meaningful break during the Christmas period"". It said anyone who worked on Boxing Day would also get time back in lieu. In November, Marks & Spencer said it would reverse its decision to open on Boxing Day so staff could spend more time with their families. Poundland said earlier in the year that it would stay closed on Boxing Day and New Year's Day, while retailers including Wickes, Pets and Home and the Entertainer have also said they will be closed.

"This video can not be played Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched the latest prototype of his Starship vehicle from Texas. Codenamed SN8, the uncrewed rocket lifted away from the Boca Chica R&D facility on what had been billed as a brief flight to 12.5km (41,000ft). The 50m-tall vehicle crashed on touchdown but Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved. Before the flight, the tech billionaire had dampened expectations, warning his fans that some mishap was likely. Nonetheless, Musk has big hopes for the Starship when it is fully developed. He says it is the future for his SpaceX company. Starship will launch people and cargo into orbit, and the entrepreneur also envisages the vehicle travelling to the Moon and Mars. The SpaceX CEO praised his team, adding that the demonstration had acquired ""all the data we needed"". ""Mars, here we come!!"" he tweeted. The crash landing: Mr Musk calls it ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" SpaceX: Musk's 'Mars ship' prototype aces 150m test flight Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronaut crew heads to orbit Elon Musk becomes world's second richest person The SN8 was given a nosecone and flaps for the flight The Boca Chica facility has developed a line of ever-more complex prototypes. The philosophy has been to test each iteration until it fails. Sometimes explosively. SN8 was the first to attempt a high-altitude suborbital flight. The plan had been to demonstrate some manoeuvres that mimicked a belly-facing re-entry to Earth's atmosphere, ending up with a flip back to the vertical just before touchdown. Most of this was achieved: a clean launch off the pad, a steady climb to altitude, followed by a horizontal descent. But it was when the Starship tried to flip back to the vertical that things started to go wrong. The vehicle came into its landing pad with too much speed, and promptly exploded on impact. ""Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high & RUD,"" Mr Musk explained on Twitter. ""RUD"" stands for ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"". A crash, in other words. Mr Musk will move swiftly on. He already has other prototypes at Boca Chica ready to take SN8's place. Allow Twitter content?

Visually, SN8 looked quite different from the test articles that had gone before it. The new vehicle was given three of SpaceX's latest methane-burning Raptor engines, a nose cone and aerodynamic control surfaces - the large flaps at its top and base. Just three Raptors today, but eventually the Starship will fly with six The Starship will eventually launch atop a booster called the Super Heavy. This will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust. That's much more than even the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon. Both parts of the new SpaceX system - Starship and Super Heavy booster - will stand 118m tall on the launch pad. The two elements are being designed to be fully reusable, making propulsive landings at the end of each mission. Mr Musk is in a hurry to get to Mars In June this year, Mr Musk stated that Starship was now his number-one priority, beyond the Falcon rockets he currently routinely flies for satellite companies, the US Air Force and the US space agency (Nasa). He believes the Starship concept can transform the economics of spaceflight. The specifications call for more than 100-tonnes to be lifted into low-Earth orbit. This mass could include satellites, people and even hardware to build bases on the Moon and Mars. Nasa has already asked Mr Musk to examine the possibility of landing a Starship on the lunar surface in the next few years. The entrepreneur has in mind a higher objective and a faster timeline, however. Receiving an award last week from the Germany digital publishing group Axel Springer SE, he said he aimed to have people at Mars in the next four to six years. The SpaceX CEO is famous for his aggressive and overly optimistic schedules. He does, however, have a habit of proving critics wrong by eventually attaining his goals.

"The UK has formally suspended trade talks with Canada despite nearly two years of negotiations, in a row over agricultural products including beef. Following Brexit and the departure from the EU's trading system in 2021, the UK has been trying to strike trade deals with countries around the world. This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a potential trading partner since then. UK halts trade negotiations with Canada over hormones in beef ban It means tariffs - or taxes - may have to be paid on some UK exports to Canada such as cheese, of which the UK exported Â£18.7m worth in 2022,according to the Food and Drink Federation,external. The ability to strike free trade deals was cited by Brexit supporters as one of the benefits of leaving the EU. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper and simpler. It normally applies to the exchange of goods, but occasionally to services as well. Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders and can help protect a country's manufacturers from cheap imports. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs or food safety requirements. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be inspected. The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020 Since Brexit, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU. However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements. And some of them are with countries with which the UK does very little trade. A deal withJapanwas signed in October 2020. It was the first that differed from the existing EU trade deal. TheAustralia dealwas thefirst trade agreementnegotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU. UK farmerswarned they could be undercut by cheap imports, which could cost jobs. However, the UK government insists the deal contains protections for the sector. An agreement withNorway, Iceland and Liechtensteinwasannounced in June 2021and builds on the previous agreement the UK had with these countries. British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef The UKsigned a new deal,externalwithNew Zealandon 28 February 2022. New Zealand is a small trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% of total UK trade. While the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much, it could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK. The UK has also agreed to join an existing trade agreement between11 Pacific Rim nations. The governmentexpects to become a member,externalof the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in the second half of 2024. Talks withIndiabegan in early 2022, although no deal has been reached. And there has not been a deal agreed with theUS, although it had been set as a priority in the Conservative 2019 manifesto. Rishi Sunak said in June 2023that a full free trade agreement had not in fact been a priority for either country ""for a while now"", although a more limited economic agreement called the Atlantic Declaration was signed. After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship. This was important because the EU was the UK's largest and closest trading partner. After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021. The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced, which would have made it more expensive to trade goods between the two partners. The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit. As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced. The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs. What's in the UK-EU trade deal?

"Sales of homes continued to rise ahead of Christmas, but surveyors are expecting a slowdown early next year. Many buyers have been trying to benefit from temporary stamp duty holidays, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said. But there were signs that demand was ""losing a bit of steam"" in some areas of the UK. Despite the predicted slowdown it is not expecting a significant fall in house prices. It pointed out that ""stickier"" property prices could cause affordability problems for some people hoping to buy a home. Where can I afford to live? Enquiries from new buyers had increased in November, RICS said, and sales had also been on the rise in most areas of the UK. Wales and Northern Ireland seeing particularly strong growth for November, it said. Surveyors in the West Midlands, East Midlands and Scotland had started to report a flatter trend in agreed sales. Many buyers were making the most of a temporary reduction or removal of stamp duty, or its equivalent tax, in the different parts of the UK. Colin Townsend, of John Goodwin Estate Agents in Malvern, Worcestershire, said that house prices were still rising and that he had seen ""another record-breaking month for sales in November as buyers seem to be trying to move before the stamp duty deadline"". Once that tax break was withdrawn, there was an expectation of falling demand from buyers. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: ""It is clear from responses to the latest survey that there is considerable concern about the prospect of a sharp slowdown in transaction activity following the end of the first quarter of the coming year."" Reduced government support and expectations of a rise in unemployment as redundancy programmes began to take effect were behind those predictions, he said. ""There is little sense that the projected softer sales picture will feed through into pricing which is viewed as likely to prove rather stickier in the face of ongoing macro challenges,"" he said. The report comes after some of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders reported relatively large rises in house prices in November. The Nationwide Building Society said UK house prices were 6.5% higher than a year ago - thesharpest rise for nearly six years. Rival lender, the Halifax, said the average property price had risen by more than Â£15,000 since June. House prices have risen at a relatively rapid rate in many parts of the UK in the late summer and autumn as some people sought a Covid-inspired change in lifestyle, or more space to work from home. There was also some pent-up demand from the first period of lockdown. House price growth 'fastest for almost six years' Where can I afford to live?

"US federal regulators and more than 45 state prosecutors have sued Facebook, accusing the social media company of taking illegal actions to buy up rivals and stifle competition. The lawsuits are one of the most significant legal actions the US government has taken against the firm. Officials are asking the court to consider breaking up the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook said the deals under scrutiny were approved by regulators years ago. ""The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final,"" Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead said. She said the company had invested millions to make Instagram and WhatsApp successful and would defend itself ""vigorously"". ""Antitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses,"" Facebook said, describing the government's arguments as ""revisionist history"".

The lawsuits filed by the states and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) focus on Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, 2014 purchase of WhatsApp and rules governing outside software developers. Officials accused Facebook of taking a ""buy or bury"" approach to potential rivals, hurting competitors and users, who have lost control of their own data to support the firm's advertising revenue. The legal filings cite internal messages from Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, such as one 2008 email that said it was ""better to buy than compete"". ""For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the legal fight by the states. ""No company should have this much unchecked power over our personal interaction and social interactions. That's why we are taking action today."" It's quite hard sometimes to comprehend just how massive Facebook is. Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram - all owned by Facebook - all have more than a billion monthly users. WhatsApp and Facebook have more than two billion. What the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is arguing is that there's a reason why Facebook came to dominate this highly lucrative sector - it acquired the competition illegally. In 2012 Instagram was growing rapidly. Facebook was worried. Zuckerberg has admitted himself previously that Instagram was a competitor to Facebook. It was bought, for what now seems a ludicrously low figure of $1bn. WhatsApp too in 2014 was growing at incredible speeds. Was it going to threaten Facebook's own messenger service? Facebook bought WhatsApp too. Both of these acquisitions were previously looked at by the FTC and were approved. That is Facebook's argument - that they bought these companies when they were much smaller - that there was nothing pre-ordained about their success. In other words, don't punish Facebook for building strong American companies. Whether Instagram and WhatsApp will be cleaved off from Facebook will now be decided in the courts - and these antitrust lawsuits take time. There will also be ample opportunity for appeals. Don't expect a breakup of Facebook soon. But this is yet more indication of where the courts and politicians are now headed. Big Tech is a little too big in many peoples' eyes - and it needs to cutting down to size. The lawsuits come as US regulators are taking a closer look at the power enjoyed by tech companies. This summer,the bosses of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple were forced to testify before Congress, as part of a bigger investigation of their influence on the market. In October, the Department of Justice sued Google,accusing the search giant of violating US competition laws to maintain a monopoly on internet searches and online advertising. More than 2.5 billion people use one of Facebook's apps each day. The firm, valued at nearly $800bn, employs more than 56,000 people and reported more than $18bn in profit last year. The Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that has been pushing regulators to take a more aggressive stance against tech companies, said the lawsuits were a ""critical step"" forward. ""There's still more to do, but this is a big moment,"" the organisation wrote on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns of a ""worrying"" rise in cases in London, Kent and Essex Mass testing will be rolled out for secondary school-aged children in that age group in the worst affected parts of those regions He warns at a Downing Street press conference that ""the fight is not over"" and urges: ""Don't blow it now"" The UK's economic recovery slowed in October - rising 0.4% on the month against a backdrop of rising Covid cases Canada joins the UK in approving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine The United States records more than 3,000 deaths in the latest 24-hour period - the highest total in a single day anywhere in the world South Africa, the worst hit country in Africa, enters a second wave of the pandemic as it registers 7,000 new cases on Wednesday Ministers in Northern Ireland are due to meet later before the end of a two-week lockdown on Friday There have been 68.9m cases and 1.56m deaths worldwide, figures from Johns Hopkins University show Edited by Rob Corp We are now closing our live coverage. Today's live coverage was brought to you by: Alex Kleiderman, George Wright, Lauren Turner, Jennifer Scott, Sarah Fowler and Rob Corp. Thanks for joining us today as we've brought you the latest in coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. We'll be closing the live page for the day shortly. But before we do, here's a recap of the main headlines. Cabin crews in China are being advised to wear diapers for flights to high-risk coronavirus countries and to avoid using the toilet to reduce the chance of infection. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the advice for charter flights to and from areas where infections exceed 500 in every one million people. ""It is recommended that cabin crew wear disposable nappies to avoid special circumstances,"" it states. The advice is in the personal protection equipment (PPE) section of its latest guidelines. It also includes disposable caps, disposable shoe covers and goggles. Flight crew must wear masks and goggles, but will not be made to wear diapers if they do not wish. The four UK governments have said that families will be able to celebrate Christmas together by easing restrictions for five days over the festive period. Between 23 and 27 December (22 and 28 December in Northern Ireland), households will be able to form ""Christmas bubbles"" with two other households and will be able to meet indoors and stay overnight. BBC Asian Network have created video explainers of the rules coming into force in the UK in five South Asian languages  For further information in English,check out this explainer. If you're just catching up, here's what happened at the Downing Street press conference today. Metro's Dominic Yeatman asks about possible changes to the UK's travel rules if a Brexit trade deal is not agreed in time, and whether the health secretary would like to apologise to staff after reports that NHS staff were given ""rotten"" PPE. Matt Hancock says: ""We make judgements and decisions on what international travel can be recommended... based on public health advice. ""That's the approach that we will be sticking to."" On PPE, he says there was a ""massive effort... and I'm really, really pleased that so many people contributed and there was never a national shortage of PPE. ""That doesn't mean it wasn't difficult at times and there were undoubtedly challenges. ""Now I'm glad to say we have over 30 billion items of PPE and we've also developed the domestic manufacture so we won't be reliant on getting it from abroad in the future.""  The final question asks whether there are any plans to re-open the Nightingale Hospital in east London at the Excel Centre, and if there is any point putting the capital in tier three just days before Christmas? Hancock says he understands the impact of tiering decisions, but adds: ""We have to make them in order to keep the virus under control and we have all seen the consequences if the virus gets out of control in other countries on the health service."" Powis says Nightingale Hospitals are the NHS' ""insurance policy"" to make sure there is additional capacity if needed. But, while infection rises are ""worrying"" in London, ""we are not at the levels we saw in April so can manage in existing hospitals"". He concludes they will keep the use of the Excel Centre ""under review"". By Ben Butcher, BBC Reality Check Reality Check Matt Hancock said that a high proportion of the cases being seen in national âhot spotsâ were in secondary school-aged children, rather than older people. âWe know from experience that a sharp rise in cases amongst younger people can lead to a rise amongst more vulnerable age groups,â he said. This is certainly what happened with the recent autumn spike that led to a national lockdown. Case rates among 10-19 year olds in England started increasing at the end of August, having been broadly stable over the summer. This trend was also seen among people in their 20s. However, it wasnât until several weeks later in mid-September that the rates started increasing for people in their 50s or older. Case rates for this group peaked a couple of weeks after younger groups. Part of the case rate increases by younger people could be linked to surges in testing around school time. However, increased interactions at school (regardless of social distancing measures) will likely have played a role - and then these were passed onto parents. This matters, because when older, more vulnerable people get the virus, hospital cases increase. In September, these didnât start rising sharply until the older groups had caught the virus. The Guardian asks a question of the health secretary following itsreports on Matt Hancock's former neighbour supplying NHS test tubes,externalafter sending him a personal WhatsApp message. Hancock says he had ""absolutely nothing to do with that contract"". He adds: ""What I would say more broadly is I am very pleased that so many people came forward in the spring of this year when the nation really needed the support of the nation."" But he reiterates he did not deal with the contract awarded to his former neighbour.  ITV's Tom Clarke asks if it's inevitable we are going to see a third wave of cases, and whether ministers should be acting sooner in making a decision on restrictions. He also asks what tests will be rolled out for secondary schools, and how effective they will be? Matt Hancock says decisions on tiers will depend on how people behave. He says targeted testing is being rolled out due to a particular rise in cases in a particular part of London. ""That can help us and play a part in keeping case rates down, but only as part of an overall package. ""It's individuals behaviour that can make the biggest difference,"" he says. He says PCR tests will be used in the first instance in London, and then lateral flow tests will also be rolled out. ""They are both effective,"" he says. Prof Chris Whitty says a third wave ""is not inevitable"" but it can be avoided by everyone ""coming together"". He says people should be ""very sensible"" over the Christmas period. On testing, he says a testing programme is a ""useful addition"" to all the other social distancing measures.

""If you add it to those things it adds an additional bit of heft,"" he says. Christmas gatherings in homes in Northern Ireland will be permitted from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing, First Minister Arlene Foster said: ""Over the next weeks and months I ask you all to be sensible, make good choices and keep yourself and others safe."" Foster also confirmed that the easing of coronavirus restrictions will take place as planned on Friday. Restrictions on parts of the hospitality sector, non-essential retail and close-contact services will be lifted at midnight. A maximum of 15 people will be able to take part in outdoor sports, while 500 spectators will be able to attend sport events. ""Covid ambassadors"" will be on high streets to give advice, Foster added. The first minister defended the decision to ease restrictions. ""Of course we are very disappointed to see the number of deaths this week, 73, that's a big number, and therefore when we look at these figures it's important we realise that comes after two weeks when we were out of restrictions,"" she said. ""People have to realise that personal responsibility is the key issue here."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The suggestion that test and trace in England has improved its performance because it is reaching 86% of the close contacts of people who test positive, up from around 60% a few weeks ago, is somewhat misleading. The service has changed the way it works â so if an infected person says they have told the rest of their household - and they are all family members - that counts as those close contacts being reached. The change may be for the better â it means families wonât receive multiple calls like they used to do previously when the call handlers had to speak to each member of the household individually - but it does not constitute an improvement in performance. Now it is time for journalists. BBC health editor Hugh Pym asks how concerned the government is about the rise in cases in south-east England - and how likely is it London and Essex will move to tier three. Hancock says the case numbers are ""worrying"", adding: ""We will look at the most up to date data we have on 16 December and take a formal decision"", but he won't pre-empt it. Whitty says ""of course we are concerned and anyone living in those areas will be concerned"". He says it is the time of year when respiratory viruses go up and we are seeing it across Europe, but he says we ""need to look seriously at these areas and ask if enough"" restrictions are in place. Whitty adds: ""If these rates are going up towards the tail end of lockdown that is a concerning situation."" NHS Englandâs national medical director Prof Steve Powis also warns there could be increased pressure on the NHS as a result. Kate, from Dudley, asks whether people will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve with close family members. The health secretary says: ""Yes if you live with them in your own household, but we are not bringing in a special set of rules as we have for Christmas"". He says this is necessary to keep the virus under control. Before taking questions from the public and reporters, the health secretary finishes his opening statement by urging people to remember ""we're all on the same side"" and ""respect the rules"" as Christmas approaches. ""The finish line is in sight,"" he says ""and I know together we can get there"". The press conference moves straight to questions - with Phil from south London asking what the criteria is to get out of the current tier system of restrictions in England. Hancock says the ""simple answer"" is they will keep looking at their criteria for putting places into tiers, such as hospitalisation, cases in the over-60s and cases. They will then ""watch the data and the vaccine will of course, I hope, suppress that data"", he adds. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty says the vaccine over time will take the risks slowly down, but it will take some time. ""The thing we don't know is will the vaccines we have available reduce transmission,"" he says. ""The expectation is it will but we can't be certain."" He warns we ""won't have a situation where we are in the tiers we are and suddenly everything stops"" - it will be a slow process.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he is particularly concerned about the number of cases in London, Essex and Kent. He says the fastest rise is among secondary school-age children, noting that the rate among adults is ""broadly flat"". He says we must do ""everything we can to stop the spread among school-age children in London"", and we must not wait until the review on 16 December. Hancock says ministers have ""decided to put in place an immediate plan for testing all secondary school-age children in the seven worst affected boroughs of London, in parts of Essex that border London, and parts of Kent"". They will get mobile testing units, and the health secretary has urged children aged between 11 and 18 and their families to get tested in the coming days. More details will be released tomorrow. ""We have all got to do our bit,"" says Hancock, appealing to people to ""respecting the social distancing and the rules that come with it."" He says: ""We cant stop doing that now the vaccine is here."" The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC.

The health secretary warns the jab will not make people fully immune until seven days after the second dose, and we don't know if it will stop people passing it on. ""That is the safest way to get the number of cases down,"" he adds. He then moves on to say he has particular concerns about rises in  London, Kent and Essex. Hancock says there will be 10 more locations in England offering vaccines soon and from next week they will be available form GP sites and care homes. ""We will keep on expanding to reach more and more people,"" he adds. Next year, vaccination centres will be opened in sports centres and conference halls. And when the time comes the NHS will get in touch with you to come forward. ""When enough people are vaccinated and we see the figures coming down, we can start removing restrictions that have made this year so tough,"" says Hancock. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock begins the briefing by saying the start of the vaccination programme ""was the latest in a long line of firsts for the NHS"". He says more than 15,000 Covid patients are in hospital and 516 deaths were reported yesterday. ""The fall in the number of cases has flattened off and is rising in some places in the country,"" he says. ""This shows us this fight is not over."" And he appeals to the people of Britain not to ""blow it"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"The French cabinet has approved a bill aimed at tackling radical Islamists after a series of extremist attacks. The draft law, part of a long-term drive by President Emmanuel Macron to uphold secular values, tightens rules on home-schooling and hate speech. Some critics, both in France and abroad, have accused his government of using it to target religion. But Prime Minister Jean Castex called it ""a law of protection"" that would free Muslims from the grip of radicals. He insisted that the text was not ""aimed against religions or against the Muslim religion in particular"". The bill ""supporting Republican principles"" would tighten restrictions on online hate speech and ban the use of the internet to maliciously reveal personal details about other people. This is seen as a response to the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in October. Paty, 47, was killed near his school by a lone attacker after showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The investigation has revealed an online campaign had been launched against him. The law also bans ""clandestine"" schools that promote Islamist ideology and tightens rules on home-schooling. It would also reinforce the ban on polygamy by refusing residency to polygamous applicants. Doctors could be fined or banned for performing virginity tests on girls. There are new rules on financial transparency for Muslim associations and a requirement that they sign up to France's republican values in return for funding. A ban on officials wearing religious attire at work is being extended to transport workers and staff at swimming pools and markets. Meanwhile, separate to the law, President Macron has agreed with France's Muslim Council (CFCM) for a national council of imams to be set up. The president is seeking to put a stop to hundreds of foreign imams practising in France. Muslims under pressure to sign French values charter Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France The draft law has been under consideration for some time but recent Islamist attacks pushed it up the agenda. Paty's murder was one of three attacks that outraged France. Three people were killed in stabbings at a church in Nice in October. Two people were stabbed and seriously hurt in September in Paris near the former offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine, where Islamist militants carried out a deadly attack in 2015. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron says France 'will never give in' to extremism President Macron is a staunch defender of French republican values including state secularism. He has described Islam as a religion ""in crisis"" and defended the right of Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. France has an estimated five million Muslims, Europe's largest Muslim minority. Mr Macron has become the target of sharp criticism in several Muslim-majority countries. Relations with Turkey, already strained, were further undermined with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan describing the legislation as an ""open provocation"" and saying Mr Macron was ""mentally ill"". Demonstrations have been held in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Lebanon. The US envoy on religious freedom, Sam Brownback, was also critical, saying:  ""When you get heavy-handed, the situation can get worse."" In France itself, some left-wing politicians have expressed concern that the legislation could be seen as stigmatising Muslims. Le Monde newspaper says it could also antagonise other religious groups who practise home-schooling. But the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says pressure has grown on President Macron to act. Tackling Islamist influence in the name of French secularism may be popular at home, but it's still a delicate operation for the state, she adds.

"Sales of homes continued to rise ahead of Christmas, but surveyors are expecting a slowdown early next year. Many buyers have been trying to benefit from temporary stamp duty holidays, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said. But there were signs that demand was ""losing a bit of steam"" in some areas of the UK. Despite the predicted slowdown it is not expecting a significant fall in house prices. It pointed out that ""stickier"" property prices could cause affordability problems for some people hoping to buy a home. Where can I afford to live? Enquiries from new buyers had increased in November, RICS said, and sales had also been on the rise in most areas of the UK. Wales and Northern Ireland seeing particularly strong growth for November, it said. Surveyors in the West Midlands, East Midlands and Scotland had started to report a flatter trend in agreed sales. Many buyers were making the most of a temporary reduction or removal of stamp duty, or its equivalent tax, in the different parts of the UK. Colin Townsend, of John Goodwin Estate Agents in Malvern, Worcestershire, said that house prices were still rising and that he had seen ""another record-breaking month for sales in November as buyers seem to be trying to move before the stamp duty deadline"". Once that tax break was withdrawn, there was an expectation of falling demand from buyers. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist, said: ""It is clear from responses to the latest survey that there is considerable concern about the prospect of a sharp slowdown in transaction activity following the end of the first quarter of the coming year."" Reduced government support and expectations of a rise in unemployment as redundancy programmes began to take effect were behind those predictions, he said. ""There is little sense that the projected softer sales picture will feed through into pricing which is viewed as likely to prove rather stickier in the face of ongoing macro challenges,"" he said. The report comes after some of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders reported relatively large rises in house prices in November. The Nationwide Building Society said UK house prices were 6.5% higher than a year ago - thesharpest rise for nearly six years. Rival lender, the Halifax, said the average property price had risen by more than Â£15,000 since June. House prices have risen at a relatively rapid rate in many parts of the UK in the late summer and autumn as some people sought a Covid-inspired change in lifestyle, or more space to work from home.

"This video can not be played Jim Pook is one of 69 cases linked to a Covid-19 outbreak at the Royal Gwent Hospital A cancer patient has claimed poor infection control at the Royal Gwent Hospital meant he and three fellow patients caught coronavirus. Jim Pook is one of 69 cases linked to an outbreak at the Newport hospital which started six days ago. Aneurin Bevan University Health Board (ABUHB) said 53 patients and 16 staff had been affected on seven wards since 3 December. The health board has apologised to Mr Pook and his family. Mr Pook, from Newbridge, was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in mid-November after collapsing at home. He was later diagnosed with advanced cancer. The 77-year-old tested positive for coronavirus three weeks later after, he claimed, being in the same bay as a patient who already had the virus. ""They put a Covid patient in with us from a Covid ward. He was there for three days, coughing and coughing and coughing,"" said Mr Pook. ""There were six of us in there. One man signed out on his own accord [but] three out of the four that was left had Covid. We were absolutely mad. ""They then tried to get us to go home and said we can self-isolate in your own bedroom or something or other. I said, 'what? Me going home with my kids and putting them at risk. You're having a joke.'"" ""It was obvious to us it was going to go through it like wildfire,"" Jim Pook said The health board said details of deaths linked tooutbreaks at the Royal Gwent, since one was initially revealed in mid-October, was not accessible. The Pook family is one of several families that BBC Wales has spoken to who have raised concerns about infection control and communication within the hospital. ""The nurses weren't wearing nothing,"" said Mr Pook, on what infection control measure there was. ""When they come to me, I made them wash their hands cause they went round the others first - they didn't wash their hands when they went round the other boys. ""Everybody was using the same things. It was obvious to us it [Covid] was going to go through it like wildfire."" Concerns over patient safety if hospital opens Covid hotspot ICU staff 'broken' by deaths NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care ABUHB said it took such complaints ""very seriously"". ""The hospital is under significant pressure but the protection of patients and staff is an absolute priority,"" said a spokesman. ""We would like to apologise to Mr Pook and his family, and other patients, for the distress caused and reiterate we are rapidly reviewing what happened."" Aneurin Bevan University Health Board has apologised to Jim Pook and his family The most serious coronavirus hospitaloutbreak in Wales is at the Royal Glamorgan Hospitalin Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, where 85 people linked to the outbreak have died. In north-east Wales, a number of families said they want answers after seeing loved ones contract coronavirus after being admitted to Wrexham's Maelor Hospital for non-Covid-related treatments. They claim the hospital failed to properly isolate them from other patients who already had the virus. North Wales Conservative member of the Senedd, Mark Isherwood, asked Health Minister Vaughan Gething last week to respond to concerns that Covid and non-Covid patients have been placed on wards together at the hospital. He said he had been contacted by a constituent who's father contracted Covid-19 within the hospital. Mr Isherwood said: ""How do you respond to the son, who asked: 'Why would you place an elderly man with orthopaedic issues on a Ward with known Covid-19 patents?' ""And why, despite the front-line staff performing miracles, the back room at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Boardâ¦ still cannot control cross contamination, health and hygiene, but also the safety and management of patients within their safe keeping?"" Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it is doing all it can to prevent inpatients contracting Covid-19 in hospital. Debra Hickman, acting executive director of nursing and midwifery, said ""all appropriate"" infection prevention measures are in place and are kept under review. She added: ""All patients admitted into our hospitals are screened for Covid-19. Until their test result has been returned, they are cared for in designated assessment areas, where all infection prevention measures are in place to reduce the risk of transmission."" There has been a rise again in Covid-19 infections within hospitals in recent weeks. There were 248 hospital onset cases across Wales in the week to 6 December, according to official Public Health Wales figures. This is a fall of five on the previous week. Hywel Dda health board has seen ""probable"" and ""definite"" hospital infections more than double, to 48 in the latest week. Llandovery Hospitalhas been closeddue to an outbreak amongst patients and staff and thehealth board said it was facing extreme pressure.,external Despite a fall in Aneurin Bevan health board, it still had more hospital onset infections than any other health board in Wales in the most recent week. Details of how hundreds of patients had been infected while in hospital early in the pandemicemerged in the summer. Health officials have said that tackling Covid in hospital environments is particularly challenging, particularly as patients, visitors or staff with no obvious symptoms could be carrying the virus. Covid caught within hospitals make up about 4% of all positive cases.

"This video can not be played What do Welsh retailers hope Christmas will bring for business? Welsh retailers are on ""a knife edge"" amid fears many will not survive a fall in Christmas trade, according to an industry body. Stores such as Debenhams, Peacocks, Top Shop and Bonmarche are the latest to feel the financial strain of 2020. Many non-essential shops had to close for months during lockdowns aimed at reducing Covid-19 rates. A Welsh Government spokesman said it has provided the UK's most generous package of support for businesses. He said it has been worth nearly Â£2bn since the start of the pandemic, including extensive business rate relief. Covid business grant application process 'shambolic' Mixed picture for small businesses in Christmas run-up Twenty per cent of all retail sales usually come in November and December, said the Welsh Retail Consortium. Businesses will be looking for good Christmas sales to help boost them after the losses felt this year, its head, Sara Jones, told BBC Wales. ""The festive period is absolutely critical for retailers... particularly in the current climate,"" she said. ""Signs are fairly positive that we're seeing footfall coming back onto our high streets in our town centres, but to say that's going any way to make up for the disaster of a year [for] retailers, certainly will be a long way off the mark. ""We had some hope in the pre-festive period that we should get some of that trade back, get people back into our shops able to take advantage of the fantastic offers. ""But, as it stands, we are looking at a concerning picture going into the new year."" Debenhams, with eight stores in Wales, is expected to close its doors in the new year Non-essential retailers had to close over two periods in 2020 and the prospect ofanother lockdown in 2021has been raised as a possibility if cases rise after Christmas. ""Retailers are already at a knife edge. They're having to make some really difficult investment and decisions around what happens in the new year,"" Ms Jones warned. The Arcadia group which includes Top Shop, Peacocks and Bonmarche have gone into administration, posing a challenge for Welsh high streets especially in smaller towns and cities. Debenhams, with eight stores in Wales, has gone into liquidation and is expected to close its doors in the new year. Shopping: Almost one in five shops in Wales empty Covid: Mixed hopes for businesses in run up to Christmas Welsh Covid business grant application process 'shambolic' But it's not just the large chains that have felt the impact of the pandemic. Jayne Rees has been running her toy shop in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, since 2002 but has only been trading online for the last three years. She believes that has saved the business. ""We would be really struggling if we didn't have our online business. We've seen a three-fold increase in online sales,"" she said. ""We weren't expecting it, but it has saved the day, and has kept us going. ""We have missed our customers. A toy shop is a sad place when you've got no children in it, but we've survived so far."" Cardiff-based online retailer, Escentual, expects the rise in online trade to continue through the festive period as some customers avoid the shops. Chelsey Edmunds: ""Christmas should be really good for us this year"" ""The biggest surprise this year was online actually overtook bricks and mortar for Black Friday, so that gives a really strong indication that Christmas should be really good for us this year,"" said Chelsey Edmunds, communications manager. ""We're expecting a huge drive on fragrance. ""We've seen more of a trend around classics and particularly home fragrance. It's going to be a really interesting year."" Sales of home fragrance had increased by over 265% as people increasingly stayed at home during the pandemic, the company said. It also believes a drop in sales of lipstick but an increase in sales of mascara was down to people increasingly wearing masks. But with vaccines now being rolled out, will this accelerated trend of more online shopping continue longer-term? ""I actually see online sticking because customers really appreciate the sort of ease - click, collect, done,"" she said. Laura Tenison: ""Some people will thrive but many will actually go to the wall"" Laura Tenison, who owns the mother and baby chain Jojo Maman Bebe, said the pandemic has meant businesses have had to adapt their services but that turning retail demand into a mail order business overnight was difficult. ""Retail in 2021 is a scary place to be,"" she said. ""I think some people will thrive but many will actually go to the wall and we're going to see a lot of empty shops."" The Welsh Government spokesman said it had ""engaged significantly"" with business and retail. He added: ""Our Ministerial Town Centre Action Group, which includes representation from the Welsh Retail Consortium and other business interests, supports the economic and social recovery of our town centres, and our Transforming Towns programme is providing more than Â£90m to help achieve this.""

"The UN Human Rights Council meets at least three times a year and reviews UN member states' rights records A dead professor and numerous defunct organisations were resurrected and used alongside at least 750 fake media outlets in a vast 15-year global disinformation campaign to serve Indian interests, a new investigation has revealed. The man whose identity was stolen was regarded as one of the founding fathers of international human rights law, who died aged 92 in 2006. ""It is the largest network we have exposed,"" said Alexandre Alaphilippe, executive director ofEU DisinfoLab, which undertook the investigation and published an extensive report,externalon Wednesday. The network was designed primarily to ""discredit Pakistan internationally"" and influence decision-making at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and European Parliament, EU DisinfoLab said. EU DisinfoLab partially exposed the network last year but now says the operation is much larger and more resilient than it first suspected. Allow Twitter content?

There is no evidence the network is linked to India's government, but it relies heavily on amplifying content produced on fake media outlets with the help of Asian News International (ANI) - India's largest wire service and a key focus of the investigation. EU DisinfoLab are an independent NGO ""focused on tackling sophisticated disinformation campaigns targeting the EU, its member states, core institutions, and core values"". Their researchers, who are based in Brussels, believe the network's purpose is to disseminate propaganda against India's neighbour and rival Pakistan. Both countries have long sought to control the narrative against the other. Last year, the researchers uncovered 265 pro-Indian sites operating across 65 countries, and traced them back to a Delhi-based Indian holding company, the Srivastava Group (SG). Wednesday's report, titled Indian Chronicles, reveals that the operation, run by SG, is spread over at least 116 countries and has targeted members of the European Parliament and the United Nations - raising questions about how much EU and UN staff knew about SG's activities, and whether they could have done more to counter those activities, especially after last year's report. Mr Alaphilippe said the EU DisinfoLab researchers had never encountered such co-ordination between different stakeholders to spread disinformation. ""During the last 15 years, and even after being exposed last year, the fact that this network managed to operate so effectively shows the sophistication and the drive of the actors behind Indian Chronicles,"" he said. Some of the many news sites the investigation found to be fake ""You need more than a few computers to plan and sustain such an action,"" he said. The researchers cautioned against ""definitively attributing Indian Chronicles to some specific actors such as Indian intelligence services"" without further investigation. Ben Nimmo, a disinformation network expert, told the BBC the uncovered network was ""one of the most persistent and complex operations"" he had seen, but he too was wary of attributing it to a specific actor. Mr Nimmo, who is director of investigations at digital monitoring firm Graphika, cited previous examples of privately-run large-scale troll operations. ""Just because they're big, it doesn't necessarily mean they're directly run by the state,"" he said. The BBC approached the Indian government for comment but had received no response by the time of publication. One of the most important findings of the open-source investigation was establishing direct links between the Srivastava Group (SG) and at least 10 UN-accredited NGOs, along with several others, which were used to promote Indian interests and criticise Pakistan internationally. ""In Geneva, these think tanks and NGOs are in charge of lobbying, of organising demonstrations, speaking during press conferences and UN side-events, and they were often given the floor at the UN on behalf of the accredited organisations,"" the report says. The investigation shows that the operation led by SG began in late 2005, a few months after the UNHRC was founded in its current form. One particular NGO which caught the eye of the researchers was the Commission to Study the Organisation of Peace (CSOP). The CSOP was founded in the 1930s and won UN-accreditation in 1975 but became inactive later in the 1970s. The investigation found that a former chairman of the CSOP -Prof Louis B Sohn, one of the 20th Century's leading international law scholars,externaland a Harvard Law faculty member for 39 years - was listed under the name Louis Shon as a CSOP participant at the UNHRC session in 2007 and at a separate event in Washington DC in 2011. The listings shocked the researchers because Prof Sohn died in 2006. Louis B Sohn ""appeared"" at events years after he died The authors dedicated their investigation to the professor's memory, writing that his name had been ""usurped by the malicious actors in this report"".  They said CSOP ""had been resurrected, and its identity hijacked in 2005 by the same actors depicted in our first investigation"". The investigation also shows there were several hundred pro-Indian interventions by the non-accredited NGOs, which were repeatedly given the floor at the UNHRC on behalf of the accredited organisations, pursuing the same agenda of maligning Pakistan. On other occasions, NGOs and organisations which seemingly had nothing to do with Pakistan or India according to their stated objectives would get the opportunity to speak at the UNHRC and target Pakistan. In March 2019, during the UNHRC's 40th session, United Schools International (USI), another UN-accredited organisation with direct links to SG, allowed its slot to be used by Yoana Barakova, a research analyst with an Amsterdam-based think-tank called the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS). Ms Barakova spoke about ""atrocities committed by Pakistan"" during the session. She told the BBC that EFSAS was a partner with USI and she was ""not responsible for organisational logistics"". The BBC received no reply when it contacted the director of EFSAS, who also represented USI at the same session to criticise Pakistan. Vast pro-Indian 'propaganda' network exposed Outrage over right-wing Euro-MPs' Kashmir visit India buzzes with fake news of 'civil war' in Pakistan Fake pro-China accounts exposed The primary news agency re-packaging and boosting pro-India content related to SG appears to be ANI, established in 1971, which describes itself as ""South Asia's leading multimedia news agency, with more than 100 bureaus in India, South Asia and across the globe"". Indian news media, especially broadcast media, thrive on content provided by ANI. EU DisinfoLab found at least 13 instances of ANI re-publishing mostly anti-Pakistan and sometimes anti-China op-eds by Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), originally published on EU Chronicle, one of the fake news sites linked to SG. EU Chronicle was born in May this year when EP Today, a site flagged in the previous disinformation report, was simply discontinued and renamed. The EU DisinfoLab report said: ""The actors behind the operation hijacked the names of others, tried to impersonate regular media such as the EU Observer... used the letterhead of the European Parliament, registered websites under avatars with fake phone numbers, provided fake addresses to the United Nations, created publishing companies to print books of the think-tanks they owned. ""They used layers of fake media that would quote and republish one another. They used politicians who genuinely wanted to defend women or minority rights to ultimately serve geopolitical interests and gave a platform to far-right politicians when convergent objectives could be reached."" Protesters demonstrate against Pakistan outside the UNHRC in Geneva last year Mr Alaphilippe said the news agency ANI was being used to give legitimacy to the entire ""influence operation"", which relied ""more on ANI than on any other distribution channel"" to give it ""both credibility and a wide reach to its content"". ANI's news reports have found space in many mainstream Indian news outlets and publishers. Its content was further reproduced on more than 500 fake media websites across 95 countries, the researchers found. Websites identified by the report as fake media outlets include those owned by Big News Network, which describes itself as a ""leading provider of news headlines with over 400 distinct categories of latest news"". In an e-mail to the BBC a Big News Network spokesman said that they are not associated with ANI, other than as a client which has for many years been a subscriber to their service. They add that their sites ""take news disseminated from the Big News Network database which comprises numerous sources"" including ANI and other agencies. Demonstrations in Europe conducted by organisations linked to the Srivastava Group have also been covered by ANI, as well as by fake media websites linked to SG. According to the findings of the investigation, the disinformation network had a two-pronged strategy to spread influence. In Geneva, the think-tanks and NGOs were in charge of lobbying and protesting, and taking the floor at the UNHRC on behalf of accredited organisations. In Brussels, the focus was on the MEPs, who were taken on international trips and solicited to write ""exclusive"" op-eds for fake outlets like EU Chronicle, which would then be amplified using ANI, the researchers found. A group of MEPs appear regularly in the investigation. One of them, French MEP Thierry Mariani, has written two op-eds for EU Chronicle and was also part of acontroversial visit to Indian-administered Kashmir last year. ""If the Indian government is behind the newspaper [EU Chronicle], it is not my problem,"" Mr Mariani, a member of France's far-right National Rally, told the BBC. Organisers and delegation members met Indian PM Narendra Modi during the MEPs' controversial 2019 Kashmir trip ""I sign what I want and I feel, it is my opinion. I have connections in [India's governing] Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and I support the government of [Narendra] Modi,"" he said. Two other MEPs named in the report - Angel Dzhambazki from Bulgaria and Grzegorz Tobiszowski from Poland - denied having written op-eds that were published on EU Chronicle. The articles under their names were also reproduced on ANI. How to spot a bot The human cost of 'fake news' Seven ways to stop bad information Asked what the EU is doing to fight disinformation networks, EU spokesperson on foreign affairs Peter Stano pointed to the action taken to expose EP Today last year. ""Exposing the disinformation and those who spread it is one of our main instruments,"" he told the BBC. ""We will continue to identify them and call them out."" But he said questions about finances and transparency of NGOs registered in Brussels were for Belgian authorities to answer. Rolando Gomez, a spokesperson for the UNHRC, told the BBC that it was the prerogative of NGOs to raise whichever issue they wish to address and whoever they grant space to speak on the floor. ""There are no rules stating that an NGO must speak to specific issues. Doing so would amount to infringing on their freedom of speech,"" Mr Gomez said. The International Institute of Non-aligned Studies is UN-accredited and openly linked with the Srivastava Group Gary Machado, managing director of EU DisinfoLab, said he thought the muted reaction to the revelation of the disinformation network was partly because it was ""clearly managed by Indian stakeholders"". ""Imagine if the same operation was run by China or Russia. How do you think the world would have reacted? Probably with international outrage, leading to public inquiries and probably sanctions,"" he told the BBC. But the activities of MEPs named in the report prompted criticism from some of their colleagues. MEP Daniel Freund from the Greens said fellow members needed to declare their activities. ""There have been at least 24 breaches of rules in the past years. Not a single violation has been sanctioned. So there is little incentive to respect the rules when the worst that can happen is to file a declaration after you have been caught,"" he said. Another member, who did not want to be named, said MEPs contributing to sites like EU Chronicles had been identified as ""election tourists"". ""A ragtag group of MEPs from the bottom of the parliamentary barrel who prefer to travel on sponsored trips by unsavoury governments rather than invest in their mandate,"" the MEP told the BBC. ""How PR stunts with such individuals could be even conceived as helpful is baffling."" The BBC put questions to ANI and to nine other MEPs who have written op-eds for the EU Chronicle and made visits to India, Bangladesh and the Maldives, but received no response. The investigations from last year and this year show a man called Ankit Srivastava at the centre of the entire global operation that was uncovered. More than 400 domain names have been bought through Mr Srivastava's private email address or through email addresses belonging to his organisations, the EU DisinfoLab investigations found. The Srivastava office gate, with the Indian Institute for Non-Aligned Studies and New Delhi Times on the right Then, there's a case of the mysterious SG-owned tech firm Aglaya. Its website has been inaccessible since at least February this year but in the past the company has advertised products for ""hacking/spy tools"" and ""information warfare services"". Aglaya's marketing brochure mentioned the ability to ""hamper country level reputations"" and described some of its services as ""Cyber Nukes"". In a 2017 interview with Forbes magazine, a man called Ankur Srivastava claimed he ""only sold to Indian intelligence agencies"". It's unclear what relation, if any, he has to Ankit Srivastava. A third Srivastava appears to be Dr Pramila Srivastava, chairperson of the group and mother of Ankit Srivastava. Dr Harshindar Kaur, a paediatrician from the Indian state of Punjab, told the EU DisinfoLab researchers that in 2009 she had been invited to the UNHRC in Geneva to give a lecture on female foeticide when she was threatened by a woman called Dr P Srivastava, who claimed to be a ""very senior government official from India"". Dr Kaur told the BBC it was Pramila Srivastava who had threatened her. The BBC emailed Ankit Srivastava asking him to respond to this and the other allegations in the report, but received no reply. When the BBC visited the firm's offices in Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave, staff there would not answer questions. What might happen to the network, or how it might evolve, in the light of the latest investigation is unclear. The authors of Indian Chronicles say their findings ""should serve as a call to action for decision-makers to put in place a relevant framework to sanction actors abusing international institutions"". Mr Alaphilippe said following the 2019 investigation there had been ""no official communication, no sanction, nothing. This passivity gave a message to Indian Chronicles: you've been exposed, but no consequences"". ""We think there should be consequences to disinformation and we expect actions to be taken. The biggest failure from institutions would be if another report is released next year on the same actors with the same techniques,"" he told the BBC. ""This would mean that EU institutions are ok with foreign interference.""

"YouTube said on Wednesday it would start removing content that falsely alleges that widespread voter fraud changed the result of the US election. The update applies to all new content, including videos from President Donald Trump. The company had previously labelled potentially misleading election videos, adding links to accurate information. YouTube said ""enough states have certified their election results to determine a president-elect"". Democrats have criticised YouTube for not doing enough to take down fake news and conspiracy theories on the platform. Mr Trump and senior Republicans have repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims that the election was ""rigged"". Trump's lawyers have failed to provide evidence of this. Facebook and Twitter grilled over US vote actions Twitter hides Trump's first tweet of the day 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked YouTube bans misleading Covid-19 vaccine videos The announcement comes after a ""safe harbour"" deadline - which sets a date by which states need to certify the results of the presidential election. ""Yesterday was the safe harbour deadline for the US Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect,"" said YouTube. It also said that the move was in line with its historical approach to US presidential elections. Examples it cited of videos it would now remove were uploads claiming that a presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. Last monthReuters identified several YouTube channels making money from ads and memberships,externalthat were amplifying debunked accusations about voting fraud. YouTube said that it has taken down 8,000 channels since September, for uploading ""harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies"". The latest move will anger President Trump and many Republicans, many of whom already believe Big Tech is biased against conservatives. The focus now moves to Twitter and Facebook as to whether they will follow YouTube's lead.

"Bee populations have been on the decline across the world Researchers have found that honeybees in Vietnam collect and smear animal faeces around their nests to prevent deadly raids by giant hornets. They say the finding is the first to document the use of ""tools"" by honeybees. The bees used chicken poo, buffalo dung and even human urine to defend their hives. Honeybees play a critical role in pollinating the plants humans depend on for their diet. The scientists behind the study,published in the journal PLOSE ONE on Wednesday,external, said the research was sparked when a Vietnamese beekeeper told them that the mysterious dark spots they had spotted at hive entrances was excrement. ""We thought that'd be crazy because bees don't collect dung,"" lead author Heather Mattila told AFP news agency. More 'murder hornet' nests likely to be found in US But the study confirmed that the poo was indeed a defence being deployed by the bees, specifically against giant hornets. It adds to ""an already impressive list of defences they have to prevent these hornets from destroying their colonies"", Dr Mattila, a biology professor at Wellesley College in the US state of Massachusetts, said. Bees are known for using a range of strategies to deflect attacks from predators. They have been observed physically shielding their colonies through synchronised body shakes, hissing, or enveloping encroachers in a ball until they overheat. This video can not be played Listen to the sounds of honeybee queens ""tooting"" and ""quacking"" Giant Asian hornets - up to five times bigger than honey bees - can slaughter a bee colony in a matter of hours. They can also inflict powerful stings on humans. The scientists found that the hornets were less likely to launch mass attacks on hives dotted with more faeces, and that they spent 94% less time chewing at the entrance if they did land. The use of excrement was particular to Asian honeybees, they added, saying their counterparts in Europe and North America lacked similar defences. Asian hornets have recently been detected in North America where they have been dubbed ""murder hornets"" for the threat they pose to local honeybees and ecosystems as well as concerns about human safety. Around 40 people are killed annually by the hornets in Asia, according to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington DC.

"A teenager given a tent to live in, and a child denied the chance to say ""goodbye"" to his dying mother feature in a report revealing heart-breaking decisions about children in care. The watchdog report also includes a case of siblings abruptly removed from a foster family wanting to adopt them. Another details how a fostered girl returned home to find her bags packed and a taxi to a hostel waiting for her. The cases are revealed by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman. Ombudsman Michael King said even one case like this was one too many, and urged all councils, when making decisions about children in their care, to ask: ""Would this decision be good enough for my child?"" None of the councils in England are named in the report. Cathy Ashley, of the Family Rights Group, said such poor decisions could be ""so damaging at a critical moment in the lives of children in care or at risk of care"". With the number of children in care at its highest for 35 years, and the pandemic increasing the pressure and strain on families and on children's services, this was very concerning, she said. The report - Careless: Helping to improve council services to children in care -  looks at the journey of children coming into care, creating stability, contact arrangements and eventually leaving care. It uses a litany of real life case studies. whose names have been changed to protect their identities, to show where things have gone wrong. One case featured was Albert who was 11 and living with foster parents, when he was told his birth mother had died. Four years later, during a review meeting, Albert learned his mother had been seriously ill and on life support. This was switched off without him being told, thus denying him the opportunity to visit her before she died. He also complained about the use of insensitive language and the way in which the information was shared with him. The council upheld the complaint. The ombudsman said young children needed to be able to understand the decisions being made by their corporate parents. The case of Billy, a vulnerable and troubled 17-year-old who was thrown out of his home by his father, is also highlighted The unnamed council offered him accommodation, but far from where he usually lived. Then rather than consider whether it should accommodate Billy nearer, the council gave him a tent to live in, followed by a static caravan. Billy's mental and physical health seriously deteriorated during his ordeal, and shortly afterwards, he was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 where he remained for nearly a year, the ombudsman said. It added: ""The council had seriously failed Billy by not offering him suitable accommodation under section 20 of the Children Act 1989."" The council awarded Billy Â£2,500 for the distress they caused and for placing him at risk. In another case, Tim and Nikki fostered two particularly vulnerable children when their birth parents were no longer able to look after them. After two years, the couple told the council they wished to adopt the children. But the council questioned the amount of money the couple requested to help them support these needy children, and they were also concerned about the children's academic progress. The council decided the children should be removed from Tim and Nikki's care without notice. There was no statutory meeting or evidence to support the council's claim about the foster parents. Social workers then collected the children from school and told them Tim and Nikki had gone on holiday. The ombudsman said: ""In this case, we used our powers to also consider the injustice the children suffered.  We found the children would have been harmed by the sudden removal from the home. ""While, happily, they were found another foster placement which became long term, the way the council acted denied them the chance to voice their own wishes on the matter,"" it said. Ms Ashley added: ""Putting the voices and experiences of children and families at the centre is key to getting this right."" President of the Association of Directors of Children's Services Jenny Coles said there had been a 34% increase in the number of children in care over the past decade, and that the availability of placements for children in care was a key issue for the majority of councils. He said; ""It is important that local authorities learn from their successes and also where things have gone wrong. ""The case studies in the report provide an opportunity for the sector to learn and subsequently improve practice.""

"People with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab, regulators say. It came after two NHS workers had allergic reactions on Tuesday. The advice applies to those who have had reactions to medicines, food or vaccines, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said. The two people had a reaction shortly after having the new jab, had treatment and are both fine now. They are understood to have had an anaphylactoid reaction, which tends to involve a skin rash, breathlessness and sometimes a drop in blood pressure. This is not the same as anaphylaxis which can be fatal. Both NHS workers have a history of serious allergies and carry adrenaline pens around with them. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? What you need to know about vaccine safety When can you get the Covid vaccine? Professor Stephen Powis, medical director for the NHS in England, said both individuals were recovering well. He said this was ""common with new vaccines"", describing it as a precautionary measure. Dr June Raine, head of the MHRA, said it was only right to take this step now that ""we've had this experience"". Reactions like this are uncommon, but do happen with other vaccines, including the annual flu jab. Several thousand people were vaccinated on Tuesday in hospital clinics on the first day of the UK rollout of the new Covid jab. Prof Peter Openshaw, an expert in immunology at Imperial College London, said: ""The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well."" This is a story to assess with your head and not your gut. No effective medicine is without side effects so you have to balance the risk and the benefit. Remember, one in a thousand of the entire UK population have died after being infected with coronavirus this year and that figure is rising daily. Two people, out of thousands vaccinated yesterday, had an allergic reaction which they recovered from. Such reactions can happen with any vaccine and are treated with drugs such as steroids or adrenaline. The trials reportedone possible allergic reaction,externalper thousand people immunised that may have been related to the jab. The MHRA has given targeted advice to those most at risk, but for the overwhelming majority of people, this changes nothing. More from James:What you need to know about vaccine safety The development came after the NHS has announced the vaccination programme will be expanded out to GP surgeries from next week. Doses are expected to be delivered to around 200 GP surgeries initially to allow them to start on Tuesday. The over-80s will be invited first. Once the first 200 GP practices have received their doses the programme will be expanded out to more than 1,000 surgeries - with each local area having a designated site. It means most patients will be invited to a GP centre that is not their usual one. Similar arrangements are being made in the rest of the UK. Dr Richard Vautrey, GP leader from the British Medical Association, said GPs were ""ready to go"". ""We have a wealth of experience in delivering vaccines - and will be able to do millions of people a week. It is really dependent on supply and how quickly we can get our hands on it."" Meanwhile, one of the key people behind another Covid vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca has played down fears the jab may not be effective in older people. Data published by the Lancet on Tuesdaysuggested there was a lack of certainty over the effectiveness of the vaccine in the over-55s. Prof Sarah Gilbert said older people were only recruited into the trials later in the process, and the next trial results provided were likely to include information about how well the jab worked in people over the age of 55. But she said there ""was no difference"" in the immune response seen in younger adults and people over 70 in earlier trials. This meant the regulator could support licensing of the vaccine to the elderly, she said. The MHRA is currently considering the Oxford University-Astra Zeneca jab. The vaccine is crucial to fast rollout as it is much easier to store and distribute, because it does not need to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures. There are more than 5 million doses of the vaccine currently in the country. The latestdaily figures for the UK,external, published on Wednesday, showed a further 533 people have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. A further 16,578 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the UK's total cases to 1,766,819. All's well that ends well?

"Food and drink supplies in the UK face more disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period than they did from Covid, the industry has said. ""There are 14 [working] days to go,"" the Food and Drink Federation's (FDF) chief executive, Ian Wright, told MPs. ""How on earth can traders prepare in this environment?"" he added. Noting that rules for sending goods from Welsh ports to Northern Ireland had only just been published, he said: ""It's too late, baby."" Uncertainty over a deal and new border checks would make it difficult to guarantee the movement of food through ports without delays, he said. Mr Wright was giving evidence to the Commons business committee on Brexit preparedness. He said there was a big concern that the problems would ""erode the confidence of shoppers in the supply chain"", adding: ""It has done very well over Covid and shoppers will expect the same thing over Brexit, and they may not see it."" PM: 'Sweet reason' can get us to post-Brexit deal NI food supply warnings 'taken very seriously' ""We can't be absolutely certain about the movement of food from the EU to the UK from 1 January for two reasons,"" Mr Wright said. ""One is checks at the border. The other is tariffs, and the problem with tariffs is, we don't know what they will be."" Mr Wright added: ""With just 14 working days to go, we have no clue what's going to happen in terms of whether we do or don't face tariffs. ""And that isn't just a big imposition. It's a binary choice as to whether you do business in most cases. My members will not know whether they're exporting their products after 1 January, or whether they'll be able to afford to import them and charge the price that the tariff will dictate."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Wright warned that while he expected Kent and Operation Brock to work ""reasonably well"", he was less confident about ports such as Holyhead, with goods heading to Northern Ireland. He called the Northern Ireland protocol a ""complete shambles"", adding: ""The idea that you can prepare for something as big as the change that's going to happen is ridiculous, it's a massive toll."" Mr Wright added that 43% of FDF members who supply Northern Ireland have said they were not going to do so in the first three months of next year. He told MPs that many companies had lost some of their customer base in the EU. ""The problem is, if there's any disruption to supply, you lose your customer pretty quickly and you do not get them back,"" he added. Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, told the committee that up to a quarter of the UK's financial activity was EU-related and that in the worst-case scenario, about 40% of that business could be lost. However, he added: ""We've not seen this vast shift in jobs and activity."" Instead, Brexit had acted as a ""strategic accelerator"", with firms taking action such as restructuring EU-based offices as standalone operations. Even so, he warned: ""This all comes ultimately at a cost."" Lloyd Mulkerrins of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that if tariffs were levied on parts and finished vehicles, the UK's car industry was likely to see a sales decline of 20% to 30%. Production would decline from as much as 1.6 million to just 800,000, he told the MPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"GMP faced ""unprecedented challenges"" during the first Covid lockdown, a senior officer said England's second-largest police force failed to record about 80,000 crimes in a year and closed cases without proper investigation, a watchdog has found. Inspectors said Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) service to victims of crime was a ""serious cause of concern"". HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said about 220 crimes a day went unrecorded in the year up to June 2020. Victim support charities said it was ""shocking"" while the Greater Manchester mayor apologised on GMP's behalf. In the 12-month period reviewed by inspectors, it was estimated the force had recorded 77.7% of reported crimes, a drop of 11.3% from 2018. HMIC's report,externalsaid about one in five of all crimes and one in four violent crimes reported to GMP were not recorded. The review also found officers prematurely closed some investigations on the basis the victim did not support police action. Police wrongly cancelled serious crime records Inspector Zoe Billingham said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the frequency of closed cases without a full investigation. ""In too many of these cases, the force did not properly record evidence that the victim supported this decision,"" she said. Inspector Zoe Billingham said she was ""deeply troubled"" by the number of cases closed without full investigation This was particularly evident in cases of domestic abuse, where seven in 10 were closed on this basis, Ms Billingham said. She said it was ""simply not good enough"" that, despite being urged by the watchdog to improve in 2016, ""concerns have not been addressed for over four years"". Ms Billingham did, however, acknowledge the force was taking action and had made a ""marked improvement"" in its recording of serious sexual offences and rapes. A further inspection will take place in six months. Charity Independent Choices said victims of domestic violence were ""extremely vulnerable"" Independent Choices in Greater Manchester said: ""It's extremely shocking for us, as a domestic abuse charity, to hear that 70% of all domestic abuse cases were closed prematurely by GMP."" Jo Roberts, manager of the charity, said: ""Victims of domestic abuse are extremely vulnerable and it takes so much courage to seek help in the first place so it is vital they get the right support and help when they report cases to the police. ""This could discourage victims from reporting incidents in future, potentially putting their lives in danger."" Women's Aid said it was alarmed by the findings too. It was ""crucial"" police and wider justice system listen and respond to the wishes and needs of survivors of domestic violence, Lucy Hadley, head of policy and campaigns said. ""Survivors and our member services continue to make clear that perpetrators of coercive and controlling behaviour are still not being held accountable - and, as today's report shows, a very high proportion of unrecorded crimes in the Greater Manchester Police region involved coercive control."" ""This means that patterns of abuse and harm are not being investigated, and opportunities to support survivors are missed."" Failing to report domestic abuse has ""a knock-on effect for future victims,"" Jane Gregory from the Salford Survivor Project said. The abuse will not be recorded onClare's Law register, she said, ""it may put other victims at risk"". The scheme - named after Clare Wood, 36, from Salford who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend with a record of violence against women in 2009 - allows the police to disclose information on request about a partner's previous history of domestic violence. Sarah Lewis, Greater Manchester Victim Support manager, said: ""We want victims to know we are here to support them regardless of whether they have reported an incident to the police. ""More needs to be done to strengthen victims' trust in the process so that they are not suffering in silence and feel supported and listened to when reporting crimes."" GMP Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said the force had ""robust plans"" to address the issues Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said the force was ""disappointed... particularly where we have let victims down"". He said GMP had a long-term ""robust"" strategic plan to address the issues raised and ""secure the best possible outcomes for victims"". The inspection had coincided withthe implementation of a troubled computer systemand ""unprecedented challenges posed by the first Covid lockdown"", he added. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham apologised on behalf of GMP. He said: ""I would like to say sorry to all of the victims of crime who have found that the service has not been good enough. ""We owe it to them to improve and we will and we will do it fast."" The region's deputy mayor for policing Bev Hughes said the findings were ""extremely disappointing"". She added that she had ""communicated my feelings"" to the force's Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, ""who must now move quickly to make improvements"".

"If at first you don't succeed you can try and try. But eventually, sometimes, failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the country towards a different future - a deal that, in theory, would ease the junction from membership of a huge trading bloc to a world outside. There is a chance still that a couple of frantic days could result in a change. The prime minister could decide that after all, the potential disruption of no deal is just too great to risk. The EU president might be able to persuade continental leaders to budge, as they gather in Brussels today. But the chance of reassessing and refreshing the efforts seem now remote. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? The talks between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen were difficult - the gaps between them no slimmer at the end than the start. The hoped-for mutual understanding, the nudge or wink to pursue compromise, did not come. The only agreement was on when they might call a halt. For the first time in a world of highly moveable deadlines,they announced that a final decisionmust be taken by the end of the weekend. Both sides want to stick to their principles. But that determination right now has set them on the path to the practical outcome they both wanted to avoid - and, if nothing changes, the chance of significant disruption at least in the short term for the country in many different ways. And for both sides, failing to agree would be a real political accident - something they don't want, and that didn't have to happen. One diplomat told me: ""It's dystopian - the UK wants to have the absolute freedom to do things it will probably never do - apart from some tinkering. The EU wants to protect itself from things that will probably never come."" People involved in the negotiations believed that there was a way through that could protect each part. But unless one side, or more likely both, are willing to give up some of their principles very fast, or the negotiators come up with a sudden miracle, then for all his optimism, Boris Johnson may fail to achieve the trade deal that Brexiteers boasted would be easy. A result that he always said he would be ready for, but no doubt what he wanted to avert. TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL YET: What are the sticking points in trade talks?

"Talks have ended in Brussels between Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Downing Street said ""very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged"" The two leaders will come to a decision about the future of the talks by Sunday Johnson and von der Leyen were working through a list of sticking points that have so far blocked a Brexit trade deal being agreed Three ""critical issues"" need to be resolved - fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not agreed by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force Jennifer Scott and Paul Seddon We're leaving it there for our live coverage this evening. As Boris Johnson returns to London after his Brussels dinner with Ursula von der Leyen the fate of Brexit trade talks hangs in the balance. To recap: The team with you tonight were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and editing Johanna Howitt. Thanks for following along with us. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent So No 10 describes tonightâs talks as âfrankâ, while Ursula von der Leyen says they were âlivelyâ. All diplomatic speak,
surely, for a difficult evening, and thatâs evidenced by whatâs come from it. Large gaps remain between the two sides, we're told. The point of this dinner
was to try and gives the negotiations, which had stalled, a political push. But itâs far from clear that the negotiators will enter the room tomorrow with
any kind of fresh mandate, or any more flexibility, than they had before. Meanwhile, Sunday is the latest deadline. A government source tonight said it really will be a firm end point - a day to decide whether a deal can be
done or if itâs time to walk away. Brexit deadlines have been missed before, of
course, but the ticking clock of the transition period tells us this canât go on
much longer. We now have an official statement from No 10 on tonight's meeting and here it is in full: The prime minister and President von der Leyen met for dinner in Brussels this evening.  The leaders had a frank discussion about the state of play in the negotiations. They acknowledged that the situation remained very difficult and there were still major differences between the two sides.  They agreed that chief negotiators would continue talks over the next few days and that a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks by Sunday.  The prime minister is determined not to leave any route to a fair deal untested, but any agreement must respect the independence and sovereignty of the UK. Downing Street spokesman UK PM Boris Johnson leaving the talks in Brussels earlier The SNP's leader in Westminster is warning against the ""self-harm"" of leaving the EU without a deal. Ian Blackford took to Twitter after the news broke from the Brussels dinner, saying: ""A no deal would be a massive failure of diplomacy and leadership which Boris Johnson has to take ownership of."" He said it would do particular damage in light of the ""health and economic impact"" of coronavirus. And he added: ""Disruption to trade, tariffs, higher prices and lost jobs is never a price worth paying."" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says he does not want to ""give false hope"" about getting a trade deal with the EU. Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, he said he had talked to the prime minister's team tonight and there were ""still very significant areas of disagreement"" between the UK and EU. He admitted things were getting close to the wire with the transition period deadline looming. And he said Sunday would be the ""decision point... whether ultimately there is a deal to be done or to accept disagreements are too great and we need to move forward"". But Jenrick promised ""concerted efforts to break those divides"" between the two negotiating teams, even if he believed the UK would ""thrive under any arrangement"" - or lack thereof. Since the news broke in Brussels that the latest Brexit talks hadended without clear agreementon a UK-EU trade deal, the UK newspaper front pages have started to come in. Both sides said a decision on the future of the talks should be taken by Sunday. Downing Street has published a number of pictures from the meeting in Brussels tonight... First, from left to right, is the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier Here are the two leaders just before heading into the dinner, discussing when to wear a mask ""After you prime minister"" - Von der Leyen points the way into the meeting We've just heard from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who says her three-hour long dinner with UK PM Boris Johnson tonight was ""a lively and interesting discussion"" on ""outstanding issues"":  "" We had a lively & interesting discussion on the state of play on outstanding issues. We gained a clear understanding of each otherÂ´s positions. They remain far apart. ""We agreed that the teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues.  ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend."" Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's been made clear Downing Street that tonight's meeting has not gone well. Reading between the lines, it appears tonight has been far from any kind of breakthrough. But in politics, in the whole Brexit process, the distance been Wednesday and Sunday is a very, very long time. So while this appears tonight towards being a big and significant step towards leaving the transition period without a firm arrangement in place, it's still not impossible a deal could happen. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, is one of the first UK opposition MPs to respond to the news from Brussels. She says the prime minister ""promised an oven ready deal"" for Brexit, and now ""needs to get it done so we can focus on what matters to the British people"". Allow Twitter content?

BBC Politics Discussions between Johnson and von der Leyen don't seem to have gone as well as some may have hoped. A senior source from No 10 said the leaders had a ""frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations"". But despite three hours together, ""very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged"". The source said there would be discussions over the next few days between UK and EU negotiating teams and the PM ""does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested"". They added the pair agreed ""a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"" by Sunday.

Talks between the UK and the EU are under way, in an attempt to secure a post-Brexit trade deal. If no agreement is reached by 31 December, charges will be introduced on many things the UK buys and sells, which could push up prices. But what is a trade deal, and how many has the UK struck around the world since it left the EU in January? You can read more here.  BBC Politics We are all waiting to find out how the meeting is going between the leaders. We know Johnson arrived shortly after 19:00 GMT, and they have been locked in a room since then discussing a future deal. But a spokesman from No 10 said the dinner was ongoing at 21:30 GMT. That's one lengthy meal... UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arriving in Brussels earlier for talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen In the last post we mentioned that, even though the UK left the EU on 31 January it continued to follow EU rules. And it will do so until 31 December. That 11 month gap is known as the transition period - or implementation period. So what is the transition period and why is it necessary? In short - yes - the UK has already signed a deal with the European Union. That was thewithdrawal agreement- or the 'divorce deal' - which passed in 2019, setting out the terms of the UKâs exit from the EU. Tonight's talks are about the next step: the possibility of a new trade agreement between the two sides. If they were to strike deal - it would set out new joint rules on how they do business with each other in the future. But time is running out - the UK will stop following current EU trading rules on 31 December. And just to quickly recap - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are meeting right now in Brussels to try to find a breakthrough in the âsignificant differences"" that remain on getting a deal.  BBC News Channel Tom Tugendhat also chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee. So that's who Ursula von der Leyen is, but why is she talking to Boris Johnson tonight? Well, it's because she's in charge of the European Commission, the Brussels-based body negotiating a trade deal on behalf of the 27 EU countries. But it's worth remembering that ultimately, the Commission negotiators will be taking their instructions from the European governments they represent. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat tells BBC News this means Mrs von der Leyen is ""a bit like the lawyer

"US federal regulators and more than 45 state prosecutors have sued Facebook, accusing the social media company of taking illegal actions to buy up rivals and stifle competition. The lawsuits are one of the most significant legal actions the US government has taken against the firm. Officials are asking the court to consider breaking up the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook said the deals under scrutiny were approved by regulators years ago. ""The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final,"" Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead said. She said the company had invested millions to make Instagram and WhatsApp successful and would defend itself ""vigorously"". ""Antitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses,"" Facebook said, describing the government's arguments as ""revisionist history"".

The lawsuits filed by the states and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) focus on Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, 2014 purchase of WhatsApp and rules governing outside software developers. Officials accused Facebook of taking a ""buy or bury"" approach to potential rivals, hurting competitors and users, who have lost control of their own data to support the firm's advertising revenue. The legal filings cite internal messages from Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, such as one 2008 email that said it was ""better to buy than compete"". ""For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the legal fight by the states. ""No company should have this much unchecked power over our personal interaction and social interactions. That's why we are taking action today."" It's quite hard sometimes to comprehend just how massive Facebook is. Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram - all owned by Facebook - all have more than a billion monthly users. WhatsApp and Facebook have more than two billion. What the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is arguing is that there's a reason why Facebook came to dominate this highly lucrative sector - it acquired the competition illegally. In 2012 Instagram was growing rapidly. Facebook was worried. Zuckerberg has admitted himself previously that Instagram was a competitor to Facebook. It was bought, for what now seems a ludicrously low figure of $1bn. WhatsApp too in 2014 was growing at incredible speeds. Was it going to threaten Facebook's own messenger service? Facebook bought WhatsApp too. Both of these acquisitions were previously looked at by the FTC and were approved. That is Facebook's argument - that they bought these companies when they were much smaller - that there was nothing pre-ordained about their success. In other words, don't punish Facebook for building strong American companies. Whether Instagram and WhatsApp will be cleaved off from Facebook will now be decided in the courts - and these antitrust lawsuits take time. There will also be ample opportunity for appeals. Don't expect a breakup of Facebook soon. But this is yet more indication of where the courts and politicians are now headed. Big Tech is a little too big in many peoples' eyes - and it needs to cutting down to size. The lawsuits come as US regulators are taking a closer look at the power enjoyed by tech companies. This summer,the bosses of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple were forced to testify before Congress, as part of a bigger investigation of their influence on the market. In October, the Department of Justice sued Google,accusing the search giant of violating US competition laws to maintain a monopoly on internet searches and online advertising. More than 2.5 billion people use one of Facebook's apps each day. The firm, valued at nearly $800bn, employs more than 56,000 people and reported more than $18bn in profit last year. The Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that has been pushing regulators to take a more aggressive stance against tech companies, said the lawsuits were a ""critical step"" forward. ""There's still more to do, but this is a big moment,"" the organisation wrote on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched the latest prototype of his Starship vehicle from Texas. Codenamed SN8, the uncrewed rocket lifted away from the Boca Chica R&D facility on what had been billed as a brief flight to 12.5km (41,000ft). The 50m-tall vehicle crashed on touchdown but Mr Musk was delighted with how much the test outing achieved. Before the flight, the tech billionaire had dampened expectations, warning his fans that some mishap was likely. Nonetheless, Musk has big hopes for the Starship when it is fully developed. He says it is the future for his SpaceX company. Starship will launch people and cargo into orbit, and the entrepreneur also envisages the vehicle travelling to the Moon and Mars. The SpaceX CEO praised his team, adding that the demonstration had acquired ""all the data we needed"". ""Mars, here we come!!"" he tweeted. The crash landing: Mr Musk calls it ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"" SpaceX: Musk's 'Mars ship' prototype aces 150m test flight Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronaut crew heads to orbit Elon Musk becomes world's second richest person The SN8 was given a nosecone and flaps for the flight The Boca Chica facility has developed a line of ever-more complex prototypes. The philosophy has been to test each iteration until it fails. Sometimes explosively. SN8 was the first to attempt a high-altitude suborbital flight. The plan had been to demonstrate some manoeuvres that mimicked a belly-facing re-entry to Earth's atmosphere, ending up with a flip back to the vertical just before touchdown. Most of this was achieved: a clean launch off the pad, a steady climb to altitude, followed by a horizontal descent. But it was when the Starship tried to flip back to the vertical that things started to go wrong. The vehicle came into its landing pad with too much speed, and promptly exploded on impact. ""Fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn, causing touchdown velocity to be high & RUD,"" Mr Musk explained on Twitter. ""RUD"" stands for ""rapid unscheduled disassembly"". A crash, in other words. Mr Musk will move swiftly on. He already has other prototypes at Boca Chica ready to take SN8's place. Allow Twitter content?

Visually, SN8 looked quite different from the test articles that had gone before it. The new vehicle was given three of SpaceX's latest methane-burning Raptor engines, a nose cone and aerodynamic control surfaces - the large flaps at its top and base. Just three Raptors today, but eventually the Starship will fly with six The Starship will eventually launch atop a booster called the Super Heavy. This will feature perhaps 28 Raptors, producing more than 70 meganewtons (16 million lbs) of thrust. That's much more than even the mighty Apollo Saturn 5 rocket, which sent men to the Moon. Both parts of the new SpaceX system - Starship and Super Heavy booster - will stand 118m tall on the launch pad. The two elements are being designed to be fully reusable, making propulsive landings at the end of each mission. Mr Musk is in a hurry to get to Mars In June this year, Mr Musk stated that Starship was now his number-one priority, beyond the Falcon rockets he currently routinely flies for satellite companies, the US Air Force and the US space agency (Nasa). He believes the Starship concept can transform the economics of spaceflight. The specifications call for more than 100-tonnes to be lifted into low-Earth orbit. This mass could include satellites, people and even hardware to build bases on the Moon and Mars. Nasa has already asked Mr Musk to examine the possibility of landing a Starship on the lunar surface in the next few years. The entrepreneur has in mind a higher objective and a faster timeline, however. Receiving an award last week from the Germany digital publishing group Axel Springer SE, he said he aimed to have people at Mars in the next four to six years. The SpaceX CEO is famous for his aggressive and overly optimistic schedules. He does, however, have a habit of proving critics wrong by eventually attaining his goals.
