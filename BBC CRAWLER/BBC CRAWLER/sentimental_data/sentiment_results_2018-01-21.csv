"This video can not be played Guests tried to escape by using bed sheets to climb down from balconies An eyewitness has told the BBC of the terrifying moment gunmen burst into Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel restaurant on Saturday. The man, who is not being named for security reasons, said he was spared after saying he was an Afghan. ""Where are the foreigners?"" they shouted. Fourteen foreigners are confirmed to have died, along with four Afghans. However, some media reports indicate the number of dead could be much higher. The interior minister said the recent decision to transfer security to a private company had been a mistake. Some 160 people were rescued after Afghan troops fought throughout the night to regain control of the building. Three attackers were also killed in the siege, officials said. Ten people, including four civilians, were injured. Kabul police told the BBC that nine Ukrainians, one German, one Greek and one Kazakh citizen had been confirmed dead. Two have yet to be identified. Afghan airline Kam Air says a number of its employees were killed and some are still missing. The Taliban,which targeted the hotel in 2011, says it was behind the latest attack. A spokesman said in a statement quoted by AFP that the group had ""killed tens of foreign invaders and their puppets"". Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new ""Great Game"" The gunmen burst into the six-floor hotel at around 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Saturday evening, as guests were enjoying dinner. The eyewitness told the BBC he was having dinner with his son when the gunmen began firing into the air with small arms. They killed a woman - believed to be a foreigner - and turned the gun on the eyewitness himself. He shouted ""I'm Afghan"". One of the gunmen shouted that they didn't kill Afghans and demanded to know ""Where are the foreigners?"" The men then ran out of the room to look for them. Haseeb, anothereyewitness told Tolo News that two of the gunmen had asked him to serve them food,externalfirst. ""They were wearing very stylish clothes,"" he said. ""They came to me and asked for food. I served them the food and they thanked me and took their seats. Then they took out their weapons and started shooting the people."" ""There were dozens of dead bodies lying around me."" Several guests were pictured using bed sheets to try to climb down from a top-floor balcony. Dramatic images on Afghan TV showed thick black smoke and flames rising from the imposing hilltop hotel. The hotel is a landmark in Kabul Several ambulances were on hand to transport the wounded to hospital Afghan special forces were lowered by helicopters on to the roof of the hotel during the night, an interior ministry spokesman said. They were working with Western special forces to bring the siege to an end. The ministry has promised an investigation into how the attackers breached security, which was handed to a private company two weeks ago. Hotel manager Ahmad Haris Nayab said the gunmen had entered the hotel through a kitchen. The Intercontinental is a state-owned hotel - not linked to the global hotel chain of the same name - which often hosts weddings, conferences and political gatherings. Security has been tightened in Kabul since last May, whena huge truck bomb killed at least 150 people. However, there have been several attacks in recent months.They include a bomb at a Shia cultural centre last monththat killed more than 40 people. Are you in the area?

"This video can not be played UKIP chairman Paul Oakden announces that party leader Henry Bolton has lost initial confidence vote UKIP's ruling national executive committee (NEC) has unanimously backed a vote of no confidence in party leader Henry Bolton. Mr Bolton has faced repeated calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his former girlfriend. But he has said he will defy the committee and continue as leader, as a contest would finish the party. Party members will now be given a vote on whether the former Army officer should remain in post. UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said Mr Bolton was ""disappointed"" by the NEC's decision but understood ""that the party has a process to go through"". ""Henry was offered the opportunity to resign but he has made clear that he feels he is the right man to lead the party forward,"" he added, after a three-hour emergency meeting to decide his future. The committee does not have the power to remove him - that can only be done by a vote of the party's membership. Who is Henry Bolton? UKIP MEP quits party over leadership UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Mr Bolton had earlier toured TV and radio studios, saying the committee had no right to pass ""moral"" judgement on his private life. He said he had ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with girlfriend Jo Marney after she sent texts saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. But he said he would ""support her in rebuilding her life"", which he said had been ""turned on its head"". If the former army officer were to step down it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Mr Bolton warned that another leadership contest could spell the end for the party, which is believed to be heavily in debt, and said calls for his resignation were part of a ""coup"" attempt by a rival faction in the party. ""If the NEC decides to go down the road of months of further in-fighting and further negative media scrutiny by deciding to pass a vote of no confidence in me, I think that the reality is that the party is probably over,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. He said the NEC should be focusing on ensuring the party's ""survival"" rather than discussing his leadership. The 53-year-old party leader, who left his wife prior to his relationship with Ms Marney, 25, became public, said: ""I don't believe I have done anything wrong. ""My own personal life, it's a little bit of a mess at the moment. I need to sort that out, of course."" UKIP said in a statement that, after a discussion of ""recent press coverage"" of the leader, ""the committee took the decision to hold a vote of no confidence in the leadership of Henry Bolton"". It added: ""The vote was carried unanimously, with the exception of the leader."" Under UKIP rules, an emergency general meeting must be staged within 28 days to endorse or reject the no confidence vote. Members will be told about when and where it will be held in the next 10 days. Senior figures have called on Mr Bolton - who won the leadership of the pro-Brexit party in October after a close-fought contest - to stand down to save the party. Neil Hamilton, the party's leader in Wales, said: ""He should now resign from UKIP immediately so we can get on with rebuilding the party without further distraction. ""If he forces us to hold an EGM, he will only humiliate himself further."" Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said Mr Bolton's position was ""untenable"" and that the controversy was ""damaging"" UKIP, and he offered to step in as interim leader.

"James Mattis flew in as Afghanistan's two top military leaders stood down US Defence Secretary James Mattis was filmed beside an open cargo door as he flew in to Kabul on Monday.  It was a glamorous image, but he could scarcely have flown into the country on a less auspicious day. In the morning both Defence Minister Abudullah Habibi and the Army Chief of Staff Qadam Shah Shahim had handed in their resignations in the wake of the Taliban attack on an army base outside Mazar-e Sharif on Friday.  It was the deadliest single attack on a military installation in the entire 16-year history of the Afghan conflict. When I was shown around the base the message was that although mistakes were made, the Taliban subterfuge had been particularly thorough. The Taliban fighters arrived in Ford Ranger trucks painted in a perfect facsimile of Afghan army vehicles.  They had full uniforms and plausible paperwork; one of the team was disguised as a casualty complete with a bloodied bandage around his head and an IV drip in his arm. This video can not be played 'The walls are pocked with gunshot fire' - Justin Rowlatt visits the site of the attack in Mazar-e Sharif But even this elaborate ruse should not have resulted in the carnage that ensued. The 10 Taliban attackers are believed to have killed around 170 Afghan soldiers. It was a major blow to morale in the military, but also in the country at large. No surprise then that the two top-level resignations were just the beginning of a unprecedented shake-up of the military hierarchy.  Four corps commanders - including Major Katawazai who was in charge of the base that was attacked - were suspended.  Meanwhile a further eight military personnel are being investigated, allegedly on suspicion that the Taliban attackers had help from inside the base. It leaves the Afghan military rudderless at a particularly dangerous time.  The Taliban now control more than a third of the country and traditionally there is an upsurge in violence as Afghanistan's bitter winter comes to an end: the so-called ""fighting season"". Officially the spring offensive has not started yet this year. Nevertheless last month the Taliban retook the key district of Sangin in the southern Afghan province of Helmand; a significant strategic advance. Insurgents targeted Afghan troops leaving Friday prayers at the mosque at the base in Mazar-e Sharif Damage to the base canteen shows the ferocity of the attack Public statements about the US mission have increasingly focused on the effort to tackle IS and other international terrorist organisations in Afghanistan. But the truth is the US recognises that the main threat to the Afghan government comes from the Taliban, and so the overwhelming focus of American involvement here remains anti-Taliban. Taliban successes in the almost two and a half years since the Nato combat mission in Afghanistan officially ended have led senior Afghan officials and American top brass here to argue that the US needs to boost its training and assistance mission.  The suggestion is a few thousand more troops are needed. That will certainly have been on the agenda of Defence Secretary Mattis as he met the Afghan president and other senior figures to discuss the Trump administration's evolving strategy here. Snipers and green tea on Helmand's frontline Horror at Kabul's military hospital Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' But many military analysts doubt that this will be enough to turn the tide.  Last year a record number of Afghan forces were killed - 6,800 in total.  That is three times the losses of American forces during the entire 16 years of this conflict. And many thousands more Afghan military personnel were either invalided out of service or simply deserted. It emphasises once again the key problems the Afghan forces face: inadequate training and a lack of commitment from recruits, exacerbated by terrible conditions, corruption in the officer class and poor air support. Today the office of the chief executive of Afghanistan, Abdullah Abudullah, announced a new defence minister had been appointed.  He was named as Tariq Shah Bahrani. Whether his appointment will be endorsed by parliament is another matter.  The National Unity government rarely lives up to its name.  During the almost three years it has held power it has been marked by deep divisions and open disagreements. With the army in turmoil, unity at the top levels of government is needed if a successful push back against Taliban advances is to be achieved.  Whether the current administration will be able to deliver that is another matter.

"The security situation is still precarious in many parts of the country Afghanistan's strategic landscape is changing as regional powers forge links with the Taliban and vie to outdo each other in what's being seen as a new ""Great Game"". Fifteen years after the US-led intervention in Afghanistan, competition for influence - reminiscent of that rivalry between the Russian and British empires in the 19th and early 20th Centuries, and that during the Cold War in the 1980s - is intensifying, complicating an already precarious security situation. Suspicion and mistrust remain the biggest obstacle to stability in strategically-located Afghanistan, which has the potential to destabilise the wider region. Pakistan, considered the main supporter of the Afghan Taliban, has been accused of playing a double game. But Afghan and Western officials as well as Taliban sources have also spoken about the Taliban's clandestine links with Iran for the past few years. And recently it emerged that Russia's ties with the Taliban were warming too. Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in 1988 - Russia now has links with the Taliban In December the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen John Nicholson, criticised Russia and Iran for establishing links with the militants, which both countries have confirmed. The US has also pursued contacts with the Taliban in recent years but those efforts have not brought peace. Several regional powers, most notably Russia and Iran, criticise the US and its allies for ""failing"" in achieving its original objectives of eliminating violent extremism and drugs in Afghanistan. Three major factors have contributed to the shifting of regional alliances: the emergence of so-called Islamic State in Afghanistan; changes in the approach of the new Afghan government; and tensions between the US and regional players such as Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan. The emergence of IS in Afghanistan - the group announced the creation of its Khorasan Province branch in January 2015 - provided Russia and Iran with the opportunity to make ""contacts"" with the Taliban. Gen John Nicholson (right) has criticised Russia and Iran for their Taliban links The US's decreasing military role in Afghanistan and a resurgent Taliban had contributed to creating a sense in regional capitals that Afghanistan's fate was up for grabs. The political infighting in the central government in Kabul also raised concerns about political stability both inside and outside the country. Over the past two years, alarm in Russia and former Soviet Central Asian republics grew as militancy spread to northern Afghan provinces close to their borders as well as to China's Xinjiang region. Conspiracy theories in Russia, Iran and China paint IS as an American or Western creation aimed at destabilising their countries. The government says it is cracking down on IS, some of whose alleged members have been paraded by Afghan police The emergence of IS posed a serious challenge to the supremacy of the Taliban but also encouraged Iran, China and Russia, who were fearful of IS expansion, to review their policies and open dialogue with the Taliban. Softening its approach towards the Taliban is a dramatic and unexpected shift for Russia. Moscow has for years opposed the Taliban, calling them terrorists, and supported the anti-Taliban ""Northern Alliance"" in the Afghan civil war of the 1990s. But faced with a common enemy in the shape of IS, Russia has changed its mind. In December 2015, a senior Russian diplomat declared that ""the Taliban interest objectively coincides with ours"" in the fight against IS and that his country and the Taliban ""have channels for exchanging information"". Taliban sources also confirmed that the group's representatives met Russians inside Russia and ""other"" countries several times over the past two years. But Moscow's current assertiveness in Afghanistan can also be seen as a tactic to put pressure on the US and to enhance its role and regional influence. Taliban contacts with Russia and Iran might also help Pakistan to distribute and dilute the international pressure it is under for hosting the Afghan Taliban leadership. Shared animosity towards IS has also brought the Sunni Taliban closer to their historic nemesis, Iran, a Shia powerhouse, whose clerical regime had previously viewed the Afghan Taliban as a major threat. Iran and its allies have been fighting IS in Syria and Iraq Like Russia, Iran supported the anti-Taliban groups in the 1990s. Tehran also co-operated with the US-led international coalition to topple the Taliban regime in late 2001. But, at the same time, Taliban sources say Iran sent them a message that it was willing to support them against the US. When the Taliban insurgency gained momentum in Afghanistan, Iran publically supported the US-backed Afghan government but reportedly kept a link to the Taliban alive. Since the emergence of IS (which considers Shia to be infidels), the Tehran-Taliban relationship has deepened. A delegation from the Afghan Taliban's political office in Qatar visited Iran in mid-May 2015 where the two sides discussed, among other things, ways to counter IS in Afghanistan. The Taliban supreme leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, was reportedly on his way back from Iran when he was killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Balochistan province in May 2016. The foreign policy of the Afghan government established in September 2014 has also altered political calculations. Hawks in Russia, Iran and China consider President Ashraf Ghani's government with suspicion and see it as too weak to deal with the multiple security challenges it faces. They also view Mr Ghani as too close to the US compared with his predecessor, Hamid Karzai. And some of Mr Ghani's decisions have raised eyebrows in regional capitals. Afghan security forces have launched operations against both Taliban and IS militants Soon after taking office, he said that improving relations with Pakistan was a top priority. While ignoring India, Pakistan's arch-rival but Afghanistan's traditional ally, the new president made several positive gestures to appease Islamabad. But that rapprochement ended within a year and Kabul and Islamabad reverted to hurling accusations at each other. Mr Ghani then revived Afghanistan's close relationship with India and on a few occasions seemed to be taunting Pakistan while speaking in India. His government also pledged support for the Saudi-led military coalition against Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen. That gesture was not received well in Tehran. These rivalries underline the nature and scale of possible troubles ahead. The Afghan Taliban had been largely dependent on their support base in Pakistan, a country where their leadership is allegedly living. Fears are now growing in Afghanistan that the Taliban are being used as a Trojan horse by state actors in three main ways: to put pressure on the Afghan government and its US/Nato allies; to increase the influence of individual countries; and to outdo one another in a regional competition. Talks have not yet led to peace with the Taliban The Taliban see their expanding regional portfolio and diplomatic push as evidence of their ""legitimate struggle"" - in some ways more important for them than material assistance. The price the Taliban ask has generally been for these countries to help them rid Afghanistan of foreign forces. In return the Taliban offer the following assurances: not to allow IS to establish a base in Afghanistan; to prevent foreign militants from using Afghanistan against these states; to keep their war focused on Afghanistan. Most US military personnel have left Afghanistan - there is little appetite for more losses among the US public Major regional players seem to have realised that they cannot rely on the US alone to sort out Afghanistan and stabilise the wider region. They are keen to make themselves much more relevant and are looking to play a more assertive role. They also insist that their ""contacts"" with the Taliban are aimed at promoting regional security. Afghanistan has been the scene of foreign interventions for a long time. The British and Russian Empires jockeyed for control during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. In the 1980s the US-led Western alliance helped Pakistan provide weapons and funding to Afghan mujahideen fighting to end Soviet occupation. Recent developments show the extent of a new ""Great Game"" taking shape. And once again Afghan civilians are caught in the crossfire. The UK, one of the original 19th Century ""Great Game"" players, has once again pulled out of the country The past few decades have shown that no country has the means to impose its will in Afghanistan on its own, but many actors have created disorder. Because a big part of the chaos in Afghanistan is rooted in the wider region, the solution needs  co-operation and a wider consensus. One positive outcome of the shifting regional alliances might be a more inclusive approach towards stabilising Afghanistan and its neighbourhood. Many Afghans are hopeful that Russian leader Vladimir Putin and incoming US President Donald Trump will improve bilateral relations, with a positive impact on the situation in Afghanistan. For many decades during its recent past, when it was left alone, Afghanistan was one of the most peaceful and stable countries. History shows that what Afghanistan needs is less foreign interference, not more of it. Who are the Taliban? Why are the Taliban resurgent in Afghanistan?

"Mylee Billingham died in hospital shortly after being found seriously injured An eight-year-old girl who was stabbed to death has been named as Mylee Billingham. West Midlands Police said she died in hospital shortly after being found seriously injured in Valley View in Brownhills, near Walsall, at 21:15 GMT on Saturday. A post mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Monday. A 54-year-old man has been arrested and is in a critical condition in hospital with a stab wound to the stomach. Midlands Live: Crash closes community centre; Jasper Carrott's tribute to Ed Doolan A police cordon was put in place around the property West Midlands Police said they were treating the stabbing as a ""domestic incident"" and would be questioning the man in due course. Det Insp Jim Colclough said no-one else was being sought in connection with the death and that investigations were continuing. ""This is an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and my thoughts are with everyone who has been affected,"" he added. Forensic officers have been at the scene On Sunday, a bungalow in Valley View was being searched by forensic officers behind a police cordon.

"The singer's remains are lying in repose in her home city of Limerick Hundreds of people have gathered to pay their respects to the late Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan in her home city of Limerick. Large crowds gathered for the event ahead of her funeral on Tuesday. Hundreds queued outside St Joseph's Church, where the singer's open coffin is lying in public repose until 16:00 GMT on Sunday. This is the public's first opportunity to see her body. O'Riordan died suddenly in London last week, aged 46. Many of those waiting carried yellow flowers such as daffodils, which they said represented sunshine. Inside, O'Riordan's own songs played quietly, and a floral tribute beside her coffin read: ""The song has ended, but the memories linger on."" In remarks carried by broadcaster RTE,Bishop of Limerick Brendan Leahy said the singer was a deeply loved and cherished daughter of the city,external, and a convinced advocate of living life in truth, love and peace. Dolores O'Riordan: Voice of a rebel The tragedy that inspired Zombie IRA victim's father pays tribute to O'Riordan Hundreds queued in Limerick despite the wet weather to pay respects Her remains will later be taken to a funeral home in nearby Ballyneety, where she will lie in repose on Monday evening before removal to St Ailbes' Church in Ballybricken, where a funeral mass will be held on Tuesday morning. The funeral service will be followed by a private burial attended by her family. Local radio will broadcast the funeral service live for those unable to attend. The Irish Times reports that she will be buried next to her father,externalTerence, who died in 2011. O'Riordan was discovered unresponsive in her hotel room in London on 15 January. It has now emerged she was due to discuss a new Cranberries album with her record label during her trip. Her publicist issued a statement saying that while she had been in the city for a studio mixing session with her other music group, D.A.R.K., she was also due to meet representatives of the BMG record label ""to discuss plans for the release of a new Cranberries studio album"". An inquest into O'Riordan's death, held at London's Westminster Coroner's Court, has been adjourned until 3 April while the coroner awaits test results. The Metropolitan Police have said they are not treating her sudden death as suspicious.

"The woman was captured during the battle for Mosul last year A court in Iraq has sentenced a German woman to death after finding her guilty of belonging to the Islamic State (IS) group. She was sentenced for providing logistical support and taking part in attacks on Iraqi security forces. The woman, who has not been named but is said to be of Moroccan descent, was captured during the battle for Mosul last year. Thousands of foreigners have been fighting for IS in Iraq and Syria. The court said she travelled from Germany to Iraq to join IS with two daughters, who married members of the jihadist group. She is thought to be the first foreign woman to be sentenced to death in Iraq for joining the group, reports say. Another German female, teenager Linda Wenzel, was arrested in Mosul at the same time for belonging to IS. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq?

"Mr Schulz (C) had initially ruled out a new ""grand coalition"" Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to start formal coalition negotiations with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. Ever since Germans went to the polls in September, the chancellor's ruling party has tried to form a government. Initially the SPD ruled out going back into government with Mrs Merkel's centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. But, after months of stalemate, they voted narrowly for formal talks. In-depth negotiations could start on Monday and Mrs Merkel is keen for them to wrap by 12 February. Merkel's coalition marathon keeps Germany waiting Angela Merkel's quiet power Germany country profile SPD leader Martin Schulz had at first refused to take part in a coalition but changed his mind when CDU/CSU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) won 94 seats in parliament in September's vote and became the third biggest force in German politics. Jenny Hill in Berlin It's fair to assume Angela Merkel has permitted herself a sigh of relief. Nevertheless the poker face was on for the cameras as she gave a brief statement welcoming the Social Democrats' decision to approve formal coalition talks. This is her last realistic shot at forming a government and avoiding fresh elections. It is far from a done deal. Many Social Democrats blame Mrs Merkel for a poor election result in September and there is still significant opposition within the party to another four years as her junior coalition partner. If and when talks produce a formal agreement, all 440,000 members will be asked - via a postal ballot - to approve the deal.  Mrs Merkel isn't out of the woods just yet. But she is a step closer to delivering the government, the stability she promised. This is Germany's longest post-war period of coalition-building. The SPD has governed jointly with the CDU for eight of the last 12 years. But after historically poor poll results for both parties in September, Mr Schulz had vowed to take his party into opposition. However,pressure mounted on the SPD since November, when Mrs Merkel failed to cobble together a coalition with the liberal FDP and the Greens. This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures The two parties held preparatory talks earlier this month to see if they could overcome key policy differences and establish a framework for how they would govern. Mrs Merkel has said she wants to win back voters who deserted her party for the anti-immigration AfD amid tensions over the influx of asylum seekers while the SPD stood for a more open immigration policy. Earlier this month the parties agreed to limit asylum-seeker arrivals to about 200,000 annually and may also cap at 1,000 a month the number of migrants who will be allowed to join relatives living in Germany. Mrs Merkel and Mr Schulz have both stressed the need to ensure Germany's ""social cohesion"". German official figures show that 280,000 asylum seekers arrived in 2016, a drop of more than 600,000 on the total for 2015. Arrivals fell after EU countries and Turkey tightened border controls. There have also been disagreements over issues such as taxation. German media reported that the parties had agreed to crack down on tax avoidance in the EU, plugging tax loopholes exploited by US tech giants and other big corporations Mrs Merkel could form a less stable minority government with the Greens, with SPD support. However, she has previously said she would prefer a fresh election to that eventuality.

"This video can not be played UKIP chairman Paul Oakden announces that party leader Henry Bolton has lost initial confidence vote UKIP's ruling national executive committee (NEC) has unanimously backed a vote of no confidence in party leader Henry Bolton. Mr Bolton has faced repeated calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his former girlfriend. But he has said he will defy the committee and continue as leader, as a contest would finish the party. Party members will now be given a vote on whether the former Army officer should remain in post. UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said Mr Bolton was ""disappointed"" by the NEC's decision but understood ""that the party has a process to go through"". ""Henry was offered the opportunity to resign but he has made clear that he feels he is the right man to lead the party forward,"" he added, after a three-hour emergency meeting to decide his future. The committee does not have the power to remove him - that can only be done by a vote of the party's membership. Who is Henry Bolton? UKIP MEP quits party over leadership UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Mr Bolton had earlier toured TV and radio studios, saying the committee had no right to pass ""moral"" judgement on his private life. He said he had ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with girlfriend Jo Marney after she sent texts saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. But he said he would ""support her in rebuilding her life"", which he said had been ""turned on its head"". If the former army officer were to step down it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Mr Bolton warned that another leadership contest could spell the end for the party, which is believed to be heavily in debt, and said calls for his resignation were part of a ""coup"" attempt by a rival faction in the party. ""If the NEC decides to go down the road of months of further in-fighting and further negative media scrutiny by deciding to pass a vote of no confidence in me, I think that the reality is that the party is probably over,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. He said the NEC should be focusing on ensuring the party's ""survival"" rather than discussing his leadership. The 53-year-old party leader, who left his wife prior to his relationship with Ms Marney, 25, became public, said: ""I don't believe I have done anything wrong. ""My own personal life, it's a little bit of a mess at the moment. I need to sort that out, of course."" UKIP said in a statement that, after a discussion of ""recent press coverage"" of the leader, ""the committee took the decision to hold a vote of no confidence in the leadership of Henry Bolton"". It added: ""The vote was carried unanimously, with the exception of the leader."" Under UKIP rules, an emergency general meeting must be staged within 28 days to endorse or reject the no confidence vote. Members will be told about when and where it will be held in the next 10 days. Senior figures have called on Mr Bolton - who won the leadership of the pro-Brexit party in October after a close-fought contest - to stand down to save the party. Neil Hamilton, the party's leader in Wales, said: ""He should now resign from UKIP immediately so we can get on with rebuilding the party without further distraction. ""If he forces us to hold an EGM, he will only humiliate himself further."" Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said Mr Bolton's position was ""untenable"" and that the controversy was ""damaging"" UKIP, and he offered to step in as interim leader.

The UKIP leader is preparing to face party chiefs at an emergency meeting of the NEC later. The committee does not have the power to terminate Mr Bolton's leadership - that requires a vote of the wider party. He has vowed to carry on as leader if there is a vote of no confidence in him. If the former army officer were to step down it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Senior UKIP figures have warned the party faces extinction if he continues as leader - but he claimed that could happen if it was plunged into another leadership contest. ""If the NEC decides to go down the road of months of further in-fighting and further negative media scrutiny by deciding to pass a vote of no confidence in me I think that the reality is that the party is probably over,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. He said the NEC should be focusing on ensuring the party's ""survival"" rather than discussing his leadership. ""Their job should be to ensure the party is capable of projecting its politics,"" he told 5 live's John Pienaar. ""They should be concerned more about the elements within the party that are busy and engaged with not in-fighting and in undermining party and its coherence. ""That's what the NEC should be focused on. They are not a court of moral judgement. While my personal life is obviously of public interest, this is a matter of the survival and future of UKIP - and that's what they should be looking at,"" he said. Former leader Nigel Farage has cautioned over another leadership contest On his relationship with Jo Marney, he said: ""She has been vilified and quite rightly criticised for the statements she's madeâ¦ She's out of the party and as far as the party and politics is concerned, that has moved on."" Former leader Nigel Farage - who isreported to be considering forming a new party or a cross-party Brexit campaign,externalif UKIP collapses - has said another leadership contest would be ""difficult"" for the party, which is believed to be heavily in debt. Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said Mr Bolton's position was ""untenable"" and that the controversy was ""damaging the party"". Mr Batten told BBC Breakfast he was willing to step in as an interim leader. He said: ""On Monday if Henry is still the leader of this party then we are going to lose members, activists, branches and donors - and this jeopardises the very existence of our party."" Patrick O'Flynn, UKIP's MEP for the East of England, told BBC One's Sunday Politics East that the party could be ""wiped out"" if it does badly in May's local elections. ""There's no doubt the party is drinking in the last-chance saloon,"" he said. ""If we get wiped out again in the district elections too, then maybe people are going to have to get round the table and say: Is the electorate trying to tell us something and is that 'thank you very much and goodnight'?"" Jonathan Arnott, UKIP's MEP for the North East of England,quit the party amid calls for Mr Bolton to step down, saying the leader was ""not the right person for the job"" and that UKIP's influence over Brexit was waning. He said UKIP had ""shifted"" its stance on religious and cultural issues to a degree he could not support.

"This video can not be played Sarah Smith spoke to the UKIP leader Henry Bolton. UKIP leader Henry Bolton has said the party's national executive committee (NEC) has no right to sit in judgement on his personal life. And he warned that UKIP faced extinction if the NEC voted to get rid of him as leader when it meets later. Mr Bolton has faced repeated calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his former girlfriend. He told the BBC'sPienaar's Politicsthe NEC was ""not a court of moral judgement"". He said he had ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after she sent texts saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family. But he said he would ""support her in rebuilding her life"", which he said had been ""turned on its head"". UKIP leader splits with partner Who is new UKIP leader Henry Bolton? The UKIP leader is preparing to face party chiefs at an emergency meeting of the NEC later. The committee does not have the power to terminate Mr Bolton's leadership - that requires a vote of the wider party. He has vowed to carry on as leader if there is a vote of no confidence in him. If the former army officer were to step down it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Senior UKIP figures have warned the party faces extinction if he continues as leader - but he claimed that could happen if it was plunged into another leadership contest. ""If the NEC decides to go down the road of months of further in-fighting and further negative media scrutiny by deciding to pass a vote of no confidence in me I think that the reality is that the party is probably over,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. He said the NEC should be focusing on ensuring the party's ""survival"" rather than discussing his leadership. ""Their job should be to ensure the party is capable of projecting its politics,"" he told 5 live's John Pienaar. ""They should be concerned more about the elements within the party that are busy and engaged with not in-fighting and in undermining party and its coherence. ""That's what the NEC should be focused on. They are not a court of moral judgement. While my personal life is obviously of public interest, this is a matter of the survival and future of UKIP - and that's what they should be looking at,"" he said. Former leader Nigel Farage has cautioned over another leadership contest On his relationship with Jo Marney, he said: ""She has been vilified and quite rightly criticised for the statements she's madeâ¦ She's out of the party and as far as the party and politics is concerned, that has moved on."" Former leader Nigel Farage - who isreported to be considering forming a new party or a cross-party Brexit campaign,externalif UKIP collapses - has said another leadership contest would be ""difficult"" for the party, which is believed to be heavily in debt. Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said Mr Bolton's position was ""untenable"" and that the controversy was ""damaging the party"". Mr Batten told BBC Breakfast he was willing to step in as an interim leader. He said: ""On Monday if Henry is still the leader of this party then we are going to lose members, activists, branches and donors - and this jeopardises the very existence of our party."" Patrick O'Flynn, UKIP's MEP for the East of England, told BBC One's Sunday Politics East that the party could be ""wiped out"" if it does badly in May's local elections. ""There's no doubt the party is drinking in the last-chance saloon,"" he said. ""If we get wiped out again in the district elections too, then maybe people are going to have to get round the table and say: Is the electorate trying to tell us something and is that 'thank you very much and goodnight'?"" Jonathan Arnott, UKIP's MEP for the North East of England,quit the party amid calls for Mr Bolton to step down, saying the leader was ""not the right person for the job"" and that UKIP's influence over Brexit was waning. He said UKIP had ""shifted"" its stance on religious and cultural issues to a degree he could not support.

"Turkish tanks rolled across the border into Syria on Sunday morning Turkish ground troops have crossed into northern Syria as part of a major offensive to push out Kurdish militia, which Turkey regards as terrorists. The Kurdish group targeted, known as the YPG, is active in the Afrin region, across from Turkey's southern border. It says it has repelled Turkish troops in the area, and retaliated with rocket fire on Turkish border areas. The militia forms a crucial part of a US-backed alliance battling Islamic State (IS) jihadists in Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to crush the YPG ""very quickly"", but the US is urging Turkish ""restraint"" in order to avoid civilian casualties. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? Turkey believes the group has links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a banned militant group. The Turkish government has for several months been threatening to clear Kurdish fighters from Afrin and another city, Manbij, some 100km (60 miles) away. The military operation launched on Saturday, ""Olive Branch"", is aimed at moving Kurdish forces from Afrin . Plans for the operation were believed to have accelerated when the US announced earlier this month that it would help an anti-IS alliance, formed of these Kurds and ethnic Arab militias, to build a new ""border security force"" to prevent the return of the jihadists. The YPG and the alliance, called the Syrian Democratic Forces, deny any terrorist links - a claim backed by the US government. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains On Sunday, Turkish troops accompanied by pro-Turkey rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA), began their advance into Syrian territory following dozens of air strikes the previous day. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the aim was to establish a 30km (19-mile) ""safe zone"" deep inside Syria. But a spokesperson for the YPG, Nouri Mahmoudi, said the Turkish troops had been ""forced to retreat"". Some 25,000 FSA fighters have joined the offensive on the Turkish side, rebel commander Maj Yasser Abdul Rahim told Reuters. It is not clear how many Turkish soldiers are on the ground. Turkey's military said it had hit 45 targets on Sunday, as part of its air and ground campaign. It earlier said dozens of air strikes had taken out 153 targets belonging to Kurdish militants. President Erdogan vowed on Sunday to crush the Kurdish fighters in Syria, as well as the PKK. ""Our jets took off and started bombing. And now, the ground operation is under way. Now we see how the YPG... are fleeing in Afrin,"" he said. He also warned that anyone joining pro-Kurdish protests in Turkey over the operation would pay a ""heavy price"". Police later dispersed demonstrators in a number of Turkish cities, including Istanbul, and made several arrests. There are reports of fatalities on both sides. The YPG said at least four Turkish soldiers and 10 Syrian rebel fighters supporting them were killed in clashes on Sunday morning, but there has been no confirmation from Turkey. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish air strikes had killed 11 civilians on Sunday. This follows at least nine deaths in strikes on Saturday - six civilians and three fighters - though Ankara said they were all Kurdish militants. Kurdish rockets also hit the Turkish border towns of Kilis and Reyhanli at the weekend, with casualties reported. Turkey's military has been shelling the Afrin region since Thursday, a move which it said was in response to fire coming from the area. Western powers, including the US and France, are urging restraint, and the UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency debate on Monday. ""They warned us before they launched the aircraft they were going to do it, in consultation with us. And we are working now on the way ahead,"" US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Sunday. ""We'll work this out,"" he added. The two sides have been exchanging fire for several days now Syrian President Bashar al-Assad condemned the incursion, saying: ""The brutal Turkish aggression"" on Afrin was part of Ankara's policy of ""support for terrorism"" in Syria. Russia - a key ally of President Assad - also said it was concerned by the news, and withdrew some of its troops based in the area. Moscow will demand Turkey halt its military operations at the UN meeting, according to Russian senator Frants Klintsevich, who is the deputy chairman of the defence and security committee. Iran, another Syria ally, called for a quick end to the operation ""to prevent a deepening of the crisis"" in Syria. Why Turkey targets Syria town Why is Turkey attacking Syria?

"Hyon Song-wol, pictured centre, was the star attraction during the visit to South Korea A North Korean delegation has arrived in South Korea for a landmark visit to inspect cultural venues for next month's Winter Olympics. It is headed by Hyon Song-wol, leader of the popular Moranbong girl band and a big celebrity in the secretive state. North Korea agreed to send a delegation to the games after the first high-level bilateral talks in two years. The decision is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after months of tension over its nuclear weapons programme. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy Reality Check: How good is North Korea at sport? Local media showed the North Korean delegation crossing the heavily-fortified border on a bus before arriving in the South Korean capital, Seoul. The delegation arrived at the Grand Unification Bridge, from where they crossed into the South The games are seen as a way of easing tension between the North and South Surrounded by hundreds of police officers, they then boarded a train to the eastern city of Gangneung. But it was on Hyon Song-wol that South Korea's cameras were focused. She and her 10-member Moranbong band are the glamorous face of North Korea - and have been described as Pyongyang's answer to the Spice Girls. Often seen wearing miniskirts and high heels, they perform a mixture of Western-style pop and patriotic songs - in a style seen as quaintly provincial by South Koreans, AFP news agency reports. Ms Hyon was once rumoured to have been a former girlfriend of the leader Kim Jong-un, although this has been dismissed by North Korea watchers. She will lead the 140-member Samjiyon art troupe, which is due to give two performances - one in Seoul and another in Gangneung - during the Olympics. North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive The coach who helped North Korea's skaters qualify for the Olympics The delegation's two-day visit is expected to be the first of several to prepare for Pyongyang's participation in the games. It is the first visit by Pyongyang officials to the South for four years, reports say. The delegation includes athletes, officials and cheerleaders. Another team will visit the South this week to check logistics for North Korean athletes, while Seoul will send its own officials to the North's ski resort to inspect the venue.

"Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston A police officer will not face prosecution over the death of Rashan Charles. The 20-year-old died on 22 July after being chased into a shop in Dalston, east London and apprehended by police. A common assault charge against a Met Police officer was considered by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), but it said the ""evidential test"" had not been met. The Met Police said it ""had nothing to add"" to the decision. The force said Mr Charles was taken ill and was later pronounced dead at the Royal London Hospital. His death sparked violent clashes in Hackney, with protesters throwing fireworks and bottles at riot police. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Rashan Charles The Independent Office for Police Conduct referred a file of evidence to the CPS in relation to one Met Policeâ officer for a possible charge of common assault. In a statement, the CPS said charges would not be pressed. ""The CPS has considered the matter and decided the evidential test for a prosecution for common assault is not met,"" it added. ""We will therefore not be taking any further action regarding this offence."" Leroy Logan MBE, a retired Metropolitan Police superintendent, criticised the decision not to charge the officer. Rashan Charles's death led to protests in Hackney He said: ""To be quite honest, it is another slap in the face for families of bereaved families who believe the police are untouchable. ""It is something that needs to change."" Civil rights campaigner Lee Jasper, who knows Mr Charles' family, said they were ""deeply upset"" by the news. ""Their reaction this morning was one of complete horror and surprise,"" he said. ""The family are devastated, angry and upset that once again they have been denied an opportunity to access justice. ""All along the family have received rejection and rebuttal to bring accountability and transparency to this process."" An inquest into Mr Charles's death is expected to be held in front of a jury on 4 June. At a pre-inquest review in November, all officers involved in the death were granted anonymity, despite the coroner Mary Hassell rejecting claims there was a ""direct threat to officers' lives"".

"This video can not be played National Autistic Society's Sarah Lambert: Blue badges give ""reassurance"" People with hidden disabilities such as dementia and autism could be given blue badge parking permits in England under new government proposals. The Department for Transport said that only some councils currently recognised hidden disabilities. It said the proposed new policy was designed to provide ""clear and consistent"" guidelines. Mental health campaigners welcomed the proposals for providing a ""lifeline"" to many people with hidden disabilities. It is hoped the proposals, being put to an eight-week consultation, would create parity in the treatment of physical and mental health. If they go ahead, it will be the biggest change to the blue badge scheme since it was introduced in 1970. Around 2.4 million people have blue badges in England, which allows them to park for free in some pay and display bays, use disabled parking bays, and stay for up to three hours on yellow lines. In London blue badge holders are exempt from paying the congestion charge. Brian Beatson was in the RAF and still goes to air shows - but his son says parking is a problem Richard Beatson said blue badges would be a ""big bonus"" when taking his father Brian, who is known as Sam and has Alzheimer's, on family trips to the shops and to air shows. ""My dad loves aviation - he was in the RAF,"" he said. ""He'd watch the red arrows and then five minutes later wonder when they were going to fly over."" But Mr Beatson, from North Wales, said people with Alzheimer's may often be in a ""world of their own"" and put themselves in danger. He said he has to think ""long and hard"" about how to get his father safely to and from car parks, since he is not entitled to a blue badge. ""Parking nearer would be a big bonus,"" he said. ""If you're taking them to a garden centre or an event, car parks can be a long way away from entrances. ""I ended up printing a disabled symbol and ask people on the gate if they'd mind letting us park closer. ""The closer you can make it, the better. It's an unseen illness,"" he said. Transport minister Jesse Norman said blue badges give people with disabilities the freedom to get jobs, see friends or go to the shops ""with as much ease as possible"". He said: ""We want to try to extend this to people with invisible disabilities."" The Department for Transport said about 75% of badge users said they would go out less often if they didn't have the flexibility to park with a blue badge. The National Autistic Society has been campaigning for this change and its head of policy, Sarah Lambert, said it could provide a lifeline to many autistic people. She told the BBC: ""There are some families that sometimes don't go out because they're worried about the stress that is going to be caused if it's very busy and very crowded. Council plans fees for disabled parking Autistic boy's mum refused badge Mother's mental health bid hits milestone ""For lots of autistic people, they don't have as good an understanding of danger as others, so we know that some families are worried about their children running out in front of cars."" Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, welcomed the changes, saying: ""By looking at non-visible illness, we can actually change the perceptions of mental illness. ""It's the first time that the government has shown that it's going to fulfil a parity of esteem between physical and mental illness,"" she said. The National Police Autism Association, which supports officers affected by autism, Asperger's Syndrome and other conditions, said it was ""great news"" for drivers on the autism spectrum. ""Access to disabled parking eases the stress of trips out and makes independent living easier,"" it said.

"Turkish tanks rolled across the border into Syria on Sunday morning Turkish ground troops have crossed into northern Syria as part of a major offensive to push out Kurdish militia, which Turkey regards as terrorists. The Kurdish group targeted, known as the YPG, is active in the Afrin region, across from Turkey's southern border. It says it has repelled Turkish troops in the area, and retaliated with rocket fire on Turkish border areas. The militia forms a crucial part of a US-backed alliance battling Islamic State (IS) jihadists in Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to crush the YPG ""very quickly"", but the US is urging Turkish ""restraint"" in order to avoid civilian casualties. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? Turkey believes the group has links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a banned militant group. The Turkish government has for several months been threatening to clear Kurdish fighters from Afrin and another city, Manbij, some 100km (60 miles) away. The military operation launched on Saturday, ""Olive Branch"", is aimed at moving Kurdish forces from Afrin . Plans for the operation were believed to have accelerated when the US announced earlier this month that it would help an anti-IS alliance, formed of these Kurds and ethnic Arab militias, to build a new ""border security force"" to prevent the return of the jihadists. The YPG and the alliance, called the Syrian Democratic Forces, deny any terrorist links - a claim backed by the US government. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains On Sunday, Turkish troops accompanied by pro-Turkey rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA), began their advance into Syrian territory following dozens of air strikes the previous day. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the aim was to establish a 30km (19-mile) ""safe zone"" deep inside Syria. But a spokesperson for the YPG, Nouri Mahmoudi, said the Turkish troops had been ""forced to retreat"". Some 25,000 FSA fighters have joined the offensive on the Turkish side, rebel commander Maj Yasser Abdul Rahim told Reuters. It is not clear how many Turkish soldiers are on the ground. Turkey's military said it had hit 45 targets on Sunday, as part of its air and ground campaign. It earlier said dozens of air strikes had taken out 153 targets belonging to Kurdish militants. President Erdogan vowed on Sunday to crush the Kurdish fighters in Syria, as well as the PKK. ""Our jets took off and started bombing. And now, the ground operation is under way. Now we see how the YPG... are fleeing in Afrin,"" he said. He also warned that anyone joining pro-Kurdish protests in Turkey over the operation would pay a ""heavy price"". Police later dispersed demonstrators in a number of Turkish cities, including Istanbul, and made several arrests. There are reports of fatalities on both sides. The YPG said at least four Turkish soldiers and 10 Syrian rebel fighters supporting them were killed in clashes on Sunday morning, but there has been no confirmation from Turkey. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Turkish air strikes had killed 11 civilians on Sunday. This follows at least nine deaths in strikes on Saturday - six civilians and three fighters - though Ankara said they were all Kurdish militants. Kurdish rockets also hit the Turkish border towns of Kilis and Reyhanli at the weekend, with casualties reported. Turkey's military has been shelling the Afrin region since Thursday, a move which it said was in response to fire coming from the area. Western powers, including the US and France, are urging restraint, and the UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency debate on Monday. ""They warned us before they launched the aircraft they were going to do it, in consultation with us. And we are working now on the way ahead,"" US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Sunday. ""We'll work this out,"" he added. The two sides have been exchanging fire for several days now Syrian President Bashar al-Assad condemned the incursion, saying: ""The brutal Turkish aggression"" on Afrin was part of Ankara's policy of ""support for terrorism"" in Syria. Russia - a key ally of President Assad - also said it was concerned by the news, and withdrew some of its troops based in the area. Moscow will demand Turkey halt its military operations at the UN meeting, according to Russian senator Frants Klintsevich, who is the deputy chairman of the defence and security committee. Iran, another Syria ally, called for a quick end to the operation ""to prevent a deepening of the crisis"" in Syria. Why Turkey targets Syria town Why is Turkey attacking Syria?

"There has been heavy snowfall across large parts of the country, including in Kinlochewe Heavy snow has caused travel chaos on roads in Scotland as motorists faced hazardous driving conditions as the weather deteriorated. Five people were hurt in a two-car crash near the Glencoe Mountain Resort on the A82 on Sunday. Local police asked drivers to avoid the area, who described the conditions in the area as ""extremely poor"". A Met Officeyellow weather warning,externalfor snow and ice was in force earlier in the day. At the height of the problems at Glencoe, the road was closed while police dealt with the aftermath of the accident. 'Six mile tailback' at Scottish ski resort Climbers rescued from snow-covered ridge Insp Jen Valentine urged people in the ski resort and in homes and hotels in the area to stay put. She said: ""We have officers at the scene of the collision and the weather conditions in the area are extremely poor. ""We have closed the A82 while we deal with the collision and get those injured off to hospital and I would ask that drivers avoid the area in the meantime. ""For those who are currently at Glencoe Mountain Resort or at home, hotels or restaurants in the area I would urge them to stay where they are and stay safe and warm as there will potentially be a significant delay due to road conditions in getting people out of the area."" Glasgow Airport had to be closed while the runway was cleared The road was later opened to traffic leaving the ski centre but it remained closed to all other vehicles as road conditions remained ""challenging"" with drifting snow. It came a day after police reported six-mile queues of traffic around the ski resort, as people tried to get on the slopes. Police said the snow gates on the A9 at Dalwhinnie had been closed due to the conditions. And ScotRail tweeted that due to the conditions at Dalwhinnie, services between Inverness and Glasgow Queen Street and Inverness and Edinburgh may be delayed by up to 70 minutes. Delays were also experienced on the A1 near Reston for more than four hours after a car transporter ended up across the road, blocking the road completely. The road has since reopened. Delays were caused when a car transporter blocked the A1 at Reston Motorists in Dumfries and Galloway were asked not to make unnecessary journeys The roads around the Keir roundabout at Dunblane were gritted Earlier drivers in the south-west were urged to ""avoid unnecessary journeys"" following a spate of road accidents. Police said heavy snowfall across Dumfries and Galloway was causing problems on roads including the A75, which was blocked at the Glen for a short time. Police later said it had been gritted and was ""passable with care"". Heavy snow was also affecting the A76, the A701, the A709  and the A713 Castle Douglas - Ayr road, where there were a number of accidents. In their latest statement, police in Dumfries said: ""If you are having to drive, please slow down and drive to the conditions."" Traffic Scotland also urged drivers to check their routes before setting off and to ensure they were carrying emergency supplies in case they get stuck. Police Scotland's control room said they were dealing with a number of weather-related incidents and road closures. Glasgow Airport was closed for a short time while the runway was cleared of snow. There was heavy snow in Newton Mearns at 13:00 on Sunday The snow has been affecting a number of roads in Scotland, including the M77 Heavy snow has also been falling in Glasgow North Wales Police also warned of poor conditions on the roads due to snow and ice, particularly on routes in Snowdonia. Meanwhile, the Mountain Road was closed on the Isle of Man due to snow. In Northern Ireland, a yellow warning of ice was in force until 09:00 on Sunday, while a yellow warning of rain runs until 15:00. The yellow ""be aware"" warning covers much of inland Scotland, and was later extended to cover the north-west Highlands and parts of the Western Isles. Large swathes of England may also be affected, with areas as far south as Hertfordshire, Essex and Suffolk covered by the warning. The radar shows snow falling on large parts of central and southern Scotland and Cumbria at 11:00. The snow is expected to turn to rain later on Sunday Saturday night saw the coldest temperature recorded in the UK since February 14 2016, when -14.1C was recorded at Braemar. Despite the frigid temperatures in the far north, the mercury rose to 11C in the far south west of England. Met Office forecaster Steven Keate said the near 20C difference, caused as warmer air moves in, was ""pretty unusual for the UK"". ""The broad theme is it is turning milder from the west, but before we get there some snow will fall,"" he said. Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in traffic on the M74 on Tuesday night Yellow: Severe weather expected. Yellow means you should plan ahead thinking about possible travel delays, or the disruption of your day-to-day activities. Amber: Be prepared for disruption. There is an increased likelihood of bad weather affecting you, which could potentially disrupt your plans and possibly cause travel delays, road and rail closures, interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property. Red: Extreme weather is expected. Red means you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the weather. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely. You must avoid dangerous areas and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.

"This video can not be played Guests tried to escape by using bed sheets to climb down from balconies An overnight siege of a luxury hotel by gunmen in the Afghan capital has come to an end, security forces say. Six civilians, including a foreign woman, died at the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, along with three attackers, the interior ministry said. Some 160 people were rescued after Afghan troops fought through the night to regain control of the building. Some reports suggested gunfire had continued for some time after the authorities declared the siege over. Afghan news agency Tolo says the death toll could be higher than the official figure, quoting a reporter who said they had seen dozens of bodies inside the hotel. Allow Twitter content?

Afghan airline Kam Air told local journalist Bilal Sarwary it had 42 members of staff in the hotel, some of whom are foreign nationals; 18 are still missing with five feared dead. The Taliban,which targeted the hotel in 2011, says it was behind the latest attack. A spokesman said in a statement quoted by AFP that the group had ""killed tens of foreign invaders and their puppets"". The gunmen burst into the six-floor hotel at around 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Saturday evening, as guests were enjoying dinner. Afghan Telecom regional director Aziz Tayeb, who was one of dozens of guests due to attend an IT conference at the hotel on Sunday, said he saw the attackers arrive as he was heading towards the exit. ""Everything became chaotic in a moment,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""I hid behind a pillar and I saw people who were enjoying themselves a second ago screaming and fleeing like crazy, and some of them falling down, hit by bullets."" The gunmen - armed with rocket-propelled grenades as well as smaller weapons - stormed through the hotel taking many of the guests hostage. ""They were shouting... 'Don't leave any of them alive, good or bad. Shoot and kill them all,"" another guest, Abdul Rahman Naseri, said. Several guests were pictured using bed sheets to try to climb down from a top-floor balcony. One of them, Mohammad Musa, said his roommate suggested they escape that way after a fire broke out on their floor. ""I tried to come down but I was heavy and my arms were not strong enough,"" he said. ""I fell down and injured my shoulder and leg."" Dramatic images on Afghan TV showed thick black smoke and flames rising from the imposing hilltop hotel. The hotel is a landmark in Kabul Several ambulances were on hand to transport the wounded to hospital Afghan special forces were lowered by helicopters on to the roof of the hotel during the night, an interior ministry spokesman said. They were working with Western special forces to bring the siege to an end. Forty-one foreigners were among those rescued and seven people were wounded, according to figures from the interior ministry. The ministry has promised an investigation into how the attackers breached security, which was handed to a private company two weeks ago. Hotel manager Ahmad Haris Nayab said the gunmen had entered the hotel through a kitchen. Saturday's siege comes just days after the US embassy in Kabul issued a warning about hotels in the city. ""We are aware of reports that extremist groups may be planning an attack against hotels in Kabul,""the embassy wrote in a public security alert published Thursday,external, though it highlighted another hotel near the international airport as a possible target.

"This video can not be played Guests tried to escape by using bed sheets to climb down from balconies An eyewitness has told the BBC of the terrifying moment gunmen burst into Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel restaurant on Saturday. The man, who is not being named for security reasons, said he was spared after saying he was an Afghan. ""Where are the foreigners?"" they shouted. Fourteen foreigners are confirmed to have died, along with four Afghans. However, some media reports indicate the number of dead could be much higher.

Some 160 people were rescued after Afghan troops fought throughout the night to regain control of the building. Three attackers were also killed in the siege, officials said.

"This video can not be played Republican Leader Senator Mitch McConnell accused the Democrats of ""irresponsible political games"" US senators are struggling to agree on a bill to fund the government, which is in its second day of shutdown. A Senate session session adjourned late on Sunday and a vote has been postponed to midday (17:00 GMT) on Monday. Democratic and Republican senators have so far traded blame for the shutdown. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no deal is possible while federal government services are closed. Mr Trump has called for a simple majority vote to end the impasse. Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to overcome blocking tactics by opponents. The Republicans currently have 51 senators and would need some Democratic support to pass a budget. But Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple-majority vote was necessary.

The initial vote on a bill to fund the government until 8 February had been scheduled for 01:00 on Monday (06:00 GMT). But it was postponed as Sunday's session ended. On Monday the closure of many federal services will be felt around the country and hundreds of thousands of federal staff face unpaid leave. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party, the Republicans, controls both Congress and the White House. Friday's vote fell 50-49, far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. ""I hope it is just a matter of hours or days. But we need to have a substantive answer, and the only person who can lead us to that is President Trump. This is his shutdown,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told the CBS network.

"The government will stop workers' pensions being put at risk from ""executives who try to line their own pockets"", the prime minister has said. Inthe Observer,external, Theresa May said a government white paper would set out ""tough new rules"" for company bosses. It comes after it emerged that the collapse of construction firm Carillion could leave itspension scheme with a deficit of as much as Â£900m. Labour said ministers also had to be held to account for firms' failings. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink? Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Labour 'would nationalise NHS cleaning' In her comment piece, Mrs May stressed that it would be Carillion shareholders, not taxpayers, ""who pay the price for the company's collapse"". She said the government would not be writing the company's directors a blank cheque, but would be ""stepping in and supporting those affected"". She also defended using the private sector to complete public projects. It was earlier reported that Carillion's defined benefit pension scheme has a deficit of Â£580m, although this figure could be as high as Â£900m. Defined benefit (DB) schemes, which are based on a worker's final salary or their career average earnings, are currently being examined by the government. The Department for Work and Pensions isexpected to release a White Paper,externalin March, detailing new legislation on protecting DB schemes. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the paper would outline proposals regarding directors who ""raid"" company pension pots. She told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the role of the pensions regulator, as well as company law, would be consulted on. ""Where people filch from the public purse, where there are issues and they let down pension funds, they let down people who work for their company. ""Then they do need to be dealt with,"" she said. Labour's Baroness Chakrabarti said: ""It's all very well for Mrs May to now say she's going to sting these executives. ""There's got to be a bit of ministerial responsibility in all of this as well."" The shadow attorney general told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""What we need is oversight. Of course we want a thriving private sector, but some vital services need to be run by public servants and with ministers held to account."" The management of pension schemes, and the perceived lack of protection and security, has caused public outcry in recent years. Following the collapse of BHS it was found that there was a Â£571m deficit in the pension scheme. Last year, former BHS ownerSir Philip Green came to an agreement with the pensions regulatorto pay back Â£363m into the pension scheme for the company. Despite the recent collapse of Carillion, one of the government's biggest private contractors, Mrs May defended the government's use of public-private partnerships. She said the ""private sector plays a valuable role helping the public sector"". The fate of Carillion, which employed 43,000 staff globally, has left many questioning what will happen to several high-profile public services and infrastructure projects. The construction firm was in charge of completing the newÂ£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital, and the Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell. Both completion dates were delayed by the company. Mrs May added that Cabinet Office minister David Lidington had ""acted swiftly"" to co-ordinate the government's response to Carillion's collapse. A spokesman for the Institute of Directors, Roger Barker, said: ""If the fallouts at BHS and Carillion have taught us anything, it is that pension schemes often suffer when companies collapse and something needs to be done to safeguard those who have contributed to them. ""However, significant policy decisions should never be made in the heat of the moment."" He said the IoD supported a proposal to confiscate or ""claw back"" bonuses of top executives when companies collapse. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?

"There has been heavy snowfall across large parts of the country, including in Kinlochewe Heavy snow has caused travel chaos on roads in Scotland as motorists faced hazardous driving conditions as the weather deteriorated. Five people were hurt in a two-car crash near the Glencoe Mountain Resort on the A82 on Sunday. Local police asked drivers to avoid the area, who described the conditions in the area as ""extremely poor"". A Met Officeyellow weather warning,externalfor snow and ice was in force earlier in the day. At the height of the problems at Glencoe, the road was closed while police dealt with the aftermath of the accident. 'Six mile tailback' at Scottish ski resort Climbers rescued from snow-covered ridge Insp Jen Valentine urged people in the ski resort and in homes and hotels in the area to stay put. She said: ""We have officers at the scene of the collision and the weather conditions in the area are extremely poor. ""We have closed the A82 while we deal with the collision and get those injured off to hospital and I would ask that drivers avoid the area in the meantime. ""For those who are currently at Glencoe Mountain Resort or at home, hotels or restaurants in the area I would urge them to stay where they are and stay safe and warm as there will potentially be a significant delay due to road conditions in getting people out of the area."" Glasgow Airport had to be closed while the runway was cleared The road was later opened to traffic leaving the ski centre but it remained closed to all other vehicles as road conditions remained ""challenging"" with drifting snow. It came a day after police reported six-mile queues of traffic around the ski resort, as people tried to get on the slopes. Police said the snow gates on the A9 at Dalwhinnie had been closed due to the conditions. And ScotRail tweeted that due to the conditions at Dalwhinnie, services between Inverness and Glasgow Queen Street and Inverness and Edinburgh may be delayed by up to 70 minutes. Delays were also experienced on the A1 near Reston for more than four hours after a car transporter ended up across the road, blocking the road completely. The road has since reopened. Delays were caused when a car transporter blocked the A1 at Reston Motorists in Dumfries and Galloway were asked not to make unnecessary journeys The roads around the Keir roundabout at Dunblane were gritted Earlier drivers in the south-west were urged to ""avoid unnecessary journeys"" following a spate of road accidents. Police said heavy snowfall across Dumfries and Galloway was causing problems on roads including the A75, which was blocked at the Glen for a short time. Police later said it had been gritted and was ""passable with care"". Heavy snow was also affecting the A76, the A701, the A709  and the A713 Castle Douglas - Ayr road, where there were a number of accidents. In their latest statement, police in Dumfries said: ""If you are having to drive, please slow down and drive to the conditions."" Traffic Scotland also urged drivers to check their routes before setting off and to ensure they were carrying emergency supplies in case they get stuck. Police Scotland's control room said they were dealing with a number of weather-related incidents and road closures. Glasgow Airport was closed for a short time while the runway was cleared of snow. There was heavy snow in Newton Mearns at 13:00 on Sunday The snow has been affecting a number of roads in Scotland, including the M77 Heavy snow has also been falling in Glasgow North Wales Police also warned of poor conditions on the roads due to snow and ice, particularly on routes in Snowdonia. Meanwhile, the Mountain Road was closed on the Isle of Man due to snow. In Northern Ireland, a yellow warning of ice was in force until 09:00 on Sunday, while a yellow warning of rain runs until 15:00. The yellow ""be aware"" warning covers much of inland Scotland, and was later extended to cover the north-west Highlands and parts of the Western Isles. Large swathes of England may also be affected, with areas as far south as Hertfordshire, Essex and Suffolk covered by the warning. The radar shows snow falling on large parts of central and southern Scotland and Cumbria at 11:00. The snow is expected to turn to rain later on Sunday Saturday night saw the coldest temperature recorded in the UK since February 14 2016, when -14.1C was recorded at Braemar. Despite the frigid temperatures in the far north, the mercury rose to 11C in the far south west of England. Met Office forecaster Steven Keate said the near 20C difference, caused as warmer air moves in, was ""pretty unusual for the UK"". ""The broad theme is it is turning milder from the west, but before we get there some snow will fall,"" he said. Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in traffic on the M74 on Tuesday night Yellow: Severe weather expected. Yellow means you should plan ahead thinking about possible travel delays, or the disruption of your day-to-day activities. Amber: Be prepared for disruption. There is an increased likelihood of bad weather affecting you, which could potentially disrupt your plans and possibly cause travel delays, road and rail closures, interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property. Red: Extreme weather is expected. Red means you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the weather. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely. You must avoid dangerous areas and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.

"This video can not be played Sarah Smith spoke to the UKIP leader Henry Bolton. UKIP leader Henry Bolton has said the party's national executive committee (NEC) has no right to sit in judgement on his personal life. And he warned that UKIP faced extinction if the NEC voted to get rid of him as leader when it meets later. Mr Bolton has faced repeated calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his former girlfriend. He told the BBC'sPienaar's Politicsthe NEC was ""not a court of moral judgement"". He said he had ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after she sent texts saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family. But he said he would ""support her in rebuilding her life"", which he said had been ""turned on its head"". UKIP leader splits with partner Who is new UKIP leader Henry Bolton? The UKIP leader is preparing to face party chiefs at an emergency meeting of the NEC later. The committee does not have the power to terminate Mr Bolton's leadership - that requires a vote of the wider party. He has vowed to carry on as leader if there is a vote of no confidence in him. If the former army officer were to step down it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Senior UKIP figures have warned the party faces extinction if he continues as leader - but he claimed that could happen if it was plunged into another leadership contest. ""If the NEC decides to go down the road of months of further in-fighting and further negative media scrutiny by deciding to pass a vote of no confidence in me I think that the reality is that the party is probably over,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. He said the NEC should be focusing on ensuring the party's ""survival"" rather than discussing his leadership. ""Their job should be to ensure the party is capable of projecting its politics,"" he told 5 live's John Pienaar. ""They should be concerned more about the elements within the party that are busy and engaged with not in-fighting and in undermining party and its coherence. ""That's what the NEC should be focused on. They are not a court of moral judgement. While my personal life is obviously of public interest, this is a matter of the survival and future of UKIP - and that's what they should be looking at,"" he said. Former leader Nigel Farage has cautioned over another leadership contest On his relationship with Jo Marney, he said: ""She has been vilified and quite rightly criticised for the statements she's madeâ¦ She's out of the party and as far as the party and politics is concerned, that has moved on."" Former leader Nigel Farage - who isreported to be considering forming a new party or a cross-party Brexit campaign,externalif UKIP collapses - has said another leadership contest would be ""difficult"" for the party, which is believed to be heavily in debt. Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said Mr Bolton's position was ""untenable"" and that the controversy was ""damaging the party"". Mr Batten told BBC Breakfast he was willing to step in as an interim leader. He said: ""On Monday if Henry is still the leader of this party then we are going to lose members, activists, branches and donors - and this jeopardises the very existence of our party."" Patrick O'Flynn, UKIP's MEP for the East of England, told BBC One's Sunday Politics East that the party could be ""wiped out"" if it does badly in May's local elections. ""There's no doubt the party is drinking in the last-chance saloon,"" he said. ""If we get wiped out again in the district elections too, then maybe people are going to have to get round the table and say: Is the electorate trying to tell us something and is that 'thank you very much and goodnight'?"" Jonathan Arnott, UKIP's MEP for the North East of England,quit the party amid calls for Mr Bolton to step down, saying the leader was ""not the right person for the job"" and that UKIP's influence over Brexit was waning. He said UKIP had ""shifted"" its stance on religious and cultural issues to a degree he could not support.

"This video can not be played National Autistic Society's Sarah Lambert: Blue badges give ""reassurance"" People with hidden disabilities such as dementia and autism could be given blue badge parking permits in England under new government proposals. The Department for Transport said that only some councils currently recognised hidden disabilities. It said the proposed new policy was designed to provide ""clear and consistent"" guidelines. Mental health campaigners welcomed the proposals for providing a ""lifeline"" to many people with hidden disabilities. It is hoped the proposals, being put to an eight-week consultation, would create parity in the treatment of physical and mental health. If they go ahead, it will be the biggest change to the blue badge scheme since it was introduced in 1970. Around 2.4 million people have blue badges in England, which allows them to park for free in some pay and display bays, use disabled parking bays, and stay for up to three hours on yellow lines. In London blue badge holders are exempt from paying the congestion charge. Brian Beatson was in the RAF and still goes to air shows - but his son says parking is a problem Richard Beatson said blue badges would be a ""big bonus"" when taking his father Brian, who is known as Sam and has Alzheimer's, on family trips to the shops and to air shows. ""My dad loves aviation - he was in the RAF,"" he said. ""He'd watch the red arrows and then five minutes later wonder when they were going to fly over."" But Mr Beatson, from North Wales, said people with Alzheimer's may often be in a ""world of their own"" and put themselves in danger. He said he has to think ""long and hard"" about how to get his father safely to and from car parks, since he is not entitled to a blue badge. ""Parking nearer would be a big bonus,"" he said. ""If you're taking them to a garden centre or an event, car parks can be a long way away from entrances. ""I ended up printing a disabled symbol and ask people on the gate if they'd mind letting us park closer. ""The closer you can make it, the better. It's an unseen illness,"" he said. Transport minister Jesse Norman said blue badges give people with disabilities the freedom to get jobs, see friends or go to the shops ""with as much ease as possible"". He said: ""We want to try to extend this to people with invisible disabilities."" The Department for Transport said about 75% of badge users said they would go out less often if they didn't have the flexibility to park with a blue badge. The National Autistic Society has been campaigning for this change and its head of policy, Sarah Lambert, said it could provide a lifeline to many autistic people. She told the BBC: ""There are some families that sometimes don't go out because they're worried about the stress that is going to be caused if it's very busy and very crowded. Council plans fees for disabled parking Autistic boy's mum refused badge Mother's mental health bid hits milestone ""For lots of autistic people, they don't have as good an understanding of danger as others, so we know that some families are worried about their children running out in front of cars."" Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, welcomed the changes, saying: ""By looking at non-visible illness, we can actually change the perceptions of mental illness. ""It's the first time that the government has shown that it's going to fulfil a parity of esteem between physical and mental illness,"" she said. The National Police Autism Association, which supports officers affected by autism, Asperger's Syndrome and other conditions, said it was ""great news"" for drivers on the autism spectrum. ""Access to disabled parking eases the stress of trips out and makes independent living easier,"" it said.

"Vaccination programmes are being rolled out across southern Brazil to deal with the outbreak. Brazil's south-eastern state of Minas Gerais has declared a public health emergency following a deadly outbreak of yellow fever. At least 15 people have died there since December. Many areas, including the state capital Belo Horizonte, have been affected. A mass vaccination programme is in place in three southern states. But queues have formed outside clinics in Rio and Sao Paulo amid concerns that vaccines could run out. In neighbouring Argentina, there have also been long queues for the vaccine in Buenos Aires and other cities as thousands of prospective tourists prepare to travel to Brazil for carnival. On Tuesday the WHO recommended that travellers to Sao Paulo state get a yellow fever vaccine before visiting. Minas Gerais has been the hardest-hit Brazilian state. The health emergency will be in place for six months and will allow local authorities to commission special services and buy in emergency materials. WHO advises people to get a vaccine at least 10 days before travelling to a yellow-fever area Caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes Difficult to diagnose and often confused with other diseases or fevers Most people recover after the first phase of infection that usually involves fever, muscle and back pain, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting About 15% of people face a second, more serious phase involving high fever, jaundice, bleeding and deteriorating kidney function Half of those who enter the ""toxic"" phase usually die within 10 to 14 days Source:WHO,external The WHO's advice is for all travellers to Sao Paulo to get a vaccination at least 10 days before travelling and to take measures to avoid mosquito bites. Brazilian Health Minister Antonio Nardi responded by saying that most people attending Brazil's carnival celebrations in February should be safe as they are held in large cities and not the rural and forested areas which have seen the biggest increase in yellow fever cases. Mr Nardi said Sao Paulo state authorities would speed up their vaccination campaign with the aim of vaccinating half of the state's population by the end of February. More than 45 million people live in Sao Paulo state.

"Air quality has improved slightly on Scotland's most polluted streets, according to figures from Friends of the Earth (FoE) Scotland. But the data suggests the total number of official ""pollution zones"", where levels regularly exceed legal limits, has remained static at 38. The Scottish government said it was doing all it can to protect people from the effects of air pollution. It has committed to measures including phasing out petrol and diesel cars. Hope Street in Glasgow remains the most polluted street for nitrogen dioxide but levels have decreased from 65mcg per cubic metre to 58. Salamander Street in Edinburgh is the worst for Particulate Matter, overtaking Queensferry Road in the capital and Atholl Street in Perth. Salamander Street in Edinburgh tops the poll for the most particulate matter Edinburgh Salamander St - 23 Edinburgh Queensferry Road - 23 Perth Atholl Street - 21 Glasgow Clarence Drive- 19 Edinburgh Glasgow Road - 19 Glasgow Dumbarton Road - 19 Figures in mcg per cubic metre. The Scottish air quality objective is 18 mcg per cubic metre. The environmental group said its figures still demonstrate the importance of low emissions zones which are planned for the end of the year in Glasgow and by 2020 in Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Emilia Hanna, FoE Scotland's air pollution campaigner, said: ""Once again, streets in Scotland have dangerous levels of toxic air pollution which are breaking legal limits. ""The situation across Scotland is potentially showing some slow signs of improvements but filthy streets continue to poison our lungs nearly a decade after a legal deadline. ""Scotland's first low emission zone will be in Glasgow by the end of this year, and this will be an important test of commitment to address this problem. The rest of Scotland is looking to Glasgow to set a high standard with its low emission zone. ""Glasgow City Council must ensure that its proposed LEZ restricts the most polluting buses, vans and lorries by the end of this year, with cars and taxis restricted by 2020."" Three roads in Aberdeen have fallen out of the league tables of the worst offenders with Lochee Road in Dundee newly entering the top six along with Clarence Drive in Glasgow. High Street in Crieff, perhaps one of the most surprising roads in the list for previous year, has also dropped out. The raw data doesn't provide an explanation for the change which could be down to the weather or mitigation measures introduced by local authorities. Hope Street in Glasgow tops the list of the most polluted streets in Scotland Glasgow's Hope Street - 58 Edinburgh's St John's Road - 50 Glasgow's Dumbarton Road - 43 Dundee's Seagate - 43 Dundee's Lochee Road - 42 Edinburgh's Queensferry Road - 41 Figures in mcg per cubic metre. The European Ambient Air Quality Directive set a limit for NO2 of 40 mcg per cubic metre. A Scottish government spokesman said it was committed to introducing low emission zones into Scotland's biggest cities between 2018 and 2020. He added: ""We will continue to work with industry to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032. ""We have invested more than Â£210m in active travel since the start of the 2011 spending review, and the most recent programme for government announced that we would double the active travel budget from Â£40m to Â£80m in 2018-19. ""This will allow us to continue to build an Active Nation, boosting investment in walking and cycling and putting active travel at the heart of our transport planning. ""We have created one of the most comprehensive electric vehicle charging networks in Europe with more than 1,600 charging bays, an interest free loan scheme to support low emission vehicle ownership, and a Â£14.5m Green Bus Fund, which has seen the introduction of 300 low emission buses to the Scottish fleet. ""Our Cleaner Air for Scotland strategy sets out an ambitious programme of action to promote air quality and Scotland is the first country in Europe to pass legislation based on World Health Organisation guidelines for fine particulate matter."" FoE Scotland estimates that 2,500 people die prematurely each year because of air pollution which has been linked to respiratory conditions such as asthma. The two measures, particulate matter and Nitrogen Dioxide, are both caused by fossil-fuel engines.

"Bodies were accidently damaged 89 times in the last three years A person's brain being found in the wrong corpse by an undertaker was among incidents reported by mortuaries from 2014 to 2016, a BBC Freedom of Information request has found. There were 278 serious incidents in total in the three-year timespan in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Accidental damage to bodies was reported 89 times over that period. The Human Tissue Authority (HTA) said that when incidents occur, thorough investigations are undertaken. Organs were discovered by hospitals after the rest of a body had been released to a family on 13 occasions, while the wrong body was released to families 36 times. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust recorded the largest number of incidents - 11 - over the three-year period. During post-mortems, a deceased person's body is opened and the organs removed for examination. The pathologist will return the organs to the body after the post-mortem has been completed, and tissue will generally only be retained where a death is suspicious. The HTA defines a serious incident as ""human errors or system failures that lead to damage to bodies or misplaced bodies or body parts"". An undertaker discovered a brain in the abdominal cavity of a body which did not belong to it (Warwick Hospital) Human error resulted in a mix-up of brains (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford) Memory stick containing unencrypted images from two post-mortem examinations was left on public transport (Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) A large corpse could not be removed from a mortuary freezer because of the way it had frozen (King's College Hospital, London) Wrong body released and cremated (Southport & Formby District General Hospital) Sarah Simpson said her father's brain was stored for 22 years after his death Sarah Simpson found out that her father's brain and other parts were stored against family wishes for 22 years after his death at South Tyneside District Hospital. ""In March earlier this year, police knocked on my door, saying it's about my dad, Terry Simpson."" she said. ""I said it can't be him as he has been dead for 22 years, and it must be about my brother, with the same name, who had died a few months earlier."" The police explained that her father's organs were at the hospital, and were about to be released, and talked to her about funeral options. Terry Simpson was killed in a fall in 1995 ""There had been no permission to take any body parts at any time. My dad believed in reincarnation. ""He used to say, you're not taking my eyes or anything because I don't know where I'm going afterwards',"" she explained. She said she had not been given any answers about why it had happened, and the incident had sent her family into panic. ""I've just had to have another funeral for my dad,"" she said. South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust's Medical Director Dr Shaz Wahid said: ""We met with Ms Simpson in September 2017 to explain the conclusions of our internal review into the retention of forensic human tissue samples at South Tyneside District Hospital and the measures we have taken to prevent this from occurring again in the future. ""Once again, we apologise unreservedly to Ms Simpson and all the families involved for the undoubted distress this must have caused."" Chris Birkett, director of regulation for the HTA, said: ""Incidents such as these are distressing for the families of those involved and, although they are rare, should never happen. ""If an incident does happen, we work with the establishment to ensure that a thorough investigation is undertaken, that lessons are learned, and that improvements are made to mitigate the risks of similar incidents happening again."" He also said the number of incidents was small given the fact that 330,000 bodies enter the care of mortuaries in England and Wales annually. Leicester's Hospitals said it dealt with a large number of bodies, as one of the biggest and busiest mortuaries in the UK, and had an excellent culture of reporting. Oxford University Hospitals said the very regrettable mix-up of brains was because of a labelling error at the John Radcliffe during a specialist examination as part of the autopsy process, and that an external expert had reviewed its processes in response. Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had reported the data breach to the Information Commissioners Office and HTA, and that its guidelines had not been followed. Kings College Hospital said that new procedures had been introduced after the freezer incident to stop the same thing happening again and it had informed and apologised to the family. University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust said a full investigation had been undertaken into the error at Warwick Hospital and it was rectified immediately.

"The government will stop workers' pensions being put at risk from ""executives who try to line their own pockets"", the prime minister has said. Inthe Observer,external, Theresa May said a government white paper would set out ""tough new rules"" for company bosses. It comes after it emerged that the collapse of construction firm Carillion could leave itspension scheme with a deficit of as much as Â£900m. Labour said ministers also had to be held to account for firms' failings. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink? Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Labour 'would nationalise NHS cleaning' In her comment piece, Mrs May stressed that it would be Carillion shareholders, not taxpayers, ""who pay the price for the company's collapse"". She said the government would not be writing the company's directors a blank cheque, but would be ""stepping in and supporting those affected"". She also defended using the private sector to complete public projects. It was earlier reported that Carillion's defined benefit pension scheme has a deficit of Â£580m, although this figure could be as high as Â£900m. Defined benefit (DB) schemes, which are based on a worker's final salary or their career average earnings, are currently being examined by the government. The Department for Work and Pensions isexpected to release a White Paper,externalin March, detailing new legislation on protecting DB schemes. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the paper would outline proposals regarding directors who ""raid"" company pension pots. She told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the role of the pensions regulator, as well as company law, would be consulted on. ""Where people filch from the public purse, where there are issues and they let down pension funds, they let down people who work for their company. ""Then they do need to be dealt with,"" she said. Labour's Baroness Chakrabarti said: ""It's all very well for Mrs May to now say she's going to sting these executives. ""There's got to be a bit of ministerial responsibility in all of this as well."" The shadow attorney general told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""What we need is oversight. Of course we want a thriving private sector, but some vital services need to be run by public servants and with ministers held to account."" The management of pension schemes, and the perceived lack of protection and security, has caused public outcry in recent years. Following the collapse of BHS it was found that there was a Â£571m deficit in the pension scheme. Last year, former BHS ownerSir Philip Green came to an agreement with the pensions regulatorto pay back Â£363m into the pension scheme for the company. Despite the recent collapse of Carillion, one of the government's biggest private contractors, Mrs May defended the government's use of public-private partnerships. She said the ""private sector plays a valuable role helping the public sector"". The fate of Carillion, which employed 43,000 staff globally, has left many questioning what will happen to several high-profile public services and infrastructure projects. The construction firm was in charge of completing the newÂ£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital, and the Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell. Both completion dates were delayed by the company. Mrs May added that Cabinet Office minister David Lidington had ""acted swiftly"" to co-ordinate the government's response to Carillion's collapse. A spokesman for the Institute of Directors, Roger Barker, said: ""If the fallouts at BHS and Carillion have taught us anything, it is that pension schemes often suffer when companies collapse and something needs to be done to safeguard those who have contributed to them. ""However, significant policy decisions should never be made in the heat of the moment."" He said the IoD supported a proposal to confiscate or ""claw back"" bonuses of top executives when companies collapse. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?

President Trump accused the Democrats of putting politics above the interests of the American people. The Democrats blame him for rejecting bipartisan compromise proposals. Negotiations in both houses of Congress continued on Saturday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would be back in session on Sunday to try to end the impasse. The White House budget chief has expressed optimism that a resolution will be found before Monday. But if not, hundreds of thousands of federal workers face the prospect of no work and shuttered offices at the start of the working week. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party, the Republicans, controls both Congress and the White House. The vote on Friday was 50-49, falling far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. With a 51-seat majority in the Senate, the Republicans did not have enough seats to pass the bill without some support from the Democrats. They want funding for border security - including the border wall - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. The Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The Republicans added a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. But Democrats want this programme extended permanently. Mr Trump accused the Democrats of being ""far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border"". But the leading Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, blamed the president, saying Mr Trump was under pressure from ""hard-right forces within the administration"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders warned: ""The president will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government."" Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The game of chicken ended with a head-on crash. Republicans are anxious to label this the ""Schumer shutdown"" and, essentially, they're right. Chuck Schumer and his fellow Democrats (with the help of a few Republicans) blocked a bill that would have kept the government open - at least temporarily. Determining responsibility and apportioning blame, however, are two decidedly different endeavours. Democrats will argue that they had a deal with the president on their bipartisan compromise that included immigration reform - only to have him back away during that fateful obscenity-laden Oval Office meeting last week. Republicans will frame this as liberals putting undocumented immigrant protections over military readiness and health insurance for poor kids. The winner of the blame game has yet to be decided. Generally, the loser in these types of showdowns is the party entering the fight with the lowest popularity - bad news for Mr Trump and the Republicans. The good news, for both sides, is that their political bases will be thrilled they are playing hardball. Midterm election years, like 2018, tend to encourage this kind of rally-the-base manoeuvres. Now that the line has been crossed, this could become a protracted, ugly fight. The US budget must be approved by 1 October - the start of the federal financial year. But Congress has often failed to meet this deadline and negotiations continue well into the new year, with the previous year's funding to federal agencies extended on a temporary basis. Because Congress failed to agree an extension that would have maintained government funding through to 16 February, it means many federal agencies effectively closed for business as of 00:01 on Saturday (05:01 GMT). Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work.

But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation.

"A faulty tumble dryer is believed to have caused a fire in a seventh floor flat in Shepherd's Bush The government is creating a new Office for Product Safety and Standards to help manage large-scale product recalls and identify risks to consumers. It comes after several fires, including Grenfell Tower, linked to faulty fridge freezers and tumble dryers. The Commons' Business Committee said last week there was a ""strong case"" for a national product safety authority. Consumer group Which? welcomed the move but said it ""falls short of the full overhaul"" required. It emerged last week thatmore than one million fire-risk tumble dryers are still in usemore than two years after a defect was discovered. The defect in tumble dryers sold under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands was discovered in 2015 and led to at least 750 fires since 2004, according to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee. Business minister Andrew Griffiths said the new office ""will allow consumers to continue to buy, secure in the knowledge there is an effective system in place if products need to be repaired or replaced."" The fire at Grenfell Tower began in a fridge-freezer, but police said it was not started deliberately The new product safety office will start work immediately. The move is a part of the government's response to recommendations from the Working Group on Product Recalls and Safety, a group of consumer. fire and product safety experts. The group, established in 2016, presented the government with recommendations which built on anindependent review by former BBC presenter and consumer rights campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood. Chairman Neil Gibbins said: ""I'm pleased to see the government respond to our recommendations with concrete steps to ensure safety of consumers, now and in the future."" But Alex Neil of Which? said: ""This action falls short of the full overhaul it so desperately needs. ""Consumers need an independent national body, which has real powers to protect them and get dangerous products out of their homes.

"The protest was organised by supporters of the defeated opposition candidate One protester has been killed in clashes in Honduras between riot police and demonstrators who dispute the result of November's presidential poll. Police fired tear gas and cleared roadblocks made of burning tyres across the country. The death occurred in the northern town of Saba. The protest was organised by supporters of the defeated opposition candidate. Last month, incumbentPresident Juan Orlando Hernandez was declared the winnerdespite days of street protests. On Saturday a local NGO in Saba, 210km (130 miles) north-east of the capital Tegucigalpa, said a 60-year-old man was killed and another person wounded when police opened fire on a roadblock, Reuters news agency reported. The 25 November election has been widely criticised.Supporters of opposition leader Salvador Nasralla are deeply suspicious of the electoral tribunalthat counted the ballots. This is because it is appointed by Congress, which is controlled by Mr HernÃ¡ndez's National Party. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest following the election Mr Nasralla initially established a lead as the votes were being counted, but this quickly diminished and he accused the authorities of manipulating the results. Thousands of people took to the streets in rival demonstrations following the election. Human rights group Amnesty International says 14 people died in the clashes, but police say only three have died. President HernÃ¡ndez, 49, has been in power since 2013, and is the first president to run for a second term after the country's supreme court lifted a ban on re-election.

"IS's Afghanistan chief Hafiz Saeed Khan was killed in a US air strike in July last year Amid a rise in attacks in Afghanistan attributed to the so-called Islamic State (IS), the BBC's Dawood Azami examines what kind of threat the militant group poses in the conflict-hit nation and the wider region. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. Within a few weeks, the group appeared in at least five Afghan provinces, including Helmand, Zabul, Farah, Logar and Nangarhar, trying to establishpockets of territory from which to expand. It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency. Its first aim was to drive Afghan Taliban fighters out of the area and it also hoped to evict Taliban ally al-Qaeda from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, or absorb its fighters. Yet despite efforts to energise battle-weary militants, IS struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan. Instead, it made enemies of almost everyone, including the Afghan Taliban. In the first half of 2015, IS managed to capture large chunks of territory in eastern Nangarhar province. This became the de facto ""capital"" principally for two reasons - its proximity to the tribal areas of Pakistan, home of IS Khorasan's top leaders, and the presence of some people who follow a similar Salafi/Wahhabi interpretation of Islam to IS. IS is also trying to get a foothold in northern Afghanistan, where it aims to link up with Central Asian, Chechen and Chinese Uighur militants. But it has largely been eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and military operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces. Six Red Cross workers were killed earlier this month in northern Afghanistan by suspected IS militants It has also lost territory in eastern Afghanistan in recent months. But it still has control over some parts of Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, where it plans attacks and trains fighters. Small IS pockets have also been reported in Zabul and Ghazni, as well as a few northern provinces. Since its emergence in Afghanistan, IS has lost hundreds of militants in US air strikes and ground fighting with the Afghan military. Meanwhile, several hundred IS fighters have been killed in clashes with the Afghan Taliban. Around a dozen top leaders of the group's Afghanistan-Pakistan branch, including founding leader Hafiz Saeed Khan, a former Pakistani Taliban commander, and his deputies, have been killed in Afghanistan, mostly in US drone attacks. Estimates about IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000. US General John Nicholson, the top commander of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan, estimates that between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters are in Afghanistan. He says their number has been cut in half, from an estimated 3,000, by military operations over the past year or so. Afghan security forces have been battling IS fighters, but the group has survived the onslaught He adds that about 70% of those fighters come from the Pakistani Taliban group (TTP), some of whom moved to Afghanistan after the Pakistani military launched an operation in North Waziristan tribal area in 2014. But Afghan security officials insist that 80% of IS militants are Pakistanis. The other members were part of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), a group focused on Central Asian countries, and former Afghan Taliban or new recruits, they say. IS has so far survived the onslaught and it seems the group is attracting new recruits to replace those killed. After losing territory, IS Khorasan is emulating its Middle East counterparts by resorting to guerrilla tactics such as suicide attacks, targeted killings and the use of IEDs. It says it carried out some of the deadliest recent attacks in Afghanistan, several of them in the capital, Kabul. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed around 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. All of these attacks targeted minority Shia Muslims. IS has also claimed responsibility for attacks in other parts of the country and has killed civilians, including tribal elders and religious scholars opposed to its extreme ideology and brutal tactics. Nato estimates that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 IS fighters in Afghanistan Like its counterparts in the Middle East, IS Khorasan has taken violence to new levels, even by the bloody standards of the region. While al-Qaeda introduced suicide bombings into the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, IS brought new and more ruthless tactics. In one notorious example an IS video released in August 2015 showed 10 blindfolded community elders in Achin district in Nangarhar being forced to sit on holes in the ground filled with explosives. They were then blown to pieces. Beheadings and abductions, including of women and children, are other tactics. In addition, IS propaganda on the internet and air waves is strong. The group has several Twitter and Facebook accounts and has been broadcasting on an FM radio station in Nangarhar since December 2015. Radio Caliphate can be heard in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, as well as adjacent parts of Pakistan. The station was once hit in a US airstrike but was back on air within a few weeks. IS has also carried out attacks in Pakistan, where it relies mainly on the support of certain anti-Shia sectarian groups. The first major attack in Pakistan for which IS claimed responsibility was in May 2015 when about 40 minority Shias were killed in a gun attack on a bus in the country's biggest city, Karachi. On 16 February, IS said it carried outan attack on the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrinein the town of Sehwan in Sindh province. Police say 90 people were killed. The attack at the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar Sufi shrine shocked Pakistan The conflict in Afghanistan has been going on for nearly four decades, but the country has largely remained immune to the sectarian violence that has hit other regional nations. IS, however, aims to turn the conflict in Afghanistan into a sectarian war between the majority Sunnis and minority Shias, as it has tried in Syria and Iraq. Shias are considered apostates by IS, which follows an austere version of Sunni Islam. The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame? Islamic State group: The full story Although IS has also killed many of its Sunni opponents, it has clearly stated sectarian goals in a number of its attacks. Justifying the July 2016 attack on the Shia rally in Kabul, IS called it retaliation for the activities of Afghan Shia Hazaras who have gone to Syria via Iran to fight for the government of President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawi-Shia, against the Islamic State group. Deliberate attacks by IS against Shia in Afghanistan add a dangerous complication to the conflict. The future of IS in Afghanistan and Pakistan is in many ways linked to the fate of IS in Syria and Iraq. Western and Afghan military officials confirm the group has financial ties to, and is in communication with, the main IS leadership. It also has contacts with IS cells operating in South and Central Asian countries. So far, IS has not been able to carry out attacks outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the group has many sympathisers in the region. Additionally, thousands of volunteers from nine South and Central Asian states - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS. They have been trained and radicalised there. The return of these militants will pose a new threat and might strengthen the existing IS infrastructure in the region. Such developments further complicate the conflict in Afghanistan and pose a long term risk to regional stability. Regional powers, such as Russia, China and Iran, are concerned about the threat that IS poses to their internal security. These powers have established contacts withthe Afghan Taliban, which is fighting IS, to hedge against the potential risk. Mutual mistrust is preventing regional players from reaching a consensus to end the conflict in Afghanistan. Six Afghan ICRC workers 'killed by IS' Pakistan's bloody week: Who is to blame?

"Turkish war planes hit Kurdish positions on the Syrian side of the border on Saturday Turkish war planes have launched air strikes on Kurdish fighters in northern Syria in a move likely to raise tensions with the US. Turkey wants to oust the YPG militia, which it calls a terrorist group, from Afrin region on its southern border. The US-backed YPG says at least nine people were killed in the air strikes. Russia has moved its troops away from Afrin, saying it is concerned but will not interfere. Syria denounced Turkey's ""aggression"" and ""brutal attack"". Turkey had been shelling the area for two days, ahead of its declaration of a military operation on Saturday. In a nutshell: The 100, 300 and 700-word story Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says Turkey has notified all parties involved - including the Syrian government - about the offensive. Syria denied this was the case. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains On Saturday, Turkey announced that an air and ground campaign, dubbed ""Olive Branch"", had been launched at 14:00 GMT, targeting the Kurdish YPG (Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units) and Islamic State (IS) group jihadists. The operation would be carried out ""with respect for Syria's territorial integrity"", it added.  A later statement said 108 targets belonging to Kurdish militants had been hit. Pro-Turkey rebels, known as the Free Syrian Army, also began moving into the area, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. The YPG said the strikes had killed at least six civilians and three fighters, with another 13 civilians wounded. One of the fighters belonged to the YPG and the other two were from its all-female affiliate, spokesperson Birusk Hasaka said. Ankara also said there were casualties, but they were all Kurdish militants. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters that ground forces would join the operation on Sunday. Turkey's military has been shelling the area since Thursday, a move which it said was in response to fire coming from the area. On Saturday, a spokesperson for the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said it would have no choice but to defend itself if attacked. Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent, near border with Syria In mid-afternoon the Turkish air strikes began, with plumes of smoke rising above Afrin. On the ground, Syrian rebel fighters backed by Turkey moved in, the military incursion rather inappropriately named Operation Olive Branch. President Erdogan has vowed to wipe out a corridor, first Afrin and then the nearby town of Manbij, from where the YPG has failed to withdraw. Nobody can object when what we do is necessary, he said. We will get rid of these messy terrorists trying to invade our country. But the risks are huge - the offensive pits Turkey against its Nato ally the US, which backs the Kurdish militia against IS, infuriating Ankara. Russia, which has troops in the area, has urged restraint - an MP in Moscow says it will be discussed at the UN. The Syrian regime warned it would be seen as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. An estimated half a million people have been killed in the Syrian war. With this new front, the danger is that number will rise again. The YPG has been a key part of the battle against IS in Syria, and has been supported by the US. Turkey, however, believes the group has links to the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and has for several months been threatening to clear Kurdish fighters from Afrin and another city, Manbij, which lies 100km away. Turkey's military plans seem to have been accelerated by an announcement from the US that it will help the SDF alliance build a new ""border security force"" to prevent the return of IS. Saturday's air strikes raise the prospect of deeper strains between Turkey and the US The YPG and SDF deny any terrorist links - a claim backed by the US government. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the border force a ""terror army"". Disagreement over the Kurdish fighters has created a sharp division between the Nato allies. The US state department has appealed for calm, and attempted to downplay portrayals of a new ""border force"", instead characterising the new development as security training. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? Russia's foreign ministry says it is concerned by news of the offensive, and is urging restraint. It said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his American counterpart Rex Tillerson had discussed ""measures to take aimed at securing stability in the north of the country"". Russian senator Frants Klintsevich - who is the deputy chairman of the defence and security committee - earlier told Interfax news agency that Moscow would only respond if Russian bases in Syria were threatened. He said that Russia has been placed in a difficult situation, as it has ""good relations with both Damascus and Ankara"". Turkey's military and intelligence chiefs had been trying to get Russia's agreement to allow Turkish planes to use the Russian-controlled airspace above Afrin. Moscow is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and until now, had a contingent of soldiers at the airport in the centre of Afrin. It is not yet clear if Russia's claim that it will not interfere precludes allowing use of its airspace. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also discussed the military offensive with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. No details of the conversations have been provided.

"Air quality has improved slightly on Scotland's most polluted streets, according to figures from Friends of the Earth (FoE) Scotland. But the data suggests the total number of official ""pollution zones"", where levels regularly exceed legal limits, has remained static at 38. The Scottish government said it was doing all it can to protect people from the effects of air pollution. It has committed to measures including phasing out petrol and diesel cars. Hope Street in Glasgow remains the most polluted street for nitrogen dioxide but levels have decreased from 65mcg per cubic metre to 58. Salamander Street in Edinburgh is the worst for Particulate Matter, overtaking Queensferry Road in the capital and Atholl Street in Perth. Salamander Street in Edinburgh tops the poll for the most particulate matter Edinburgh Salamander St - 23 Edinburgh Queensferry Road - 23 Perth Atholl Street - 21 Glasgow Clarence Drive- 19 Edinburgh Glasgow Road - 19 Glasgow Dumbarton Road - 19 Figures in mcg per cubic metre. The Scottish air quality objective is 18 mcg per cubic metre. The environmental group said its figures still demonstrate the importance of low emissions zones which are planned for the end of the year in Glasgow and by 2020 in Dundee, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Emilia Hanna, FoE Scotland's air pollution campaigner, said: ""Once again, streets in Scotland have dangerous levels of toxic air pollution which are breaking legal limits. ""The situation across Scotland is potentially showing some slow signs of improvements but filthy streets continue to poison our lungs nearly a decade after a legal deadline. ""Scotland's first low emission zone will be in Glasgow by the end of this year, and this will be an important test of commitment to address this problem. The rest of Scotland is looking to Glasgow to set a high standard with its low emission zone. ""Glasgow City Council must ensure that its proposed LEZ restricts the most polluting buses, vans and lorries by the end of this year, with cars and taxis restricted by 2020."" Three roads in Aberdeen have fallen out of the league tables of the worst offenders with Lochee Road in Dundee newly entering the top six along with Clarence Drive in Glasgow. High Street in Crieff, perhaps one of the most surprising roads in the list for previous year, has also dropped out. The raw data doesn't provide an explanation for the change which could be down to the weather or mitigation measures introduced by local authorities. Hope Street in Glasgow tops the list of the most polluted streets in Scotland Glasgow's Hope Street - 58 Edinburgh's St John's Road - 50 Glasgow's Dumbarton Road - 43 Dundee's Seagate - 43 Dundee's Lochee Road - 42 Edinburgh's Queensferry Road - 41 Figures in mcg per cubic metre. The European Ambient Air Quality Directive set a limit for NO2 of 40 mcg per cubic metre. A Scottish government spokesman said it was committed to introducing low emission zones into Scotland's biggest cities between 2018 and 2020. He added: ""We will continue to work with industry to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032. ""We have invested more than Â£210m in active travel since the start of the 2011 spending review, and the most recent programme for government announced that we would double the active travel budget from Â£40m to Â£80m in 2018-19. ""This will allow us to continue to build an Active Nation, boosting investment in walking and cycling and putting active travel at the heart of our transport planning. ""We have created one of the most comprehensive electric vehicle charging networks in Europe with more than 1,600 charging bays, an interest free loan scheme to support low emission vehicle ownership, and a Â£14.5m Green Bus Fund, which has seen the introduction of 300 low emission buses to the Scottish fleet. ""Our Cleaner Air for Scotland strategy sets out an ambitious programme of action to promote air quality and Scotland is the first country in Europe to pass legislation based on World Health Organisation guidelines for fine particulate matter."" FoE Scotland estimates that 2,500 people die prematurely each year because of air pollution which has been linked to respiratory conditions such as asthma. The two measures, particulate matter and Nitrogen Dioxide, are both caused by fossil-fuel engines.

"YouTube says it will remove videos of people taking part in the 'Tide Pod challenge', a dangerous craze proving popular in the US. Tide is an American brand of laundry detergent that uses pods covered by plastic which dissolve in the washing machine. Some people have been chewing or swallowing them and posting videos online. YouTube says channels sharing the videos will now receive a ""strike"". Videos will be removed when they are flagged by users, YouTube says, and the channel in question will have its access to the site limited for three months as a result of the strike. YouTube's community guidelines prohibit content that encourages dangerous or harmful activities. ""We work to quickly remove flagged videos that violate our policies,"" a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. The craze has been linked directly to an unusually high number of poisonings being reported in the US so far in 2018. In the first 15 days of 2018, 39 people between the ages of 13 and 19 contacted the American Association of Poison Control Centres (AAPCC) to report issues of intentional poisoning. Swallowing Tide pods were related to 91% of these, according to the the AAPCC. In comparison, there were only 39 reports of intentional poisoning in this age group in both 2016 and 2017. People who swallow pods could suffer seizures, pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs), breathing difficulties, coma, or even death in extreme cases, they warned. Procter & Gamble, which manufactures Tide, says its pods ""should not be played with, whatever the circumstance, even if meant as a joke"". ""Laundry pacs are made to clean clothes. Like all household cleaning products, they must be used properly and stored safely."" Earlier this month, Tide warned people against the challenge in a video shared online. They said that the pods are for ""doing laundry. Nothing else."" Tide shared a video highlighting its product is for cleaning clothes.,external (Warning third-party content may contain ads) The AAPCC says videos seen online have ""caused significant concern among poison control centres."" ""The 'laundry packet challenge' is neither funny nor without serious health implications,"" says Stephen Kaminski, the executive director of the AAPCC. ""The intentional misuse of these products poses a real threat to the health of individuals. ""We have seen a large spike in single-load laundry packet exposures among teenagers since these videos have been uploaded."" Despite Tide Pod challenge videos initially experiencing a surge of popularity on social media, many more people are now posting footage criticising people who have deliberately swallowed detergent.

"This video can not be played The team took 62 days to complete the challenge Six women from the British Army have become the largest all-female group to ski coast-to-coast across Antarctica. The Ice Maiden team began the 1,000-mile expedition on 20 November - each pulling an 80kg sledge behind them. After 62 days on the ice, the six soldiers crossed the finish line at the Hercules Inlet just before 10:00 GMT. Completing the challenge, Maj Nics Wetherill said: ""I'm just so incredibly proud of the team. I can't believe how far we've come."" The women left Heathrow on the 25 October The group was expected to take between 75 and 90 days, with the women tackling winds of up to 60mph and temperatures reaching as low as -40C. Maj Wetherill, of the Royal Army Medical Corps in Portsmouth, added: ""This journey has had good times, bad times and great times for all concerned, and each of them, I know, has made us better people."" Congratulations have been coming in for the group. The Countess of Wessex, who met the team at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst in September, sent a series of tweets congratulating the women, saying: ""You have achieved your dream and performed an incredible feat of endurance physically and mentally, all while smashing the previous record!""

The soldiers also received congratulations from Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. He said: ""They are an inspiration to us all and are role models to young people across the country."" The team held a Remembrance service on 11 November Maj Wetherill came up with the idea along with Maj Nat Taylor, also of the Royal Army Medical Corps. They said they wanted to inspire women of all ages and abilities. The only conditions for applicants were they were serving in the Army, regular or reserve. In total, 250 people came forward. Applicants were put through rigorous tests in the UK and Norway before the final six were picked. The team have been skiing through temperatures as low as -40C The other four members of the team were reservist Maj Sandy Hennis of the Royal Signals, Capt Zanna Baker and Lt Jenni Stephenson, both of the Royal Artillery, and Honourable Artillery Company reservist Lance Sgt Sophie Montagne. Maj Taylor said: ""I have spent the last few days trying to imprint this beautiful landscape in my mind. ""We have called it home for close to two months now and I will, in a strange way, miss it a lot."" The women celebrated Christmas during the expedition Maj Hennis told the BBC: ""It feels pretty amazing. ""It was really key for me to be part of an all-female team because I really want to inspire other women, specifically women, to get out there and do things they wouldn't normally be doing, or think would be possible. ""We set what was an impossible challenge and achieved it, so anything is possible."" Speaking from base camp, Capt Baker said she had dreamt of taking on the challenge for 10 years.

"Afghan security forces have taken up positions around the hotel At least four gunmen have launched an attack on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel, Afghan officials say. Special forces killed two of the attackers, an interior ministry spokesman said, and are trying to get to the others. The gunmen stormed the hotel on Saturday evening, shooting at guests and detonating grenades. At least five people have been injured, officials said. It is not clear how many have been killed. The attack began at about 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT), with reports suggesting the gunmen shot at security guards as they made their way into the five-storey building. They targeted staff and guests before special forces were called in. Security forces then cleared the ground floor of the luxury hotel but the attackers are still on the floors above, spokesman Nasrat Rahimi told the BBC. Some reports said the hotel had been hosting an IT conference attended by provincial officials at the time. One witness told Reuters news agency that the attackers had taken hostages. The attack comes just days after the US embassy in Kabul issued a warning about hotels in the city. ""We are aware of reports that extremist groups may be planning an attack against hotels in Kabul,""the embassy wrote in a public security alert published Thursday,external, though it highlighted another hotel near the international airport as a possible target. ""These groups may also be targeting public gatherings/demonstrations, government facilities, transportation, markets, and places where foreigners are known to congregate."" File photo: The Intercontinental Hotel, photographed in January 2016 A guest at the hotel told AFP news agency that people were hiding in their rooms. ""I don't know if the attackers are inside the hotel but I can hear gunfire,"" the guest said. ""I beg the security forces to rescue us as soon as possible before they reach and kill us.""

"This video can not be played Guests tried to escape by using bed sheets to climb down from balconies An overnight siege of a luxury hotel by gunmen in the Afghan capital has come to an end, security forces say. Six civilians, including a foreign woman, died at the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul, along with three attackers, the interior ministry said. Some 160 people were rescued after Afghan troops fought through the night to regain control of the building. Some reports suggested gunfire had continued for some time after the authorities declared the siege over. Afghan news agency Tolo says the death toll could be higher than the official figure, quoting a reporter who said they had seen dozens of bodies inside the hotel. Allow Twitter content?

Afghan airline Kam Air told local journalist Bilal Sarwary it had 42 members of staff in the hotel, some of whom are foreign nationals; 18 are still missing with five feared dead. The Taliban,which targeted the hotel in 2011, says it was behind the latest attack. A spokesman said in a statement quoted by AFP that the group had ""killed tens of foreign invaders and their puppets"". The gunmen burst into the six-floor hotel at around 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Saturday evening, as guests were enjoying dinner. Afghan Telecom regional director Aziz Tayeb, who was one of dozens of guests due to attend an IT conference at the hotel on Sunday, said he saw the attackers arrive as he was heading towards the exit. ""Everything became chaotic in a moment,"" he told the AFP news agency. ""I hid behind a pillar and I saw people who were enjoying themselves a second ago screaming and fleeing like crazy, and some of them falling down, hit by bullets."" The gunmen - armed with rocket-propelled grenades as well as smaller weapons - stormed through the hotel taking many of the guests hostage. ""They were shouting... 'Don't leave any of them alive, good or bad. Shoot and kill them all,"" another guest, Abdul Rahman Naseri, said. Several guests were pictured using bed sheets to try to climb down from a top-floor balcony. One of them, Mohammad Musa, said his roommate suggested they escape that way after a fire broke out on their floor. ""I tried to come down but I was heavy and my arms were not strong enough,"" he said. ""I fell down and injured my shoulder and leg."" Dramatic images on Afghan TV showed thick black smoke and flames rising from the imposing hilltop hotel. The hotel is a landmark in Kabul Several ambulances were on hand to transport the wounded to hospital Afghan special forces were lowered by helicopters on to the roof of the hotel during the night, an interior ministry spokesman said. They were working with Western special forces to bring the siege to an end. Forty-one foreigners were among those rescued and seven people were wounded, according to figures from the interior ministry. The ministry has promised an investigation into how the attackers breached security, which was handed to a private company two weeks ago. Hotel manager Ahmad Haris Nayab said the gunmen had entered the hotel through a kitchen. Saturday's siege comes just days after the US embassy in Kabul issued a warning about hotels in the city.

"The government will stop workers' pensions being put at risk from ""executives who try to line their own pockets"", the prime minister has said. Inthe Observer,external, Theresa May said a government white paper would set out ""tough new rules"" for company bosses. It comes after it emerged that the collapse of construction firm Carillion could leave itspension scheme with a deficit of as much as Â£900m. Labour said ministers also had to be held to account for firms' failings. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink? Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Labour 'would nationalise NHS cleaning' In her comment piece, Mrs May stressed that it would be Carillion shareholders, not taxpayers, ""who pay the price for the company's collapse"". She said the government would not be writing the company's directors a blank cheque, but would be ""stepping in and supporting those affected"". She also defended using the private sector to complete public projects. It was earlier reported that Carillion's defined benefit pension scheme has a deficit of Â£580m, although this figure could be as high as Â£900m. Defined benefit (DB) schemes, which are based on a worker's final salary or their career average earnings, are currently being examined by the government. The Department for Work and Pensions isexpected to release a White Paper,externalin March, detailing new legislation on protecting DB schemes. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the paper would outline proposals regarding directors who ""raid"" company pension pots. She told ITV's Peston on Sunday that the role of the pensions regulator, as well as company law, would be consulted on. ""Where people filch from the public purse, where there are issues and they let down pension funds, they let down people who work for their company. ""Then they do need to be dealt with,"" she said. Labour's Baroness Chakrabarti said: ""It's all very well for Mrs May to now say she's going to sting these executives. ""There's got to be a bit of ministerial responsibility in all of this as well."" The shadow attorney general told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""What we need is oversight. Of course we want a thriving private sector, but some vital services need to be run by public servants and with ministers held to account."" The management of pension schemes, and the perceived lack of protection and security, has caused public outcry in recent years. Following the collapse of BHS it was found that there was a Â£571m deficit in the pension scheme. Last year, former BHS ownerSir Philip Green came to an agreement with the pensions regulatorto pay back Â£363m into the pension scheme for the company. Despite the recent collapse of Carillion, one of the government's biggest private contractors, Mrs May defended the government's use of public-private partnerships. She said the ""private sector plays a valuable role helping the public sector"". The fate of Carillion, which employed 43,000 staff globally, has left many questioning what will happen to several high-profile public services and infrastructure projects. The construction firm was in charge of completing the newÂ£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital, and the Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell. Both completion dates were delayed by the company. Mrs May added that Cabinet Office minister David Lidington had ""acted swiftly"" to co-ordinate the government's response to Carillion's collapse. A spokesman for the Institute of Directors, Roger Barker, said: ""If the fallouts at BHS and Carillion have taught us anything, it is that pension schemes often suffer when companies collapse and something needs to be done to safeguard those who have contributed to them. ""However, significant policy decisions should never be made in the heat of the moment."" He said the IoD supported a proposal to confiscate or ""claw back"" bonuses of top executives when companies collapse. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?

"YouTube star Logan Paul is one of many high profile figures to have made a public apology in recent months Sorry seems to be the hardest word. So sang Elton John on one of his biggest 1970s hits - but not every public figure seems to find it so tough to utter that powerful five-letter word. In recent months a broad spectrum of public figures, frompoliticians, toHollywood actorsandYouTube starshave all publicly expressed remorse. In the latest example, the new Conservative vice-chairman for youth, Ben Bradley, has been forced to apologise twice over previous remarks - the latest of which appear to back police brutality,according to the Times,external. But with so much remorse on the airwaves, just how can we differentiate a forced apology from a heartfelt expression of remorse? In its purest form, saying sorry should be an ""act of contrition, a realisation that something you have said or done has hurt someone and you want to make amends"", says psychologist Geraldine Joaquim. Made early, a well-crafted apology can be hugely beneficial and can ""diffuse the situation and takes the wind out of an accuser's sails"", she says. A need to say sorry can arise in someone's public life and equally at home with their family and friends but, whatever the environment, how well it is received depends on how personalised it feels. Experts say the formula for an affective apology can be summed up with the acronym CAR: showconcern demonstrateaction offerreassurance ""People want the response to be personal to them, to feel that they're being listened to and taken seriously,"" says Martin Stone, of PR agency Tank. He says that, in the professional sphere, the phrase ""formal apology"" is often used, but, in reality, the opposite is what is required. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties From businesses, governments and organisations, a scripted response will fail to resonate as it will not convey empathy and compassion. ""This is a problem Theresa May has often found but it's interesting to see that her recent apology for the NHS crisis had been notably humanised,"" Stone says. ""It is vital that any business or individual making an apology understands the focus - is it sorry for the way it's acted or is it sorry that the complainant feels the way they do?"" Spontaneity - watch out for the speed of response, the quicker the apology comes, the better indication that the person making it has felt an immediate sense of guilt Body language - if genuine, the person making the apology will be looking for listening clues to see if they are being understood, such as eye contact and facial expressions Vulnerability - performed apologies always have a sense of being ""acted out"", and are often accompanied by too many theatrical gestures. If the person is genuine they will provide ""humbling signals""', such as a lowered head, to indicate remorse and vulnerability Denial gestures - the biggest clues of insincerity can come after the gesture itself, with non-verbal signals that silently reject the words used; this can include looking to the floor and smirking. Perhaps the rise in apologies over recent years can be linked to the rise of social media, which has helped facilitate a ""breakdown in formality"", says Stone. Platforms such as Twitter, and to a lesser extent Facebook, offer the opportunity for immediate engagement and impact. If pitched exactly right, a witty and well-judged apology can even ""go viral"" and end up as a positive for a company that has done wrong but shows it can ""own"" its mistake and put it right. And while this can present fantastic marketing opportunities for companies who strike the right tone between ""witty and irreverent responses to general comments"", it is important to know when to tone it down for more sensitive situations, Stone says. Toby Young said he regrets his ""politically incorrect"" comments Earlier this month, Virgin Trains were left red-faced when an attempted tongue-in-cheek apology to a passengerwas branded sexist. If the wrong move is made, the high level of audience engagement leaves huge potential for reputational damage - which will then only be solved by a further apology that appeases users but draws more attention to the problem. The nature of the internet also means unguarded comments live on for ever - as can controversy years down the line,as Toby Young recently found. The journalist ""unreservedly apologised"" for past tweets of a sexual and misogynistic nature that he said were ""ill-judged or just plain wrong"". In this climate, social media management has become a huge business. Job-hunting platform LinkedIn found that between 2010 and 2013, the number of such roles listed rose tenfold. Whether online or in person, the timing and choice of language in an apology are decisive factors. ""Firstly, it is important to show that you understand and sympathise,"" says Stone. ""Theresa May did this well in her NHS apology by starting sentences with 'I know it's difficult' and 'I know it's frustrating'. Even if you're a massive corporate giant, don't hide from emotion and don't ignore feelings."" Linguistically it is also important to avoid dehumanising statements or promises that can't be kept. ""Don't say that you'll ensure that this will not happen again if you're not confident it won't. It could come back to bite you,"" Stone explains. Equally, the use of ""but"" can hugely change the tone of an apology. As Stone points out: ""I'm sorry butâ¦' sounds like you are making excuses and aren't actually taking any form of responsibility. ""It may be three letters but it can instantly make an apology seem hollow."" Tony Blair apologises over Iraq This video can not be played Tony Blair expresses sorrow, regret and apology for the 2003 Iraq invasion ""This is a masterclass in deflection. He begins with an over-congruent non-verbal apology bordering on the tearful. His voice breaks, he seems to blink back tears and he falters as though about to break down. ""It was a delayed apology too, so not remotely spontaneous. His emotional turn-around is too rapid to suggest genuine feelings of remorse. He flips like a switch, saying there are things he won't apologise for, and his body language flips with it, becoming splayed and defiant, with an accelerated blink-rate suggesting anger.""

"""What people don't realise is it's a form of bereavement. There were days I couldn't get out of bed. I just couldn't face the world."" Nicci Fletcher, 50, says she and her husband Andrew felt ""real grief"" at not having children together and wanted to help other people going through the same experience. So they decided to set up an online subscription magazine -The Childless Not By Choice Magazine,external- aimed solely at other people who wanted children but couldn't have them. Nicci and Andrew met in their late 30s. When an unplanned pregnancy ended in miscarriage they were devastated but thought they would be able to conceive again. But Nicci later discovered she had inherited her mother's endometriosis - a condition which can lead to infertility. ""My mother was advised not to have any more children after me but I'd never asked why,"" she said. ""I kick myself now. I had no symptoms at all. My periods were like clockwork, no pain. ""If I'd known then I could have done something about it. I could have had my eggs harvested and frozen. When you're in your 20s, you think you've got all the time in the world."" According to government statistics published in November,,externalnearly one in five women in England and Wales born in 1971 have no children at all - compared to one in 10 of their mother's generation. Although there are no official statistics on how many childless women wanted children, an academic study from Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands suggested it could be as high as 90%. The situation hit Nicci hard. As well as the pain of not having children, she felt isolated from her friends who were busy with their young families. ""Of my 20 close friends, I was the only one without a child,"" she said. ""I had such a feeling of being marginalised. ""They were supportive as much as they could be supportive but we were in denial, we didn't ask for any support."" Andrew, 52, became despondent at not being able to resolve the situation. ""It's different for men. We don't have the biological imperative that women do - we can supposedly have babies at any age,"" he said. ""But I felt depressed at not being able to help Nicci. I can say the right words, I can rub her back but I can't fix it. Most blokes like to fix things."" Is flexible working biased against non-parents? Soaring childlessness among southern European women - report When childless isn't a choice He also grieved for the future he had planned. ""We bought our farmhouse in France because it would be a marvellous place to bring up children. As a couple you make decisions based on the assumption of having children. It's painful realising you're not going to have the life you expected."" Slowly, Nicci and Andrew began to withdraw from friends and family. ""I'd always been a sociable person, but we became quite reclusive,"" said Andrew. ""Everything felt geared towards children - even adverts on the TV - and so we began to feel completely alone."" For four years, the grief and depression overwhelmed them. It was only by becoming involved in the annual World Childless Week, a global event to bring childfree people together, that Nicci and Andrew realised there were thousands of other people going through exactly the same feelings. ""It really helped us,"" said Nicci. ""For the first time in years we're going around with smiles on her faces. We're members of a club none of us wanted to be part of, but it's a very supportive club."" It was this feeling which made them decide to launch their online subscription magazine for other child-free people. It's just one of a number of ways childfree people are coming together to support each other. Debbie Norman, aged 50, is a member of Gateway Women, an online community of childless women who meet up every month throughout the UK. Before joining, she found it difficult to talk openly about the pain she felt at being childless. ""People would say: 'Why don't you just adopt?' They'd try and fix the problem or sweep it under the carpet. It just made me feel worse because my feelings weren't being validated."" The friendships she's made through Gateway Women have given her ""permission"" to work through her feelings and come to terms with her situation. ""It's not a life sentence,"" she said. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel. It's not the future you planned but it's still light and beautiful. It can still be lovely."" The Institute of Public Policy Research estimates that, by 2030, there will betwo million people aged over 65 without adult children,,externalup from 1.2 million in 2012. Approximately 230,000 of them will be in need of more than 20 hours' care a week and will have no informal support. Ageing without Children, a campaign group founded by Kirsty Woodward for people over 50 who don't have children, is concerned about who will take on the caring responsibilities for childless people as they grow old. A pilot scheme has been launched in Dorset which aims to challenge how services plan for people facing those circumstances. Ms Woodward said: ""Our care system still relies heavily on the younger generation caring for its parents - 95% of care is picked up by the family."" As for Nicci and Andrew, helping and connecting with other people means they can now look forward to the future. ""We've gone from rock bottom to feeling so optimistic and positive about the future,"" said Nicci. ""Helping other people has helped us heal. We've got a reason to get out of bed in the morning - which isn't simply to walk our three dogs.""

"The collapse of construction giant Carillion has put thousands of jobs at risk across the UK. Here are six charts and maps that tell the story of the firm's demise. Carillion may not have been a household name, but it employed 43,000 staff globally, around half of these in the UK. Describing itself as an ""integrated support services business"", it held about 450 governmental contracts, spanning the UK education, justice, defence and transport ministries. It managed the Smart Motorways traffic control system and supplied school dinners as well as maintaining about half of the UK's prisons and Young Offender Institutions. Its responsibilities included cleaning, landscaping and catering. Carillion was the second-biggest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. It also operated in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean and was a big supplier of construction services to the Canadian government. The UK government has said staff and contractors working on public sector contracts will continue to be paid. Carillion: What is it and what's happening? The company entrenched in public life Where did Carillion's problems come from? Carillion's buildingcontracts spanned the country. They included the planned HS2 high speed railway line, the Royal Opera House, the Library of Birmingham, the Tate Modern, and the hoop-shaped building of GCHQ. Three troubled and delayed projects - the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell, the Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Aberdeen bypass - eventually contributed to the company's demise. In 2016, Carillion had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost Â£1bn. But it ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up huge debts. Some argue that it overreached itself, taking on too many risky contracts that proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. Last year, it issued three profit warnings in five months and wrote off more than Â£1bn from the value of contracts. This made it much harder for the company to manage its debts and pension deficit. The firm finally buckled in January 2018 under the weight of a massive Â£1.5bn debt pile. Despite discussions between Carillion, its lenders and the government, no deal could be reached to save the company. Its biggest problems were cost overruns on three UK public sector construction projects: The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell: opening delayed to 2019 due to construction problems The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital: completion date repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building The Â£745m Aberdeen bypass: delayed because of slow progress in completing initial earthworks In December, the firm convinced lenders to give it more time to repay them. But the company's banks, which include Santander UK, HSBC and Barclays, were reluctant to lend it any more cash. Carillion's share price plummeted following the first profit warning in January last year, then dropped further as more warnings were made. Large contracts were awarded to the firm during the period those warnings were being made and the company was known to be in financial difficulty. The companywas left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt. Former chief executive Richard Howson, who headed the company from 2012 until July 2017, earned Â£1.5m in 2016, which included Â£245,000 in bonuses and Â£231,000 in pension contributions. As part of his departure deal, Carillion had agreed to continue paying him a Â£660,000 salary and Â£28,000 in benefits until October 2018. A similar deal was struck for former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September and was set to receive Â£425,000 in base salary for the following 12 months. Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his Â£750,000 salary until July, despite being due to leave next month. However, the UK government has saidno bosses and directors of Carillion will be receiving such bonuses or severance payments. The Insolvency Service confirmed no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed this week. Executives are often granted a lengthy paid notice period. The UK Corporate Governance Code stipulates that they should be ""set at one year or less"", but that new directors can be offered longer periods. Carillion: What is it and what's happening?

"Trump signed a bill to increase Nasa funding last March It's a quarter of the way through Donald Trump's presidential term - long enough to judge his performance so far. There have been promises kept, promises broken and promises ignored. But how much have his policies changed things? A business tycoon with no political experience, he said he came to Washington to make waves. Has he succeeded? The Trump administration tackled the immigration issue pretty much right out of the gate, with its ill-fated executive order closing the US border to entrants from a handful of majority-Muslim nations. Implementation of that effort led to chaos at US airports and a quick suspension at the hands of US courts. Since then, the White House has rolled out two new border orders, adding a few countries to the banned list and removing one (Sudan). The latest measures have, at least so far, largely withstood legal challenge. Immigration enforcement has also been ramped up - 143,470 arrests for violations for the year ending in October - a 30% increase. Mr Trump also announced an end to the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which granted normalised residency status to roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US when they were young. The order has been temporarily suspended by the court, and is the subject of ongoing negotiations in Congress. About 200,000 Salvadoreans face an uncertain future because the White House has brought their temporary protected status (TPS) to an end. Mr Trump is pushing for sweeping changes to the US immigration system, including reductions in the total number of entrants, the termination of the visa lottery system and greatly reducing the ability of current US residents to bring relatives into the country. Those measures will be strongly opposed by Democrats, however. As for the Mexican border wall, perhaps the most memorable of Mr Trump's campaign promises, funding is still in doubt and - and the money to pay for it will almost certainly come from US taxpayers, not Mexico. Making waves?The president has sweeping authority on immigration and border issues - and he's used it, even if some lower courts have tried to clip his wings. Still, there's nothing Mr Trump would like more than to stand in front of a shiny, new border wall. Because of the controversial move by Senate Republicans to block consideration of Barack Obama's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat in 2016, Mr Trump had the opportunity to put his mark on the high court just months after taking office. The president's judicial accomplishments stretch well beyond one Supreme Court pick, however. Senate Republicans also largely refused to confirm Mr Obama's lower court nominees for the last two years of his term, leaving a record number of open slots for Mr Trump to fill. He's had 12 circuit court and six district court judges confirmed so far. There are currently 149 vacancies left - with 47 presidential nominees awaiting Senate approval. All these judges will hold lifetime appointments, guaranteeing that after one year in office Mr Trump has already cemented a lasting conservative legacy on the US judicial branch. It's also a reason Republicans are eager to maintain control of the Senate in the upcoming mid-term elections. If Democrats take control, expect Mr Trump's ability to get his people on the federal bench to be sharply curtailed. Making waves?Through fortune and political force of will, the stars have aligned for conservatives eager to make their mark on the judiciary. Some were concerned that Mr Trump may be unreliable when it comes to picking nominees, but he's more than exceeded their expectations. In his inaugural address, Mr Trump outlined an ambitious new programme of US infrastructure investment. ""We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels, and railways, all across our wonderful nation,"" he said. ""We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labour."" Since then, Mr Trump's big infrastructure plan has always been just around the next bend of the road. Instead, Congress and the administration first focused on healthcare reform, an effort that ended in a string of disappointments. Then they turned their gaze on tax reform, which had a much happier ending. Aside from a few press events, such as a June announcement of an air traffic control initiative that has since gone nowhere, infrastructure talk has been little more than empty words. ""It's infrastructure week"", in fact, has become a running joke among Washington insiders grown used to seeing the White House's intended talking points and objectives derailed by controversies big and small. Making waves?Where would Mr Trump be today if he had led with a bipartisan infrastructure programme that was met with overwhelming public approval, instead of travel bans and an extended, acrimonious fight over healthcare? For much of the year, it looked as though Mr Trump's efforts to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a conservative plan would fall flat. It took two tries for the House of Representatives to pass a bill - which was unceremoniously abandoned by the Senate. The upper chamber's efforts to craft their own version were dramatically derailed by Senator McCain's late-night ""no vote"", and a subsequent, bare bones effort met with defeat as well. Beneath those dramatic legislative failures, however, the administration has taken significant steps to chip away at the foundations of the Democrat's signature law. The president suspended payments to insurance companies to help them control the costs of insuring poorer, sicker Americans. The administration greatly curtailed efforts to encourage Americans to sign up on the government-run health insurance exchanges - although enrolment numbers held firm in 2017. Congressional Republicans also placed a stick of Obamacare dynamite in the tax bill the passed in December, repealing the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance as of January 2019. The move could lead healthier Americans to forego insurance until they get sick, driving up premiums. Meanwhile, under Mr Trump's watch, Congress has yet to renew a health-insurance programme for children from less-affluent families, causing concern among states that manage the system. In October Mr Trump declared opioid addiction to be a public-health emergency, although no new resources have been allotted to deal with the situation and the order will expire later in January. Making waves?It's taken a year, but Mr Trump is making strides toward repealing Obamacare. The ""replace"" portion of the task, however, is still far out of reach. In meetings with foreign leaders, the president has repeatedly emphasised ""reciprocal"" trade and encouraged friendly nations to buy US-made products. The president quickly ended US participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and initiated talks with Canada and Mexico to restructure the North American Free Trade Agreement - negotiations that presently seem to be severely strained. The US and Canada have also been mired in a dispute over softwood lumber, dairy products and aircraft sales, leading to US ""duty investigations"" that could lead to new tariffs. In January, Canada filed a formal complaint against the US with the World Trade Organisation, alleging violations of international rules. What will Trump impact be on world trade? Although Mr Trump talked up confrontation with China on the campaign stump, action toward the US's largest trading partner has been muted. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit with China grew to $35.4bn in November, the largest gap over two years. The overall US trade deficit in November was $50.5bn, the largest in five years, indicating that the total mark for 2017 could reach five-year highs as well. While Mr Trump campaigned on closing the US trade gap, the widening deficit can be attributed largely to continued US economic growth. Making waves?Mr Trump has hinted at big trade moves to come, but in the first year the primary change is that US support for expanding free trade across the world has ground to a halt. This video can not be played What the world thinks of Trump What promises has Trump kept as president? 11 things we never said before Trump Trump defeat still haunts Democratic voters At the end of 2017, Mr Trump boasted that he had signed more legislation than any previous president. While that claim was clearly not true - the 94 bills that reached his desk rank well behind John F Kennedy's 684 and trail all modern presidents - he did close out the year with one major legislative accomplishment. Mr Trump promised voters he would enact major tax reform on individuals and businesses, and in the waning days of 2017 Republicans - with no Democratic support - enacted sweeping tax cuts for businesses and many Americans. Top personal rates were slashed, a tax credit for families with children was doubled and the standard deduction for individuals who do not itemise their tax returns was increased. The total cost of the changes to the tax code has been estimated at $1.5tn over 10 years - and it would be more, except the individual tax reductions are set to expire after eight years. Some of Mr Trump's more ambitious reform goals were left on the cutting room floor, however. While there are provisions to allow corporations to repatriate overseas earnings and changes to a more territorial-based business tax system to discourage outsourcing, there's little to encourage existing overseas factories to relocate back to the US. Another survivor was the carried-interest loophole used by hedge-fund managers and other powerful Wall Street investors to pay greatly reduced taxes - which was condemned repeatedly by Mr Trump during the campaign. There were also some prominent losers in the president's tax reforms, namely individuals in high-tax, largely Democratic states, who will lose the ability to deduct state and local taxes over a $10,000 cap. Mr Trump is revelling in the recent announcements by major corporations that they are passing some of their tax savings along to employees and customers - although polls continue to show that many Americans think the new law won't help their bottom line. Making waves?Mr Trump can lay claim to the most substantive change to US tax law in 16 years, enacting the kind of massive corporate tax cut that Republicans have been after for decades. In a mid-December press event, Mr Trump stood in a White House room next to a towering mound of white papers. ""For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,"" the president said. ""But all that changed the day I took the oath of office."" While it may not have happened quite so instantly, the first year of the Trump administration has seen a significant reduction in the amount of federal regulation, and no place has that been more marked than in the way the government deals with environmental issues. Shortly after his inauguration, Mr Trump gave final approval to several long-delayed oil pipelines. The recently completed tax bill opened vast swaths of Alaskan wilderness up to new oil and gas drilling. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt recently announced energy exploration would be permitted off much of the rest of the US coastline (although Florida, with its Republican governor, became a notable exception). The government's environmental department, the EPA, also rescinded Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions from coal-based power plants, although those changes will likely be bogged down in legal challenges for years. According to a New York Times tracker, the administration has sought to reverse at least 60 federal environmental regulations and has succeeded in 29 instances. Mr Trump also greatly reduced the amount of federal protected land in Utah, opening the door for increased development in the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. It was the largest such rollback in US history. On 1 June the president also announced the US was withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, although the benchmarks the US agreed to were not mandatory. Making waves?President Obama had taken significant administrative steps to increase environmental regulation and enforcement over the objection of Republicans in Congress. Now the Trump administration is using that same authority to tear it all down. Mr Trump's first year in office has been filled with economic good news. The stock market, as the president frequently points out, is driving to new highs, with the Dow Jones index recently passing the 25,000 mark. Unemployment, which was at 4.8% when the president took office, has reached a 17-year low of 4.1%. In the third quarter of 2017, gross domestic product growth hit 3.2%, the highest level since the first quarter of 2015. The hard numbers indicating robust growth are translating into new levels of economic optimism. The US Consumer Confidence Index hit a 17-year high in November, before dropping slightly in December. Also in November, asmall-business confidence,externalindex hit the highest level in its 45-year history. Of course all these glowing numbers represent the continuation of trend-lines that began during the Obama administration - a fact that a majority of the nation seems to acknowledge. In a recentQuinnipiac survey,externalthat showed 66% of the public believes the economy is ""excellent or good"",  49% think it is because of Mr Obama while only 40% credit Mr Trump. Making waves?The rising economic tide is buoying Mr Trump's hopes that a public presently divided about his presidency will eventually give him his due. He has three more years to make his case. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised an ""America First"" foreign policy that asked allies to carry more of the financial and military burden. He's now had a year to show what that looks like in action. The president delivered a blunt speech to Nato allies in Belgium, surprising many observers by declining to reiterate US support for the pact's mutual-defence arrangements Mr Trump engaged in a very public exchange of insults with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, calling him ""little rocket man"" and saying his nation would be met with ""fire and fury"" if they continued their bellicose rhetoric. The most notable use of US military force during Mr Trump's first year was his missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to that nation's use of chemical weapons. The highest-profile incident of US combat casualties, on the other hand, came when a group of special forces were ambushed in Niger leading to four deaths - drawing attention to the increased US military presence in Africa. In Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Trump has given his generals a free hand to prosecute the ongoing military engagements. Over the course of the year, the so-called Islamic State has been largely defeated on the battlefield and its influence curtailed. The conflict in Afghanistan drags on, however, as the president increased the number of US troops there to 14,000. He also recently threatened to cut off aid to Pakistan if it does not do more to support the US fight against Islamic militants. Mr Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, although the most dramatic development in that area was the president's move to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital - thrilling the Israeli government but prompting stern condemnations from Palestinian officials and much of the global community. With great fanfare, he declined to recertify Iranian compliance with multinational nuclear deal, although that is largely a symbolic act unless sanctions that have been suspended are reimposed. Making waves?Mr Trump talks about foreign policy like no other modern American president. Critics will say he's undermining US standing on the world stage, but when it comes to actual policy this isn't the paradigm shift feared - or hoped for - by some There's never been an American president quite like Donald Trump. No one has ever held the office with no prior elective or military leadership experience. No one, in modern times at least, has been as blunt or as disruptive a force on the national and international stage. For many of the president's supporters, this is exactly what they wanted. They supported the candidate who told them the system was broken, the other politicians on the stage with him were phony and the process was a joke. They asked for different, and different is what they got. Mr Trump has said he is defining ""modern day presidential"" with his free-form use of social media, his continued practice of giving unscripted campaign-style rally speeches and his willingness to disregard many of the time-honoured traditions of politics. In some ways his has been a conventional presidency. His court appointments are largely in keeping with conservative desires, his tax package was a longtime Republican wish-list and his efforts at deregulation are out of the party's anti-big-government playbook. But the way Mr Trump has operated, and the way he has talked about how he is going about running the nation, has been one-of-a-kind. Making waves?It remains to be seen whether Donald Trump is permanently changing the way politics is conducted in the US. A quarter of the way through his term in office, however, it should be quite clear that US politics isn't changing Donald Trump.

"GÃ¼iÃ±as are considered pests by some people as they can steal chickens It's the smallest cat in the Americas, occupying the smallest area of land. Listed as vulnerable to extinction, the gÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat of Chile has lost much of its natural home as forests are chopped down or converted to farmland. And, like many carnivores, it's at risk from human persecution over fears it might kill livestock. However, new research shows the animal is able to survive near human settlements on agricultural land. Its biggest threat is being squeezed out when land is broken up into smaller areas, say conservationists. The guiÃ±a is known variously as the little tiger cat, little spotted cat or Chilean cat. About half the size of the domestic cat, it is one of the most threatened cat species in South America. GÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat spotted on a camera-trap The wildcat lives only in central and southern Chile and in a narrow strip of Argentina. According to the IUCN, there are only about 10,000 individuals left in the wild. Its natural habitat is rainforest, but it has also been seen in pine or eucalyptus plantations or close to agricultural areas. Research led by the University of Kent, UK, found that habitat fragmentation, and the subdivision of large farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal. ""This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,"" said Dr NicolÃ¡s GÃ¡lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. More than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the gÃ¼iÃ±a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss. They say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the gÃ¼iÃ±a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat. The wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile This is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say. Another threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens. Questionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a gÃ¼iÃ±a over the last decade. ""This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,"" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent. Theresearch,externalpublished in theJournal of Applied Ecology,externalprovides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat. The approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"Trump and Kim on TV screens in Seoul The world has become a more uncertain place since US President Donald Trump issued his ""America First"" decree in the dark and dystopian language that so alarmed allies and intrigued adversaries. But has it become more dangerous? Not if you look at what's actually happened. President Trump may have stoked fears and churned up chaos with his erratic and volatile Twitter feed. But he has not torpedoed the alliances he has questioned. He hasn't started any new wars and, by and large, he's followed the script of his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the old ones. So, while he may have shaken things up, he hasn't blown anything up. But has this unorthodox commander-in-chief edged us closer to some sort of global crisis? Here are my takeaways. Since he became president, the Islamic State group has been all but defeated in Iraq and Syria - the IS caliphate has been eliminated and its remnants are on the run. Yes, the group has spawned active affiliates in other parts of the world, and it's a brand that continues to inspire extremist violence. But its nerve centre has been severed, making its threat less potent. Palmyra was liberated from IS control One can argue about whether Mr Trump is entitled to claim credit or whether he simply completed what Mr Obama started. He did follow Mr Obama's template - supporting local forces with bombs from the air and special operations forces on the ground - but accelerated the campaign and gave American commanders more authority to run it. That ""had a major impact"", says Brett McGurk, the special envoy for the global coalition to counter the IS group, who has worked for both presidents. Either way, it happened on Mr Trump's watch, and is arguably his biggest foreign policy success. A year ago, the Americans and five other world powers had reduced the threat of an Iranian atomic bomb with an agreement that limited its nuclear programme. The deal is broadly seen to be working, but Mr Trump says it's deeply flawed and needs to be ""fixed"". He's threatening to abandon it unless the Europeans who helped negotiate it take a harder line. Mr Trump wants to make the nuclear restrictions permanent, restrict Iran's ballistic weapons programme and counter ""malign"" Iranian activities not covered in the accord, such as its support for regional proxies that threaten Western allies. These are things the Europeans agree need to be addressed, but not by enfeebling the nuclear deal which, they say, is crucial to their security. There are three potential dangers if the agreement unravels - greater instability in the Middle East, especially given Trump's strong support for Iran's regional rival, Saudi Arabia; and a weakening of the transatlantic alliance, which has been a cornerstone of global security since World War Two. It could also undermine the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on which the Iran deal was built, says Angela Kane, until recently the UN's top disarmament official: ""We need to have this as a gold standard."" North Korea's Kim Jong-un has made the world a more dangerous place by building nuclear weapons and threatening the US with them. But Mr Trump has made the situation more dangerous by responding with fiery rhetoric, increasing the risk of accidental conflict with the reclusive and paranoid regime. True, he swings between hurling insults and threats to expressing a willingness to talk. Right now he's doing the latter, going with the flow of the Olympic dÃ©tente between the Koreas. And the administration has built a strong coalition of international support for a higher-pressure strategy, united in its demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? That, says John Negroponte, deputy secretary of state under George W Bush, shows Mr Trump is trying to make the world safer. People ""got all upset because he called Kim Jong-un 'Rocket Man' at theâ¦ United Nations, and that's endangering world peace? Come on!"" he says. ""Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me!"" Patrick Cronin, an Asia expert at the Center for a New American Security,says Mr Trump's brinkmanship serves a purpose,external: ""Kim thinks we don't use force and that's why President Trump is right to kind of stress, in his maniacal way, that 'you don't know that.'"" Still, this is the first time the US has threatened to attack a nuclear-armed state since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. That was dangerous, and lessâ¦ unorthodox. Six graphics that tell story of Trump's first year What has actually changed under Trump? What Trump has said about your country Trump and Putin share a joke but the rift between their countries deepens Speaking of the Cold War, the recent false alert in Hawaii that warned of an incoming missile was caused by a worker who pushed the wrong button during a shift change. William Perry, secretary of defence under Bill Clinton, is all too familiar with false alerts - he was awakened by a call from a nightwatch officer in 1979 and thought he was ""about to experience the holocaust"". Mr Perry presided over the dismantlement of nuclear weapons in the 1990s but now warns the threat is back - ""because the US and Russia today are confronting each other with a hostility that's recreating the geopolitical dangers of the Cold War,"" he said at a recent forum. ""And because the US and Russia are rebuilding their nuclear arsenals that's recreating the military dangers of the Cold War."" This is not Mr Trump's fault, per se. The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, upped the ante with his interventions in Ukraine, and under Mr Obama the presidents stopped talking to each other in any meaningful way. Mr Trump wants to talk to Mr Putin, probably too much. But he can't, because the controversy over whether his campaign colluded with Moscow to influence his election has created such a toxic climate in Washington. Ironically the relationship is worse now than it was under Barack Obama. Donald Trump has made it clear that he prefers generals to diplomats. He's proposed deep budget cuts to the state department and presided over the marginalisation of diplomatic influence in national security decision-making. The militarisation of US foreign policy has been under way for some time, especially since the 9/11 attacks, but Mr Trump has accelerated it. He doesn't seem to understand or care much for diplomacy. When asked about unfilled positions at the state department, he famously channelled Louis XIV, telling a Fox News presenter he was the only one who mattered because ""when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be"". Diplomacy is a bit like preventive health care - it solves problems before they become wars. So if you weaken it, you're more likely to have wars. And if Mr Trump wants to #MAGA [Make America Great Again], he'd do well to remember that many of the critical successes of American foreign policy have been diplomatic - think the Marshall Plan, the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. Its military adventures less so - think Vietnam, Iraq. This video can not be played What the world thinks of Trump Mr Trump has begun to unpick America's commitment to a network of agreements that are supposed to collectively solve the world's problems. Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord has been the most consequential so far. It's true that the process takes four years and that other factors are mitigating the effects - American states and private companies are continuing with their own clean-power plans. But the US will be doing far less to fight global warming than it might have done. More broadly, Mr Trump's America First rhetoric seems aimed at disrupting the alliances and institutions that have kept the world peaceful since World War Two. Or at least, he is retreating from America's traditional lead role in maintaining them. If Mr Trump ""succeeds in dismantling that order the world will be a lot more dangerous"", says David Ignatius, who writes about foreign affairs for the Washington Post. But, he told me, American power has ""a durability that transcends Trump and his government by tweet"". Richard Haass, of the Council on Foreign Relations, is more pessimistic.He writes in The Atlantic,externalthat no other power is capable of taking America's place if it withdraws from actively promoting international order. ""The alternative to a US-led international order is less international order."" The US has walked away from global agreements You can argue that Donald Trump is driven more by his volatile personality than his commitment to America First. That has introduced an almost permanent element of disruption into US foreign policy, channelled by his Twitter feed and often contradicting his more stable senior officials. Mr Trump's supporters claim the unpredictability of his tweets can be used as leverage in international dealings. Or that they should be ignored as he rarely follows through with his threats. But it confuses allies and adversaries alike about what exactly US policy is and decreases international confidence in American leadership. And that's not a comfortable place to be - having to live with an unpredictable White House in an unpredictable world.
