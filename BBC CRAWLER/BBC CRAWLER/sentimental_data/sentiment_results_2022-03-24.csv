"Rishi Sunak has been accused of not doing enough to help the poorest as the cost of food and energy increases at its fastest rate for 30 years. The Resolution Foundation and Institute for Fiscal Studies think tanks said he could have done more to protect those hit hardest by rising costs. Planned increases in benefits will be much smaller than the rise in the cost of living this year. Mr Sunak said tax cuts this year would help those on low wages the most. He said his plans to raise the point at which workers start paying National Insurance would particularly help people on low and middle incomes. And he said it was impossible for him to ""fully compensate"" people for spiralling energy costs, a challenge the UK was ""not alone"" in facing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also hinted more help for people struggling was on its way in the coming months. ""The cost of living is the single biggest thing we're having to fix, and we will fix it,"" the prime minister told LBC Radio, adding: ""As we go forward, we need to do more"". Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you People face biggest living standards drop since 1956 This video can not be played Watch: Sunak defends measures set out in Spring Statement Mr Sunak sought to address the rising cost of living in his Spring Statement on Wednesday, cutting 5p from fuel duty and taking some of the sting out of April's National Insurance (NI) rise by raising the point at which workers have to start paying it from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570 from July. But he has faced calls from opposition MPs to do more to help people now, as inflation is predicted to hit more than 8% by end of the year and UK living standards are predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility to fall faster than at any time since the 1950s. His tweaks to National Insurance fell short of the demands from Labour and some Tory MPs, who had called on him to scrap April's rise completely. One of the Conservatives who had called on him to scrap the increase, Richard Drax, said the chancellor's approach was ""tinkering around the edge"" and he had not gone far enough to ease the tax burden. Another Conservative backbencher, Peter Aldous, said the chancellor's tweaks would ""offset"" the effect of the NI rise - but added the below-inflation increase to benefits meant claimants would still see a ""significant fall"" in spending power. Privately, there is angst among some Conservatives, including ministers, that the changes announced by Rishi Sunak amounted to ""fiddling,"" as one put it. Another was scathing about what they perceived to be the political calculation made by a chancellor desperate to be seen as a tax-cutter at a time when taxing and government spending is higher than it's been for decades. One described Mr Sunak's promise to cut income tax - but possibly not for two years - as ""ridiculous,"" seeing it as a gesture to burnish his credentials and image as a future prime minister rather than sensible policy making. A photo opportunity where Mr Sunak filled up someone else's car with petrol is also being privately mocked among some of his colleagues. But there's a deeper concern from many here: that at what one minister described as a ""genuinely difficult time for people,"" the capacity for any government to make a substantial difference is limited. And plenty fret this government has not yet grasped the true scale of the problems coming down the track. The Institute for Fiscal Studies' director Paul Johnson said that overall the measures set out by Mr Sunak - including council tax and energy bill rebates announced last year - amounted to a ""relatively modest giveaway"" of around Â£5bn. He acknowledged that the chancellor had been ""caught in a bind"", dealing with the effects of the pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukraine. But he said that the new policies would ""not be enough to protect poorer households from a significant hit to their living standards"". And, despite the chancellor's rhetoric about cutting taxes, they were set to rise their highest level as a share of national income since the 1940s, when Britain was emerging from World War Two. Another think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, criticised Mr Sunak's decision to go ahead with April's National Insurance rise, but said his tweaks to the starting point for paying the tax were a good way to ""soften the blow"". ""This has long been a good idea which help ensure that work pays, and leave money in the pockets of lower earners beyond the current crisis,"" it added, saying boosting growth in the long term was the only way out of the current economic issues.

But the chancellor said this needed to been seen in the context of the ""biggest economic shock in over 300 years"" due to Covid. Speaking to the BBC, he said borrowing had spiralled to its biggest level since World War Two as a result of spending to support the economy during pandemic. ""It's unsurprising that dealing with the aftermath of that is also pretty exceptional,"" he added. Powder is being kept dry, while the energy cap suppresses further rises in bills. The extent of any further support can be determined in the summer, when it will be clear if the new cap implies average bills of an incredible Â£200 per month or even a truly terrifying Â£300 per month. That in turn depends on the war in Ukraine and supplies of energy from Russia. Not even the Office for Budget Responsibility knows where this is going to land. But there is space for a support package of several billion, if required. Mr Sunak also used Wednesday's statement to promise to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20p to 19p in the pound by the next general election in 2024, when he said the UK economy would be in better shape than it is now.

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009 and they have two children Rishi Sunak has denied any connection with a multinational firm part-owned by his wife that has continued to operate in Russia during the war in Ukraine. The chancellor said he had ""nothing to do"" with Infosys, in which his wife Akshata Murty holds shares. He has urged UK firms to pull out of Russia to inflict ""economic pain"" on President Vladimir Putin. Mr Sunak's spokesperson said Ms Murty had no role in Infosys's operational decisions. The software giant was co-founded by Ms Murty's father Narayana, an Indian billionaire who retired from the company in 2014. Founded in 1981, the firm has since expanded into a number of countries and operates an office in Moscow. Itsmost recent annual report,externallists Ms Murty as holding 0.9% of the company's shares - reportedly worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Let's hit Putin's gold, says PM amid new sanctions Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Profile: Rishi Sunak India has not followed Western countries, including the UK, in restricting trade with Russia via sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Mr Sunak said the government would ""fully support"" UK firms that pull out of Russia voluntarily. After meeting a group of leading British companies, the chancellor said he welcomed the ""consensus on the need to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his regime"". ""While I recognise that it may be challenging to wind down existing investments, I believe there is no argument for new investment in the Russian economy,"" he added. ""I am urging asset owners and managers to think very carefully about any investments that would in any sense support Putin and his regime."" Pressed on Infosys's presence in Russia on Thursday, Mr Sunak told Sky News: ""I'm an elected politician, and I'm here to talk to you about what I'm responsible for. My wife is not."" He added that companies' operations were ""up to them"". ""We've put in place significant sanctions and all the companies we're responsible for are following those, as they rightly should,"" said the chancellor. Narayana Murthy co-founded Infosys, often seen as the poster child of India's technology boom. A spokesperson for the chancellor said Ms Murty was ""one of thousands of minority shareholders in the company"". ""It is a public company and neither her nor any member of her family have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company,"" they added. Infosys said it had a ""small team of employees based out of Russia"" that ""services some of our global clients, locally"". ""We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,"" it added. ""Infosys supports and advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine"". Infosys hashad connections in the past to Alfa Bank,external, one of Russia's biggest financial institutions, which was added to the UK's sanctions list on Thursday, having already been sanctioned by the US and EU. In 2004, Mr Putin visited Infosys' headquarters in Bangalore, where he was given a guided tour by Narayana Murthy. Mr Sunak met his future spouse while studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. They married in 2009 and have two children.

"The government is considering plans to lower people's energy bills based on how close they are to onshore wind turbines, the BBC has been told. It's an idea the energy company Octopus offers some customers in Yorkshire and Caerphilly. But the government is considering expanding this across the country. There are currently strict planning rules about where onshore wind farms can be built in England, which inhibit the development of wind farms. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is in favour of loosening regulations to make it easier to approve plans for more onshore wind. Cabinet split over onshore wind expansion plan The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis It's expected the government will outline its energy supply strategy next week - which will include plans for accelerating renewable energy in the UK. One plan under consideration is reviewing planning laws in England, that were tightened in 2015, to make it easier to approve more onshore wind farms. The business secretary supports the idea, and Downing Street sources have said the government has ""got to be open"" to more onshore wind. It is understood Michael Gove - who is in charge of planning in England - is also supportive. But the BBC has been told othercabinet ministers strongly oppose the plans, and onshore wind farms have been controversial with Conservative activists in the past. A government source said that - if the idea is approved - ""as with any development, local consent is absolutely critical. We would always want to bring the public with us."" Electricity and gas bills for a typical household will go up by Â£693 a year in April, a 54% increase. In October, customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. But the OBR on Wednesday forecast that energy bills will rise by 40% again in October, if wholesale gas prices remain at the same level they are now. In his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. What help with bills is there? The BBC understands one option under consideration is introducing a scheme to make energy bills cheaper depending on how close people live to an onshore wind farm. It's understood this would apply to new developments. Currently, a similar scheme is run by the energy company Octopus. Their customers get 20% off electricity bills when their local turbine is spinning, and 50% off when it's picking up speed. There are two local wind turbines using this model so far - one in Market Weighton in Yorkshire and one in Caerphilly in Wales. Can the energy crisis help the climate? Ukraine war 'puts Wylfa nuclear back on agenda' The BBC has been told that the government is ""very interested"" in this model and are considering expanding it across the country to provide an incentive for onshore wind farms to be approved in people's local areas. A government source said: ""Ministers would want to ensure communities are able to directly benefit from hosting renewable energy infrastructure. There are a range of different options under discussion."" The energy strategy expected next week is likely to focus on plans to accelerate the rollout of more renewable and nuclear energy in the UK - as well as the government's ambitions to loosen regulations around extracting North Sea oil and gas while the government moves away from Russian gas and transitions towards more renewable energy. Labour MP Darren Jones, who is chair of the Commons select committee which focuses on business and energy, called on the government for more action on energy. ""For colleagues in Parliament who have concerns about onshore wind turbines, which is a much better option than fracking, maybe they can demand that government brings forward the delayed updates to the energy efficiency voucher scheme to help families insulate their homes and reduce energy demand in the first place.""

"Lyn Burrow says her plans have been thrown into chaos A funeral plan provider with 45,000 customers in the UK has collapsed, throwing contracts into doubt and raising concern over refunds. Safe Hands had already signalled its intention to stop operating, but its collapse means pre-bought funerals may not be honoured. Administrators said the company could not provide immediate refunds, leaving many worried their money will be lost. The sector is facing an imminent overhaul,leaving other plans in doubt. From 29 July, any provider must be authorised andregulated by the Financial Conduct Authority,external(FCA) which, from that point onwards, will give consumers far greater protection than they have at the moment. Safe Hands was one of dozens of companies operating in the currently unregulated pre-paid funeral sector. Customers such as Lyn Burrow, 72, and her husband Fred, 80, signed up to contracts that saved their family the expense and emotional cost of organising their funerals when they die. The couple spent a total of Â£6,310 on their plan, which she said had given them ""peace of mind"". She spoke toBBC Radio 4's Money Box programmeabout her concerns when it emerged that Safe Hands had decided to stop operating when new regulations begin. Now, following news that the company is in administration, those fears have heightened. She said: ""My family was supposed not to have to worry, but what are we going to do now?"" ""If we could at least recover some of the money, we could make up the difference with a reputable company. But Â£6,000 is a lot of money. It would have to come from our savings."" Joint administrator Nedim Ailyan, partner at FRP, said they would carry out a detailed investigation to discover what could be returned to creditors, including policyholders - whose funds are in a trust fund, which itself has a shortfall compared to what is required for full refunds. ""Regrettably, the administration means the company is not in a position to issue refunds at this time. We appreciate how upsetting this period of uncertainty will be for Safe Hands Plans' customers and their families,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, there is a shortfall between the level of plan holder investments and the forecast level of funeral plan costs to be paid. Essentially, the value of the investments is not enough to meet the funeral plan obligations of the company."" Any funeral plans activated in the next two weeks, because the policyholder has died, will be covered by another provider - Dignity. Mr Ailyan said a ""longer-term solution"" was being sought beyond that deadline, and customers - or their loved ones - would be contacted. A helpline has been set up on 0800 640 9928. Funeral costs drop for first time in 18 years Cold-calling ban among plans for pre-paid funerals The FCA said it was reforming the sector because elderly, and very often vulnerable, customers have been subjected to unfair practices such as high pressure sales tactics and cold calls. It wants to raise standards by regulating what companies can and cannot do. However, a FCA spokeswoman said that, in the case of Safe Hands, its powers were limited because it had yet to come under the regulator's jurisdiction. ""People who bought a pre-paid funeral plan with Safe Hands will be understandably concerned, which is why we welcome Dignity stepping in to provide funerals for the next two weeks,"" she said. ""We will continue to support the administrators and industry to see whether there is a longer-term solution for Safe Hands' customers."" Mike Hilliar, director for funeral planning at Dignity, said: ""Dignity stands by its commitment to provide assistance where we can, and we will be working with others in the industry to come to a resolution to help customers of Safe Hands, or indeed of other plan providers that do not achieve authorisation with the regulator."" 1.6 million customers 200,000 funeral plans taken out every year Approximately 65 companies Average plan costs Â£4,000 Average plan lasts for 8 years Source: FCA/Fairer Finance As the funeral plan market is being reformed, industry insiders are worried that this could mean more of the 65 providers will go out of business, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket. Whilst many of the larger, more reputable firms are expected to be granted authorisation by the FCA, others are unlikely to even apply for authorisation or will be turned down. If that happens they will be unable or not allowed to operate beyond 29 July. While customers who have signed up to plans very recently can cancel during a cooling-off period, others will have to wait to see what happens to their provider and their plan.

"Ukraine is ""not alone"" in its fight against Russia's invasion, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said the UK would not stand by while Vladimir Putin ""vents his fury on Ukraine"" and would work to ramp up defensive weaponry for the country. Speaking in Brussels, he warned that, if the Russian president used chemical weapons, the consequences would be ""catastrophic for him"". Earlier, the UK announced sanctions on 65 more Russian groups and individuals. Mr Johnson later told BBC Newsnight that Russia did not want peace, and instead wanted to intensify its attack on Ukraine. Leaders from Nato, the EU and the G7 have been holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the conflict. Speaking at a news conference following the Nato summit, Mr Johnson defended the level of the UK's support for Ukraine, saying the government planned to send 6,000 more missiles to the country as well as an extra Â£25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The PM said kit would be provided to Ukraine to defend against ""its bullying neighbour"". Mr Johnson also promised a new deployment of UK troops to Bulgaria, on top of doubling troops both in Poland and in Estonia. It follows Nato's earlier announcement that new battle groups would be created in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. ""The message Putin can take is: Ukraine is not alone. We stand with the people of Kyiv, Mariupol, Lviv and Donetsk,"" Mr Johnson said. ""As President Zelensky himself has said, the people of Ukraine must prevail and Putin must fail - and he will."" Let's hit Putin's gold, says PM amid new sanctions Defiant troops to Russians: 'Go home while you're alive' Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Mr Johnson added that Western nations were looking to ""steadily ratchet up"" the amount of military gear they are sending Ukraine, but that it was proving ""difficult"" to meet the country's request for warplanes and tanks. In a virtual appearance at the summit earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's asked Nato for ""1% of all your planes, 1% of all your tanks"". Mr Johnson said: ""What President Zelensky wants is to try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city. To that end he does need armour, as he sees it."" ""We are looking at what we can do to help. But logistically it looks very difficult both with armour and with jets."" Mr Johnson added that no Western power was looking to put ""boots on the ground"" or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian president wanted more from Nato, saying allies felt ""agony"" about their ""inability to do more given the constraints we face"". In a statement reported by Russia's Ria news agency, Russia's foreign ministry said Nato's decision to continue supporting Ukraine showed the military alliance wanted the conflict to continue. This video can not be played Watch: Zelensky calls on people to 'support freedom' one month after Russia invaded Ukraine The UK government has already given Â£400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and its neighbouring nations since Russia's invasion last month. The PM said ministers had sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and entities so far in the toughest sanctions the UK had ever imposed. The Wagner Group, a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military, was among the 65 entities hit by the latest sanctions announced by the UK earlier. Also targeted were Gazprombank, the country's third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Polina Kovaleva, who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated Â£4m, was also targeted by the measures. Earlier, Mr Johnson called on the West to consider measures to prevent Russia using its gold reserves to prop up its currency, the rouble. He told the news conference the Kremlin was ""trying to get around the sanctions on their gold"" and the UK and others were trying to ensure there was ""no leakage or no sale of bullion into markets around the world"".

He said that, while one could be sympathetic to ordinary Russians, the way Mr Putin was leading Russia was ""utterly catastrophic"" and his invasion of Ukraine was ""inhuman and barbaric"". Mr Johnson dismissed talk about the use of nuclear weapons as a ""distraction"" from what was happening in Ukraine - where he said Russia's use of conventional weapons against ""innocent people"" had been ""absolutely barbaric"". He warned that any use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be ""disastrous for Putin"". ""There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that the consequences would be very, very severe. ""You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that. And I think that he understands that."" This video can not be played Watch what Boris Johnson says about the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight Mr Johnson said Ukraine can win the war with Russia - not necessarily on the battlefield, but by making an occupation impossible. ""There's a sense in which Putin has already failed, or lost, because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is - and, far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation, he's solidified it... He can't subjugate Ukraine."" The prime minister added that he was ""not optimistic"" the Russian president truly wanted peace, and that he had instead decided to ""double down"" in his assault on Ukraine which he said was a ""tragic mistake."" Mr Johnson sparked anger at the weekend afterappearing to make a comparison between Britons voting to leave the European Union and Ukrainiansfighting for the freedom from Russia. But when asked about this the prime minister said that had not been the analogy he was making and his words had been ""wildly misconstrued"". Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden warned any use of chemical weapons by Mr Putin would be met with a ""response in kind"", the nature of which ""would depend on the nature of the use"". Mr Biden said the Russian President had ""miscalculated"" in his decision to invade Ukraine, and had banked on ""Nato being split"". ""Nato has never, never been more united. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of (what) he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.""

"The West should consider ways to stop Russia using its gold reserves to prop up the rouble, the prime minister said. Boris Johnson's comments came as the UK announced sanctions on 65 more groups and individuals, including a private military firm and a major Russian bank. Speaking ahead of a Nato summit, the PM said the UK and the West must ""tighten the economic vice"" on Vladimir Putin. He said Russia crossed ""red lines"" by targeting Ukrainian civilians and tough steps now could help shorten the war. In addition to the new raft of financial sanctions, the UK government has announced plans to send 6,000 more missiles to Ukraine. Leaders from Nato, the EU, and the G7 are holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine. On Thursday, Nato announced the creation of new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used a virtual address to urge the bloc to increase its supply of military equipment. Ahead of the talks, Mr Johnson said that, by deliberately bombing civilian centres, Putin had ""already crossed the red line into barbarism"". ""We've got to step up. We've got to increase our support,"" he said. ""We've got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today, as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group, looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves."" In an interview with LBC, he added: ""We need to do more economically. ""Can we do more to stop him [Putin] using his gold reserves, for instance, in addition to his cash reserves? The more pressure we apply now, particularly on things like gold, I believe the more we can shorten the war â¦ And then we need to do more to give the Ukrainians military support."" As Mr Putin invaded Ukraine, the Russian Central Bank deployed some of its $640bn war chest of currency and gold reservesto prop up the Russian rouble.

""I simply want you to know the alliance still can prevent Ukrainian deathsâ¦ by providing us all the munitions we are asking for."" The summit follows an announcement by the UK government that it would be providing Ukraine with an additional 6,000 anti-tank and other missiles. The UK has already sent 4,000 anti-tank weapons, but will now send another 3,000, plus a similar number of what Downing Street described as ""high explosive missiles"". The prime minister is also expected to set out plans to offer more help to Ukraine with intelligence and longer-range combat. Ukrainian officials indicated this week the country's armed forces had the equipment they needed to stop tanks at short range, but needed more that would help them do the same over longer distances. The UK will also send an additional Â£25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The government has already given Â£400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and neighbouring nations since Russia's invasion.

"President Biden is expected to discuss natural gas supplies, as the EU moves to reduce exposure to Russia US President Joe Biden joins fellow Western leaders in Brussels on Thursday for three summits on Russia's war in Ukraine, a month after the invasion began. Nato, the G7 and the EU are all holding meetings, in a display of unity rarely seen by the West. Mr Biden will take part in all three, the first ever visit by a US president to an EU summit in Brussels. But his visit to Brussels is not just about symbolism. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has given the Western defensive alliance Nato a renewed sense of purpose. And as the EU attempts to sever energy ties with Russia, it needs to forge and reinforce other relationships, particularly with the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to appear by video link at all three summits. Nato's 30 presidents and prime ministers will agree greater support for Ukraine and new troop deployments for Eastern allies. Their aim is to show solidarity to Kyiv, though only up to a point. Many, but not all, have been willing to supply weapons. The UK said it would use both the G7 and Nato meetings to ""substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine"". But the alliance has also made clear it won't become more directly involved and Mr Zelensky's repeated requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine have pretty much been ignored. Nor is it clear how Nato would respond if Russia were to dramatically escalate the conflict in Ukraine - such as an attack on a Western weapons convoy, the use of chemical, or even tactical nuclear weapons. Nato's red lines have so far been drawn at its borders. Why can't Ukraine join Nato? For the past few weeks, 30,000 Nato troops from 25 countries have been training in Norway as part of Exercise Cold Response, a long-planned exercise that has now taken on more significance. Soldiers from Sweden, which is not part of Nato, joined thousands of troops on exercise in Norway Like Ukraine, Norway borders Russia. The key difference is that, as a Nato member, Norway is covered by a commitment to ""collective defence"" - an attack on one is an attack on all. ""I think an exercise like this is pretty good to have, to prove to countries like Russiaâ¦ that you don't want to mess with Nato,"" a young Norwegian conscript called Peder told the BBC. Nato leaders are focused on how to boost their own defences. They've already sent thousands more troops to the alliance's eastern flank, along with more air defence batteries, warships and aircraft. Five challenges for Biden in Europe Nato to send more troops to Eastern Europe This, says Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, is the ""new normal"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia will get exactly what it didn't want - more, not less Nato near its border. Nato battlegroups will stretch all the way from the Baltic to the Black Sea for the foreseeable future. Two EU countries that are not members of Nato - Sweden and Finland - contributed troops to the exercise in Norway. They appear to be edging closer and closer to Nato in the wake of Russia's invasion. President Trump once questioned the very existence of Nato and French President Emmanuel Macron once called it ""brain dead"". But President Biden's visit to Brussels is proof that he sees it as being more important than ever to curb a more aggressive Russia. Defence strategy will also play a part in an EU summit where leaders will approve plans that aim to pull member states closer together on military planning, intelligence and procurement. One ambition is to have a rapidly deployable force of 5,000 troops. It's all part of the theme of ""strategic autonomy"" championed by Mr Macron. The argument is that a more sovereign Europe is a safer Europe, whether that's by securing reliable supplies of energy and semiconductor chips or by boosting military spending. But the trickiest subject for the European Union's 27 member states is fast becoming the future of energy supplies, as they try to look beyond Russia. After an initial, dizzying display of unity on sanctions across all 27 member states there are now obvious ruptures over what to do next. EU leaders have reacted fast to Russia's invasion with a series of hard-hitting sanctions German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly denounced the idea of banning Russian gas and oil imports, arguing it will drag Europe into a recession. ""Sanctions must not hit the European states harder than the Russian leadership. That is our principle,"" he said on the eve of the summit. Soaring energy prices are also a concern to be discussed by EU leaders on Friday. But there are nations agitating for action as they voice deep discomfort about handing cash to the Kremlin via energy payments. ""It's blood money,"" said one central European diplomat. ""I don't think some countries understand the gravity of the situation."" President Biden's ability to offer Europe more US Liquefied Natural Gas is a key watch at Thursday's summit. The US is the world's largest producer of natural gas. He is also expected to announce more sanctions on Russian political figures as well as so-called oligarchs. But the prospect of fresh EU sanctions this week is being played down. Some in Brussels call it ""fatigue"", while others insist it's the right time to take stock.

"Joe Biden is taking his third trip to Europe as US president at a moment of international crisis. His last journey, in the autumn for the G20 meeting in Rome and the climate conference in Glasgow, was planned months in advance. This one is of the emergency variety. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering its fourth week with no end in sight, and the path ahead for the US-Europe alliance is far from clear. Here's a look at five of the most pressing concerns as Mr Biden meets European leaders and allies in the days ahead. Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, the US has made special efforts to move only in concert with its allies. That sometimes meant holding off on actions - such as different forms of sanctions or military aid - until the rest of Nato was ready to take steps concurrently. This was never easy given the disparate interests of the 30-nation alliance, but the early, dramatic days of Russia offensive created a sense of urgency that removed some traditional obstacles to consensus. As the war drags on - and the economic fallout from the violence and resulting allied response grows more pronounced - the potential for public discord within the alliance will increase. The primary goal of Mr Biden's trip, then, is to be seen standing shoulder-to-shoulder with America's allies (literally and figuratively) and to demonstrate that strengthened Nato resolve is not a temporary condition but the new normal in response to Russia's expansionist policies. Follow live updates from inside Ukraine After meeting other leaders in Belgium, Mr Biden will travel to Poland for a bilateral meeting with President Andrzej Duda. Given the nation's position on Nato's eastern flank, the former Soviet satellite state has been given special attention by the US in the past few months, with visits from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Vice-President Kamala Harris. Although topics of military aid to Ukraine and an increased Nato presence on Polish soil are sure to come up, US officials say the top issue for the meeting will be dealing with the flood of refugees that has been arriving at the Ukraine-Poland border since hostilities began. Caring for and processing millions of refugees has put a considerable financial and logistical burdens on Poland and, if not handled competently, could ultimately lead to social unrest and economic instability. Given Poland's geopolitical importance in the confrontation with Russia, ensuring the nation remains a reliable Nato member is a pressing US concern. Where have Ukraine's 10 million refugees gone? In the past few months the US and its allies have open the spigots of lethal military aid to the uniformed and volunteer Ukrainian forces holding off the Russian assault. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear recent in speeches to legislative bodies in Europe and North America, however, the aid so far has not been enough. He says Ukraine needs more sophisticated anti-air systems as well as jet fighters capable of ""closing the skies"" over Ukraine to Russian warplanes. While the US has promised to provide more advanced long-range air defense capabilities, that's easier said than done. As seen with the friction between the US and Poland over the proposed but now shelved effort to supply Ukraine with Polish-owned Soviet-era jets, there are concerns over the kinds of anti-air support that would generate a Russian response against Nato, the logistics of getting weapons into Ukrainian hands and how to replace the weapons that are transferred. The US is currently engaged in discussions with Nato members Slovakia and Turkey to move their anti-air systems over to Ukraine, but it will take a more deft touch than was displayed with Poland to accomplish it. If Mr Biden can pull this off while he's in Europe, it would be a notable success. What weapons will US give Ukraine? Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine The US and its allies promised that they would impose unprecedented, debilitating economic sanctions on Russia if it were to invade Ukraine. After some early fits and starts, that's exactly what the allies have done. The Russian economy, its stock market and its currency have been staggered by the allied punishments, which include trade restrictions, financial isolation, limits on energy exports and targeted sanctions on Russian political and business leaders. Severe as the restrictions may be, however, they have not deterred Russia from continuing its all-out assault. While western allies insist that the pain of the current sanctions will increase as time goes by, there is growing pressure on US and European leaders to find new ways of punishing Russian aggression that they can announce during Mr Biden's meetings this week. Some proposals include new sanctions on oligarchs and politicians, greater restrictions on Russian energy exports and the kinds of technology that is imported to Russia. None of these seem likely to produce a dramatic new impact on the Russian economy, but sometimes the perception of continued action is as important as the actions themselves. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The hunt for superyachts of sanctioned Russians Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin had a warm meeting in Beijing during February's Winter Olympics, where they described a friendship between their nations that had ""no limits"". If that translates into ongoing Chinese economic and military support for Russia in the months ahead, it could undermine everything the US and its European allies are trying to do in Ukraine. Last week, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met his Chinese counterpart in Rome, followed by a nearly two-hour phone call between Mr Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The US can't act alone here, however. Both America and Europe will need to make concerted, co-ordinated efforts to convince China to keep its distance from Russia and, if possible, be more vocal in its denunciations of Russia's infringement on Ukrainian territorial sovereignty. China's recent backing of Russian participation in the upcoming G20 economic summit suggests the task will not be easy. Like the US, Europe is a key market for Chinese goods - and the threat of US and European sanctions on China if it were to openly aid Russia is already weighing on the Chinese economy. Mr Biden has frequently spoken of how the world is in an era-defining conflict between democracies and autocracies - but pushing China and Russia into the same adversarial camp at the moment is a risky move.

"The Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his ""profound sorrow"" over slavery during a speech at a dinner in Jamaica. Prince William said slavery was abhorrent, ""should never have happened"" and ""forever stains our history"". Earlier, the island's prime minister, Andrew Holness, told the future king his country planned to pursue its goals as an independent country. On the fifth day of their Caribbean tour the duke and duchess also visited a hospital and school. Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Governor General of Jamaica, Prince William praised the spirit of the island that ""makes it so special"" as well as addressing the UK's role in slavery. ""While the pain runs deep, Jamaica continues to forge its future with determination, courage and fortitude,"" he said. The prince added the Queen had a deep affection for the country and said he had been touched to hear from Jamaicans about their affection for his grandmother in her Platinum Jubilee year. ""Sorrow"" is not ""sorry"". Some will be disappointed about that. But ""sorry"" would have been a different order of magnitude, carrying with it acceptance of responsibility and opening up the question of financial compensation. Hardly surprising then that Prince William didn't go that far. That would be a job for government, not royalty. When I spoke to Jamaicans earlier in the evening in Emancipation Park in Kingston there was a lot of thought about slavery, but little in the way of anger. There was talk of pain, but also an acknowledgment that this generation of Jamaicans is a long way from the generations exploited by plantation owners during colonial rule. It was those who suffered then that deserved an apology, one young woman said. This has been a particularly political part of the Caribbean tour. With his speech, William tried to deal with some of the issues about Britain's past in Jamaica. But the prime minister has raised a big question about the future of the Royal Family in a truly independent Jamaica. There have been calls in Jamaica to drop the Queen as head of state and the royal visit has seen demonstrations urging the monarchy to pay reparations for the slave trade. Mr Holness, who campaigned on a platform of making Jamaica a republic, told the duke there were ""unresolved"" issues but said that the royals' presence gave an opportunity for those to be addressed. He said Jamaica was ""moving on"" and added: ""We intend to attain in short order our development goals and fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country."" Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness (left) earlier told the Duke of Cambridge there were ""unresolved"" issues The royal couple visited a hospital in Spanish City during their tour The Duchess of Cambridge spoke with pupils at Shortwood Teachers' College in Kingston Last year,Barbados officially removed the Queen as its head of statein a ceremony attended by the Prince of Wales. In a speech to mark the occasion Prince Charles acknowledged the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"", something his son referenced during his own address in Jamaica. Raheem Sterling joins William for Jamaica game William and Kate dance and try chocolate in Belize Earlier on Wednesday, the duke was joined by his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for a visit to Spanish Town Hospital and Shortwood Teachers' College where they met staff and students. At the hospital the duke revealed both he and his wife had received three Covid vaccines and described staff as ""total heroes"" as he asked them to look after their mental health. They also visited the Caribbean Military Technical Training Institute, near Montego Bay, where the duchess forced her husband off the road as he tested his skills in a driving simulator. In his speech the duke said the couple wished they had more time to spend in Jamaica and said they hoped to come back with their children.

"High street retail giant Next has warned it will need to increase prices even further later this year. The retailer said prices for homeware items will jump 13% and fashion prices rise 6.5% in the second half of 2022 to average an 8% increase overall. Clothingprices are already rising, with inflation data showing overall clothing and footwear prices rose 8.8% in the year to February 2022. The retailer said it still expects to make a Â£850m profit this year. Across the UK economy companies have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers, leading to surging prices for everything fromtinned tomatoesandMarmite, to used cars and home insurance. Next had already warned of incoming price rises in January, but it has now increased its estimate of price increases in the second half of the year from 6% to 8%. It still predicts sales to grow overall - despite the price rises - but not by as much as first thought, which it said was due to the closing of its Ukrainian and Russian websites. Next's chief executive, Lord Simon Wolfson, told the PA news agency that, given the worsening cost of living crisis, trading could be ""subdued"" for the rest of the year. ""Over the past 20 years, we've seen that what really matters is what's in people's bank accounts rather than costs,"" he said. ""In January, when we laid down our outlook, people suggested it could be pessimistic but we thought confidence could be subdued."" The company also flagged that demand could be dented as people spend their disposable incomes elsewhere, with a return to spending on holidays abroad and other social activities. However, for now, Next said the first three months of the year had seen UK sales ""ahead of where we expected them to be"" as people headed back to its stores after lockdown and purchased more formal fashion and fewer things for their homes. Next also reported pre-tax profits of Â£823m for the year to 31 January, more than double the amount of the previous year and 10% above pre-pandemic levels.

"Northern Ireland's abortion laws changed in 2020 but full services have yet to be commissioned Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has said he will intervene further on abortion services for Northern Ireland after the assembly election in May. Northern Ireland's abortion laws changed in 2020 after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution. But the commissioning of services had been stalled due to political disagreement. Mr Lewis said the collapse of the executive had created a ""further obstacle"" to progress the legislation. Last July, the secretary of statedirected Stormont ministers and departments to act by March 2022. He took powers that issued a formal direction to Stormont's Department of Health to draw up proposals and take them to the executive for approval. In February, the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister which prompted the collapse of the executive. Brandon Lewis says he has no choice but to act over abortion services On Thursday, Mr Lewis said it was ""increasingly clear"" the Department of Health was going to miss the deadline he had set. He also said the collapse of the executive left him with ""no choice"" but to take forward the issue himself. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland New abortion laws come into force in NI In a written statement, he said: ""Two years after the Abortion (Northern Ireland) 2020 Regulations established the framework for abortion services, women and girls are still unable to access high-quality abortion and post-abortion care in Northern Ireland. ""This is unacceptable. Without access to services in Northern Ireland, women and girls are being placed at an increased risk of harm."" He added he was committed to making regulations and directions, ""directly following"" the election to place a duty on the Department of Health to make abortion services available ""as soon as is reasonably practicable"". He said he would also take action that would ""remove the need"" for executive approval for legislation on abortion before services can be commissioned and funded. ""This means that the Department of Health will have no further barriers to commission and fund services,"" he added. The secretary of state is also immediately setting up a small team in the Northern Ireland Office ""with relevant experience in reproductive healthcare and financial monitoring"" to provide expert advice and to work alongside the Department of Health. He warned: ""If I assess the Department of Health is not complying with the duty I place on it, I am prepared to use my powers to intervene."" The delay around commissioning of abortion services has been the subject of several legal challenges in recent months.

"The tram toppled over after hitting a curve at 73km/h (45mph) The driver of the Croydon tram that crashed killing seven people is being prosecuted by the railway watchdog. Transport for London (TfL) and the operator, Tram Operations Limited (TOL), are also facing action for breaches of health and safety law, the Office for Road and Rail (ORR) says. Alfred Dorris was driving the tram when it overturned in November 2016. The crash was ruled accidental by an inquest jury and TfL paid compensation to victims' families. The tram was travelling more than three times faster than a speed limit when it tipped over and spun off the tracks near Sandilands tram stop in south London. Mark Smith, Dane Chinnery, Phil Seary and Dorota Rynkiewicz (l-r) all died in the crash The crash resulted in the deaths of Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Logan, 52, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington, and Mark Smith, 35, and Donald Collett, 62, from Croydon. Sixty-one people were injured in the crash in darkness and heavy rain on 9 November 2016, 19 of them seriously. Mr Dorris, then aged 42, is accused of ""an alleged failure as an employee to take reasonable care of passengers whilst employed at work driving the tram"", the ORR said. If found guilty, he could face a penalty of up to two years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. TfL and ToL could also face an unlimited financial penalty. Transport for London admitted liability for the crash Simon French, chief inspector of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, previously said Mr Dorrismay have slipped into a period of ""microsleep""before the derailment. During police interviews, Mr Dorris said he was ""confused"" but when asked if he had fallen asleep, he replied: ""No, no, no."" Croydon tram crash passengers killed accidentally Unanswered questions for Croydon tram crash families Croydon tram crash: Who were the victims? The driver was arrested at the scene but in October 2019 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he would not be charged with manslaughter due to a lack of evidence. The CPS also said corporate manslaughter charges would not be brought against TfL or TOL. Ben Posford, partner at London law firm Osbornes Law, who represented five of the seven families at the inquest, described this as ""welcome news"" for the families ""who have been fighting for years for justice"". Marilyn Logan, 67, whose husband Philip Logan died in the crash, said she had been given ""some kind of closure"" from the news that prosecutions would be launched, according to her granddaughter Danielle Wynne. Ms Wynne said: ""It has been a horrible five years of feeling so let down, I feel like our families have been forgotten along the way. This video can not be played Danielle Wynne spoke to the BBC after last July's inquest verdict ""I will be in that courtroom, I will be there however long it takes every step of the way, it's for them, it's justice for our loved ones and I don't want their lives to have been lost for nothing, because that's what it feels like at the moment."" Jean Smith, whose son Mark, 35, died in the crash told the BBC: ""It has been a long time coming but it's a step in the right direction. ""I'm happy that there will be accountability where it rightly belongs."" By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent For the families who lost loved ones this prosecution will be very welcome. One family this morning told me they were ""elated"" there might be accountability over what happened because after a safety investigation and an inquest, they felt too many questions had not been answered. Why had previous incidents of speeding not been reported? Why did it take so long to investigate a similar incident on the same corner just 10 days before? That was only looked into after the Sandilands crash and it took so long the CCTV from the tram had automatically been wiped. Why did drivers feel they could not report incidents? And were fatigue management systems in place and adequate - considering most tram drivers in a survey said they were not? The inquest heard that over five years, five drivers had been disciplined or sacked for falling asleep but it kept happening. It seems now those questions will have to be answered in court. Many of the families had lost faith in the system. It has taken six years to get here. A spokesperson for TOL said it would ""co-operate fully with the legal process"", adding: ""Our thoughts remain with all those affected by the tragic incident at Sandilands in 2016. ""Our commitment to safety remains unwavering and is integral to everything we do."" TfL said it would ""consider those proceedings once we receive them"" and ""safety will always be our highest priority"". A spokesperson for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he would ""continue to work with TfL to introduce further measures to help ensure such an awful incident never happens again"". ORR's Chief Inspector of Railways Ian Prosser CBE said: ""We've made a fair, independent and objective assessment about what happened, and it is now for the court to consider if any health and safety law has been breached.""

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia In January and February 2025, Nato forces will take part in a military  exercise calledSteadfast Dart 25,externalin Bulgaria and Romania, led by a UK army division.

In 2023, Nato's commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks anywhere in the Arctic, the North Atlantic, Eastern Europe or the Mediterranean Sea region.

"Shopping at a supermarket in Moscow The cost of living in Russia is surging following the country's invasion of Ukraine, according to new data. Official figures show price of some household staples - such as sugar - have jumped by as much as 14% over the past week. Inflation is set to keep rising in Russia where the rouble has fallen sharply since the Ukraine war began. The value of the currency has dropped about 22% this year, and this has pushed up the cost of importing goods. The inflation data came as the Russian stock market resumed trading on Thursday after a month-long hiatus, with the majority of shares rising in a volatile trading session. The benchmark Moex index closed 4.4% higher after surging over 10% in Moscow. Analysts said a government plan to buy billions of dollars worth of Russian shares was supporting the market, which dived last month after Russia invaded its neighbour. Bans on trade with foreigners and on short-selling remain in place. On Wednesday, Russia's economic ministry said annual inflation had jumped 14.5% in the week ending 18 March - the highest rate since late 2015. The Federal State Statistics Service said the cost of sugar rose by as much as 37.1% in certain regions of the country and increased by an average 14%. Sugar, which is commonly used to preserve food or make liquor, was the biggest gainer in the week,the government agency found,external. Prices of sugar have jumped 14% in Russia The price of onions was the second biggest riser over the week, up 13.7% nationwide and 40.4% in some areas. Meanwhile, nappies were 4.4% more expensive.Prices for black tea rose 4% and toilet paper increased by 3%. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said prices were higher because of the weaker rouble. ""The biggest culprit is imported inflation,"" Mr Innes told the BBC. ""Anything Russia imports is exponentially (pricier) due to the weaker rouble."" The UK, the US and the European Union have cut off a number Russian banks from financial markets in the West. They have also prohibited dealings with Russia's central bank, state-owned investment funds and the finance ministry. The Bank of Russiamore than doubled its interest rate to 20%in March, in an attempt to stop its currency from sliding further. A large number of Western businesses have pulled out of Russia because of the war in Ukraine. Others, such as the Swiss food giant Nestle, have withdrawn major brands such as KitKat and Nesquik. Videos on social media show shoppers scrambling to buy sugar and buckwheat at supermarkets in Moscow. Deputy prime minister Viktoria Abramchenko has told Russians the country is ""fully self-sufficient when it comes to sugar and buckwheat"". ""There is no need to panic buy these goods. There is enough for everybody,"" she said. But some Russians told the BBC that they were feeling the squeeze. Ksenia Mironiuk said the price of many basic goods had ""gone up dramatically"" in St Petersburg. ""It's already quite noticeable when you go shopping,"" she said. ""Lots of people are buying them in bulk fearing they will disappear altogether."" Merkutsio Anzhello, who lives in the southern city of Krasnodar, said staples now cost 10 to 20% more. But he said he is not too concerned: ""In general, neither I nor my relatives are not concerned about it. Prices in Russia grow sometimes and we are accustomed to this."" Russia has hit back at international sanctions, and threatened to seize the assets of businesses that have stopped operating in the country. It sanctioned US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officialslast week. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the country would start selling natural gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles. It is understood the move is aimed at supporting the currency. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. However, many existing contracts are agreed upon in euros and it is unclear if Russia can change them. Mr Putin's announcement drove the rouble to a three-week high. It later closed at 97.7 against the dollar.

"An aerial view of Jeffrey Epstein's island Little St. James Private Caribbean islands owned by the deceased sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein are up for sale and could fetch up to $125m (Â£94.7m). A lawyer for Epstein's estate confirmed to the BBC thatthe two islands - Little St James and Great St James - have been listed.,external Lawyer Daniel Weiner said some proceeds from the sale will be used to settle outstanding lawsuits. Epstein died in jail in 2019, awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The financier bought the 90-acre Little St James - the more developed of the two - nearly 25 years ago for almost $8m (Â£6m). He then acquired the larger Great St James in 2016 for $22.5m and had drawn up plans to develop the 161-acre island by building homes, an amphitheatre, as well as an underwater office and pool. Bespoke Real Estate, which is jointly overseeing the sale, told the BBC both islands are being offered for a total $125m. Epstein was accused by US Virgin Islands attorney general Denise George of sexually abusing girls as young as 12 years old on Little St James. The lawsuit, filed two years ago, also claimed that one 15-year-old girl attempted to escape the island by swimming away before being captured and having her passport confiscated. A boarded-up property on Little St James Mr Weiner, a partner at New York law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed, said the sale is taking place with the support of Ms George and that the proceeds ""will be used by the estate for the resolution of outstanding lawsuits and the regular costs of the estate's operations"". Epstein reportedly welcomed a number of high profile guests to Little St James over the years. One of Epstein's alleged victims, Virginia Giuffre, claimed in a civil suit that Prince Andrew had abused her on the island. Prince Andrew denied the claims and said he had no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre. The prince recently paid a settlement to Ms Giuffre to end a civil case in the US. The settlement accepted no liability and Prince Andrew has always strongly rejected claims of wrongdoing. Jeffrey Epstein faced sex trafficking charges before dying in jail in 2019 Other visitors to Little St James included Jes Staley, the former boss of Barclays. He resigned from the UK bank last year following an investigation by financial regulators overhow the banker had characterised his relationship with Epstein. Mr Staley dropped by Epstein's island in 2015 a few months before he took on the chief executive role at Barclays. UK financial regulators began an investigation after JP Morgan - Mr Staley's former employer - handed over 1,200 emails sent between the banker and Epstein mostly 2008 and 2012. Regulators were concerned that the emails showed a closer relationship between the two men than Mr Staley had described to Barclays board. Mr Staley is contesting the regulators' finding.

"Trust me, I'm a tax cutter. Rishi Sunak cares so much about tax, the chancellor even had his own ten-page glossy pamphlet that came with the Spring Statement document. It was tucked under his arm as he emerged from No 11 Downing Street to pose for the cameras before going to the Commons. There was a practical imperative for him to make some move to help with the cost of living, after demands from all parts of the political spectrum. And it seems, a self-imposed political imperative to show that despite presiding over enormous rises in tax and borrowing, that he really is a tax cutter at heart. Sunak vows to cut income tax before next election Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter? How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Two eye-catching cuts were therefore flourished at the dispatch box. The level at which workers start paying National Insurance gets a chunky increase. From July, it will kick in at the same level of income tax. In effect, that's a tax cut for millions of workers. But remember, not that long ago, that Rishi Sunak himself had resolved to put that tax up. So what will be trumpeted as a tax cut by the Tories whenever they get the chance is also a partial reversal of a rise that they themselves decided to do. No surprise then it's been branded the ""hokey cokey"" by Labour: not quite in then out - but up, then partly down. Fuel duty on petrol and diesel will be cut by 5p, in a bid to help motorists with prices at the pumps Second, the chancellor confirmed what many had long suspected: that he would hold back some financial fire power now, to dangle tax cuts to the voting public in the run-up to the election. This strategy is not exactly a surprise. But what's deeply unusual is that Mr Sunak chose to announce this giveaway, a penny off income tax, two years before it would kick in. It's certainly unusual to announce election goodies this far out, not just because it kills any element of political surprise, but also it ties the chancellor's hands in the years ahead. While the moves seem to designed to polish up Mr Sunak's credentials as a tax cutter, the black and white of the statement documents beg to differ. As chancellor, he has increased taxes massively more than he has just reduced them. As the official number crunchers at the OBR put it: ""The chancellor has undone just over a quarter of the overall value of the personal tax rises he announced last year, and around a sixth of the overall net tax rises he has announced since becoming chancellor."" In other words, he's giving a pound back for every six that he's already taken. That's why one right-of-centre think tank, Bright Blue, has branded him the confused chancellor this afternoon. Another, the free-market Adam Smith Institute, warns the chancellor giveth, and the chancellor taketh away. With such strong warnings about the drop in living standards that looms, political signalling on tax may be swamped by a much tougher reality. With the chancellor's chosen big focus on tax, there was less significant attention on immediate help for firms and families who will struggle the most with bills. There was no mention of increases on benefits, extra cash for public services that might be hit by inflation, and only one mention of the government mantra of ""levelling up"". It was always the case that the Treasury favoured a ""wait and see"" approach when it comes to extra help to people as energy and prices spiral. The inflation spike came before the invasion of Ukraine, but accelerates the trend and makes the next few months so much more uncertain. Just because No 10 didn't press the button on more support today doesn't mean it's not likely in October. The Conservative benches, and many members of the public too, may be heartened after two years of mammoth public spending to hear the party's money man talk about giving cash back. Cutting tax at the pump matters. Raising the NI threshold makes a difference. But at a time of potential peril, Rishi Sunak may have left himself vulnerable to the charge that he hasn't yet understood the scale of the squeeze so many families and firms really face. He wants to focus on tax cuts, but many voters may very soon be more preoccupied with the unavoidable cut in the standard of how they can afford to live. Is Rishi Sunak a tax-cutter?

"The tram toppled over after hitting a curve at 73km/h (45mph) The driver of the Croydon tram that crashed killing seven people is being prosecuted by the railway watchdog. Transport for London (TfL) and the operator, Tram Operations Limited (TOL), are also facing action for breaches of health and safety law, the Office for Road and Rail (ORR) says. Alfred Dorris was driving the tram when it overturned in November 2016. The crash was ruled accidental by an inquest jury and TfL paid compensation to victims' families. The tram was travelling more than three times faster than a speed limit when it tipped over and spun off the tracks near Sandilands tram stop in south London. Mark Smith, Dane Chinnery, Phil Seary and Dorota Rynkiewicz (l-r) all died in the crash The crash resulted in the deaths of Dane Chinnery, 19, Philip Logan, 52, Philip Seary, 57, Dorota Rynkiewicz, 35, and Robert Huxley, 63, all from New Addington, and Mark Smith, 35, and Donald Collett, 62, from Croydon. Sixty-one people were injured in the crash in darkness and heavy rain on 9 November 2016, 19 of them seriously. Mr Dorris, then aged 42, is accused of ""an alleged failure as an employee to take reasonable care of passengers whilst employed at work driving the tram"", the ORR said. If found guilty, he could face a penalty of up to two years imprisonment and an unlimited fine. TfL and ToL could also face an unlimited financial penalty. Transport for London admitted liability for the crash Simon French, chief inspector of the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, previously said Mr Dorrismay have slipped into a period of ""microsleep""before the derailment. During police interviews, Mr Dorris said he was ""confused"" but when asked if he had fallen asleep, he replied: ""No, no, no."" Croydon tram crash passengers killed accidentally Unanswered questions for Croydon tram crash families Croydon tram crash: Who were the victims? The driver was arrested at the scene but in October 2019 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he would not be charged with manslaughter due to a lack of evidence. The CPS also said corporate manslaughter charges would not be brought against TfL or TOL. Ben Posford, partner at London law firm Osbornes Law, who represented five of the seven families at the inquest, described this as ""welcome news"" for the families ""who have been fighting for years for justice"". Marilyn Logan, 67, whose husband Philip Logan died in the crash, said she had been given ""some kind of closure"" from the news that prosecutions would be launched, according to her granddaughter Danielle Wynne. Ms Wynne said: ""It has been a horrible five years of feeling so let down, I feel like our families have been forgotten along the way. This video can not be played Danielle Wynne spoke to the BBC after last July's inquest verdict ""I will be in that courtroom, I will be there however long it takes every step of the way, it's for them, it's justice for our loved ones and I don't want their lives to have been lost for nothing, because that's what it feels like at the moment."" Jean Smith, whose son Mark, 35, died in the crash told the BBC: ""It has been a long time coming but it's a step in the right direction. ""I'm happy that there will be accountability where it rightly belongs."" By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent For the families who lost loved ones this prosecution will be very welcome. One family this morning told me they were ""elated"" there might be accountability over what happened because after a safety investigation and an inquest, they felt too many questions had not been answered. Why had previous incidents of speeding not been reported? Why did it take so long to investigate a similar incident on the same corner just 10 days before? That was only looked into after the Sandilands crash and it took so long the CCTV from the tram had automatically been wiped. Why did drivers feel they could not report incidents? And were fatigue management systems in place and adequate - considering most tram drivers in a survey said they were not? The inquest heard that over five years, five drivers had been disciplined or sacked for falling asleep but it kept happening. It seems now those questions will have to be answered in court. Many of the families had lost faith in the system. It has taken six years to get here. A spokesperson for TOL said it would ""co-operate fully with the legal process"", adding: ""Our thoughts remain with all those affected by the tragic incident at Sandilands in 2016. ""Our commitment to safety remains unwavering and is integral to everything we do."" TfL said it would ""consider those proceedings once we receive them"" and ""safety will always be our highest priority"". A spokesperson for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he would ""continue to work with TfL to introduce further measures to help ensure such an awful incident never happens again"". ORR's Chief Inspector of Railways Ian Prosser CBE said: ""We've made a fair, independent and objective assessment about what happened, and it is now for the court to consider if any health and safety law has been breached.""

"Fortnite's virtual store has adopted Ukrainian colours Epic Games says it has raised more than $50m (Â£37m) to aid humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.

""We're not waiting for the actual funds to come in from our platform and payment partners, which can take a while depending on how the transaction was processed.

Epic's fundraising joins other efforts by games companies and their fans to raise money for the victims of the war in Ukraine. How 'charity speedrunning' made gaming the new telethon Afghanistan War veteran who lost both legs says gaming saved his life Mother turned into 'ghost' gamer for homeless charity Humble Bundle, for example, sells collections of video games online, with proceeds usually benefitting both the developers and charities. But in its latest offering, Humble has raised more than Â£10m exclusively for charities benefitting Ukraine. It is providing a bundle of 120 games and items usually valued at more than Â£1,800 that it now offers for a minimum donation of only Â£30.52. Kamini Tiwari, vice-president of social impact at Humble, praised the players who have put up their money to get the games. ""We're very, very happy that our community is leaning in to support us,"" she said. ""I think they also, like us, recognise that need is so great. ""We are constantly humbled - pardon the pun - by our community. Throughout the year, and particularly during times of crisis and disaster, it's been great to see that across the gaming industry so many others are leaning in as well."" Chucklefish Games, makers of WarGroove and Starbound, is one of the independent developers based in London that has offered up its games to the bundle. Alexis Trust, communications manager at the studio, said she felt it was their ""duty to help those in need"". She said the firm's partners, Lithuania-based Hidden Layer Games, which made the game Inmost, is ""a two-man team from Ukraine and Russia"". ""Throughout the project the team experienced first-hand the difficulty of working between borders during a time of political tension, and so made the difficult decision to move together to Lithuania where their dream project could actually become a reality. ""When the Russian military invaded Ukraine, we felt that it was our duty to extend that help to other families in whatever capacity we could."" Chucklefish released indie hit Wargroove in 2019 But Humble isn't the only bundle right now aiming to help those in Ukraine. There is also the now-completed itch.io bundle, which raised Â£4.7m by offering up 1,000 games in exchange for a minimum donation of Â£7.56. Brandon Sheffield, creative director of Necrosoft Games, organised the bundle. He told the BBC he thinks the cause ""really resonated with people"". And, he said, it was surprisingly easy to persuade developers of indie hits like Celeste and Superhot to help. ""Believe it or not, it didn't take very much convincing at all,"" he said. ""Everyone was pretty much ready to help. The publisher Raw Fury joined the itch.io platform just so that they could put four of their games into this."" The charities which benefitted from the itch.io bundle were International Medical Corps, as well as the Voices of Children Foundation - a Ukrainian charity which provides support to children affected by trauma caused by war. ""I feel like that's incredibly important for the future of Ukraine,"" Mr Sheffield said. ""I chose this local organisation that's already there. ""Because they're there, they've been like impromptu shelters, going around and using the money that they've been donated to try to protect the people in Kyiv and other places where they can actually access them."" And Andy Pearson, chief marketing officer of British publisher PQube Games, that has donated games for the bundle, compared what was happening in the games industry to some of the big musical fundraising events of the past. ""It's phenomenal. It exceeded the initial expectations and then continued to go on from there. ""It was amazing. I am thinking now - has this been done before? And it has - it's like Live Aid - those big, big events where you had lots of creators all coming together in one versus a single person trying to contribute. That's what's really helped establish this.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces that income tax will be cut by 2024 Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures aimed at combating soaring energy, food and fuel prices, in his Spring Statement. He cut fuel duty by 5p but resisted calls to scrap April's National Insurance rise of 1.25p in the pound. He warned the UK's post-pandemic recovery had been blown off course by the war in Ukraine. But he held out the promise of an income tax cut in 2024 when he said the economy would be in better shape. Labour said he had made an ""historic mistake"" by pushing ahead with next month's National Insurance increase, which the party warned would hit workers hard. But the chancellor said the money raised was needed for the NHS - and instead he said he would raise the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Squeeze on households overwhelms tax reversal More than a million face poverty, think tank warns This would amount to ""a Â£6bn personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom, a tax cut for employees worth over Â£330 a year,"" said the chancellor. Mr Sunak warned the economic outlook was uncertain and the full impact of the war in Ukraine was not yet clear. The Office for Budget Responsibility painted a bleak picture of the UK's immediate economic prospects, saying that living standards are set to take the biggest hit since records began in the 1950s. It said inflation was set to peak at 8.7% at the end of this year and this - combined with rising taxes - will ""weigh heavily on living standards in the coming 12 months"". The watchdog said the UK's tax burden will be at the highest level since the 1940s. Other measures in the chancellor's mini-Budget include: VAT on solar panels, heat pumps, roof insulation and other energy saving measures will be reduced from 5% to zero for five years The employment allowance will increase from Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, allowing small businesses to reduce their National Insurance payments Green technology will be exempt from business rates from April, saving firms Â£35m in 2022-23 Councils get another Â£500m for the Household Support Fund from April, designed to help vulnerable households with rising living costs Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had failed to appreciate the scale of the cost of living crisis facing workers and pensioners. This video can not be played WATCH: Labour's Rachel Reeves responds to Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement She told MPs: ""In eight days, people's energy bills will be rising by 54%, two weeks today the chancellor's tax hike will start hitting working people and their employers. ""His National Insurance tax rise was a bad idea last September and he's admitted it's an even worse one today."" She repeated Labour's call for a windfall tax on energy companies. Later, the chancellor answered questions on a phone-in on LBC radio. One woman said that despite a good salary ""on paper"", she was leaving her heating and lights off - and her family were wearing coats at home, to try to save on energy bills. She also said she was taking on extra cleaning and delivery jobs, and had cut her grocery shop down to Â£15 a week for her and her two children - and she often went without. ""Please tell me what else I can be doing,"" she asked. Mr Sunak paid tribute to her for working her ""socks off"" - and pointed to the energy bill rebate and higher national insurance threshold that will give a tax cut in July. UK faces biggest drop in living standards on record Fuel duty cut by 5p a litre to help motorists What's deeply unusual is that Mr Sunak chose to announce this giveaway, a penny off income tax, two years before it would kick in. It's certainly unusual to announce election goodies this far out, not just because it kills any element of political surprise, but also it ties the Chancellor's hands in the years ahead.

Read Laura's full blog The SNP criticised Mr Sunak over his decision not to reverse the removal of the Â£20-a-week top-up to Universal Credit payments, or to increase other benefits, ""at a time when people need it the most"". Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said ""the very poorest"" could see their cost of living increase by 10%, despite a ""small amount of extra cash"" promised by the chancellor for local authorities to help those on benefits. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Spring Statement was a ""total swindle"" by Mr Sunak, who he said was ""giving with one hand and taking with another"". And the Green Party criticised him for not mentioning climate issues. Its co-leader Adrian Ramsay accused Mr Sunak of ""[looking] after the interests of fossil fuel companies"". Mr Sunak promised the government would ""stand by"" families struggling with the cost of living. And in a surprise announcement at the end of his statement, he said his ambition was to cut the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound. ""It would clearly be irresponsible to meet this ambition this year,"" he told MPs, but official forecasts said inflation would be ""back under control"" and national debt falling by 2024, making a cut possible then, he added. ""I can confirm, before the end of this Parliament, in 2024, for the first time in 16 years, the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20p to 19p in the pound. ""A tax cut for workers, for pensioners, for savers. A Â£5bn tax cut for 30 million people. It is fully costed and fully paid for in the plan announced today.""

"Rishi Sunak has been accused of not doing enough to help the poorest as the cost of food and energy increases at its fastest rate for 30 years. The Resolution Foundation and Institute for Fiscal Studies think tanks said he could have done more to protect those hit hardest by rising costs. Planned increases in benefits will be much smaller than the rise in the cost of living this year. Mr Sunak said tax cuts this year would help those on low wages the most. He said his plans to raise the point at which workers start paying National Insurance would particularly help people on low and middle incomes. And he said it was impossible for him to ""fully compensate"" people for spiralling energy costs, a challenge the UK was ""not alone"" in facing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also hinted more help for people struggling was on its way in the coming months. ""The cost of living is the single biggest thing we're having to fix, and we will fix it,"" the prime minister told LBC Radio, adding: ""As we go forward, we need to do more"". Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you People face biggest living standards drop since 1956 This video can not be played Watch: Sunak defends measures set out in Spring Statement Mr Sunak sought to address the rising cost of living in his Spring Statement on Wednesday, cutting 5p from fuel duty and taking some of the sting out of April's National Insurance (NI) rise by raising the point at which workers have to start paying it from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570 from July. But he has faced calls from opposition MPs to do more to help people now, as inflation is predicted to hit more than 8% by end of the year and UK living standards are predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility to fall faster than at any time since the 1950s. His tweaks to National Insurance fell short of the demands from Labour and some Tory MPs, who had called on him to scrap April's rise completely. One of the Conservatives who had called on him to scrap the increase, Richard Drax, said the chancellor's approach was ""tinkering around the edge"" and he had not gone far enough to ease the tax burden. Another Conservative backbencher, Peter Aldous, said the chancellor's tweaks would ""offset"" the effect of the NI rise - but added the below-inflation increase to benefits meant claimants would still see a ""significant fall"" in spending power. Privately, there is angst among some Conservatives, including ministers, that the changes announced by Rishi Sunak amounted to ""fiddling,"" as one put it. Another was scathing about what they perceived to be the political calculation made by a chancellor desperate to be seen as a tax-cutter at a time when taxing and government spending is higher than it's been for decades. One described Mr Sunak's promise to cut income tax - but possibly not for two years - as ""ridiculous,"" seeing it as a gesture to burnish his credentials and image as a future prime minister rather than sensible policy making. A photo opportunity where Mr Sunak filled up someone else's car with petrol is also being privately mocked among some of his colleagues. But there's a deeper concern from many here: that at what one minister described as a ""genuinely difficult time for people,"" the capacity for any government to make a substantial difference is limited. And plenty fret this government has not yet grasped the true scale of the problems coming down the track. The Institute for Fiscal Studies' director Paul Johnson said that overall the measures set out by Mr Sunak - including council tax and energy bill rebates announced last year - amounted to a ""relatively modest giveaway"" of around Â£5bn. He acknowledged that the chancellor had been ""caught in a bind"", dealing with the effects of the pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukraine. But he said that the new policies would ""not be enough to protect poorer households from a significant hit to their living standards"". And, despite the chancellor's rhetoric about cutting taxes, they were set to rise their highest level as a share of national income since the 1940s, when Britain was emerging from World War Two. Another think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, criticised Mr Sunak's decision to go ahead with April's National Insurance rise, but said his tweaks to the starting point for paying the tax were a good way to ""soften the blow"". ""This has long been a good idea which help ensure that work pays, and leave money in the pockets of lower earners beyond the current crisis,"" it added, saying boosting growth in the long term was the only way out of the current economic issues.

But the chancellor said this needed to been seen in the context of the ""biggest economic shock in over 300 years"" due to Covid. Speaking to the BBC, he said borrowing had spiralled to its biggest level since World War Two as a result of spending to support the economy during pandemic. ""It's unsurprising that dealing with the aftermath of that is also pretty exceptional,"" he added. Powder is being kept dry, while the energy cap suppresses further rises in bills. The extent of any further support can be determined in the summer, when it will be clear if the new cap implies average bills of an incredible Â£200 per month or even a truly terrifying Â£300 per month. That in turn depends on the war in Ukraine and supplies of energy from Russia. Not even the Office for Budget Responsibility knows where this is going to land. But there is space for a support package of several billion, if required. Mr Sunak also used Wednesday's statement to promise to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20p to 19p in the pound by the next general election in 2024, when he said the UK economy would be in better shape than it is now.

Louise in Leicester told BBC 5 Live that her electricity bill ""has gone up Â£120 a month so that's money off something else"". ""I'm having to buy bulk more to make stuff last. You dare not put your electric onâ¦ you can't put that on for 300-odd quid a month."" Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had failed to understand the scale of the cost of living crisis. ""I think most people are looking at their pay packets now and looking at their taxes, and saying these promises in the future are not going to help me pay these bills this year,"" she said in an interview. ""I was incredibly surprised that the chancellor didn't do anything yesterday with rising gas and electricity bills, when the profits being made by North Sea oil and gas companies are at near-record highs.""

"The UK is facing its biggest drop in living standards on record as wages fail to keep pace with rising prices. Soaring energy prices could push inflation to a 40-year high of 8.7% in the final three months of 2022, the government forecaster said. Rising prices and tax hikes mean living standards will not recover to their pre-pandemic level until 2024-25, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. The chancellor said government would ""stand by"" people hit by higher prices. Living standards - disposable household incomes when adjusted for inflation - are expected to drop by 2.2% this year, the OBR said. That would be their largest fall in a financial year since records began in 1956. In the Spring Statement, Rishi Sunak said a 5p a litre fuel duty cut would take effect at 18:00 GMT, and he raised the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. But the OBR, which publishes its economic forecasts twice a year, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had ""major repercussions for the global economy, whose recovery from the worst of the pandemic was already being buffeted by Omicron, supply bottlenecks, and rising inflation"". The jump in oil and gas prices brought about by the conflict would ""weigh heavily on a UK economy that has only just recovered its pre-pandemic level"", it added. Petrol prices had already risen by 20% since the OBR's previous forecast, and household energy bills are set to increase by 54% in April. If wholesale energy prices remained as high as expected, then energy bills would rise by another 40% in October to take the bill for a typical household to Â£2,801 a year. The energy regulator Ofgem has already said bills will increase 54% to Â£1,971 for a typical household from April. With prices rising at such a rapid rate, wages would not keep up and and people would spend less, according to the OBR. As a result, it has dramatically slashed its growth forecast. In October prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine it expected the UK economy to grow 6% this year. Now it expects growth of just 3.8% this year. The chancellor promised to ""stand by"" families - but some of  those families may feel more like he's put his arms around them - only to pick their pockets. Much of their increased burden isn't the government's fault, reflecting global energy and food costs and supply issues. Come April the average household has to find nearly Â£1000 extra per year - just to afford the same stuff they did a year ago. And that's without counting the National Insurance increases, which are still going ahead. In total, the extra government help announced since October, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility will only compensate for a third of the prospective blow to living standards in the next 12 months. And it's not just household's fortunes that are at stake but the entire recovery - upon which the chancellor has pinned his hopes of rebuilding the public purse. The following year will also see slower growth than the OBR predicted five months ago. In 2023, the UK is expected to grow 1.8%, down from 2.1%. However, from 2024 growth is expected to accelerate faster than expected, rising 2.1% that year and 1.8% in 2025, up from 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. Stevie and Pauline Stevie Hall in Halifax says rising food, fuel and energy bills have nudged her into debt already. She told the BBC she had been batch cooking to save money and is only driving when there is a real need. ""We're just trying to get by, I'm trying to stay upbeat about it,"" she said. GDP allows businesses to judge when to expand and hire more people, and for government to work out how much to tax and spend. The OBR said the cut in living standards would have been worse without government support for households, including today's temporary 5p cut in fuel duty; the increase in the National Insurance contributions threshold; and a Â£9bn energy bill rebate scheme announced in February. ""Taking account of both energy and non-energy pressures on household incomes, the policy measures announced since October offset a third of the overall fall in living standards that would otherwise have occurred in the coming 12 months,"" it said in its report. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said: ""Perhaps what really stands out today is what was missing. ""In the face of what the OBR calls the biggest hit to household finances since comparable records began in 1956-57, [Mr Sunak] has done nothing more for those dependent on benefits, the very poorest, besides a small amount of extra cash for local authorities to dispense at their discretion. ""Their benefits will rise by just 3.1% for the coming financial year. Their cost of living could well rise by 10%.""

"President Biden is expected to discuss natural gas supplies, as the EU moves to reduce exposure to Russia US President Joe Biden joins fellow Western leaders in Brussels on Thursday for three summits on Russia's war in Ukraine, a month after the invasion began. Nato, the G7 and the EU are all holding meetings, in a display of unity rarely seen by the West. Mr Biden will take part in all three, the first ever visit by a US president to an EU summit in Brussels. But his visit to Brussels is not just about symbolism. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has given the Western defensive alliance Nato a renewed sense of purpose. And as the EU attempts to sever energy ties with Russia, it needs to forge and reinforce other relationships, particularly with the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to appear by video link at all three summits. Nato's 30 presidents and prime ministers will agree greater support for Ukraine and new troop deployments for Eastern allies. Their aim is to show solidarity to Kyiv, though only up to a point. Many, but not all, have been willing to supply weapons. The UK said it would use both the G7 and Nato meetings to ""substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine"". But the alliance has also made clear it won't become more directly involved and Mr Zelensky's repeated requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine have pretty much been ignored. Nor is it clear how Nato would respond if Russia were to dramatically escalate the conflict in Ukraine - such as an attack on a Western weapons convoy, the use of chemical, or even tactical nuclear weapons. Nato's red lines have so far been drawn at its borders. Why can't Ukraine join Nato? For the past few weeks, 30,000 Nato troops from 25 countries have been training in Norway as part of Exercise Cold Response, a long-planned exercise that has now taken on more significance. Soldiers from Sweden, which is not part of Nato, joined thousands of troops on exercise in Norway Like Ukraine, Norway borders Russia. The key difference is that, as a Nato member, Norway is covered by a commitment to ""collective defence"" - an attack on one is an attack on all. ""I think an exercise like this is pretty good to have, to prove to countries like Russiaâ¦ that you don't want to mess with Nato,"" a young Norwegian conscript called Peder told the BBC. Nato leaders are focused on how to boost their own defences. They've already sent thousands more troops to the alliance's eastern flank, along with more air defence batteries, warships and aircraft. Five challenges for Biden in Europe Nato to send more troops to Eastern Europe This, says Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, is the ""new normal"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia will get exactly what it didn't want - more, not less Nato near its border. Nato battlegroups will stretch all the way from the Baltic to the Black Sea for the foreseeable future. Two EU countries that are not members of Nato - Sweden and Finland - contributed troops to the exercise in Norway. They appear to be edging closer and closer to Nato in the wake of Russia's invasion. President Trump once questioned the very existence of Nato and French President Emmanuel Macron once called it ""brain dead"". But President Biden's visit to Brussels is proof that he sees it as being more important than ever to curb a more aggressive Russia. Defence strategy will also play a part in an EU summit where leaders will approve plans that aim to pull member states closer together on military planning, intelligence and procurement. One ambition is to have a rapidly deployable force of 5,000 troops. It's all part of the theme of ""strategic autonomy"" championed by Mr Macron. The argument is that a more sovereign Europe is a safer Europe, whether that's by securing reliable supplies of energy and semiconductor chips or by boosting military spending. But the trickiest subject for the European Union's 27 member states is fast becoming the future of energy supplies, as they try to look beyond Russia. After an initial, dizzying display of unity on sanctions across all 27 member states there are now obvious ruptures over what to do next. EU leaders have reacted fast to Russia's invasion with a series of hard-hitting sanctions German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly denounced the idea of banning Russian gas and oil imports, arguing it will drag Europe into a recession. ""Sanctions must not hit the European states harder than the Russian leadership. That is our principle,"" he said on the eve of the summit. Soaring energy prices are also a concern to be discussed by EU leaders on Friday. But there are nations agitating for action as they voice deep discomfort about handing cash to the Kremlin via energy payments. ""It's blood money,"" said one central European diplomat. ""I don't think some countries understand the gravity of the situation."" President Biden's ability to offer Europe more US Liquefied Natural Gas is a key watch at Thursday's summit. The US is the world's largest producer of natural gas. He is also expected to announce more sanctions on Russian political figures as well as so-called oligarchs. But the prospect of fresh EU sanctions this week is being played down. Some in Brussels call it ""fatigue"", while others insist it's the right time to take stock.

"""For God's sake this man cannot remain in power,"" US President Joe Biden says of Vladimir Putin during a speech in Warsaw The Kremlin responds: ""That's not for Biden to decide - the president of Russia is elected by Russians"" The White House says Biden meant Putin should not wield power over neighbours, rather than calling for regime change Powerful explosions have been heard in Lviv, which has been spared the worst of the fighting so far Thick black smoke has been seen rising over the outskirts of the city in the west of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine has inflicted ""powerful blows"" and ""significant losses"" on the Russians Edited by Thom Poole Thanks for joining us -we are continuing our live coverage on a new address. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded the West steps up military supplies, saying it wasn't just Ukraine at risk. ""What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities,"" he said. ""Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders."""" He said Ukraine needed just 1% of Nato's tanks and aircraft. ""We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days!""  A seven-year-old Ukrainian refugee from Lviv plays outside a temporary shelter in Poland Children in Ukraine face a dire situation and one in two have had to flee their homes, a Unicef spokesperson has told the BBC. The western Ukrainian city of Lvivhas come under heavy rocket fireand James Elder, who's from the UN children's charity Unicef, says the attacks add to the terror felt by people there. ""I'd been to a hospital where I see women go down, every time there's an air raid siren, carrying two day old babies or women 36 weeks pregnant who are frigid cold"", he says. ""Those women are hiding again tonight - terrified, petrified. And so many other people and children."" ""You can just see in the faces of families who have been through this in Kyiv, or Khakiv, and thought they were getting a moment's respite. Well the missiles tell a very different story tonight."" Earlier we reported that the city of Slavutych, where many of the Chernobyl power plant's workers live, has been taken by Russian forces. Now the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed its concern over the welfare of the plant's employees, as there has been no staff rotation at the plant for nearly a week. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, says there are concerns about the ability of staff to regularly rotate and return to their homes to rest. Earlier this month, Grossi stressed the ability of staff to carry out their tasks without undue pressure is one of ""the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety"". This is not the only nuclear plant held by the Russians. Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, is also in the hands of Russian troops. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" said US President Joe Biden of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during a speech in Warsaw earlier.

He was asked at the Doha Forum in Qatar if Russian oligarchs facing sanctions from western countries could do business in Turkey. ""Of course, if it is legal; if it is not against international law, I will consider it,"" he says. ""If it is against international law, that's another story."" Two superyachts belonging to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovichdocked in Turkey this week. Nato member Turkey, which has strong ties with both Russia and Ukraine, hasn't joined western sanctions targeting Moscow's oligarchs. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv First, mid-afternoon, the air raid sirens went off. Then,
three powerful explosions, and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the
distance. Hours later, another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its
invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russiaâs aggression,
where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling, turned this city
into something like a safe haven. Displaced people, humanitarian workers,
volunteers. They are all here. That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack, a
39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast, gives a passionate
testimony that may be shared by many. âWeâre feeling unprotected. Nobody really
cares about whatâs happening here,â she says. âWe need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely
destroyed. Itâs really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the
country too.â A nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been hit by Russian shelling, according to authorities cited in a Ukrainian news outlet. The Kyiv Independent said because of constant shelling in the area, in the north east of the country, authorities have been unable to assess the damage to the site. Russia has been repeatedly criticised for targeting nuclear power plants in Ukraine, such as the Zhaporizhia nuclear plant in the south east. Though risky, there has so far been no release of radioactive material from this site. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Russian air strikes on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv today were intended to send a message to US President Joe Biden, mayor Andriy Sadovyy says. He's been speaking at a joint briefing with the head of the Lviv military civil administration, Maksym Kozytskyy, broadcast on YouTube. ""I think that, with today's strikes, the aggressor is sending greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland now. Lviv is 70 km away from Poland,"" Sadovyy says. ""I think the whole world should realise that the threat is extremely serious."" Kozytskyy says the missiles hit two critical infrastructure facilities, one of which was an oil depot in a residential area in Lviv, and another was a military plant also located in a residential area. Each of them was targeted by two missile attacks, he says. No-one was killed, Kozytskyy adds, but five people sought medical help. The Kharkiv Music Festival, in Ukraine's second city, has gone ahead, despite relentless shelling by Russia since the start of the war. Organisers insisted the event must start as scheduled, so musicians have been performing deep underground, on the marble steps of a metro station which serves as a huge bomb shelter. A small crowd watched, some with their eyes closed, others holding children or pets, as a string quintet played classical music, as well as the national anthem. A cello player who performed at the festival, Denys Karachevtsev, said he wanted to deliver a message of hope to the people of Kharkiv: ""My message is that we have no fear, we are strong, and we can be helpful for our country, each person [in their own way]."" Violinist Tatiana Choukh said ""it was maybe the best concert of my life"". The mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv - former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko - has urged thousands of protesters in central London to stand with Ukraine. A huge crowd of people, including Ukrainians living in the UK, politicians and celebrities,marched through London in solidarity with Ukraine. Klitschko, speaking via video link from a military bunker, told the crowd on a big screen near Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square: ""We defend, right now, the same principles. ""Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine."" London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced more than Â£1.1m in funding to support migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK capital, and said he was ""full of admiration"" for people who have offered Ukrainian refugees somewhere to stay. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, told the crowd: ""I urge you to keep up the good work, the military and humanitarian aid. ""The sanctions must continue until the Russian economy has stopped in its tracks."" Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden met at a summit in Geneva in June of last year It is not for Joe Biden to decide if Vladimir Putin stays in power, the Kremlin says. As we reported earlier, the US president gave a speech with comments aimed directly at the Russian people, closing with: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" According to Reuters, a Kremlin spokesman responded: ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians."" A White House official says Biden was not calling for regime change, but making the point Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. Biden was delivering the speech earlier in Warsaw, where he has met Ukrainian government ministers and refugees who have crossed the border into Poland. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A building that was home to several families in Kharkiv has been destroyed Russia has destroyed about 4,500 residential buildings, 100 enterprises, 400 educational institutions and 150 medical establishments in Ukraine, a Ukrainian government minister says. The total damage across the country will be assessed after the end of hostilities and removal of mines, Minister for Community and Territorial Development Oleksiy Chernyshov says, as quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. According to preliminary assessments, the losses incurred by Ukraine have reached tens of billions of US dollars, with the sum increasing daily. With a view to reconstruction efforts, the government has simplified procedures for construction material imports.
   However, the minister adds, any reconstruction must be preceded by clearing mines and rubble. Ukraine hopes to involve domestic and foreign specialists in reconstruction efforts. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv The deputy mayor of thebesieged Ukrainian city of Mariupolsays people are starting to die from starvation and dehydration, as food and
water supplies run low and no humanitarian aid is allowed in. âSome are dying from dehydration and lack of food.
Some are dying from lack of medicine, insulin... Because people cannot find
medical help,â Sergey Orlov tells the BBC. âSome mothers do not have milk, and they don't have food
for children. What should they do with their infants? I donât know. Thereâs no
food for children at all in the city.â Mariupol has been under relentless Russian attacks since the
early days of the war, and pictures show a city in ruins, with entire
neighbourhoods destroyed. Orlov says 70% of hospitals in the city have been âdestroyed
by bombing and shellingâ. Communication with the city is difficult, as the phone
network is intermittent, so it is hard to independently verify information.
Residents spend most of their time in shelters or basements with no
electricity, running water, or gas. âPeople are just looking for any possibility to survive.
[They] share food, water, theyâre collecting wood to cook in the street,â Orlov
says. More than 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol. Efforts
to carry out large-scale evacuations have failed, although thousands have
managed to leave in recent days in private vehicles. Next, Joe Biden addresses the Russian people, saying he's worked with Russian leaders for decades, since the height of the Cold War. ""I've always spoken directly and honestly to you the Russian people,"" he says. ""Let me say this, if you're able to listen. You the Russian people are not our enemy. ""I refuse to believe you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents. ""Or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards for God's sake, being pummelled with Russian missiles and bombs. ""Or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee, supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission. ""Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine's children. ""These are not the actions of a great nation."" He closes his speech with a reference to Vladimir Putin - ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" ""My message to the people of Ukraine... we stand with you, period,"" President Biden says during his speech in Warsaw, a line greeted by cheers. ""Today's fighting in Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battles in a long struggle,"" he says. ""Hungary in 1956, Poland in 1956 and then again in 1981, Czechoslovakia in 1968 - Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings but the resistance continued until finally in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all the walls of Soviet domination, they fell and the people prevailed. ""The battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War. ""Over the last 30 years the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones. Contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself. ""Today, Russia has strangled democracy and has sought to do so elsewhere."" Biden says it is obscene that Vladimir Putin has lied by saying he is trying to de-Nazify Ukraine. US President Joe Biden says Ukraine and its people are ""fighting to save their nation"", as he  addresses crowds in Warsaw. We need to be clear-eyed - this battle will not be won in days, or months, either.

We've heard from residents there. Volodymyr Kachinsky, 24, was working at a restaurant near the area of the western city hit by rocket strikes on Saturday afternoon. âI had never heard anything like this. I can only imagine whatâs happening in the east.â He says he still thought Lviv was safe. â[But] it was really scary.â Maryanna Pack: We need more help now Maryanna Pack, a 39-year-old economist, was also nearby. âIt was a loud noise,â she said. âWeâre feeling unprotected. Nobody really cares about whatâs happening here. We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. Itâs really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too.â She said she felt the war coming closer to this city. âThings have changed dramatically.

Biden made the comment at a televised event at the national stadium in Warsaw, on a visit to show support for Poland over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during which he also met members of the Ukrainian government. A reporter asked the president ""You're dealing every day with Vladimir Putin, look at what he's done to these people. What does it make you think?"" ""He's a butcher,"" responded Biden before walking away. Biden also said each refugee he spoke to had asked him to say a prayer for the safety of their father or brother back home in Ukraine. In response to the president's comments, a Kremlin spokesman quoted by Russia's TASS news agency said Biden's comment narrows the prospects of mending ties between Washington and Moscow. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces that income tax will be cut by 2024 Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures aimed at combating soaring energy, food and fuel prices, in his Spring Statement. He cut fuel duty by 5p but resisted calls to scrap April's National Insurance rise of 1.25p in the pound. He warned the UK's post-pandemic recovery had been blown off course by the war in Ukraine. But he held out the promise of an income tax cut in 2024 when he said the economy would be in better shape. Labour said he had made an ""historic mistake"" by pushing ahead with next month's National Insurance increase, which the party warned would hit workers hard. But the chancellor said the money raised was needed for the NHS - and instead he said he would raise the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance from Â£9,600 to Â£12,570. Spring Statement: Key points at a glance How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you Squeeze on households overwhelms tax reversal More than a million face poverty, think tank warns This would amount to ""a Â£6bn personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom, a tax cut for employees worth over Â£330 a year,"" said the chancellor. Mr Sunak warned the economic outlook was uncertain and the full impact of the war in Ukraine was not yet clear. The Office for Budget Responsibility painted a bleak picture of the UK's immediate economic prospects, saying that living standards are set to take the biggest hit since records began in the 1950s. It said inflation was set to peak at 8.7% at the end of this year and this - combined with rising taxes - will ""weigh heavily on living standards in the coming 12 months"". The watchdog said the UK's tax burden will be at the highest level since the 1940s. Other measures in the chancellor's mini-Budget include: VAT on solar panels, heat pumps, roof insulation and other energy saving measures will be reduced from 5% to zero for five years The employment allowance will increase from Â£4,000 to Â£5,000, allowing small businesses to reduce their National Insurance payments Green technology will be exempt from business rates from April, saving firms Â£35m in 2022-23 Councils get another Â£500m for the Household Support Fund from April, designed to help vulnerable households with rising living costs Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had failed to appreciate the scale of the cost of living crisis facing workers and pensioners. This video can not be played WATCH: Labour's Rachel Reeves responds to Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement She told MPs: ""In eight days, people's energy bills will be rising by 54%, two weeks today the chancellor's tax hike will start hitting working people and their employers. ""His National Insurance tax rise was a bad idea last September and he's admitted it's an even worse one today."" She repeated Labour's call for a windfall tax on energy companies. Later, the chancellor answered questions on a phone-in on LBC radio. One woman said that despite a good salary ""on paper"", she was leaving her heating and lights off - and her family were wearing coats at home, to try to save on energy bills. She also said she was taking on extra cleaning and delivery jobs, and had cut her grocery shop down to Â£15 a week for her and her two children - and she often went without. ""Please tell me what else I can be doing,"" she asked. Mr Sunak paid tribute to her for working her ""socks off"" - and pointed to the energy bill rebate and higher national insurance threshold that will give a tax cut in July. UK faces biggest drop in living standards on record Fuel duty cut by 5p a litre to help motorists What's deeply unusual is that Mr Sunak chose to announce this giveaway, a penny off income tax, two years before it would kick in. It's certainly unusual to announce election goodies this far out, not just because it kills any element of political surprise, but also it ties the Chancellor's hands in the years ahead. While the moves seem to designed to polish up Mr Sunak's credentials as a tax cutter, the black and white of the statement documents beg to differ. As chancellor, he has increased taxes massively more than he has just reduced them. Read Laura's full blog The SNP criticised Mr Sunak over his decision not to reverse the removal of the Â£20-a-week top-up to Universal Credit payments, or to increase other benefits, ""at a time when people need it the most"". Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said ""the very poorest"" could see their cost of living increase by 10%, despite a ""small amount of extra cash"" promised by the chancellor for local authorities to help those on benefits. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the Spring Statement was a ""total swindle"" by Mr Sunak, who he said was ""giving with one hand and taking with another"". And the Green Party criticised him for not mentioning climate issues. Its co-leader Adrian Ramsay accused Mr Sunak of ""[looking] after the interests of fossil fuel companies"". Mr Sunak promised the government would ""stand by"" families struggling with the cost of living. And in a surprise announcement at the end of his statement, he said his ambition was to cut the basic rate of income tax by 1p in the pound. ""It would clearly be irresponsible to meet this ambition this year,"" he told MPs, but official forecasts said inflation would be ""back under control"" and national debt falling by 2024, making a cut possible then, he added. ""I can confirm, before the end of this Parliament, in 2024, for the first time in 16 years, the basic rate of income tax will be cut from 20p to 19p in the pound. ""A tax cut for workers, for pensioners, for savers. A Â£5bn tax cut for 30 million people. It is fully costed and fully paid for in the plan announced today.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says it looks to him as if P&O Ferries has ""broken the law"" Doubts have been cast on a claim by Boris Johnson that the sudden sacking of 800 workers by P&O Ferries may have broken UK employment law. The prime minister told the Commons the firm could face fines ""running into millions of pounds"" if found guilty. But employment lawyers told the BBC Mr Johnson had misunderstood the law and P&O had not broken the rules. It came as the boss of the ferry firm apologised for the mass sacking, saying he understood the ""anger and shock"". The sackings - along with claims that workers paid as little as Â£1.81 an hour will replace the fired staff - have sparked outrage. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""Under section 194 of the trades union and labour relations act of 1992, it looks to me as though the company concerned has broken the law. ""And we will be taking action therefore, and we will be encouraging workers themselves to take action under the 1996 employment rights act."" P&O Ferries offers Â£100,000 to some sacked staff Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? According toSection 194 of the act,external, firms are meant to notify the Secretary of State before they sack 100 people or more. However, Tim Tyndall, employment partner at Keystone Law, told the BBC the law had changed in 2018 due to the implementation of an EU directive. Chris Grayling was the Secretary of State for Transport from 2016 to 2019 when the change was made. Firms no longer need to inform the UK government about mass dismissals but instead must tell the governments of the countries where boats are registered, he said. Protestors marched through London on Monday Eight P&O Ferries ships are registered overseas in countries including Cyprus and The Bahamas. ""The obligation to notify the government of P&O actions has not been breached as the competent authority for these foreign registered ships is the government of where they are registered,"" Mr Tyndall said. ""It would appear the government did not understand its own legislation when writing in the terms that it did to P&O."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The requirement to inform the flagged authorities of workforce changes was introduced in 2018 in order to implement a directive from the European Union. ""The government is strongly committed to protecting UK seafarers and those who work in UK waters continue to be protected by National Minimum Wage laws despite the 2018 legal change."" Separately, Nautilus International, the trade union for maritime professionals, has accused P&O Ferries of breaking UK law because it did not notify the relevant flag states of its decision to sack workers. It said under UK Law, P&O Ferries was ""obliged to provide 45 days' notice to the Cypriot authorities, and 30 days' notice to the Bahamian and Bermudan authorities"". ""We believe the government must penalise P&O Ferries for their omission,"" said general secretary Mark Dickinson. The BBC has approached P&O for comment following the union's claim. On Wednesday, P&O boss Mr Hebblethwaite said he understood people's anger. ""I want to say sorry to the people affected and their families for the impact it's had on them, and also to the 2,200 people who still work for P&O and will have been asked a lot of difficult questions about this,"" he said. ""Over the last week, I've been speaking face-to-face to seafarers and their partners. They've lost their jobs and there is anger and shock and I completely understand."" He added that the sackings were necessary to keep the loss-making firm afloat. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision that we wrestled with but once we knew it was the only way to save the business, we had to act,"" Mr Hebblethwaite said. ""I wish there was another way and I'm sorry."" It comes after reports that Indian agency workers paid as little as Â£1.81 an hour have already replaced sacked P&O workers at the Port of Dover. Last week, P&O said the figure was inaccurate but said it could not comment on how much agencies pay workers on ferries. At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government should immediately cancel a Â£50m freeports contract awarded to P&O's owner, DP World. Ministers have said such contracts are under review. ""DP World must be quaking in their boots,"" the Labour leader said. ""The prime minister says how disappointed he is in them whilst handing them Â£50m."" P&O Ferries offers Â£100,000 to some sacked staff P&O sackings were appalling, says Sunak Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"President Biden is expected to discuss natural gas supplies, as the EU moves to reduce exposure to Russia US President Joe Biden joins fellow Western leaders in Brussels on Thursday for three summits on Russia's war in Ukraine, a month after the invasion began. Nato, the G7 and the EU are all holding meetings, in a display of unity rarely seen by the West. Mr Biden will take part in all three, the first ever visit by a US president to an EU summit in Brussels. But his visit to Brussels is not just about symbolism. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has given the Western defensive alliance Nato a renewed sense of purpose. And as the EU attempts to sever energy ties with Russia, it needs to forge and reinforce other relationships, particularly with the US. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was due to appear by video link at all three summits. Nato's 30 presidents and prime ministers will agree greater support for Ukraine and new troop deployments for Eastern allies. Their aim is to show solidarity to Kyiv, though only up to a point. Many, but not all, have been willing to supply weapons. The UK said it would use both the G7 and Nato meetings to ""substantively increase defensive lethal aid to Ukraine"". But the alliance has also made clear it won't become more directly involved and Mr Zelensky's repeated requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine have pretty much been ignored. Nor is it clear how Nato would respond if Russia were to dramatically escalate the conflict in Ukraine - such as an attack on a Western weapons convoy, the use of chemical, or even tactical nuclear weapons. Nato's red lines have so far been drawn at its borders. Why can't Ukraine join Nato? For the past few weeks, 30,000 Nato troops from 25 countries have been training in Norway as part of Exercise Cold Response, a long-planned exercise that has now taken on more significance. Soldiers from Sweden, which is not part of Nato, joined thousands of troops on exercise in Norway Like Ukraine, Norway borders Russia. The key difference is that, as a Nato member, Norway is covered by a commitment to ""collective defence"" - an attack on one is an attack on all. ""I think an exercise like this is pretty good to have, to prove to countries like Russiaâ¦ that you don't want to mess with Nato,"" a young Norwegian conscript called Peder told the BBC. Nato leaders are focused on how to boost their own defences. They've already sent thousands more troops to the alliance's eastern flank, along with more air defence batteries, warships and aircraft. Five challenges for Biden in Europe Nato to send more troops to Eastern Europe This, says Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, is the ""new normal"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia will get exactly what it didn't want - more, not less Nato near its border. Nato battlegroups will stretch all the way from the Baltic to the Black Sea for the foreseeable future. Two EU countries that are not members of Nato - Sweden and Finland - contributed troops to the exercise in Norway. They appear to be edging closer and closer to Nato in the wake of Russia's invasion. President Trump once questioned the very existence of Nato and French President Emmanuel Macron once called it ""brain dead"". But President Biden's visit to Brussels is proof that he sees it as being more important than ever to curb a more aggressive Russia. Defence strategy will also play a part in an EU summit where leaders will approve plans that aim to pull member states closer together on military planning, intelligence and procurement. One ambition is to have a rapidly deployable force of 5,000 troops. It's all part of the theme of ""strategic autonomy"" championed by Mr Macron. The argument is that a more sovereign Europe is a safer Europe, whether that's by securing reliable supplies of energy and semiconductor chips or by boosting military spending. But the trickiest subject for the European Union's 27 member states is fast becoming the future of energy supplies, as they try to look beyond Russia. After an initial, dizzying display of unity on sanctions across all 27 member states there are now obvious ruptures over what to do next. EU leaders have reacted fast to Russia's invasion with a series of hard-hitting sanctions German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has publicly denounced the idea of banning Russian gas and oil imports, arguing it will drag Europe into a recession. ""Sanctions must not hit the European states harder than the Russian leadership. That is our principle,"" he said on the eve of the summit. Soaring energy prices are also a concern to be discussed by EU leaders on Friday. But there are nations agitating for action as they voice deep discomfort about handing cash to the Kremlin via energy payments. ""It's blood money,"" said one central European diplomat. ""I don't think some countries understand the gravity of the situation."" President Biden's ability to offer Europe more US Liquefied Natural Gas is a key watch at Thursday's summit. The US is the world's largest producer of natural gas. He is also expected to announce more sanctions on Russian political figures as well as so-called oligarchs. But the prospect of fresh EU sanctions this week is being played down. Some in Brussels call it ""fatigue"", while others insist it's the right time to take stock.

"The Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his ""profound sorrow"" over slavery during a speech at a dinner in Jamaica. Prince William said slavery was abhorrent, ""should never have happened"" and ""forever stains our history"". Earlier, the island's prime minister, Andrew Holness, told the future king his country planned to pursue its goals as an independent country. On the fifth day of their Caribbean tour the duke and duchess also visited a hospital and school. Speaking at a dinner hosted by the Governor General of Jamaica, Prince William praised the spirit of the island that ""makes it so special"" as well as addressing the UK's role in slavery. ""While the pain runs deep, Jamaica continues to forge its future with determination, courage and fortitude,"" he said. The prince added the Queen had a deep affection for the country and said he had been touched to hear from Jamaicans about their affection for his grandmother in her Platinum Jubilee year. ""Sorrow"" is not ""sorry"". Some will be disappointed about that. But ""sorry"" would have been a different order of magnitude, carrying with it acceptance of responsibility and opening up the question of financial compensation. Hardly surprising then that Prince William didn't go that far. That would be a job for government, not royalty. When I spoke to Jamaicans earlier in the evening in Emancipation Park in Kingston there was a lot of thought about slavery, but little in the way of anger. There was talk of pain, but also an acknowledgment that this generation of Jamaicans is a long way from the generations exploited by plantation owners during colonial rule. It was those who suffered then that deserved an apology, one young woman said. This has been a particularly political part of the Caribbean tour. With his speech, William tried to deal with some of the issues about Britain's past in Jamaica. But the prime minister has raised a big question about the future of the Royal Family in a truly independent Jamaica. There have been calls in Jamaica to drop the Queen as head of state and the royal visit has seen demonstrations urging the monarchy to pay reparations for the slave trade. Mr Holness, who campaigned on a platform of making Jamaica a republic, told the duke there were ""unresolved"" issues but said that the royals' presence gave an opportunity for those to be addressed. He said Jamaica was ""moving on"" and added: ""We intend to attain in short order our development goals and fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country."" Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness (left) earlier told the Duke of Cambridge there were ""unresolved"" issues The royal couple visited a hospital in Spanish City during their tour The Duchess of Cambridge spoke with pupils at Shortwood Teachers' College in Kingston Last year,Barbados officially removed the Queen as its head of statein a ceremony attended by the Prince of Wales.

"Nato leaders will approve major increases in its forces in eastern Europe at an emergency summit, Nato's secretary general says Jens Stoltenberg says four new battlegroups will be sent to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania US President Joe Biden is travelling to Brussels for the Nato summit on Thursday The US says that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine There are reports of the Ukrainian flag being raised again in the suburb of Makariv, west of the capital Kyiv But Russian bombardment of the southern port city of Mariupol continues unabated, with some 100,000 people said to be trapped there Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons we're moving our live coverage to a new webpage. Please follow ushere for all the latest from the Ukraine war. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce on Thursday that the UK will provide Ukraine with about 6,000 extra missiles. At the Nato and G7 leaders' meetings in Brussels, Johnson will also unveil Â£25m ($33m) of funding to help pay Ukrainian soldiers and pilots. The UK government will also provide Â£4.1m for the BBC World Service to help support its Ukrainian and Russian language services in the region. ""The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight,"" Johnson said. ""One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world."" Britain said the new package will come on top of around 4,000 missiles already provided by the UK to Ukrainian forces. The latest funding is in addition to Â£400m already committed in humanitarian and economic aid, said UK officials.  Boris Johnson vowed ""to keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine"" Nada TawfikBBC News, New York Itâs getting harder and harder for Russia to deny its isolation on the international stage. Besides its ally, China, all 13 members abstained from voting on Moscowâs draft. The common message from most members was if Russia cared, and wanted to relieve the suffering of the Ukrainian people, it could end its war now. Instead, Russiaâs draft does not even recognise it is the sole cause of the humanitarian disaster or respond to the realities on the ground. Ukraine has its own humanitarian resolution set for a vote in the General Assembly, where Russia cannot wield its veto. Still, Moscow doesnât show any sign of changing course. It denounced the latest General Assembly vote as another anti-Russian show and blamed the humanitarian devastation on Ukrainian ""nationalists and radicals"". As British diplomat Barbara Woodward told me after the vote: ""I think Russia has consistently misplayed its hand here, and seriously underestimated the consequences of what it's done and the international perception of what it's done. ""They tabled this resolution over a week ago and they kept it on the table and rolled it forward. And, we saw the result today. Only one country supported Russia."" Ukraine's forces are ""increasing pressure"" on Russian troops occupying the region north-east of Kyiv, according to the latest intelligence assessment from the UK Ministry of Defence. Ukraine is continuing to carry out ""successful counter attacks"" on Russians outside the capital, the report says, and the Ukrainians have probably retaken the towns of Makariv and Moschun. ""There is a realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are now able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin,"" assesses the MoD. British military officials note that Russian troops along the axis north-east of Kyiv are facing ""considerable supply and morale issues"". ""It is likely that successful counter attacks by Ukraine will disrupt the ability of Russian forces to reorganise and resume their offensive towards Kyiv,"" says the report. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Russiaâs unprovoked invasion of its Slavic neighbour has triggered Europeâs worst security crisis since the Second World War. And yet, one month on, Russian forces have failed to exert full control over a single major city, their advance has stalled on several fronts and in some places they have even lost ground to Ukrainian counter-attacks. Bolstered by hi-tech weaponry from Britain and other Nato countries, Ukrainians have proven themselves both brave and resilient. But their defiance has come at a terrible cost. The southern port of Mariupol will go down in history as one of the most bombed and shattered cities of our time. Its destruction has been labelled a war crime. And Ukraine still faces major challenges. Its forces are running low on weapons and ammunition, armed Russian drones are now operating largely with impunity and Moscow is calling up reinforcements. President Putin appears set on subjugating Ukraine even if that means reducing it to a smouldering ruin. Zelensky spoke in English during his nightly address Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been delivering nightly video addresses since the start of the war, has called on people around the world to publicly protest on Thursday - the one month anniversary of Russia's invasion. ""The war of Russia is not only the war against Ukraine. Its meaning is much wider,"" Zelensky says, for the first time delivering his address in English. ""Russia started the war against freedom,"" he continues, adding: ""This is only the beginning for Russia."" ""Russia is trying to defeat the freedom of all people in Europe. Of all the people in the world."" ""It tried to show that only crude and cruel force matters,"" he continues. He adds: ""The world must stop Russia. The world must stop the war."" ""One month already. That long. It breaks my heart, the hearts of all Ukrainians and every free person on the planet."" He goes on to call for street demonstrations and for protesters to march while wearing Ukrainian symbols. ""Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourself visible and heard,"" he says. ""Say that people matter, freedom matters, people matter, peace matters. Ukraine matters."" A Russian-drafted resolution has failed to pass the UN Security Council. The resolution called for aid access in Ukraine, but made no mention of Moscow's role in the war. Russia and China were the only members to vote yes, while the remaining 13 members abstained. A rival humanitarian resolution drafted by Ukraine is due to be voted on in the General Assembly in the coming days. Biden was greeted at the Brussels airport by Belgium's prime minister If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of some of the latest developments on day 28 of Russia's invasion of Ukraine: A Ukrainian soldier holds a US-based Javelin missile launcher outside Kharkiv The first shipments of weapons for Ukraine that were pledged by American lawmakers in a recently passed aid package will be sent to Ukraine in the next day or two, a senior US defence official told Reuters. The weapons will reach Ukraine quickly after departure, the unnamed official said, also refusing to specify which weapons would be delivered. The official added that weapons already in use by Ukrainian troops would be prioritised for delivery. ""We are already aggregating stocks in the United States and we're getting ready to ship them over there,"" the official said.

Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna The head of the UNâs nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has again stressed what he called âthe urgent needâ to send experts and equipment to Ukraine to help ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and prevent the risk of a severe accident. Grossi said he remained gravely concerned about the situation in Ukraine. He said he hoped to work out an agreement to provide technical assistance for the safe and secure operation of Ukrainian nuclear sites, but that a positive solution had not yet been reached. ""We cannot afford to lose any more time,"" he said. ""We need to act now."" Ukraineâs atomic facilities include 15 reactors as well as Chernobyl, the site of the worldâs worst nuclear accident in 1986. Ukrainian officials have said that more than 4,500 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities via humanitarian corridors on Wednesday. Nearly 3,000 of them travelled from the besieged city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said,according to the Kyiv Independent newspaper,external. An evacuee from Berdyansk checks his phone Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov has denounced US claims that Russia is planning cyber attacks in retaliation for western businesses pulling out of Russia. ""These accusations against us are absurd,"" he said in a statement. On Monday, President Biden said that it was the patriotic duty of American companies to shore up their cyber defences against possible Russian attacks. Mr Syromolotov called the warning a ""new outburst of Russophobia against the backdrop of the situation in Ukraine"". Read more: Biden: Russia 'exploring' US cyber-attacks Russia has blocked access to Google News after accusing the news aggregation site of spreading false information about the war. The decision came at the request of Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office, Interfax news agency reported. The office determined that the website ""provided access to numerous publications and materials containing unreliable socially significant information about the course of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,"" according to the report. Numerous English language-websites - including Facebook and Instagram - have been blocked in Russia since the invasion of Ukraine. A new law there makes it illegal to report on events that could discredit Russian forces. Alphabet - the parent company of Google - had said earlier that they would block advert payments to websites and YouTube videos that spread false and harmful information about the war. In an email to publishers seen by Reuters, Google said it would not run adverts alongside ""claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens"". French car manufacturer Renault has announced that it is suspending work at its Moscow factory once more. Earlier today, Ukraine's president called on Renault and other French companies to quit Russia as he addressed the French parliament via videolink. ""They must stop financing the murders of women and children,"" he told French MPs. Renault had restarted operations in Moscow this week, after pausing work following the invasion of Ukraine. Ina statement released on Wednesday evening it,externalstressed that it was already complying with international sanctions on Russia. Chelsea football club will be allowed to sell tickets to away games, cup matches and games involving the women's team after the UK government made alterations to the club's special licence. The club have been unable to sell tickets since owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the government as part of its response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Under the changed licence, the club will not receive any revenue from ticket sales. Proceeds will go directly to the Premier League and then be distributed to the relevant party. Chelsea fans can purchase tickets for future Premier League away games, with any revenue going to the host team. The move means Chelsea will be able to sell tickets for their home Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on 6 April and the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium on the weekend of 16 April.

Speaking on board Air Force One as the president travels to Brussels, Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US would be announcing more sanctions on political figures and oligarchs on Thursday. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering its fourth week with no end in sight, and, sanctions aside, the path ahead for the US-Europe alliance is far from clear. Here's a look from our senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher at the most pressing concerns facing Mr Biden as he meets European leaders and allies in the days ahead: A cancer surgeon in Lviv has told the BBC that his hospital has seen a large influx of patients needing urgent treatment arriving from eastern Ukraine. Roman Shyyan says his hospital lacks enough chemotherapy drugs to treat all the patients - though more are being shipped now from Kyiv and other parts of the country. Help from Poland is proving hard to get because of logistical problems on the Poland/Ukraine border, he says. Some technicians working all hours to try and provide the radiotherapy that the extra patients need were unable to leave the hospital for days in a row - having worked late to offer treatments they were then trapped by the curfew rules, Shyyan said. The surgeon's team are limiting the number of post-operative patients they have in the hospital, he said, as they need to be able to move everyone safely into the basement when the air-raid sirens go off. Russian state media says the foreign ministry has given the US embassy a list of American diplomats it is expelling. The move comes after 12 Russian diplomats were expelled from its mission to the United Nations in New York earlier this month. The Russian foreign ministry said that the Americans were ""firmly told that any hostile actions of the United States against Russia will receive a decisive and adequate response"", Interfax reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded the West steps up military supplies, saying it wasn't just Ukraine at risk. ""What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities,"" he said. ""Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders."""" He said Ukraine needed just 1% of Nato's tanks and aircraft. ""We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days!""  A seven-year-old Ukrainian refugee from Lviv plays outside a temporary shelter in Poland Children in Ukraine face a dire situation and one in two have had to flee their homes, a Unicef spokesperson has told the BBC. The western Ukrainian city of Lvivhas come under heavy rocket fireand James Elder, who's from the UN children's charity Unicef, says the attacks add to the terror felt by people there. ""I'd been to a hospital where I see women go down, every time there's an air raid siren, carrying two day old babies or women 36 weeks pregnant who are frigid cold"", he says. ""Those women are hiding again tonight - terrified, petrified. And so many other people and children."" ""You can just see in the faces of families who have been through this in Kyiv, or Khakiv, and thought they were getting a moment's respite. Well the missiles tell a very different story tonight."" Earlier we reported that the city of Slavutych, where many of the Chernobyl power plant's workers live, has been taken by Russian forces. Now the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed its concern over the welfare of the plant's employees, as there has been no staff rotation at the plant for nearly a week. The IAEA's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, says there are concerns about the ability of staff to regularly rotate and return to their homes to rest. Earlier this month, Grossi stressed the ability of staff to carry out their tasks without undue pressure is one of ""the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety"". This is not the only nuclear plant held by the Russians. Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, is also in the hands of Russian troops. ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" said US President Joe Biden of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during a speech in Warsaw earlier.

He was asked at the Doha Forum in Qatar if Russian oligarchs facing sanctions from western countries could do business in Turkey. ""Of course, if it is legal; if it is not against international law, I will consider it,"" he says. ""If it is against international law, that's another story."" Two superyachts belonging to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovichdocked in Turkey this week. Nato member Turkey, which has strong ties with both Russia and Ukraine, hasn't joined western sanctions targeting Moscow's oligarchs. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv First, mid-afternoon, the air raid sirens went off. Then,
three powerful explosions, and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the
distance. Hours later, another attack. It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its
invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. And this distance from the worst of Russiaâs aggression,
where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling, turned this city
into something like a safe haven. Displaced people, humanitarian workers,
volunteers. They are all here. That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack, a
39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast, gives a passionate
testimony that may be shared by many. âWeâre feeling unprotected. Nobody really
cares about whatâs happening here,â she says. âWe need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely
destroyed. Itâs really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the
country too.â A nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been hit by Russian shelling, according to authorities cited in a Ukrainian news outlet. The Kyiv Independent said because of constant shelling in the area, in the north east of the country, authorities have been unable to assess the damage to the site. Russia has been repeatedly criticised for targeting nuclear power plants in Ukraine, such as the Zhaporizhia nuclear plant in the south east. Though risky, there has so far been no release of radioactive material from this site. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The Russian air strikes on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv today were intended to send a message to US President Joe Biden, mayor Andriy Sadovyy says. He's been speaking at a joint briefing with the head of the Lviv military civil administration, Maksym Kozytskyy, broadcast on YouTube. ""I think that, with today's strikes, the aggressor is sending greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland now. Lviv is 70 km away from Poland,"" Sadovyy says. ""I think the whole world should realise that the threat is extremely serious."" Kozytskyy says the missiles hit two critical infrastructure facilities, one of which was an oil depot in a residential area in Lviv, and another was a military plant also located in a residential area. Each of them was targeted by two missile attacks, he says. No-one was killed, Kozytskyy adds, but five people sought medical help. The Kharkiv Music Festival, in Ukraine's second city, has gone ahead, despite relentless shelling by Russia since the start of the war. Organisers insisted the event must start as scheduled, so musicians have been performing deep underground, on the marble steps of a metro station which serves as a huge bomb shelter. A small crowd watched, some with their eyes closed, others holding children or pets, as a string quintet played classical music, as well as the national anthem. A cello player who performed at the festival, Denys Karachevtsev, said he wanted to deliver a message of hope to the people of Kharkiv: ""My message is that we have no fear, we are strong, and we can be helpful for our country, each person [in their own way]."" Violinist Tatiana Choukh said ""it was maybe the best concert of my life"". The mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv - former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko - has urged thousands of protesters in central London to stand with Ukraine. A huge crowd of people, including Ukrainians living in the UK, politicians and celebrities,marched through London in solidarity with Ukraine. Klitschko, speaking via video link from a military bunker, told the crowd on a big screen near Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square: ""We defend, right now, the same principles. ""Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine."" London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced more than Â£1.1m in funding to support migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK capital, and said he was ""full of admiration"" for people who have offered Ukrainian refugees somewhere to stay. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, told the crowd: ""I urge you to keep up the good work, the military and humanitarian aid. ""The sanctions must continue until the Russian economy has stopped in its tracks."" Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden met at a summit in Geneva in June of last year It is not for Joe Biden to decide if Vladimir Putin stays in power, the Kremlin says. As we reported earlier, the US president gave a speech with comments aimed directly at the Russian people, closing with: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" According to Reuters, a Kremlin spokesman responded: ""That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians."" A White House official says Biden was not calling for regime change, but making the point Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. Biden was delivering the speech earlier in Warsaw, where he has met Ukrainian government ministers and refugees who have crossed the border into Poland. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media A building that was home to several families in Kharkiv has been destroyed Russia has destroyed about 4,500 residential buildings, 100 enterprises, 400 educational institutions and 150 medical establishments in Ukraine, a Ukrainian government minister says. The total damage across the country will be assessed after the end of hostilities and removal of mines, Minister for Community and Territorial Development Oleksiy Chernyshov says, as quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. According to preliminary assessments, the losses incurred by Ukraine have reached tens of billions of US dollars, with the sum increasing daily. With a view to reconstruction efforts, the government has simplified procedures for construction material imports.
   However, the minister adds, any reconstruction must be preceded by clearing mines and rubble. Ukraine hopes to involve domestic and foreign specialists in reconstruction efforts. Hugo BachegaBBC News, Lviv The deputy mayor of thebesieged Ukrainian city of Mariupolsays people are starting to die from starvation and dehydration, as food and
water supplies run low and no humanitarian aid is allowed in. âSome are dying from dehydration and lack of food.
Some are dying from lack of medicine, insulin... Because people cannot find
medical help,â Sergey Orlov tells the BBC. âSome mothers do not have milk, and they don't have food
for children. What should they do with their infants? I donât know. Thereâs no
food for children at all in the city.â Mariupol has been under relentless Russian attacks since the
early days of the war, and pictures show a city in ruins, with entire
neighbourhoods destroyed. Orlov says 70% of hospitals in the city have been âdestroyed
by bombing and shellingâ. Communication with the city is difficult, as the phone
network is intermittent, so it is hard to independently verify information.
Residents spend most of their time in shelters or basements with no
electricity, running water, or gas. âPeople are just looking for any possibility to survive.
[They] share food, water, theyâre collecting wood to cook in the street,â Orlov
says. More than 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol. Efforts
to carry out large-scale evacuations have failed, although thousands have
managed to leave in recent days in private vehicles. Next, Joe Biden addresses the Russian people, saying he's worked with Russian leaders for decades, since the height of the Cold War. ""I've always spoken directly and honestly to you the Russian people,"" he says. ""Let me say this, if you're able to listen. You the Russian people are not our enemy. ""I refuse to believe you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents. ""Or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards for God's sake, being pummelled with Russian missiles and bombs. ""Or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee, supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission. ""Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine's children. ""These are not the actions of a great nation."" He closes his speech with a reference to Vladimir Putin - ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" ""My message to the people of Ukraine... we stand with you, period,"" President Biden says during his speech in Warsaw, a line greeted by cheers. ""Today's fighting in Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battles in a long struggle,"" he says. ""Hungary in 1956, Poland in 1956 and then again in 1981, Czechoslovakia in 1968 - Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings but the resistance continued until finally in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all the walls of Soviet domination, they fell and the people prevailed. ""The battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War. ""Over the last 30 years the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones. Contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself. ""Today, Russia has strangled democracy and has sought to do so elsewhere."" Biden says it is obscene that Vladimir Putin has lied by saying he is trying to de-Nazify Ukraine. US President Joe Biden says Ukraine and its people are ""fighting to save their nation"", as he  addresses crowds in Warsaw. We need to be clear-eyed - this battle will not be won in days, or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead"" US President Joe Biden US President Joe Biden is speaking in the Polish capital Warsaw.

Nobody really cares about whatâs happening here. We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. Itâs really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too.â She said she felt the war coming closer to this city. âThings have changed dramatically. We spend a lot of time in shelters,â she said, because of the constant air-raid sirens. âThis is creating fear and anger.â Joe Biden made the comment to a reporter after meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland's capital Warsaw US President Joe Biden has described Vladimir Putin as a butcher, during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Biden made the comment at a televised event at the national stadium in Warsaw, on a visit to show support for Poland over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during which he also met members of the Ukrainian government. A reporter asked the president ""You're dealing every day with Vladimir Putin, look at what he's done to these people. What does it make you think?"" ""He's a butcher,"" responded Biden before walking away. Biden also said each refugee he spoke to had asked him to say a prayer for the safety of their father or brother back home in Ukraine. In response to the president's comments, a Kremlin spokesman quoted by Russia's TASS news agency said Biden's comment narrows the prospects of mending ties between Washington and Moscow. Â© 2025 BBC.
