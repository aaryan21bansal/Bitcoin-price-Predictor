"This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse Three of the worst five shootings in modern US history have happened in the last 16 months. It began - more or less - with 13, the number killed in 1949 in Camden, New Jersey, one of the earliest mass shootings in the US. An army veteran, Howard Unruh, killed his neighbours. Over the next several decades, the numbers went up: 16 in Austin, Texas, on a campus in 1966, and 21 slain at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, California, in 1984. The past month or so have been especially brutal, as two attacks unfolded - in Las Vegas (58 dead) and Sutherland Springs, Texas (26). They followed a June 2016 assault in an Orlando nightclub in which 49 people were killed. This video can not be played Warning signs of a potential mass shooter The reasons for this disturbing trend are many and complex, and people across the US and around the world have struggled to understand the violence. Here analysts discuss some of the factors that may lie behind the grim numbers: The shooters have increasingly been using guns with high-capacity magazines, allowing them to fire off dozens of rounds without having to reload. ""There are more people being shot in a shorter amount of time - with more bullets in them,"" explained Harvard School of Public Health's David Hemenway. Adam Lanza, who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, and James Holmes, who killed 12 in Aurora, Colorado, that year, both used weapons with this feature. Thedata's,externalclear: the number of killings in individual attacks goes up when assault rifles are used. Researchers,externalhave also examined the laws: a ban on semiautomatic military-style assault rifles and large-capacity magazines was passed in 1994. It was lifted in 2004. Experts said lifting the ban helped to usher in a new era of mass shootings. With these weapons, individuals could shoot faster and for longer periods of time - and consequently were able to kill more people in their attacks. In addition states have their own laws. After the Sandy Hook massacre, a Connecticut law was passed that banned some semiautomatic rifles. Other states loosened their gun laws, however. In Georgia, for example, a law was passed that allowed people to carry weapons in school classrooms, nightclubs and other places.  Experts at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violencewrote,externalthat people in states with stricter gun controls tended to see less gun violence. Attacks are now carried out in places with a large number of people - such as a Las Vegas concert venue with 22,000 people. ""With that type of crowd, the shooter didn't even have to aim,"" said University of Central Florida's Jay Corzine. This video can not be played Around 500 people were wounded by the gunman in Las Vegas Most of the people who carry out mass shootings plan the attacks carefully, according toHomicide Studies,external. ""They're doing their homework,"" Corzine explained. Preparing the groundwork, he said, means the shooters kill more. The gunman who opened fire at a Batman screening in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 ""thought a movie theatre would lead to higher fatalities"", said the University of Alabama's Adam Lankford. Coverage of mass shootings - like the assaults themselves - have exploded in recent years. Shooters post on social media before the attacks and sometimes while the assaults are underway. Media organisations create live pages and provide 24/7 coverage of an assault. In addition journalists often focus on the killers, providing details about their lives and unintentionally contributing to a glorification of these individuals. Yet overall, say experts, the stories did not cause an increase in the number of deaths in the assaults. ""I've seen media accounts of mass shootings for the past 25 years, and the uptick of high casualties has been pretty recent,"" said Corzine. Still the coverage gives people ideas. ""Mass shootings are contagious,"" said Gary Slutkin, founder of a Chicago-based organisation, Cure Violence. ""People see what other people do, and they follow that."" Dylan Klebold, one of the attackers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in 1999, described their goal: ""the most deaths in US historyâ¦we're hoping."" As Lankford explained: ""This really is a race for notoriety - to be bigger and better than the attackers who came before you."" This video can not be played Would we reduce the incentive to commit a mass shooting if we refused to report the killer? Becoming famous as a mass shooter may seem like a sick glory. Yet it holds an allure for some. ""It's, 'Well, yeahâ¦,'"" Slutkin said, describing how these individuals consider the possibility of fame and spend little time contemplating the likelihood of their own grisly fate: ""It isn't all the way thought through."" ""We all want to be known after we're dead,"" he explained. ""It shows how strong that circuit is.""

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress On Wednesday, less than a month after her 29th birthday, New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was elected to the US House of Representatives. Abby Finkenauer, also 29, achieved the same result in Iowa. Upon formally taking office, the pair will become the youngest women ever to serve in Congress. While the House of Commons is still some way off achieving gender equality, a record 208 women MPs were elected in 2017 - and the number of women elected before the age of 30 is on the rise. So, what advice can our MPs offer their US counterparts? ""Always believe in yourself,"" says Danielle Rowley, who was elected as MP for Midlothian last year, aged 27. ""People will always have an idea of what politicians should be, and you're never going to fit into that, but they will believe in you for being you."" The women who made history in the mid-terms Ms Rowley admits the advice is ""dead cheesy"" but stresses self-belief is hugely important in an often male-dominated arena. ""The only skill you need is to be passionate about helping people and passionate about representing your area,"" she adds. ""Everything else you can learn, and that's fine."" Scottish Labour MP Danielle Rowley was asked if she was a male politician's secretary at a recent event Kirsty Blackman was 29 when she was elected as MP for Aberdeen North in 2015 - a seat she held in last year's election. Ms Blackman echoes her colleague's views on self-belief, adding: ""It really helps to surround yourself with people who are positive and have a similar outlook to you."" Is there anything they wished they had known before becoming an MP? ""I'd always thought Westminster would be a very hostile place,"" says Ms Rowley, ""that it would be a 'boys' club"". ""I now know there is a massive group of really welcoming, supportive people who are there for you all the time. I wish I'd known that."" While both women have had positive experiences with other MPs, receiving the wider recognition they have earned can prove a battle in itself. ""I've just been at an event in the constituency where there was another older male politician and someone came and asked me if I was his secretary,"" says Ms Rowley. ""I get that quite a lot."" Ms Blackman adds: ""I do a lot of my own phone calls and it's pretty unusual for anyone to think that I'm the MP when I'm phoning from my office. ""Quite often they'll say: 'What's your name?' I'll tell them and then they'll ask who's office I'm phoning from. ""'My office,' I'll say."" She adds that people ""have this picture in the head of what an MP should look like - and I don't fit in that box"". The SNP's Kirsty Blackman was 29 when she was first elected as an MP But not fitting the mould of a stereotypical politician can also be an advantage, says Ms Rowley. She explains: ""When I was standing for election a lot of people said: 'Are you not a bit young? What experience do you have?' ""But I find that a really good opportunity because when people question me I can talk about my experience and explain, while I might be young, this is what I've done, this is my experience and this is what I'm passionate about."" Unlike many politicians around the world, candidates chasing election in their 20s have grown up in a world of social media. Should young politicians attempt to temper their online presence? Ms Blackman suggests only posting things you are ""willing to stand by"", adding her eight years as a councillor (before being elected as an MP), mean she has never really posted anything she ""would have been upset with people looking at"". Ms Rowley adds that she has not tried to ""delete or hide"" anything from her social media now that she is an MP. ""I got elected being myself so I thought I'm not now going to become what people expect a politician to be,"" she says. ""I still want to be myself."" Regardless of the challenges ahead, Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Ms Finkenauerhave already made history. Their election to Congress is seen by many as a sign of greater opportunities for young people in politics - and their stories will undoubtedly inspire the next generation. More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms. What does it mean for Congress - and America? The women who made history in the mid-terms.

"This video can not be played Supporters of the Democratic candidate in Georgia's governor's race say they still aren't giving up hope of a win. Stacey Abrams is refusing to concede to Republican Brian Kemp until all votes are counted. Under Georgia election law, a candidate for governor must reach 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff.

"After celebration of historic wins by diverse candidates, the other big online trend for the US mid-term election was claims of massive and deliberate vote suppression. Reddit's top post was an unverified video of apparent errors at a ballot machine in Indiana, while reports of hours-long queues, broken ballot machines and intimidation spread on Twitter and Facebook. A Google map of live election-related searches showed spikes in interest in provisional ballots and long waiting lines across the country. And in Florida, a church that serves as a polling station was criticised after posting a sign discouraging voters to choose Democrats,reported local media.,external Allow Twitter content?

Some reported cases were simple technical errors. In Ohio,one widely-shared claim of vote rigging turned out to be caused by a temporary paper jam.,external In Georgia, where African-American candidate Stacey Abrams is contesting results in her race against incumbent governor Brian Kemp, many online are claiming that issues likeballot machines supplied without power cords and four-hour queues,externalhelped boost Mr Kemp to victory. Mr Kemp was responsible for overseeing his own election, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law won emergency litigation in predominantly black areas of Georgia to extend voting times. Before the election, 53,000 voter applications were put on hold in Georgia because of alleged problems with identification information. Allow Twitter content?

Without comprehensive national data about problems like broken ballot machines, it is hard to calculate the full scale of Tuesday's problems, but evidence suggests that alleged vote suppression was more widespread this year than in previous mid-terms. Calls tothe largest non-partisan voter helpline in the country,,externalrun by the Election Protection Committee, were up by one-third in comparison with 2014, with 31,000 calls on Tuesday. Purges of voters from electoral rolls are more frequent than in 2010 and there is evidence that the numbers of voters requiring provisional ballots also increased, Vanessa Williamson at the Brookings Institution research group, who has written on the topic, said on Wednesday. Stacey Abrams is contesting the results in her bid to be Governor of Georgia Provisional ballots are issued when a voter's eligibility is in question and are often only counted in a close race. On Wednesday, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois also accused Republican lawmakers of trying to ""make it as hard as possible for people to vote"". Alleged vote suppression and intimidation tends to happen in areas with high African American, Hispanic or poor populations, where their vote could alter the status quo. ""Officials pursue voter suppression tactics to lock out voters of colour with the end goal of distorting electoral outcomes,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, part of the Election Protection Committee, on Wednesday. US mid-terms: What are the claims of vote suppression? Five things we learned from the mid-terms Her organisation tracks alleged voter suppression efforts throughout election cycles and won a lawsuit against Mr Kemp in Georgia in 2016, but nonetheless the scale of claims of problems on Tuesday were ""startling"", Ms Clarke said. Georgia, Arizona, Texas and North Dakota, Florida are the front line of their efforts. Research has previously shown that alleged vote suppression in the form of ID laws,externaldoes not seriously affect election outcomes. But in places like Georgia, where Mr Kemp may have won the race by fewer than 85,000 votes, it is easy to see why citizens would be concerned that an election was stolen from them. ""In very close races, an enormous number of factors contribute to the margin of difference. But where we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people shunted off the rolls, any reasonable person would be concerned about what that would mean for the validity of election outcomes,"" Ms Williamson commented.

"Ms Ginsburg has been admitted to hospital US Supreme Court judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg has fractured three ribs in a fall on Wednesday, the court says. The fall happened in her office at the Supreme Court in Washington. Ms Ginsburg, 85, went home but was in discomfort and went to George Washington University hospital on Thursday morning, a statement said. Tests showed that she had fractured three ribs on her left side and she has been admitted for observation and treatment. It meant that Ms Ginsburg - the most senior justice on the court's liberal wing - was not present for Thursday's investiture of Brett Kavanaugh, whose appointment led to protests following allegations of sexual misconduct. Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court US Supreme Court judge's #MeToo story The appointment, confirmed last month by the Senate, restores the nine-member court's conservative majority. The court has the final say on issues such as abortion, gun control and voting rules. President Donald Trump, who nominated Mr Kavanaugh and described the claims against him as a ""hoax"", attended his investiture. On Twitter, many were quick to offer the liberal justice assistance in the form of extra ribs and human shields to ensure she made it through the Trump presidency. Allow Twitter content?

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter Many on the left have quipped that Ms Ginsburg, the liberal lioness of the Supreme Court, should be encased in bubble-wrap to ensure she remains safe and healthy until the end of Donald Trump's term. The next time they say that, they may not be joking. The justice's recent fall has once again sparked concerns for her health and worries about the prospect that the Supreme Court could tilt even further to the right. When Mr Trump replaced the ultra-conservative Antonin Scalia with Neil Gorsuch, there was no ideological change. But swapping right-leaning moderate Anthony Kennedy with Brett Kavanaugh shifted the court to the right in varying degrees based on the issue. If the president has the opportunity to fill Ms Ginsburg's seat because she resigns or dies, the change would be a nightmare scenario for Democrats. Just two days after the mid-term elections, the significance of Republicans maintaining control of the Senate - which confirms presidential nominees - has been put in stark relief. For many conservative voters, another opportunity to shape the Supreme Court was a big part of what the mid-term election fight was all about. Ms Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She had previously focused her work on women's rights and started the first law journal dedicated to the topic. Ms Ginsburg has survived cancer and in 2012 cracked two ribs in a fall at her home. Some of her legal opinions, coupled with her refusal to step down during the Obama era, have seen her gain popularity in some quarters and earned her the nickname Notorious RBG. She is the subject of both a recent documentary, RBG, and a forthcoming feature film, On the Basis of Sex, in which she is played by actress Felicity Jones. The feature film is about a landmark Supreme Court case in which Ms Ginsburg argued for fathers' rights and against gender discrimination. Allow YouTube content?

""On the depression side of things, things are a lot better now, but you still do get that anxiety when you go out and you feel like you could be outed,"" she says. Charlie, not pictured, struggled with alcohol addiction for 10 years Charlie, not his real name, 29, says the mental health problems he experienced as a teen later led to alcohol problems. He's only recently been able to deal with them. ""It was a tough place to be inside my head,"" the 29-year-old says. ""There was no education on mental health and no education on LGBT issues - or even the existence of LGBT people in a normal, functioning role in society."" Charlie says he began using alcohol in his late teens to feel more confident and ""forget about all the stuff that was inside my head"". ""From the age of eight to at least 16 or 17 I had to hide what I was feeling. ""As those emotions got harder to deal with, it was harder to hide them and that caused a lot of strain on my brain, which led me to develop anxiety and depression throughout my teenage years."" Charlie is now in rehabilitation for alcohol addiction, but says he's sad to think of what he's ""missed out on"" during his life due to his mental health issues. He urges young LGBT people to speak to someone they trust if they are experiencing mental health issues.

"Local people woke up to find hundreds of dead buffaloes in the Chobe River Hundreds of buffaloes have drowned in a river on the border between Botswana and Namibia. Early investigations suggest the herd was being chased by lions and ran into the river, say Botswana authorities. A local lodge owner told the BBC that it looks like the buffaloes then got stuck because the bank on the other side of the river was too high and that they panicked and stampeded. He has never heard of such a large group of buffaloes drowning before. Africa Live: More on this and other African stories Dozens of elephants killed near Botswana wildlife sanctuary The authorities in Botswana estimate that roughly 400 buffaloes died. People living in the area collected the buffaloes and took them home to eat. The river flows through the Chobe National Park, a major tourist attraction known for its huge numbers of elephants, giraffe, sable and buffalo. Simone Micheletti, who owns a lodge on the Namibian side of the river, said that the herd was unusually large - at roughly 1,000 buffaloes. He took photos of the scene: Mr Micheletti told the BBC that he heard the lions roaring a lot on Tuesday night. When he went down to the river on Wednesday morning he saw hundreds of dead buffaloes. He added that  it was cloudy on Tuesday night so he suspects the clouds blocked the moonlight, meaning the buffaloes couldn't see. Bill Gates showcases 'reinvented toilet' NZ fisherman rescues baby from ocean Reindeer abuse filmed at animal centre Botswana's environment ministry released a statement saying that mass drownings are not unusual in the Chobe River, but Mr Micheletti says that the scale of the deaths is unheard of. The biggest mass drowning he has heard of before was around 50 buffaloes. He said that most of the bodies have been taken out of the river by people living nearby in order to eat them, something he said the authorities have given them permission to do.

"Mary and Ron Bilton were married for 66 years A dying couple were moved to the same hospital ward so they could spend their final hours together holding hands on their 66th wedding anniversary. Ron Bilton, 89, and his wife Mary, 86, were in different departments at Hull Royal infirmary after he suffered multi-organ failure and she had cancer. Staff allowed Mrs Bilton, who was nine floors below, to be by his bedside before his death. She died days later. Nurses said they were determined to help them be together ""at the end"". The couple, who spent more than two thirds of their lives together and were from Barton-upon-Humber, North Lincolnshire, were buried together. Rosie Featherstone and Ellis Howard organised for Mary Bilton to spend time with the man she ""shared her life with before he slipped away"" Sister Rosie Featherstone said: ""We were determined to do everything we could so they could be together at the end. ""We know it made a real difference to Mrs Bilton that she could be with him and she was able to sit in a wheelchair at the side of his bed holding his hand before he died. ""We were all crying when Mr Bilton died but glad we could help them be together. ""Everyone on the ward worked as a team to make it happen."" News stories and updates from Yorkshire Staff learnt from the couple's granddaughter that Mrs Bilton, who was in the final stages of cancer, had been admitted to the hospital's Elderly Assessment Unit after her husband, who was in a ward in the Department of Elderly Medicine.

"Tommy Robinson at the Old Bailey in London to hear contempt charges Paypal has told former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson it will no longer process payments on his behalf. Mr Robinson said the online payments system told him he did not fit within its user guidelines and would never be able to use the platform again. He said he had been using the platform to collect donations to fight his legal battles and branded the ban ""fascism"". Online petitions calling on finance firms to sever links with him have gained thousands of signatures. In a statement, Paypal said it could not comment on individual customers but added that it regularly reviewed accounts to ensure their use aligned with its acceptable use policy. Accounts that broke its policies would be closed, it said. Paypal added: ""We do not take decisions like these lightly, and we work hard to be rigorous and fair-minded when reviewing PayPal accounts. ""Striking the necessary balance between upholding free expression and open dialogue and protecting principles of tolerance, diversity and respect for all people is a challenge that many companies are grappling with today."" But Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, said: ""They just don't like my opinion and want to silence me. ""The government and establishment can see I have public support, they can see I have the ability to fight back."" He said Paypal had also frozen ""a lot"" of money that was in the account for 180 days. In September, Paypal stopped processing payments for conspiracy theory site Infowars for promoting ""hate and intolerance"". In May, Mr Robinson, 35, was jailed for contempt of court. The 13-month sentence sparked a series of #freetommy protests and a conviction which was later quashed after procedural concerns. The case has now been referred to the attorney general.

"Thousands of online property adverts in England are discriminating against tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit, a study says. The National Housing Federation and charity Shelter examined 86,000 online adverts for rental properties. They found that one in 10 of those adverts requested ""No DSS"" or ""No Housing Benefit"". While it is not unlawful to refuse people on benefits, Shelter said it was likely to contravene the Equality Act. The Act protects disabled people and women - who make up the majority of private sector tenants on benefits in England. The research found many other adverts implied that no one on benefits was welcome - for example by saying ""professionals only"". In response, landlords said many of the UK's mortgage lenders refuse to lend money to landlords whose tenants are on benefits. A previous studyby Shelter and the National Housing Federation (NHF) - which represents housing associations in England - found that 10% of letting agents in England did not rent out to tenants who were claiming benefits. Benefit claimant Michelle Hunte said she had found it very hard to find a place to live, after being evicted from a flat in London in 2016. ""I woke up every day at 6am to look for a home,"" she said. ""Everywhere I looked online said 'No DSS' - Gumtree, Facebook, everywhere."" She ended up living in a bed and breakfast, while her six children lived elsewhere. ""It was so stressful being apart from my family. I'm now suffering from anxiety and depression."" The NHF said the practice had to stop. ""This research shows that blatant discrimination against people on housing benefit is widespread,"" said Kate Henderson, chief executive of the NHF. ""Many housing associations were created in the 50s and 60s in reaction to discrimination and racism from private landlords who wouldn't house migrants, and said 'No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs'. ""Today's discrimination is hardly any different and we refuse to turn a blind eye."" Landlords who say 'no DSS' are flouting law The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said landlords could not be blamed, as many mortgage lenders refuse to offer loans where tenants are on benefits. David Smith, the policy director of the RLA, told the BBC that 90% of lenders have at least one product which discriminates against benefit claimants. ""We're very concerned about that, because it treats all tenants on benefits as the same,"" he told the BBC's You and Yours programme. Research for the programme also found that landlords whose tenants claim benefit are frequently charged more by insurance companies. Many long leases exclude such tenants anyway, the RLA said, although it added that it was difficult to estimate the proportion of leases affected. Helena McAleer, a landlord from Belfast, was told by NatWest to evict an elderly tenant who was on benefits, or find another lender. ""I was very upset about it, because I find it very inhumane to ask me to find another tenant,"" she told the BBC. ""They didn't care"". NatWest eventually offered her Â£500 in compensation, which she refused. The bank has said it is now reviewing its policy.

"A ""playful"" street artist has been putting his own stamp on road signs in Edinburgh city centre. The altered signs - including images of flowers and wine glasses - have been seen in South St David Street, Thistle Street and Union Street. The signs were hacked by French artist Clet Abraham, whose work sells for thousands of pounds. He said on Twitter that there are between 15 and 20 pieces around Edinburgh. Earlier this year a post on his Facebook page showed a similar image of a flower growing through a no entry sign in Glasgow. Art experts have said that they hope City of Edinburgh Council, which owns the road signs, does not destroy the artworks. Sorcha Carey, the director of Edinburgh Art Festival, said: ""The artist is very clever in what he does because the sign remains completely functional. ""He has intervened and has been playful with it but the sign is still visible. ""Drivers can still read the sign, it's still legible. He's not sprayed a whole can all over it and that's why he's so successful."" She said she had been enjoying one of the signs at the top of Union Street. ""It's wonderful when an artist plays with the city's infrastructure and what it does for us,"" she added. ""It makes us notice things that have been there all the time that we haven't seen before and makes it visible in a whole new way. It's a wonderful approach and way of keeping the cityscape alive."" Art expert Jan Patience added: ""There is a real interest for this kind of street art, especially after Banksy led the way. ""This graffiti art on the signs is subversive against authority. It's street furniture that's been defaced, but I think the council will replace these signs rather than clean them."" Work by Clet Abraham, who lives in Florence, has been seen on the streets of cities including Paris, Rome, London and Barcelona. Billy Smith, 32, from Edinburgh, said he liked the sign in South St David Street. He said: ""It's cool but its not practical for tourists. It would be a nightmare for them as it's difficult when you drive in another country but personally I think the sign is good."" Sara O'Connor, 48, from East Lothian, said: ""I love it, it's fab. It will make me smile every time I pass it now."" Calum Alexander, 29, from Edinburgh, said: ""I like it, it's different. It still shows what it is but it makes it not just a boring sign. I think the council should leave them.""

"Hollyoaks character Cleo, whose struggle with bulimia came to a head in an episode in October Calls to the eating disorder helpline Beat have shot up, after Hollyoaks aired a storyline involving a character with bulimia. More people contacted the charity in October than in any other month ever, the charity said - and it thinks the Channel 4 soap had a ""significant impact"". People with eating disorders have praised the show for the ""hard-hitting"" episodes, which saw character Cleo collapse with a heart attack after suffering from the illness. ""The story of Cleo is probably one of the most accurate portrayals of bulimia I've seen,"" said Praise Lawal-Okeowo, 18, from London, who is in recovery from bulimia herself. ""Her eating disorder wasn't at all glamourised, which is what the media often tends to do. Her lips were crusted, her hair was frail. Praise, 18, from London, says Hollyoaks portrayed the seriousness of bulimia ""What struck me most was when she was sitting in her living room and eating the sausage roll,"" she added. ""It was the look in her eyes like she'd turned into someone else because she'd been restricting so much."" Praise, who was hospitalised because of her eating disorder, added: ""My experience was similar to Cleo's by how she blamed others for her bulimia, never accepting that it's no one's fault but just a disorder that can occur from a build-up of underlining trauma in your life. ""Cleo hiding food, the binging, purging, restricting, baggy clothes, over-exercising and saying it's 'healthy' and 'good for me' even though it's another form of restriction. ""Refusing help or lying about seeking help. On her wedding day her having to clean her teeth from the stains of purging, which similarly I've ruined my teeth and had to have fillings."" She said people suffering from bulimia may spot traits in the TV character that they recognise in themselves, possibly sparking them to seek help. ""With Cleo's storyline, I think Hollyoaks have covered every single aspect of bulimia and it could help people now suffering and know how to seek help,"" she said. Chloe Marsden, 21, agreed that the soap's storyline could be an ""eye opener"" for viewers, adding: ""It was probably what I needed when I was younger."" Chloe, 21, said friends of hers have died as a result of eating disorders Chloe, who is from Leicester, was diagnosed with anorexia aged 14 and was hospitalised two years later. ""I had low potassium and was on the edge of a heart attack, like Cleo,"" she said. ""I really related to [Hollyoaks]. Everything that she did was what a person with an eating disorder does. It was like looking through my own eyes. ""Cleo's trigger was her boyfriend abusing her, mine was bullying."" Chloe, who writes a blog about her illness, has now been in recovery for two years although she said she still struggles now. Chloe spent time in an eating disorder unit for 10 months She added that it is important to raise awareness of the seriousness of the illness, adding it is ""one of the biggest killers"" in mental health. Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at Beat, explained that the charity worked with Hollyoaks closely when writers were creating the script for Cleo's storyline. Of the rise in calls to the helpline, he said: ""I don't think we can say the rise is just because of Hollyoaks; our general trend is up although that doesn't mean every month is higher than before. ""But I definitely think Hollyoaks was really effective in raising awareness and I think we can be pretty confident it had a significant impact in more people contacting the helpline than ever before."" He said raising awareness is really important - but also making sure content is not triggering to sufferers. ""We want to be real, we don't want to be triggering,"" he added. Beat offers two helplines - one for adults: 0808 801 0677 or email help@beateatingdisorders.co.uk and one for young people: 0808 801 0711 or email fyp@beateatingdisorders.org.uk 'Anorexia's a mental disorder, not a body size' Many 'unaware' of eating disorders signs 'I'd binge on Nutella, eating a giant tub a week' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Local people woke up to find hundreds of dead buffaloes in the Chobe River Hundreds of buffaloes have drowned in a river on the border between Botswana and Namibia. Early investigations suggest the herd was being chased by lions and ran into the river, say Botswana authorities. A local lodge owner told the BBC that it looks like the buffaloes then got stuck because the bank on the other side of the river was too high and that they panicked and stampeded. He has never heard of such a large group of buffaloes drowning before. Africa Live: More on this and other African stories Dozens of elephants killed near Botswana wildlife sanctuary The authorities in Botswana estimate that roughly 400 buffaloes died. People living in the area collected the buffaloes and took them home to eat. The river flows through the Chobe National Park, a major tourist attraction known for its huge numbers of elephants, giraffe, sable and buffalo. Simone Micheletti, who owns a lodge on the Namibian side of the river, said that the herd was unusually large - at roughly 1,000 buffaloes. He took photos of the scene: Mr Micheletti told the BBC that he heard the lions roaring a lot on Tuesday night. When he went down to the river on Wednesday morning he saw hundreds of dead buffaloes. He added that  it was cloudy on Tuesday night so he suspects the clouds blocked the moonlight, meaning the buffaloes couldn't see. Bill Gates showcases 'reinvented toilet' NZ fisherman rescues baby from ocean Reindeer abuse filmed at animal centre Botswana's environment ministry released a statement saying that mass drownings are not unusual in the Chobe River, but Mr Micheletti says that the scale of the deaths is unheard of. The biggest mass drowning he has heard of before was around 50 buffaloes. He said that most of the bodies have been taken out of the river by people living nearby in order to eat them, something he said the authorities have given them permission to do.

"This video can not be played Prince Charles says it would be ""nonsense"" to think he could campaign publicly as king The Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is ""not that stupid"". He has campaigned on issues such as the environment for decades but says he would not do the same as monarch. Speaking in a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Prince Charles said the idea that he would continue making interventions was ""nonsense"". He said he would have to operate within ""constitutional parameters"". In the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people have described as ""meddling"". Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the royal for 12 months, said Prince Charles ""bridled a bit"" at the use of the word ""meddling"" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as ""motivating"". The heir to the throne said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."" The Duchess of Cornwall said Prince Charles had a passion to help He said the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate. ""It's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two,"" he said. Prince Charles 'made me pick up litter' Â£5 coin marks Prince Charles' 70th birthday Prince Charles in a land of princes Prince Charles toasts baby news ""So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir. ""But the idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different."" Asked whether his public campaigning would continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid."" BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy. He said: ""The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn."" By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent He has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, ""to make a difference"". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others. It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to hisheartfelt ""black spider"" handwritten lettersraising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention. It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop? Prince Charles alongside his grandson Prince George Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his ""campaigning"". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother. However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king. ""You operate,"" he says in the BBC documentary, ""within the constitutional parameters."" It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power. Architecture In 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a ""vast municipal fire station"" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a ""monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend"". Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: ""I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness."" Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: ""Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic."" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: ""The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. ""It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat."" Wildlife conservation Prince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns. In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left."" Homeopathy Prince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself. In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy. Clarence House later said: ""Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake on Dominic Raab's comments Dominic Raab has come under fire for saying he ""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods is on the Dover-Calais crossing. The Brexit Secretary's remarks came at a technology conference as he discussed the ""bespoke arrangement"" the UK sought with the EU after it leaves the bloc. Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman suggested Mr Raab ""doesn't even understand the very basics of Brexit"". Conservative pro-Remain MP Nicky Morgan tweeted: ""Gulp."" According to the Institute for Government,external, Dover is ""a key artery for UK trade heading to continental Europe"" with more than 2.5m heavy goods vehicles passing through the port every year. Its report says goods worth Â£119bn passed through the port in 2015, ""representing around 17% of the UK's entire trade in goods by value"". Davis: May will probably lose Brexit vote UK and France 'still friends' after Brexit Fox: UK must be able to end backstop Reality Check: How much of the UK's trade is with the EU? Mr Raab told a technology conference on Wednesday: ""We want a bespoke arrangement in goods which recognises the peculiar, frankly, geographic, economic entity that is the United Kingdom. ""We are, and I hadn't quite understood the full extent of this, but if you look at the UK and if you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing. ""And that's one of the reasons why, and there's been a lot of controversy about this, but one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we have a very specific and very proximate relationship with the EU to ensure frictionless trade at the border, particularly for just-in-time manufacturing goods whether it's pharmaceutical goods or perishable goods like food."" ""I don't think it's a question so much of the risk of major shortages but I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent to which the choice of goods that we have in the stores are dependent on one or two very specific trade routes."" Dover is indeed an important port for the UK. It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries,handling 2.9 million lorries last year,external. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben. But that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage. Dover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value,handling 17% of the UK trade in goods,external. Among critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum -suggested,externalMr Raab should have ""done your homework before backing Leave"". The Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was ""relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy"". She added: ""While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade.""

Wildlife conservation Prince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns. In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left."" Homeopathy Prince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself. In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy. Clarence House later said: ""Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics.""

"This video can not be played Stephen Richardson had to have his leg amputated because of type 2 diabetes Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than Â£1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than Â£422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. ""The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. ""This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs Â£1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over Â£10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications."" Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese (66.8%) and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese (57.8%) in England. Source: NHS England Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly Â£477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around Â£350 million was spent on insulin, and Â£181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: ""Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. ""The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes."" FollowLaurel Ives,externalon Twitter.

"Former JLS star Oritse Williams arrived at Wolverhampton Crown Court to deny rape allegation Former JLS star Oritse Williams will stand trial next year after he denied raping a fan in a hotel room, a court heard. The 31-year-old is accused of the attack on a woman in Wolverhampton following a concert in December 2016. Mr Williams, from Croydon, south London, pleaded not guilty to the rape charge at Wolverhampton Crown Court. The boyband singer, who shot to fame on the X Factor in 2008, will stand trial at the same court on 14 May 2019. Mr Williams spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and nationality, as well as to deny the charge during a 36-minute hearing. Co-defendant Jamien Nagadhana, 31, from Hounslow, London, who is charged with assault by penetration in relation to the same incident, also denied the allegation and will stand trial with Mr Williams. Both men were granted unconditional bail. The pair were charged in September.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress On Wednesday, less than a month after her 29th birthday, New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was elected to the US House of Representatives. Abby Finkenauer, also 29, achieved the same result in Iowa. Upon formally taking office, the pair will become the youngest women ever to serve in Congress. While the House of Commons is still some way off achieving gender equality, a record 208 women MPs were elected in 2017 - and the number of women elected before the age of 30 is on the rise. So, what advice can our MPs offer their US counterparts? ""Always believe in yourself,"" says Danielle Rowley, who was elected as MP for Midlothian last year, aged 27. ""People will always have an idea of what politicians should be, and you're never going to fit into that, but they will believe in you for being you."" The women who made history in the mid-terms Ms Rowley admits the advice is ""dead cheesy"" but stresses self-belief is hugely important in an often male-dominated arena. ""The only skill you need is to be passionate about helping people and passionate about representing your area,"" she adds. ""Everything else you can learn, and that's fine."" Scottish Labour MP Danielle Rowley was asked if she was a male politician's secretary at a recent event Kirsty Blackman was 29 when she was elected as MP for Aberdeen North in 2015 - a seat she held in last year's election. Ms Blackman echoes her colleague's views on self-belief, adding: ""It really helps to surround yourself with people who are positive and have a similar outlook to you."" Is there anything they wished they had known before becoming an MP? ""I'd always thought Westminster would be a very hostile place,"" says Ms Rowley, ""that it would be a 'boys' club"". ""I now know there is a massive group of really welcoming, supportive people who are there for you all the time. I wish I'd known that."" While both women have had positive experiences with other MPs, receiving the wider recognition they have earned can prove a battle in itself. ""I've just been at an event in the constituency where there was another older male politician and someone came and asked me if I was his secretary,"" says Ms Rowley. ""I get that quite a lot."" Ms Blackman adds: ""I do a lot of my own phone calls and it's pretty unusual for anyone to think that I'm the MP when I'm phoning from my office. ""Quite often they'll say: 'What's your name?' I'll tell them and then they'll ask who's office I'm phoning from. ""'My office,' I'll say."" She adds that people ""have this picture in the head of what an MP should look like - and I don't fit in that box"". The SNP's Kirsty Blackman was 29 when she was first elected as an MP But not fitting the mould of a stereotypical politician can also be an advantage, says Ms Rowley. She explains: ""When I was standing for election a lot of people said: 'Are you not a bit young? What experience do you have?' ""But I find that a really good opportunity because when people question me I can talk about my experience and explain, while I might be young, this is what I've done, this is my experience and this is what I'm passionate about."" Unlike many politicians around the world, candidates chasing election in their 20s have grown up in a world of social media. Should young politicians attempt to temper their online presence? Ms Blackman suggests only posting things you are ""willing to stand by"", adding her eight years as a councillor (before being elected as an MP), mean she has never really posted anything she ""would have been upset with people looking at"". Ms Rowley adds that she has not tried to ""delete or hide"" anything from her social media now that she is an MP. ""I got elected being myself so I thought I'm not now going to become what people expect a politician to be,"" she says. ""I still want to be myself."" Regardless of the challenges ahead, Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Ms Finkenauerhave already made history. Their election to Congress is seen by many as a sign of greater opportunities for young people in politics - and their stories will undoubtedly inspire the next generation. More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms. What does it mean for Congress - and America? The women who made history in the mid-terms.

"This video can not be played The former Brexit secretary tells Today the UK can 'look after itself' Theresa May will probably lose a Commons vote on her Brexit deal, former Brexit Secretary David Davis has said. But Mr Davis - who quit his cabinet role over the Brexit plan in July- said he believed defeat  would prompt the UK and EU to agree a ""better deal"". He also said the UK had hundreds of plans ready in case the country leaves the EU without any agreed Brexit deal. Mr Davis said there might be ""some hiccups"" but the UK was ""a big country"" and ""we can look after ourselves"". Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union. Although 95% of a Brexit deal is said to be agreed, the UK and the EU have yet to agree on how to guarantee that there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in future. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit: All you need to know Dublin's Coveney warns over Brexit border deal Hunt: UK and France 'still friends' after Brexit Ministers invited to read draft EU deal Both sides agreed to put in place a ""backstop"", also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a ""frictionless"" border. This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides. One option for the backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border. But how long this would last, and how the arrangement could be terminated, has not yet been settled. The government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work. If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the 27 remaining EU member states. Mr Davis toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethat defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan. He said MPs needed to see the ""complete legal advice, not a summary"" before voting on such a crucial issue. Mr Davis added: ""Are we going to have to wait until the Irish government says it's OK to leave? If so, that's not acceptable. ""Are we going to have to wait until it's convenient for the (European) Commission to say when we leave? If so, it's not acceptable. ""I suspect that they have not pinned down any of these issues and they need to be pinned down before Parliament votes."" This video can not be played Liam Fox: UK must be able to end backstop International Trade Secretary Liam Foxsaid that the UK government must have the right to decide when to leave any backstop which involves a customs arrangement. It is understood that the Cabinet has discussed using a mutual (UK and EU) review mechanism to leave any backstop. When asked if a system requiring a mutually agreed withdrawal from a backstop arrangement would be of concern, Mr Fox said that the government ""had an instruction from our voters to leave the European Union and that decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else. That needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine"". UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Huntdelivered a speech in Paris, in French, in which he said the UK and France would remain tied by ""bonds of friendship"" after Brexit. On the issue of publishing the full legal advice, he said: ""We have an excellent attorney general and he is giving very good legal advice on everything that we are considering signing up to, so we are going into this with our eyes open"". Mr Hunt also said that it was ""entirely possible to reach an agreement"" within the next three weeks, although to reach agreement within the next week might be ""pushing it a bit"". In Dublin, theIrish foreign minister Simon Coveneytold the Irish Canada Business Association conference: ""I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot. ""Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British Cabinet agrees something, well, then that's it then, everything is agreed. ""This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British Government but also with the European Union and the 27 countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team. ""So while of course we want progress to be made and we want it to be made as quickly as possible because time is moving on, I would urge caution that people don't get carried away on the back of rumour in the coming days.""

"The pilot of a Flybe plane that dropped 500ft (152m) in 18 seconds had selected the wrong autopilot setting shortly after take-off, an inquiry has found. Some 44 passengers and four crew were on board the Belfast City to Glasgow flight on 11 January when the aircraft ""pitched nose-down"" towards the ground. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report said warnings alerted the pilot, who fixed the error at 928ft (283m). Flybe said it had implemented ""remedial actions quickly in response"". The report said that autopilot was engaged when the Bombardier Dash-8 Q400 turboprop plane reached an altitude of 1,350 ft. The plane climbed to 1,500ft, but then pitched and ""descended rapidly"" because the autopilot was set with a target altitude of 0ft. Staff reported that the plane ""had become visual with the ground"", and the report said the aircraft had reached a maximum rate of descent of 4,300ft/min. The 60-year-old pilot ""responded almost immediately"" to cockpit alarms and disconnected the autopilot, the report found. The flight continued as planned to Glasgow and landed without further incident. Serious aircraft 'near-misses' double Light aircraft crash caused by cramp The report said ""several safety actions"" had been taken by Flybe since the incident, including revisions to simulator training and amendments to the taxi checklist. A statement from Flybe said the operator ""maintains a rigorous approach to ensuring the very highest flying standards are maintained"". ""Flybe implemented remedial actions quickly in response to the incident and our training and procedures have been amended to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence,"" it said.

"Jenni Murray penned an article headlined 'Be trans, be proud â but don't call yourself a 'real woman' BBC Radio 4 host Dame Jenni Murray has pulled out of an Oxford University talk amid a backlash over comments she made about transgender people. The Woman's Hour presenter was invited to speak at an event called Powerful British Women in History and Society. But the student union's LGBTQ Campaign said she had made ""transphobic comments"" in a 2017 newspaper article. The Oxford University History Society subsequently said she had cancelled her appearance ""for personal reasons"". Writing forthe Sunday Times,externalin March 2017, Dame Jenni penned an article headlined ""Be trans, be proud â but don't call yourself a 'real woman'"". In it, she wrote that ""it takes more than a sex change and make-up"" to ""lay claim to womanhood"". The LGBTQ Campaign said her comments contribute to ""the harassment, marginalisation, discrimination, and violence"" faced by trans people. A statement said: ""The decision to offer her a platform is not apolitical or neutral, especially when her views cause tangible harm to vulnerable members of our society."" It called on the history society to publicly condemn her views or cancel the event. Dame Jenni, who has been contacted for comment, has previously said she was not ""transphobic or anti-trans"". She also said she believed trans people ""should be treated with respect"" and protected from ""bullying and violence"".

"This video can not be played Staff applauded as Mr Sessions left the Department of Justice The US inquiry into alleged Russian meddling during the 2016 election could be under threat after President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, top opposition Democrats say. Nancy Pelosi, who leads Democrats in the House of Representatives, called the decision a ""blatant attempt"" to end or impede the investigation. The probe has been criticised by Mr Sessions's successor Matthew Whitaker. The Democrats, who won the House in the mid-terms, have vowed to protect it. Some Republicans appear to have shared the Democrats' concern over the future of the inquiry, which is being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Senator Susan Collins and Mitt Romney said it should not be impeded in any way. Trump fires Sessions - is Mueller next? Who is Acting US Attorney General Matthew Whitaker? Mr Mueller is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, resulting in a series of criminal charges against several Trump associates. Mr Trump has vehemently denied any collusion took place, and repeatedly called for the inquiry to be shut down, calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". Democrats see this latest move as an attempt to do just that. This video can not be played Chuck Schumer: Timing of Sessions' firing 'suspect' ""It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions' firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine and end Special Counsel Mueller's investigation,""Ms Pelosi - a front-runner to become speaker of the House of Representatives following this week's mid-terms - tweeted,external. She went on to argue that, ""given his record of threats to undermine and weaken the Russia investigation"", Mr Whitaker should follow in Mr Sessions' footsteps and recuse himself. Her words were echoed by Democratic party Senate leaderChuck Schumer, who added: ""Clearly, the president has something to hide."",external The sacking followed months of Mr Trump criticising Mr Sessions, mainly for his decision to step aside from the Russia inquiry in March 2017. Mr Sessions removed himself from the probe after Democrats accused him of failing to disclose contacts he had had with the Russian ambassador as a senior adviser to Mr Trump's campaign. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words All you need to know about Trump Russia story In July 2017 Mr Trump told the New York Times: ""Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else."" This video can not be played Relations between Trump and Sessions soured in 2017 In a resignation letter, Mr Sessions - a former Alabama senator who was an early supporter of Mr Trump - made clear the decision to go was not his own. ""Dear Mr President, at your request I am submitting my resignation,"" he wrote in an undated letter. Mr Whitaker can now assume control of the Mueller inquiry, which has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until now. The president cannot directly fire the special counsel. But Mr Sessions's replacement will have the power to do so, or end the inquiry. Matthew Whitaker was announced as the acting attorney general Mr Whitaker expressed concerns over the investigation. In August 2017,he wrote a piece for CNN in which he stated that looking into Mr Trump's personal finances, or those of his family, ""goes beyond the scope,externalof the appointment of the special counsel"". He went on to call on Mr Rosenstein to ""order Mueller to limit the scope of the investigation"" or risk the inquiry starting ""to look like a political fishing expedition"". The deputy attorney general appointed Mr Mueller to lead the inquiry after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey in 2017. The special counsel has also been investigating whether Mr Comey's firing amounted to obstruction of justice. There has also been a question mark over Mr Rosenstein's future since it was alleged that he had discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Trump. Top US official denies plot to oust Trump Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington There had already been hints that Robert Mueller's pre-election ""quiet period"" was about to come to an end. And, in fact, if the former FBI director is as meticulous as he's reputed to be, he might have already made plans to deal with exactly this contingency. That's stepping into the unknown, however. What's certain is that if the special counsel tries to issue new indictments or expand his inquiry, Matthew Whitaker is now in a position to rebuff those requests. If Mr Mueller files a report detailing his conclusions, the new acting attorney general could keep the document from ever becoming public. Those would be half-measures and insurance policies to limit damage. The president may also decide to instruct Mr Whitaker to fire the entire Mueller team - something Mr Trump says he has the power to do. There's some doubt about whether the president is right, but with the mid-terms behind him he could be itching to settle this Mueller business once and for all. And he's one step closer to being able to do just that. That almost certainly wouldn't be the end of this story, but it's the beginning of a new, fraught chapter.

Possible attorney general candidates Rudy Giuliani (left), Pam Bondi (left-centre), Lindsey Graham (right-centre) and Chris Christie (right) Mr Whitaker is not tipped to remain in the top role for long.

"Dyson has won a battle in the European courts over the way vacuum cleaners' energy efficiency is labelled. The UK household appliance maker said the tests behind the efficiency ratings favoured rivals' models and failed to reflect real life conditions of use. The EU's General Court found in Dyson's favour after four years of legal wrangling over the issue. The company, founded by Sir James Dyson, said the ruling was ""a win for consumers"". The UK firm said the lab tests had ""flagrantly discriminated"" against its own patented cyclone technology by testing vacuum cleaners when they were empty of dust. Dyson, which is best known for its bagless cleaners, argued that models using bags lost suction and became less energy efficient as they filled, making lab tests which only measured the performance of empty cleaners inaccurate. The company argued the tests misled consumers over the real environmental impact of the machine they were buying. Dyson to build electric car in Singapore Dyson said some manufacturers had ""actively exploited the regulation by using low motor power when in the test state, but then using technology to increase motor power automatically when the machine fills with dust - thus appearing more efficient"". The ruling in the General Court annuls the current labelling regulations, although they will remain in place for 10 weeks to allow time for appeal. By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent Dyson has compared the situation with vacuum cleaners to ""dieselgate"" - the scandal which saw Volkswagen engineers deliberately drive a bus through exhaust emissions legislation. However, it's fair to say that's overplaying things a bit. Certainly the court has concluded that the EU legislation was faulty - and the beneficiaries of that defective legislation were rivals such as Siemens or Bosch. Dyson insists some manufacturers have been gaming the system, exploiting weaknesses in the legislation. It even refers to ""defeat software"" - echoing the ""defeat devices"" used by Volkswagen. But, here's the point. Dyson seems to be suggesting that the Commission itself discriminated in favour of continental manufacturers and against its own products - while the manufacturers themselves were operating within the letter, if not the spirit, of the law. It's the bureaucrats, not the companies themselves, who stand accused. Volkswagen's engineers, in the US at least, knew full well what they were doing was downright illegal. The consequences of their actions were that a great many drivers were unknowingly using vehicles that produced far greater quantities of harmful gases than they thought, and sabotaging efforts to reduce air pollution.

Joanne D'Onofrio, 46, from Newcastle, is currently on dialysis in the city's Freeman Hospital after falling seriously ill. At 18 she suffered kidney failure and had her first transplant a year later in 1991, but her body is now attacking the donor kidney. Almost 27,000 people have re-tweeted her appeal.

""There could be a lot more people get transplants just because of that one tweet."" Ms D'Onofrio, whose two children are in their early 20s, said she was ""really awkward"" as she needed a living donor with O positive blood and matching tissue types. She said a ""cadaver kidney"" would not work due to her high antibody count which would reject such an organ. She underwent surgery on Thursday morning to have a new dialysis line fitted to her lumbar vein, but if that fails ""that would be it"". In her tweet, she said: ""I'm in desperate need of a kidney transplant and need a matching live donor. ""I'm actually at the end of the road now, so need one pretty quickly to save my life."" There were 940 adult living-donor kidney transplants in the UK in 2017/18, according to NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT). Of those, 85 were altruistic - meaning kidneys were donated voluntarily to a stranger. 'Wrong house' drunk faces no action University's 'obscene' books on display War memorial turned into bubble bath A spokeswoman said: ""For suitable patients, transplantation is normally the best treatment for end-stage kidney disease compared with dialysis. ""A transplant from a living kidney donor is often the best chance of a successful transplant.""

Mrs Hajiyeva, who lives in a Â£15m house near to the London store, is wanted by the authorities in Azerbaijan for an alleged conspiracy to defraud the Azerbaijani national bank. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods arrested She was granted bail last Tuesday but prosecutors lodged an appeal, arguing that she posed a flight risk.

"This video can not be played This is how the BBC first reported Justin Levene's story. Luton Airport says it's now upgraded its facilities. A paraplegic athlete whodragged himself through the arrivals terminal at Luton Airportsays he is dropping his legal action as the airport has ""improved their disabled facilities"". Justin Levene's self-propelling wheelchair was left behind on a flight in the incident, last August. He was offered a rigid high-backed chair but refused, as he felt it removed his independence. Luton Airport now says it has 10 self-propelled wheelchairs. As well as the chairs, based permanently at the airport, the airport says its provisions include: A loan replacement system whereby it lends people equipment, such as wheelchairs, free of charge as well as organising and funding the returns process Where it has pre-notification of a requirement for very specialised mobility equipment, it has an arrangement in place with a local disability resource centre who will assist the airport in sourcing such items. Mr Levene, an international wheelchair athlete, trainer and mentor to disabled athletes, said: ""If Luton now has self-propelling wheelchairs, and a loan system in case of loss or damage to a wheelchair, then I'm delighted with this outcome. ""This was never about money, it was about trying get a change in policy. ""I am happy to drop my legal claim because Luton has taken on board my concerns and improved their disabled facilities for the better."" Justin Levene says he had no option but to drag himself through the airport rather than use a chair that needed to be pushed As well as fears about independence, Mr Levene, from north London, was concerned about pressure sores from using a rigid high-backed chair. BBC's Gardner left stuck on plane again Journalist criticises airport for treatment of disabled passengers Four airports failing disabled passengers He had herniated a disc when he was 20 and a subsequent operation to fix the problem went wrong, leaving him paralysed below the waist and reliant on his self-propelling wheelchair. He said: ""I hope that media coverage has helped raise awareness of issues around the mobility needs of disabled travellers. ""We simply want to get from A to B with as much dignity and independence as possible."" Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson told ITV's Good Morning Britain that the result Mr Levene had achieved was ""amazing"". ""This is the reality for a lot of disabled people. You get left on planes, you get left for sometimes a couple of hours,"" she said. ""Last week I decided to crawl off a train because it didn't appear that anyone was coming to get me."" Mr Levene's experience has prompted disabled people to share their stories of using public transport, including being left on trains. When Mr Levene's story was covered by the BBC on Friday, Luton Airport said in a statement: ""On discovering that Mr Levene's flight had arrived without his wheelchair, our teams worked hard to find a solution, offering Mr Levene an assisted wheelchair as a temporary replacement. ""Mr Levene declined all offers of help as he deemed them unacceptable. ""While we apologise if Mr Levene was dissatisfied with the service he received, we are satisfied that our agents and staff did all they could in difficult circumstances.""

"Zamira Hajiyeva: Says jailed husband made his millions legitimately A woman who spent Â£16m at Harrods and is subject to the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order will be freed on bail following her arrest last week. Zamira Hajiyeva, 55, is the wife of an ex-state banker who is serving a 15-year prison sentence for embezzlement in their home country of Azerbaijan. Mrs Hajiyeva was arrested last week by the Metropolitan Police acting on a request from authorities in Azerbaijan. She faces two charges of embezzlement. Her lawyers say she is no ""fraudster"". Mrs Hajiyeva, who lives in a Â£15m house near to the London store, is wanted by the authorities in Azerbaijan for an alleged conspiracy to defraud the Azerbaijani national bank. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods arrested She was granted bail last Tuesday but prosecutors lodged an appeal, arguing that she posed a flight risk. However at the High Court on Thursday, the judge, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, granted bail, adding there were no ""substantial grounds"" to deny it. Zamira Hajiyeva faces two charges of embezzlement Mrs Hajiyeva's release on bail is subject to a Â£500,000 bond and arrangements for an electronic tagging device to be installed at her Knightsbridge home. Under her bail conditions, she must stay at home between the hours of 21:00 GMT and 06:00 and report daily to Charing Cross police station. She must also not visit any international transfer hub or apply for travel documents and must stay within the M25. Mrs Hajiyeva is subject to two UWOs by the National Crime Agency - meaning she must explain the origin of her fortune.

"Thousands of online property adverts in England are discriminating against tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit, a study says. The National Housing Federation and charity Shelter examined 86,000 online adverts for rental properties. They found that one in 10 of those adverts requested ""No DSS"" or ""No Housing Benefit"". While it is not unlawful to refuse people on benefits, Shelter said it was likely to contravene the Equality Act. The Act protects disabled people and women - who make up the majority of private sector tenants on benefits in England. The research found many other adverts implied that no one on benefits was welcome - for example by saying ""professionals only"". In response, landlords said many of the UK's mortgage lenders refuse to lend money to landlords whose tenants are on benefits. A previous studyby Shelter and the National Housing Federation (NHF) - which represents housing associations in England - found that 10% of letting agents in England did not rent out to tenants who were claiming benefits. Benefit claimant Michelle Hunte said she had found it very hard to find a place to live, after being evicted from a flat in London in 2016. ""I woke up every day at 6am to look for a home,"" she said. ""Everywhere I looked online said 'No DSS' - Gumtree, Facebook, everywhere."" She ended up living in a bed and breakfast, while her six children lived elsewhere. ""It was so stressful being apart from my family. I'm now suffering from anxiety and depression."" The NHF said the practice had to stop. ""This research shows that blatant discrimination against people on housing benefit is widespread,"" said Kate Henderson, chief executive of the NHF. ""Many housing associations were created in the 50s and 60s in reaction to discrimination and racism from private landlords who wouldn't house migrants, and said 'No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs'. ""Today's discrimination is hardly any different and we refuse to turn a blind eye."" Landlords who say 'no DSS' are flouting law The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said landlords could not be blamed, as many mortgage lenders refuse to offer loans where tenants are on benefits. David Smith, the policy director of the RLA, told the BBC that 90% of lenders have at least one product which discriminates against benefit claimants. ""We're very concerned about that, because it treats all tenants on benefits as the same,"" he told the BBC's You and Yours programme. Research for the programme also found that landlords whose tenants claim benefit are frequently charged more by insurance companies. Many long leases exclude such tenants anyway, the RLA said, although it added that it was difficult to estimate the proportion of leases affected. Helena McAleer, a landlord from Belfast, was told by NatWest to evict an elderly tenant who was on benefits, or find another lender. ""I was very upset about it, because I find it very inhumane to ask me to find another tenant,"" she told the BBC. ""They didn't care"". NatWest eventually offered her Â£500 in compensation, which she refused. The bank has said it is now reviewing its policy.

"The pilot of a Flybe plane that dropped 500ft (152m) in 18 seconds had selected the wrong autopilot setting shortly after take-off, an inquiry has found. Some 44 passengers and four crew were on board the Belfast City to Glasgow flight on 11 January when the aircraft ""pitched nose-down"" towards the ground. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report said warnings alerted the pilot, who fixed the error at 928ft (283m). Flybe said it had implemented ""remedial actions quickly in response"". The report said that autopilot was engaged when the Bombardier Dash-8 Q400 turboprop plane reached an altitude of 1,350 ft. The plane climbed to 1,500ft, but then pitched and ""descended rapidly"" because the autopilot was set with a target altitude of 0ft. Staff reported that the plane ""had become visual with the ground"", and the report said the aircraft had reached a maximum rate of descent of 4,300ft/min. The 60-year-old pilot ""responded almost immediately"" to cockpit alarms and disconnected the autopilot, the report found. The flight continued as planned to Glasgow and landed without further incident. Serious aircraft 'near-misses' double Light aircraft crash caused by cramp The report said ""several safety actions"" had been taken by Flybe since the incident, including revisions to simulator training and amendments to the taxi checklist. A statement from Flybe said the operator ""maintains a rigorous approach to ensuring the very highest flying standards are maintained"". ""Flybe implemented remedial actions quickly in response to the incident and our training and procedures have been amended to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence,"" it said.

"The suffragette is one of many computer-controlled characters who can be attacked in the game YouTube has restored several videos showing a women's rights campaigner being killed in a variety of ways in the video game Red Dead Redemption 2. The platform had deleted the recordings on Wednesday and in one case had banned the clip creator involved. The action had represented its first such response to depictions of graphic violence within a mainstream game. But it now says that it made a ""mistake"" and has restricted the clips so they cannot be seen by under-18s. The U-turn occurred after a backlash on social media. This included the vlogger PewDiePie retweeting a complaint by one of the video creators, who had accused YouTube of unfair treatment. Another popular vlogger, Keem, had also drawn attention to the affair claiming it was ""going to create GamerGate 2.0"". Ryan Wyatt, YouTube's head of gaming, eventually responded - blaming the deletions on a misinterpretation of YouTube's community guidelines. ""The reviewer will be educated on this outcome and on how to avoid repeating this mistake,""he tweeted.,external. However, the BBC understands the original decision had involved several members of YouTube's staff and that the original ruling was overturned once the business's wider gaming team took charge. ""YouTube's community guidelines prohibit among other things, gratuitous violence, nudity, dangerous and illegal  activities, and hate speech,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Creative formats such as video games can be challenging to assess but when content crosses the line and is flagged to our attention, we take action as necessary."" Red Dead 2 suffragette clips deleted by YouTube The developer behind Red Dead Redemption 2 Five things to know about Red Dead Redemption 2 The Western-themed Red Dead Redemption 2 is set at the end of the 19th Century, about two decades before women were given the vote in all US states. One of the temporarily banned clips involved the woman being tied up and then fed to animals Within the game the player meets several suffragettes. In one case it is possible to assault and kill one of the campaigners. Several YouTube creators took advantage of this to post recordings of the game's protagonist killing the computer-controlled character in a series of gruesome ways. These included the woman being: fed to an alligator dropped down a mineshaft shot in the face and fed to pigs tied up on a railway track and run over by a train set on fire In linked comments, several users made jokes about the fact it was possible to assault a ""feminist"" in this way. On Wednesday morning, the BBC asked the firm whether 10 such clips breached its policies. YouTube subsequently removed eight of them, leaving two examples in which the suffragette was beaten but not killed. Among those blocked was a clip that had attracted more than 1.5 million clicks within a channel that had attracted more than 473,000 subscribers. The channel's UK-based owner was initially told he was also being banned from owning or setting up other accounts. All of the creator's videos have since been restored, including clips of other characters being attacked within Red Dead Redemption 2. One company-watcher said the incident pointed to a wider problem. ""YouTube's guidelines have been accused of being vague and open to interpretation, meaning even when YouTube does act upon them, its decision is often challenged as censorship,"" commented Teoh Lander-Boyce, co-editor of TenEighty magazine. ""It can seem to many creators that the guidelines are not enforced even-handedly, often taking either a massive outrage online or interest from mainstream media to get it to take notice. ""This disparity between when it does and doesn't act, and how it enforces the rules just points to a lack of clarity and understanding on what the community guidelines really mean."" YouTube had initially limited itself to allowing clips in which the woman was attacked but not killed Another YouTube creator also suggested the matter had been mishandled. ""It's interesting that in a huge beautiful game with an amazing array of things to do, that's actually pretty progressive in its storytelling... someone decided to take a character representative of progress for women and kill her in not just one but multiple ways for several videos,"" Outside Xtra presenter Ellen Rose said. ""It's also interesting, but not at all surprising, that these are some of that channel's most popular videos for months, and people in the comments are being weirdly gleeful about the idea of a women's rights campaigner  - or 'annoying feminist' - being assaulted this way. ""I think that YouTube needs to stop and look at those responses when making decisions as to whether or not a clip is good for the site."" Red Dead Redemption 2 has attracted very positive reviews, and attained a score of 97 out of 100 on Metacritic,which collates critics' reviews.,external Many of the 18-certificate game's non-playable characters can be attacked, but there has been criticism of a decision to allow the suffragette to bevulnerable, given the controversy this could attract.,external Suffragettes also appear in another part of the game, but attacking them there leads to the failure of the mission.

"Emile Ratelband described himself as a ""young god"" A Dutch ""positivity trainer"" has launched a legal battle to change his age and boost his dating prospects. Emile Ratelband, 69, wants to shift his birthday from 11 March 1949 to 11 March 1969, comparing the change to identifying as being transgender. ""We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?"" he said. A local court in the eastern city of Arnhem is expected to rule on the case within four weeks. However officials were sceptical about the case, believing there was no legal mechanism allowing a person to change their birth date, local reports said. One of the judges wanted to know what would become of the 20 years that Mr Ratelband wanted to erase. ""Who were your parents looking after then? Who was that little boy?"" he was quoted as saying. Mr Ratelband argues he feels discriminated against because of his age, and that it was affecting his employment chances and his success rate on the dating app, Tinder. ""When I'm 69, I am limited. If I'm 49, then I can buy a new house, drive a different car. I can take up more work,"" he said. Mr Ratelband believes changing his age will improve his chances on dating app Tinder ""When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer. When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position."" Mr Ratelband further argued that according to his doctors he has the body of a 45-year-old, and described himself as a ""young god"". He went on Facebook last year to describe how he had made the decision one day standing in front of a mirror, not because he feared getting old but because he wanted to make the most of life for as long as possible.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""That's enough, put down the mic"" The White House has suspended the credentials of CNN's chief White House correspondent hours after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump. Jim Acosta was asking a question at a news conference on Wednesday when a White House worker tried to grab the microphone from his hands. Press secretary Sarah Huckerbee Sanders said access was removed because he had put ""his hands on a young woman"". Mr Acosta called Ms Sanders' claim ""a lie"",external. President Trump had been giving his response to the mid-term elections, which saw his Republican party lose control of the lower house of Congress but gain seats in the upper house. During a question-and-answer session, Mr Acosta challenged Mr Trump's use of the word ""invasion"" to describea migrant caravan heading to the US from Central America. He also challenged him over an anti-immigration advert that was widely seen as racist. When Mr Acosta tried to ask a question about the Russia investigation into alleged interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr Trump told him repeatedly ""that's enough"" and ""put down the mic"". This video can not be played Trump v Acosta A female staff member attempted to take the microphone from the journalist, and Mr Acosta resisted handing it over telling her at one point ""pardon me ma'am"". Mr Trump walked away from the podium and returned to say: ""CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person."" He added: ""The way you treat Sarah Huckerbee is horrible,"" without explaining why. Another journalist spoke up in Mr Acosta's defence, calling him a ""diligent reporter"". Mr Trump fired back, ""well I'm not a big fan of yours either,"" sparking laughter from members of the audience. Ms Sanders, in a statementposted in a Twitter thread,external, said the White House would ""never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job"". ""The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it's an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this Administration,"" she said. ""As a result of today's incident, the White House is suspending the hard pass of the reporter involved until further notice."" The press secretary later shared a zoomed in clip of the incident,external, which observers say is adoctored video originally posted by right-wing conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson,external. Mr Acosta posted a tweet saying he was stopped by the Secret Service from entering White House grounds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Children watch Andy Pandy in 1950 More than 7,000 people still watch TV in black and white more than half a century after colour broadcasts began. London has the most TV licences for black and white sets at 1,768, followed by 431 in the West Midlands and 390 in Greater Manchester. A total of 7,161 UK households have failed to start watching in colour despite transmissions starting in 1967. BBC2 was the first channel to regularly broadcast in colour from July that year with the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The number of black and white licences has almost halved in the past five years and is down from 212,000 in 2000. The figures were released by TV Licensing in what appears to be a reminder that anyone watching television must by law have a TV licence. Spokesman Jason Hill said: ""Whether you watch EastEnders, Strictly or Question Time in black and white on a 50-year-old TV set, or in colour on a tablet, you need to be covered by a TV licence to watch or record programmes as they are broadcast. ""You also need to be covered by a TV licence to download or watch BBC programmes on iPlayer, on any device."" Why we still love our black and white TVs Last month the organisation said more than 26,000 young people aged 18 to 25 werecaught watching live TV or BBC iPlayer without a TV licence,externalin the past year. That was despite 92% of students knowing a licence is required to catch up on their favourite shows. A black and white licence has one distinct advantage over its colour equivalent:it is a third of the price,externalat Â£50.50 a year compared with Â£150.50. Neither does TV Licensing carry out checks of households claiming to watch a black and white set. ""It's entirely done on trust,"" a spokesperson said. Television and radio technology historian Jeffrey Borinsky said collectors like him still have numerous black and white TVs. ""Who wants all this new-fangled 4K Ultra HD, satellite dishes or a screen that's bigger than your room when you can have glorious black and white TV?"" he asked. ""Thirty years ago, you could still buy black and white TVs, mainly small portables, for as little as Â£50 and it's interesting to know that some people still have them."" It is no longer possible to buy a new black and white set, though many are still offered for sale on sites such as Gumtree and eBay.

"This video can not be played Jason Coffman: The last thing I said was 'Son, I love you."" A US Marine Corps veteran with suspected mental health issues killed 12 people in a busy bar in California, including a policeman, officials say. The shooting began at 23:20 local time on Wednesday in Thousand Oaks about 40 miles (65km) north-west of Los Angeles. At least 200 people were reportedly inside the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was hosting a student line-dancing night. Police named the suspect as 28-year-old Ian David Long. Earlier this year, police mental health professionals cleared him after he was found behaving ""irrationally"" at his home, said authorities. The suspect had served in the US Marines and fought in Afghanistan Police say the suspect was dressed in black, and forced his way into the bar after shooting the bouncer. A college country music night was under way when the suspect apparently threw a smoke grenade before opening fire, witnesses say. Police say he used a legally owned .45 calibre Glock semi-automatic handgun, which had an extended magazine that is illegal in the state of California. The extended magazine allowed the gun to carry more than its typical 11-bullet capacity. Police say they do not yet know how many shots were fired, or whether the gunman reloaded during the attack. Thousand Oaks: Who are the victims? Is there a link between mass shootings and mental illness? Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? One witness, Teylor Whittler, who was celebrating a friend's 21st birthday, said: ""I was on the dance floor and I heard the gunshots, so I looked back and then all of a sudden everyone screamed: 'Get Down!' ""It was a huge panic, everyone got up, I was trampled, I was kind of left on the floor until some guy came behind me and grabbed me and dragged me out."" People escaped the bar by using chairs to break windows, while others reportedly sheltered inside the venue's toilets. The night is popular among the area's local university students At least 10 people are known to have been wounded and others are self-reporting with injuries at local hospitals. One survivor said he and his friends also escaped death last year in the deadliest US mass shooting of modern times, when a gunman killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music concert. Nicholas Champion told CBS News: ""We're all a big family and unfortunately this family got hit twice."" Popular among students, the bar is close to California Lutheran University, Pepperdine University and Moorpark College.

At the Borderline Bar and Grill survivors huddled together in the darkness, shivering in the clothes they had been wearing in the warm, friendly bar. Many of the patrons were regulars who had come to enjoy country music and dance together.

Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean described the scene inside the bar as ""horrific"" and said there was ""blood everywhere"". He said first responders arrived less than three minutes after the first emergency calls from the venue were made. Ventura Sheriff's Sergeant Ron Helus, who later died in hospital, tried to enter the active scene with a local highway patrolman when he was shot several times. Sgt Ron Helus was one of the first officers on the scene The husband and father-of-one had been a policeman for 29 years and was a professional firearms instructor. He was due to retire next year.

"This video can not be played Sainsbury's Mike Coupe tells BBC Breakfast food ""can't be stockpiled"" for a no-deal Brexit Half-year results at Sainsbury's have been boosted by its takeover of catalogue retailer Argos. Cost savings improved profits, while adding Argos outlets to Sainsbury's stores was ""driving an increase in trading intensity"", the retailer said. Sainsbury's, which plans to merge with rival Asda, said half-year underlying profits rose by a fifth to Â£302m. However, when a host of exceptional costs are taken into account, profits nearly halved. The UK's second-largest supermarket said pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to 22 September were Â£132m, compared with Â£220m a year earlier. Profits were hit by costs related to restructuring store management teams, the Argos integration and preparation for the Asda deal, which is still being considered by the competition watchdog. Aldi and Lidl part of Sainsbury-Asda probe Store sales threat over Sainsbury-Asda deal Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Like-for-like sales growth for the period - which strips out the impact of new stores - was 0.6%, which disappointed analysts. Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said the grocery market remained ""extremely competitive"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's a pleasing set of results against a difficult market backdrop, largely driven by the acquisition synergies from the Argos business."" Mr Coupe said Brexit posed a challenge, since 30% of the goods that Sainsbury's sold came from the EU. He urged the government to ""get to a settlement"" with the EU, but added: ""I'm a pragmatist and I believe that one way or another, an agreement will be arrived at."" He also admitted that availability of stock had been ""bumpy"" in early summer, but had now returned to normal. By Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent The big game changer for Sainsbury's is its proposed merger with Asda. The fate of this controversial megadeal is now being decided by the Competition and Markets Authority and a decision is expected early in the year. Chief executive Mike Coupe says he is confident in the company's future with or without the Asda deal. Sainsbury's divided opinion when it announced the Argos deal, but that now looks to have been a pretty smart move. Despite a good summer for the supermarkets, grocery sales at Sainsbury's still lag behind its rivals, according to industry figures. It's got a lot of plates to keep spinning now retailers are into the most important trading period of the year. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: ""The purchase of Argos has been a well-crafted tactical decision to draw greater footfall into its stores and reduce cost savings measures, with 90 Argos units expected to be opened in stores this financial year. ""However, there is still uncertainty around its merger with Asda, with the regulators yet to give the thumbs-up to the deal."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Argos is proving to be an ace up the sleeve for Sainsbury's in a tough retail environment. ""The World Cup and barbecue weather over the summer provided a welcome shot in the arm for the supermarket, though without this seasonal stimulus, sales growth from existing outlets wouldn't look great."" He praised Sainsbury's decision to fill excess supermarket space with Argos outlets, calling it ""a pretty canny move when you consider that many consumers will like the idea of combining their Christmas grocery shop with picking up some gifts from Argos at the same time"".

"This video can not be played Staff applauded as Mr Sessions left the Department of Justice US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been fired by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump had criticised his top law official for months, mainly over his refusal to oversee the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in favour of Mr Trump's election in 2016. Mr Sessions's chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who has criticised the inquiry, will take over temporarily. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Mueller's wide-ranging investigation has resulted in a series of criminal charges against several Trump associates. Trump fires Sessions - is Mueller next?

In a resignation letter, Mr Sessions - a former Alabama senator who was an early supporter of Mr Trump - made clear the decision to go was not his own.

This video can not be played Relations between Trump and Sessions soured in 2017 ""Clearly, the president has something to hide,"" oppositionDemocratic party Senate leader Chuck Schumer said,external. ""Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general."" Mr Trump has repeatedly pilloried his top law enforcement official since Mr Sessions stepped aside from the Russia inquiry in March 2017. In July 2017 Mr Trump told the New York Times: ""Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else."" Mr Sessions voluntarily removed himself from the probe after Democrats accused him of failing to disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing. The attorney general later said he had forgotten about those meetings, which happened during the Trump election campaign. Mr Trump has at various times belittled Mr Sessions as ""VERY weak"" and ""DISGRACEFUL"". This video can not be played President Trump: ""This is a hot White House"" Matthew Whitaker can now assume control of the Mueller inquiry, which has been under the control of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until now. The president cannot directly fire the special counsel, whose investigation Mr Trump has repeatedly decried as a witch hunt. But Mr Sessions's replacement will have the power to fire Mr Mueller or end the inquiry. Mr Whitaker has not shied away from sharing his concerns over the investigation. For example, in August 2017,he wrote a piece for CNN in which he stated that looking into Mr Trump's personal finances, or those of his family, ""goes beyond the scope,externalof the appointment of the special counsel"". He went on to call on Mr Rosenstein to ""order Mueller to limit the scope of the investigation"" or risk the inquiry starting ""to look like a political fishing expedition"". It was the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr Mueller to lead the Russia inquiry, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017. The special counsel's probe has also been investigating whether Mr Comey's firing amounted to attempted obstruction of justice. There has also been a question mark over Mr Rosenstein's future since it was reported he had discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Trump. Top US official denies plot to oust Trump Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington The presidential axe that had been hovering over Jeff Sessions for what has seemed like an eternity just came swinging down with a thud. Donald Trump had previously said he would wait until after the mid-term elections to decide his attorney general's fate, and he did - but just barely. And like that the duties of overseeing Robert Mueller's Russia investigation shift from the man who appointed the special counsel, Rod Rosenstein, to a man who has been a critic of it, Department of Justice Chief of Staff Matthew Whitaker. In an opinion piece forThe Hill,externalbefore he took the Department of Justice job, Mr Whitaker wrote that calls for an as yet-to-be-named independent prosecutor would be ""just craven attempts to score cheap political points"". In April 2017, he wrote for CNN that any Mueller investigation into the president's finances would be ""going too far"",external. What happens next is critical. Mr Mueller's inquiry could continue unabated - although the special counsel must surely be considering tightening his timeline. There is also the possibility, however, that this is just the opening move of a White House effort to shut down the probe or keep its findings out of the public eye. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Jason Coffman: The last thing I said was 'Son, I love you."" A US Marine Corps veteran with suspected mental health issues killed 12 people in a busy bar in California, including a policeman, officials say. The shooting began at 23:20 local time on Wednesday in Thousand Oaks about 40 miles (65km) north-west of Los Angeles. At least 200 people were reportedly inside the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was hosting a student line-dancing night. Police named the suspect as 28-year-old Ian David Long. Earlier this year, police mental health professionals cleared him after he was found behaving ""irrationally"" at his home, said authorities. The suspect had served in the US Marines and fought in Afghanistan Police say the suspect was dressed in black, and forced his way into the bar after shooting the bouncer. A college country music night was under way when the suspect apparently threw a smoke grenade before opening fire, witnesses say. Police say he used a legally owned .45 calibre Glock semi-automatic handgun, which had an extended magazine that is illegal in the state of California. The extended magazine allowed the gun to carry more than its typical 11-bullet capacity. Police say they do not yet know how many shots were fired, or whether the gunman reloaded during the attack. Thousand Oaks: Who are the victims? Is there a link between mass shootings and mental illness? Why are US mass shootings getting more deadly? One witness, Teylor Whittler, who was celebrating a friend's 21st birthday, said: ""I was on the dance floor and I heard the gunshots, so I looked back and then all of a sudden everyone screamed: 'Get Down!' ""It was a huge panic, everyone got up, I was trampled, I was kind of left on the floor until some guy came behind me and grabbed me and dragged me out."" People escaped the bar by using chairs to break windows, while others reportedly sheltered inside the venue's toilets. The night is popular among the area's local university students At least 10 people are known to have been wounded and others are self-reporting with injuries at local hospitals. One survivor said he and his friends also escaped death last year in the deadliest US mass shooting of modern times, when a gunman killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music concert. Nicholas Champion told CBS News: ""We're all a big family and unfortunately this family got hit twice."" Popular among students, the bar is close to California Lutheran University, Pepperdine University and Moorpark College. By James Cook,BBC News,Thousand Oaks For the United States, this is the nightmare that never ends. The names of countless schools, churches, colleges and even entire cities have become synonymous with mass murder. To the list of Las Vegas, Orlando, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Sutherland Springs and Parkland we now add Thousand Oaks. At the Borderline Bar and Grill survivors huddled together in the darkness, shivering in the clothes they had been wearing in the warm, friendly bar. Many of the patrons were regulars who had come to enjoy country music and dance together. The mood among the little groups of friends was one of shock and despair - but what was absent was a sense of surprise. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean described the scene inside the bar as ""horrific"" and said there was ""blood everywhere"". He said first responders arrived less than three minutes after the first emergency calls from the venue were made. Ventura Sheriff's Sergeant Ron Helus, who later died in hospital, tried to enter the active scene with a local highway patrolman when he was shot several times. Sgt Ron Helus was one of the first officers on the scene The husband and father-of-one had been a policeman for 29 years and was a professional firearms instructor. He was due to retire next year. ""It saddens us all and tears at our emotions,"" the sheriff said. ""He died a hero. He went in to save lives, to save other people."" America's gun culture in 10 charts Four key dates that shaped the US gun debate Sheriff Dean, who on Thursday completes his last day serving as Ventura County sheriff, warned: ""It doesn't matter how safe your community is, it doesn't matter how low your crime rate is - there are people who just don't think properly everywhere, I don't care where you are, and they commit horrific acts like this. This video can not be played Survivors of California shooting describe what they saw. ""There's no way to process. There's no way to make sense out of the senseless."" President Donald Trump issued a proclamation ordering flags to be lowered halfway at the White House and all public and military buildings to commemorate victims of the ""terrible"" attack.

Police say they have had several minor contacts with Long in recent years, including in April 2018 when they were called to his house after a report of a disturbance. During talks with police, he appeared ""somewhat irate, acting a little irrationally"", the sheriff said. A police crisis intervention team interviewed him, and determined that it was not necessary to hold him against his will in a mental health facility.

"This video can not be played Staff applauded as Mr Sessions left the Department of Justice US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been fired by President Donald Trump. Mr Trump had criticised his top law official for months, mainly over his refusal to oversee the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in favour of Mr Trump's election in 2016. Mr Sessions's chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, who has criticised the inquiry, will take over temporarily. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Mueller's wide-ranging investigation has resulted in a series of criminal charges against several Trump associates. Trump fires Sessions - is Mueller next?

In a resignation letter, Mr Sessions - a former Alabama senator who was an early supporter of Mr Trump - made clear the decision to go was not his own.

The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words All you need to know about Trump Russia story ""Most importantly, in my time as attorney general, we have restored and upheld the rule of law,"" Mr Sessions added, while thanking the Republican president. ""We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well!"" Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. This video can not be played Relations between Trump and Sessions soured in 2017 ""Clearly, the president has something to hide,"" oppositionDemocratic party Senate leader Chuck Schumer said,external. ""Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general."" Mr Trump has repeatedly pilloried his top law enforcement official since Mr Sessions stepped aside from the Russia inquiry in March 2017. In July 2017 Mr Trump told the New York Times: ""Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else."" Mr Sessions voluntarily removed himself from the probe after Democrats accused him of failing to disclose contacts with the Russian ambassador during his Senate confirmation hearing. The attorney general later said he had forgotten about those meetings, which happened during the Trump election campaign. Mr Trump has at various times belittled Mr Sessions as ""VERY weak"" and ""DISGRACEFUL"". This video can not be played President Trump: ""This is a hot White House"" Matthew Whitaker can now assume control of the Mueller inquiry, which has been under the control of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein until now. The president cannot directly fire the special counsel, whose investigation Mr Trump has repeatedly decried as a witch hunt. But Mr Sessions's replacement will have the power to fire Mr Mueller or end the inquiry. Mr Whitaker has not shied away from sharing his concerns over the investigation. For example, in August 2017,he wrote a piece for CNN in which he stated that looking into Mr Trump's personal finances, or those of his family, ""goes beyond the scope,externalof the appointment of the special counsel"". He went on to call on Mr Rosenstein to ""order Mueller to limit the scope of the investigation"" or risk the inquiry starting ""to look like a political fishing expedition"". It was the deputy attorney general who appointed Mr Mueller to lead the Russia inquiry, after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017. The special counsel's probe has also been investigating whether Mr Comey's firing amounted to attempted obstruction of justice. There has also been a question mark over Mr Rosenstein's future since it was reported he had discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Trump. Top US official denies plot to oust Trump Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington The presidential axe that had been hovering over Jeff Sessions for what has seemed like an eternity just came swinging down with a thud. Donald Trump had previously said he would wait until after the mid-term elections to decide his attorney general's fate, and he did - but just barely. And like that the duties of overseeing Robert Mueller's Russia investigation shift from the man who appointed the special counsel, Rod Rosenstein, to a man who has been a critic of it, Department of Justice Chief of Staff Matthew Whitaker. In an opinion piece forThe Hill,externalbefore he took the Department of Justice job, Mr Whitaker wrote that calls for an as yet-to-be-named independent prosecutor would be ""just craven attempts to score cheap political points"". In April 2017, he wrote for CNN that any Mueller investigation into the president's finances would be ""going too far"",external. What happens next is critical. Mr Mueller's inquiry could continue unabated - although the special counsel must surely be considering tightening his timeline. There is also the possibility, however, that this is just the opening move of a White House effort to shut down the probe or keep its findings out of the public eye. Allow Twitter content?

"The parents were told they had to be supervised at all times when visiting their dying son A dying baby's parents were given limited time to spend with him in his last few weeks of life due to failings by social workers. Strict supervision orders were placed on the couple by York City Council amid a safeguarding investigation. It meant the couple, who were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, were only able to spend time with their son when other people were present. The council apologised and has paid the family Â£2,000 for the distress caused. When the baby, who had a range of health conditions, was taken to hospital with breathing difficulties, a doctor noted injuries to his ribs. The family said these could have been caused by invasive, physical and medical interventions during a previous hospital stay. But because of the injuries, social workers began a safeguarding investigation and interim care orders were issued for their two other children to be looked after by grandparents. When visiting their son in hospital, the parents had to be supervised at all times, either by other relatives or nursing staff, who were not always available to do so. It meant that on one day they could not see their son at all and on others, they only had a few hours with him. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire An investigation by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman Michael King found that even when their son's condition deteriorated, social workers did not relax instructions despite the council stating that the risk of any harm to the baby was low. At no point did a social worker go to the hospital to see the situation for themselves, the report said. Ombudsman Michael King criticised the council for taking nearly a year to respond to the family's complaint about the situation Mr King said although the council could not be criticised for starting action, the care plan did not consider their baby's emotional needs and more should have been done to review the situation. He said: ""This would have been a horrifically stressful time for the family, at a time when their world must have felt like it was falling apart."" Child protection services near crisis as demand rises What's it like to take away a child? At the final court hearing 11 weeks after their son had died, the council withdrew the care order in respect of their other children and said although the baby's injuries were unexplained, they could not be attributed to the parents. The council said it ""apologised unreservedly to the family"" and fully accepted recommendations made by the ombudsman.

"Four people have been found dead after a vehicle broke down in outback Australia, police say. The bodies of two adults, both 19, and their three-year-old son were found near a remote road about 1,000km (620 miles) south of Darwin on Wednesday. Northern Territory Police searching for a 12-year-old boy from the group say they have found the body of a child near the car. The deaths are not being treated as suspicious. Authorities are investigating whether heat may have contributed to the tragedy. The group was last seen leaving Willowra, a small community, on Friday. The adults and toddler were found about 4.5km from the vehicle. ""One of the avenues we are looking at is that they have walked off from a vehicle in extreme weather and may have got caught out,"" Supt Shaun Gill told the ABC. ""Initially we thought it was the result of a car crash, however we are confident it's not."" After an extensive search, police found the body of a child about 120m away from the vehicle late on Thursday. ""A formal identification of the child is yet to be undertaken and as such, police are unable to confirm it is the body of the 12-year-old boy,"" they said in a statement. Police said the alarm had been raised by a man who entered a health clinic in Willowra on Wednesday. ""He will be a critical part of the investigation. He is quite distraught about what he has found,"" said Supt Jody Nobbs. Supt Nobbs said he could not give additional details, nor confirm whether the older boy was related to the family. The search is continuing as police say they cannot confirm whether there were other passengers in the car. Temperatures in the region exceeded 40C in recent days, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The tragedy follows the suspected heat-related deaths of two people in separate incidents in northern Australia within the last two weeks, the ABC reported.

"The parents were told they had to be supervised at all times when visiting their dying son A dying baby's parents were given limited time to spend with him in his last few weeks of life due to failings by social workers. Strict supervision orders were placed on the couple by York City Council amid a safeguarding investigation. It meant the couple, who were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, were only able to spend time with their son when other people were present. The council apologised and has paid the family Â£2,000 for the distress caused. When the baby, who had a range of health conditions, was taken to hospital with breathing difficulties, a doctor noted injuries to his ribs. The family said these could have been caused by invasive, physical and medical interventions during a previous hospital stay. But because of the injuries, social workers began a safeguarding investigation and interim care orders were issued for their two other children to be looked after by grandparents. When visiting their son in hospital, the parents had to be supervised at all times, either by other relatives or nursing staff, who were not always available to do so. It meant that on one day they could not see their son at all and on others, they only had a few hours with him. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire An investigation by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman Michael King found that even when their son's condition deteriorated, social workers did not relax instructions despite the council stating that the risk of any harm to the baby was low. At no point did a social worker go to the hospital to see the situation for themselves, the report said. Ombudsman Michael King criticised the council for taking nearly a year to respond to the family's complaint about the situation Mr King said although the council could not be criticised for starting action, the care plan did not consider their baby's emotional needs and more should have been done to review the situation. He said: ""This would have been a horrifically stressful time for the family, at a time when their world must have felt like it was falling apart."" Child protection services near crisis as demand rises What's it like to take away a child? At the final court hearing 11 weeks after their son had died, the council withdrew the care order in respect of their other children and said although the baby's injuries were unexplained, they could not be attributed to the parents. The council said it ""apologised unreservedly to the family"" and fully accepted recommendations made by the ombudsman.

"Women who smoke, have diabetes or high blood pressure increase their risk of a heart attack more than men faced with the same risks, a large study of UK adults has found. The researchers, writing in the BMJ, said women should receive the same treatments as men and be offered support to stop smoking. Doctors should also be better at spotting female patients at risk. Men are still three times more likely than women to have a heart attack. The study, led by Oxford University researchers, tracked nearly 500,000 people aged 40-69,externalenrolled in the UK Biobank database. Over seven years, 5,081 people had their first heart attack and one in three of them were women. Although the risk of having a heart attack is lower in women than in men of all ages, certain risk factors appeared to have a greater impact on women. Do you know your heart age? Waist size 'bigger heart risk in women' Women doctors 'best for female heart patients' Women who smoked were three times more likely to have a heart attack than women who did not smoke - but in men, smoking only doubled their risk. High blood pressure increased a woman's risk by an extra 83% relative to its effect in a man. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes both had a greater impact on the heart attack risk of women compared to men, the study found. The researchers say they do not know why these factors are sex-specific, and no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, but they do have some theories. Biological factors may be a reason. For example, type 2 diabetes, which is usually linked to poor diet and lifestyle factors, may have a different impact on the female heart to the male one. But the study says women often don't realise they are at risk of heart disease and they may also be on the receiving end of poorer care and treatment from doctors. In an accompanying editorial, the researchers say men may be more prone to heart attacks, but heart disease is the biggest killer of women in the UK. chest pain - a sensation of pressure, tightness or squeezing in the centre of your chest pain in other parts of the body - it can feel as if the pain is travelling from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm is affected, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and abdomen feeling lightheaded or dizzy sweating shortness of breath feeling or being sick overwhelming sense of anxiety (similar to having a panic attack) coughing or wheezing Although the chest pain is often severe, some people may feel only minor pain, similar to indigestion. In some cases, there may not be any chest pain at all, especially in women, the elderly and people with diabetes. Source: NHS Choices,external Dr Elizabeth Millett, lead study author and an epidemiologist at the George Institute for Global Health, University of Oxford, said: ""Heart disease also affects women and this needs to be recognised. ""Women need to be aware they're at risk, but despite lots of campaigns, it's still under the radar of most women. ""It's a complicated, long-term thing to work out, probably caused by a combination of factors - both biological and social,"" she said. She said, in the future, with an ageing population, women could start to have a similar overall rate of heart attacks to men. And the authors said women with diabetes, high blood pressure and who smoke, ""should be considered at a level of risk comparable to many men"".

"The children's commissioner for England is calling on internet giants and toy-makers to be more transparent about the data they are collecting on children. Today's children are the first to be ""datafied"" from birth and little thought has been given to the consequences, a report for her says. Who Knows What about Me?,externalcalls for a statutory duty of care between social media giants and their younger users. And it urges the government to consider strengthening data protection laws. The report also highlights how very young children are now using toys that are connected to the internet. These gather personal messages and information that may be insecure and open to attack from hackers, it says. The report quotes research led by Sonia Livingstone, who describes children as the ""canary in the coal mine for wider society"" - the first to encounter new technology and its risks before many adults are even aware of them. It says: children should be taught in schools about how their data is collected and for what purposes where a toy collects any video or audio generated by a child, this should be made explicit in a prominent part of the packaging or its accompanying information using language children understand, companies should explain clearly in their terms and conditions what data is collected and how it will be used The report estimates: between the ages of 11 and 16, children post on social media 26 times a day, on average by the time they reach adulthood, they are likely to have posted 70,000 times by the age of 13, a child's parents will have posted on average 1,300 photos and videos of them to social media There is also: the data gathered when children use the internet tracking devices and apps used by parents to keep tabs on their offspring the biometric data held by public bodies such as schools and the NHS The report warns that there could be risks to young people where profiling of internet usage is utilised in areas of life where it can have deeper ramifications, such as the judicial system or the education system. One worrying scenario it gives is if a health insurance company used information posted by a child on social media about their mental health as part of its decision on whether to issue a policy or how much to charge. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said: ""We need to stop and think about what this means for children's lives now and how it may impact on their future lives as adults. ""We simply do not know what the consequences of all this information about our children will be. ""Companies that make apps, toys and other products used by children need to stop filling them with trackers and put their terms and conditions in language that children understand. ""And crucially the government needs to monitor the situation and refine data protection legislation if needed, so that children are genuinely protected - especially as technology develops.""

"Pictured in 1987, Tynemouth Station was looking tatty and uncared for Since the heritage ""at risk"" register launched 20 years ago, more than two thirds of the original entries have been saved. But while hundreds are removed from Historic England's list each year,nearly as many are added,external. Which sites count as success stories - and which remain in danger? Pictured in 2008, the Midland reopened as a four-star hotel and since 2013 has hosted an annual ""Vintage by the Sea"" festival The Midland Hotel opened on the seafront at Morecambe in 1933 and is believed to be the UK's first Art Deco hotel. The London Midland and Scottish Railway spent the princely sum of Â£72,000 to build a hotel capable of coping with the booming number of tourists to the Lancashire resort. Architect Oliver Hill was given the brief of ""a building of international quality in the modern style"". He came up with a three-storey, curved structure that allowed every room to have good sea views. During its heyday, theatre stars performing at the nearby Winter Gardens, such as George Formby, Jimmy Clitheroe and Billy Bennett, were guests and parties were reputed to go on through the night. Pictured shortly after its opening in 1933, the Midland is thought to be the UK's first Art Deco hotel The outbreak of World War Two gave the Midland a new role - as a military hospital. On the ground floor the dining room became a large ward with about 40 beds, while the circular cafÃ© was adapted into a physiotherapy centre. Two upstairs suites were turned into operating theatres and there were also X-ray facilities, a dental surgery and a dispensary. After the war, the hotel changed hands a number of times, underwent unsympathetic refurbishment and fell victim to financial mismanagement. It closed and fell into disrepair and was on the original at risk register in 1998. However, the redevelopment company Urban Splash spent Â£11m restoring its original features, including the grand staircase. It is now officially saved. Pictured in 1999, the Midland was run down and neglected In Victorian times, people would travel to Tynemouth station just to see its famous foliage The extravaganza of Victorian ironwork that is Tynemouth station, in Tyne and Wear, was opened in 1882. It was added to the register in 2004 and removed in 2012 after the owners and Historic England provided cash for its renovation. Once decorated with a rich display of flora, the station was a destination in itself. However, the rise of the motorcar alongside more people going abroad on holiday contributed to its decline. Although it has always remained a working station, the structure began to show a lack of care, as paint peeled from the metalwork and the glass canopies became dirty and cracked. But a Â£3.68m restoration, which included fitting 4,600 new panes of glass, returned it to its former glory. A weekend market is now held on the station concourse and displays of artwork are regularly seen in the central section of the bridge and hanging from the roof area. The station concourse is also used as an events area during the annual Mouth of the Tyne Festival. The project won the Historic England Angel Award for Best Craftsmanship on a Heritage Rescue for 2012. Following its restoration, Tynemouth station is shiny, clean and off the heritage danger list The gatehouse, pictured in 1912, is said to be where Robin Hood died The timber-framed Kirklees Priory Gatehouse in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, had been on the register since 1998 but following repairs funded by Historic England, it was removed last year. Although most of it was built in the early 16th Century, parts of its timber framing came from a medieval nunnery founded on the site during the reign of Henry II (1154-89). A favourite haunt of Charlotte BrontÃ«, it is also claimed to be where Robin Hood died. Folklore suggests the prioress was his aunt and she sheltered him when he fled from the Sheriff of Nottingham. Another version of the story is that in old age Robin Hood fell ill and went to visit his cousin (rather than aunt) the prioress, so that he could be bled and restored to health. However, his cousin conspired with her lover, Sir Roger of Doncaster, to kill Robin. So she opened a vein, locked Robin in the upper room of the gatehouse, and let him bleed to death. It's also said that he decided his own burial site by shooting an arrow from his deathbed in the gatehouse. The arrow, somewhat implausibly, flew more than a mile. But still, that's where his grave is. Robin Hood is said to have died in one of the upstairs rooms at Kirklees Priory Gatehouse Pictured in 1905, the roundhouse was built by a team including George and Robert Stephenson Strictly speaking, the Roundhouse in Derby is a hexadecagon, but we won't quibble. Built in 1839 by four rival rail companies, the huge 16-sided engine repair shed is known to be the earliest railway roundhouse in the world. One of the companies that built it was the North Midland Railway, where George Stephenson and his son Robert were engineers. Robert was the engineering brain behind the roundhouse, which was built for the sum of Â£62,000 and included a 12-metre engine turntable. But the entire Derby Railway works complex became redundant and it was added to the at risk register in 1998, where it remained until 2009. A project beginning in 2008 restored and updated the site. The original turntable has been kept in the renovated building as an example of manufacturing and railway heritage. Both the roundhouse and the nearby engine sheds were converted into a venue for Derby College, and the space has been used for a variety of functions, including as a location for the TV programme  Antiques Roadshow, the BBC Spending Review, and Ultra White-Collar Boxing. Sadly not all at the same time. The Roundhouse in Derby is now used to host a variety of functions The Kasbah Conservation Area in Grimsby was given listed status in 2017 and added to the at risk list this year For all the success stories, there are 5,160 entries on the 2018 at risk register. While that is 94 fewer than last year, there remains much to be done to preserve some of the country's historical sites. Added to the latest at risk list is the Kasbah area in Grimsby, a year after it was designated a Conservation Area. Grimsby was once home to the UK's largest fishing trawler fleet, but the fishing industry has been in decline for several decades. Most of the fish at the town's daily auction are now caught by crews from the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. David Bowie 1983: An intimate portrait The place where street art found a home The woman who gave birth to rabbits The town's ""traditionally smoked fish"" has been cured in the Kasbah smokehouses since the mid 19th Century, However, only a handful now exist in the area, which has become rundown. Its owner, Associated British Ports, along with North East Lincolnshire Council and Historic England, are trying to attract funding for a repair programme. The site's owners are trying to attract investment to revitalise the area The original HMS Invincible ran aground off Portsmouth in 1758 The wreck of HMS Invincible lies on Horse and Dean Sand off Portsmouth. The wooden sailing vessel capsized while departing for Louisburg in Canada in 1758 and the wreck was discovered by a fisherman in 1979. The ship was built in 1744 and captured from the French in 1747 at Cape Finisterre, whereupon it was taken into the Royal Navy. It was the first to bear the name Invincible. Sandglasses, a bronze adze and cooper's setter used to open barrels, and cartridge cases have been recovered from the site as have army buttons from 13 different regiments. Some cannon lie 200 metres to the south, confirming that the quarterdeck cannon were jettisoned when the vessel got into difficulty. Storms and shifting sands have left the site vulnerable to biological and physical decay. Historic England placed it on the risk register in 2012, and ongoing work to conserve and record the artefacts is being carried out by the Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust, along with Bournemouth University. A well-preserved gunpowder barrel was retrieved from the seafloor near the Invincible The site of the Battle of Newburn Ford has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development King Charles I's attempt to impose a new prayer book on the Scots led to military conflict in the summer of 1640, and the Battle of Newburn Ford, Newcastle upon Tyne, was the only battle of the Second Bishops' War. The Scottish Army took Newcastle by defeating the English, forcing Charles I to pay them off. This expense meant Charles had to recall Parliament, which proved to be a critical step towards the English Civil War. The battlefield has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development but an outline action plan has been agreed between Historic England, the local authorities and the Battlefields Trust. The area is heavily industrialised, yet areas of historical and natural heritage interest are numerous. Standing at either end of Newburn Bridge provides a good view of the land over which the battle took place.

"Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May have not always seen eye to eye on Brexit The UK and France will remain ""tied by bonds of friendship"" for decades after Brexit, Jeremy Hunt has said. The foreign secretary lauded the cross-channel relationship as ""one of competition, co-operation, similarity and difference"" in a speech in Paris. Officials said the visit was aimed at showing the friendship between the two nations was ""bigger than Brexit"". But there are warnings intelligence-sharing may be damaged if a framework is not set up to mitigate the risks. A report by a joint UK-French task force whose members include former Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson and ex-French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said co-operation in cyber security and counter-terrorism could be imperilled if the UK leaves in March without an overarching agreement. The Brexit process is at a critical phase amid reports Theresa May may seek the approval of her cabinet within days to sign up to an agreement on the terms of the UK's' withdrawal. Davis: May will probably lose Brexit vote Ministers invited to read draft EU deal Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? Mr Hunt is one of a group of leading ministers reported to be insisting on seeing legal advice in full on the conditions of any agreement on the Irish border and how a so-called backstop arrangement - of the UK staying in a customs union to avoid the need for a visible Northern Ireland border - would work. After his speech Mr Hunt was asked about the legal advice. He said: ""We have an excellent attorney general and he is giving very good legal advice on everything that we are considering signing up to, so we are going into this with our eyes open"". ""That's very important because the Withdrawal Agreement is a legal document so we need to understand all the legal implications - and of course ultimately whatever the Cabinet decide to endorse will come before parliament and all these issues will be debated in full."" He was also asked if the UK and the EU were likely to agree a deal in the next three weeks, replying:  ""We are in the final phase and I think it is possible to be optimistic about the fact that we are essentially down to a couple of big issues... we are focusing all our efforts on those two issues but  I think it's entirely possible to reach an agreement and everyone wants to do that."" Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was the biggest decision the cabinet and Parliament will have to make, so they should be given the full legal advice. Mr Davis said that he believed that if it was left to the EU to decide when the temporary backstop ended it would ""never happen"". He predicted that the emerging Brexit deal would not be backed by MPs - although he told Today a defeat in the Commons would be likely to lead to the two sides hammering out what he called a better deal. However he insisted that if there was no deal, the UK was a ""big country"" able to ""look after ourselves"" and had hundreds of plans prepared, although there would be some ""hiccups over the first year"". France has taken an uncompromising line on Brexit, with its President Emmanuel Macron lashing out at the UK at a summit in Austria in September, saying its exit could not be allowed to undermine European unity. But French industries also sense an opportunity to lure jobs from London, particularly in the financial services, after the UK leaves. Uncertainty has surrounded bilateral Anglo-French immigration agreements after Brexit although the UK has made it clear it wants these to continue, along with the two countries' advanced defence co-operation. In his speech, delivered in French, Mr Hunt hailed what he said had been nearly 200 years of cross-channel co-operation. The two countries 'bled together', Mr Hunt will say, as events take place to mark the centenary of the end of World War One He paid tribute to Anglo-French solidarity, which he said was encapsulated by France's emphatic response to the poisonings of the Skripals in Salisbury earlier this year and last year's terror attacks in London. ""We will never forget the moment after the Manchester attack when President Macron walked from the Elysee Palace to the British Embassy to express France's solidarity,"" he said. ""And the crowd at the Stade de France sang the British national anthem - nor, when, after the Bataclan attack, the crowd at Wembley sang the Marseillaise."" Ahead of the centenary of the end of World War One on Sunday, Mr Hunt said the two countries' destinies were ""yoked together"" by the conflict ""in which we fought and bled side by side for over four years"". The foreign secretary is also holding talks with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on defence, national security and cyber-security. The meeting comes amid calls for the two largest military powers in Europe to step up their co-operation by consolidating a series of bilateral agreements in place since 2010. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said Whitehall officials were insisting intelligence sharing exists outside the framework of the EU and they expect it to survive the upheaval of Brexit.

"Emile Ratelband described himself as a ""young god"" A Dutch ""positivity trainer"" has launched a legal battle to change his age and boost his dating prospects. Emile Ratelband, 69, wants to shift his birthday from 11 March 1949 to 11 March 1969, comparing the change to identifying as being transgender. ""We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?"" he said. A local court in the eastern city of Arnhem is expected to rule on the case within four weeks. However officials were sceptical about the case, believing there was no legal mechanism allowing a person to change their birth date, local reports said. One of the judges wanted to know what would become of the 20 years that Mr Ratelband wanted to erase. ""Who were your parents looking after then? Who was that little boy?"" he was quoted as saying. Mr Ratelband argues he feels discriminated against because of his age, and that it was affecting his employment chances and his success rate on the dating app, Tinder. ""When I'm 69, I am limited. If I'm 49, then I can buy a new house, drive a different car. I can take up more work,"" he said. Mr Ratelband believes changing his age will improve his chances on dating app Tinder ""When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer. When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position."" Mr Ratelband further argued that according to his doctors he has the body of a 45-year-old, and described himself as a ""young god"". He went on Facebook last year to describe how he had made the decision one day standing in front of a mirror, not because he feared getting old but because he wanted to make the most of life for as long as possible. Man, 67, denied job because of age bias 'Bored stiff' man, 91, retires at last He also said he would renounce his pension if he switched his birth date. The Netherlands' constitution expressly prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of age,external. Mr Ratelband, a media personality and motivational guru, converted to Buddhism earlier this year and is a trainer in neurolinguistic programming.

"This video can not be played Prince Charles says it would be ""nonsense"" to think he could campaign publicly as king The Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is ""not that stupid"". He has campaigned on issues such as the environment for decades but says he would not do the same as monarch. Speaking in a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Prince Charles said the idea that he would continue making interventions was ""nonsense"". He said he would have to operate within ""constitutional parameters"". In the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people have described as ""meddling"". Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the royal for 12 months, said Prince Charles ""bridled a bit"" at the use of the word ""meddling"" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as ""motivating"". The heir to the throne said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."" The Duchess of Cornwall said Prince Charles had a passion to help He said the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate. ""It's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two,"" he said. Prince Charles 'made me pick up litter' Â£5 coin marks Prince Charles' 70th birthday Prince Charles in a land of princes Prince Charles toasts baby news ""So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir. ""But the idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different."" Asked whether his public campaigning would continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid."" BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy. He said: ""The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn."" By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent He has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, ""to make a difference"". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others. It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to hisheartfelt ""black spider"" handwritten lettersraising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention. It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop? Prince Charles alongside his grandson Prince George Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his ""campaigning"". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother. However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king. ""You operate,"" he says in the BBC documentary, ""within the constitutional parameters."" It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power. Architecture In 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a ""vast municipal fire station"" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a ""monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend"". Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: ""I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness."" Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: ""Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic."" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: ""The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. ""It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat."" Wildlife conservation Prince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns. In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left."" Homeopathy Prince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself. In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy. Clarence House later said: ""Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics.""

"Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May have not always seen eye to eye on Brexit The UK and France will remain ""tied by bonds of friendship"" for decades after Brexit, Jeremy Hunt has said. The foreign secretary lauded the cross-channel relationship as ""one of competition, co-operation, similarity and difference"" in a speech in Paris. Officials said the visit was aimed at showing the friendship between the two nations was ""bigger than Brexit"". But there are warnings intelligence-sharing may be damaged if a framework is not set up to mitigate the risks. A report by a joint UK-French task force whose members include former Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson and ex-French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said co-operation in cyber security and counter-terrorism could be imperilled if the UK leaves in March without an overarching agreement. The Brexit process is at a critical phase amid reports Theresa May may seek the approval of her cabinet within days to sign up to an agreement on the terms of the UK's' withdrawal. Davis: May will probably lose Brexit vote Ministers invited to read draft EU deal Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? Mr Hunt is one of a group of leading ministers reported to be insisting on seeing legal advice in full on the conditions of any agreement on the Irish border and how a so-called backstop arrangement - of the UK staying in a customs union to avoid the need for a visible Northern Ireland border - would work. After his speech Mr Hunt was asked about the legal advice. He said: ""We have an excellent attorney general and he is giving very good legal advice on everything that we are considering signing up to, so we are going into this with our eyes open"". ""That's very important because the Withdrawal Agreement is a legal document so we need to understand all the legal implications - and of course ultimately whatever the Cabinet decide to endorse will come before parliament and all these issues will be debated in full."" He was also asked if the UK and the EU were likely to agree a deal in the next three weeks, replying:  ""We are in the final phase and I think it is possible to be optimistic about the fact that we are essentially down to a couple of big issues... we are focusing all our efforts on those two issues but  I think it's entirely possible to reach an agreement and everyone wants to do that."" Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was the biggest decision the cabinet and Parliament will have to make, so they should be given the full legal advice. Mr Davis said that he believed that if it was left to the EU to decide when the temporary backstop ended it would ""never happen"". He predicted that the emerging Brexit deal would not be backed by MPs - although he told Today a defeat in the Commons would be likely to lead to the two sides hammering out what he called a better deal. However he insisted that if there was no deal, the UK was a ""big country"" able to ""look after ourselves"" and had hundreds of plans prepared, although there would be some ""hiccups over the first year"". France has taken an uncompromising line on Brexit, with its President Emmanuel Macron lashing out at the UK at a summit in Austria in September, saying its exit could not be allowed to undermine European unity. But French industries also sense an opportunity to lure jobs from London, particularly in the financial services, after the UK leaves. Uncertainty has surrounded bilateral Anglo-French immigration agreements after Brexit although the UK has made it clear it wants these to continue, along with the two countries' advanced defence co-operation. In his speech, delivered in French, Mr Hunt hailed what he said had been nearly 200 years of cross-channel co-operation. The two countries 'bled together', Mr Hunt will say, as events take place to mark the centenary of the end of World War One He paid tribute to Anglo-French solidarity, which he said was encapsulated by France's emphatic response to the poisonings of the Skripals in Salisbury earlier this year and last year's terror attacks in London.

"Children watch Andy Pandy in 1950 More than 7,000 people still watch TV in black and white more than half a century after colour broadcasts began. London has the most TV licences for black and white sets at 1,768, followed by 431 in the West Midlands and 390 in Greater Manchester. A total of 7,161 UK households have failed to start watching in colour despite transmissions starting in 1967. BBC2 was the first channel to regularly broadcast in colour from July that year with the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The number of black and white licences has almost halved in the past five years and is down from 212,000 in 2000. The figures were released by TV Licensing in what appears to be a reminder that anyone watching television must by law have a TV licence. Spokesman Jason Hill said: ""Whether you watch EastEnders, Strictly or Question Time in black and white on a 50-year-old TV set, or in colour on a tablet, you need to be covered by a TV licence to watch or record programmes as they are broadcast. ""You also need to be covered by a TV licence to download or watch BBC programmes on iPlayer, on any device."" Why we still love our black and white TVs Last month the organisation said more than 26,000 young people aged 18 to 25 werecaught watching live TV or BBC iPlayer without a TV licence,externalin the past year. That was despite 92% of students knowing a licence is required to catch up on their favourite shows. A black and white licence has one distinct advantage over its colour equivalent:it is a third of the price,externalat Â£50.50 a year compared with Â£150.50. Neither does TV Licensing carry out checks of households claiming to watch a black and white set. ""It's entirely done on trust,"" a spokesperson said. Television and radio technology historian Jeffrey Borinsky said collectors like him still have numerous black and white TVs. ""Who wants all this new-fangled 4K Ultra HD, satellite dishes or a screen that's bigger than your room when you can have glorious black and white TV?"" he asked. ""Thirty years ago, you could still buy black and white TVs, mainly small portables, for as little as Â£50 and it's interesting to know that some people still have them."" It is no longer possible to buy a new black and white set, though many are still offered for sale on sites such as Gumtree and eBay.

"Four people have been found dead after a vehicle broke down in outback Australia, police say. The bodies of two adults, both 19, and their three-year-old son were found near a remote road about 1,000km (620 miles) south of Darwin on Wednesday. Northern Territory Police searching for a 12-year-old boy from the group say they have found the body of a child near the car. The deaths are not being treated as suspicious. Authorities are investigating whether heat may have contributed to the tragedy. The group was last seen leaving Willowra, a small community, on Friday. The adults and toddler were found about 4.5km from the vehicle. ""One of the avenues we are looking at is that they have walked off from a vehicle in extreme weather and may have got caught out,"" Supt Shaun Gill told the ABC. ""Initially we thought it was the result of a car crash, however we are confident it's not."" After an extensive search, police found the body of a child about 120m away from the vehicle late on Thursday. ""A formal identification of the child is yet to be undertaken and as such, police are unable to confirm it is the body of the 12-year-old boy,"" they said in a statement. Police said the alarm had been raised by a man who entered a health clinic in Willowra on Wednesday. ""He will be a critical part of the investigation. He is quite distraught about what he has found,"" said Supt Jody Nobbs. Supt Nobbs said he could not give additional details, nor confirm whether the older boy was related to the family. The search is continuing as police say they cannot confirm whether there were other passengers in the car. Temperatures in the region exceeded 40C in recent days, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The tragedy follows the suspected heat-related deaths of two people in separate incidents in northern Australia within the last two weeks, the ABC reported.

"A huge number of tributes have been left outside the club's stadium Tributes left following the death of five people in a helicopter crash outside Leicester City's stadium are set to be moved. Club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was among those who died when the aircraft came down on 27 October. Ahead of Saturday's first home game since the crash, the tributes will be moved to a designated memorial area close to the accident site. A tribute video will also be shown 15 minutes before the 15:00 GMT kick-off. Leicester City players will wear special shirtswith their former owner's name embroidered on it for Saturday's game against Burnley. Fans will be given commemorative scarves, pin badges, clappers and programmes in honour of Mr Vichai. The club said a two-minute silence will be observed before the game in memory of servicemen and women, as well as the five who died in the crash. Additionally, supporters have planned a tribute march from Jubilee Square to King Power Stadium shortly after midday. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought the club in 2010 Leicester City says Mr Vichai's family and everyone at the club have been deeply moved by ""the remarkable volume of generous and thoughtful tributes"". But realistically they need to be moved in order for fans to get inside the King Power Stadium on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, which is also the final day of Mr Vichai's funeral in Bangkok, the floral tributes are being moved to a designated area which is close to the accident site. The club has invited fans to get in touch if they want to help move the vast volume of flowers to the south-east corner of the ground. It also plans to use a number of the gifts of shirts, scarves, flags and personal mementos that have been left among the tributes in a pitchside display for Saturday's match. Mr Vichai revolutionised the way the club raised money for charity, according to the Foxes ambassador Alan Birchenall. The Leicester City Foxes Foundation was renamed the Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Foundation in honour of the late chairman, on Tuesday. Helicopter victims 'had minimal chance' Leicester players attend Thailand funeral Helicopter crash tragic end to fairytale Mr Birchenall said: ""He's been very charitable to Leicester and Leicestershire people."" He added that the Thai billionaire's ""generosity"" saw him make about Â£4m in personal donations to local hospitals, universities and charities. Jamie Vardy's executive box and boots he wore in last Saturday's match at Cardiff are set to be auctioned for the foundation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prosecutors say that under GuzmÃ¡n the Sinaloa cartel shipped vast amounts of heroin, methamphetamines, cocaine and marijuana into the US. GuzmÃ¡n's lawyers have reportedly hinted they plan to argue he had a smaller role in the cartel than is believed. There was a heavy police presence outside the Brooklyn court during the jury selection Of the jurors, at least three are immigrants and three speak Spanish fluently. Several have relatives who work as prison guards or in law enforcement. While nearly all said they had heard of GuzmÃ¡n before being called for jury duty, they said they would be impartial in the trial. Prosecutors said the stringent security conditions were necessary to protect jurors. They said GuzmÃ¡n has a history of intimidating or ordering the murders of potential witnesses, a claim his defence denies. Drug lord El Chapo denied spousal visits El Chapo: Five things his wife revealed One woman reportedly wept after learning she was picked, and said she was fearful of the attention she would get if her identity was discovered. She remains a part of the jury. However, others were excused for more peculiar reasons. One man, who was born in MedellÃ­n in Colombia, was not chosen after admitting he was a ""bit of a fan"" of GuzmÃ¡n's, and had tried to get his autograph. Another said his job as a Michael Jackson impersonator made him too well-known to serve, while a third man was reportedly rejected after saying he had heard of GuzmÃ¡n thanks to a bagel named after the criminal at a deli near his home - a fact which, if made public, could lead to the man's identification.

"Pictured in 1987, Tynemouth Station was looking tatty and uncared for Since the heritage ""at risk"" register launched 20 years ago, more than two thirds of the original entries have been saved. But while hundreds are removed from Historic England's list each year,nearly as many are added,external. Which sites count as success stories - and which remain in danger? Pictured in 2008, the Midland reopened as a four-star hotel and since 2013 has hosted an annual ""Vintage by the Sea"" festival The Midland Hotel opened on the seafront at Morecambe in 1933 and is believed to be the UK's first Art Deco hotel. The London Midland and Scottish Railway spent the princely sum of Â£72,000 to build a hotel capable of coping with the booming number of tourists to the Lancashire resort. Architect Oliver Hill was given the brief of ""a building of international quality in the modern style"". He came up with a three-storey, curved structure that allowed every room to have good sea views. During its heyday, theatre stars performing at the nearby Winter Gardens, such as George Formby, Jimmy Clitheroe and Billy Bennett, were guests and parties were reputed to go on through the night. Pictured shortly after its opening in 1933, the Midland is thought to be the UK's first Art Deco hotel The outbreak of World War Two gave the Midland a new role - as a military hospital. On the ground floor the dining room became a large ward with about 40 beds, while the circular cafÃ© was adapted into a physiotherapy centre. Two upstairs suites were turned into operating theatres and there were also X-ray facilities, a dental surgery and a dispensary. After the war, the hotel changed hands a number of times, underwent unsympathetic refurbishment and fell victim to financial mismanagement. It closed and fell into disrepair and was on the original at risk register in 1998. However, the redevelopment company Urban Splash spent Â£11m restoring its original features, including the grand staircase. It is now officially saved. Pictured in 1999, the Midland was run down and neglected In Victorian times, people would travel to Tynemouth station just to see its famous foliage The extravaganza of Victorian ironwork that is Tynemouth station, in Tyne and Wear, was opened in 1882. It was added to the register in 2004 and removed in 2012 after the owners and Historic England provided cash for its renovation. Once decorated with a rich display of flora, the station was a destination in itself. However, the rise of the motorcar alongside more people going abroad on holiday contributed to its decline. Although it has always remained a working station, the structure began to show a lack of care, as paint peeled from the metalwork and the glass canopies became dirty and cracked. But a Â£3.68m restoration, which included fitting 4,600 new panes of glass, returned it to its former glory. A weekend market is now held on the station concourse and displays of artwork are regularly seen in the central section of the bridge and hanging from the roof area. The station concourse is also used as an events area during the annual Mouth of the Tyne Festival. The project won the Historic England Angel Award for Best Craftsmanship on a Heritage Rescue for 2012. Following its restoration, Tynemouth station is shiny, clean and off the heritage danger list The gatehouse, pictured in 1912, is said to be where Robin Hood died The timber-framed Kirklees Priory Gatehouse in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, had been on the register since 1998 but following repairs funded by Historic England, it was removed last year. Although most of it was built in the early 16th Century, parts of its timber framing came from a medieval nunnery founded on the site during the reign of Henry II (1154-89). A favourite haunt of Charlotte BrontÃ«, it is also claimed to be where Robin Hood died. Folklore suggests the prioress was his aunt and she sheltered him when he fled from the Sheriff of Nottingham. Another version of the story is that in old age Robin Hood fell ill and went to visit his cousin (rather than aunt) the prioress, so that he could be bled and restored to health. However, his cousin conspired with her lover, Sir Roger of Doncaster, to kill Robin. So she opened a vein, locked Robin in the upper room of the gatehouse, and let him bleed to death. It's also said that he decided his own burial site by shooting an arrow from his deathbed in the gatehouse. The arrow, somewhat implausibly, flew more than a mile. But still, that's where his grave is. Robin Hood is said to have died in one of the upstairs rooms at Kirklees Priory Gatehouse Pictured in 1905, the roundhouse was built by a team including George and Robert Stephenson Strictly speaking, the Roundhouse in Derby is a hexadecagon, but we won't quibble. Built in 1839 by four rival rail companies, the huge 16-sided engine repair shed is known to be the earliest railway roundhouse in the world. One of the companies that built it was the North Midland Railway, where George Stephenson and his son Robert were engineers. Robert was the engineering brain behind the roundhouse, which was built for the sum of Â£62,000 and included a 12-metre engine turntable. But the entire Derby Railway works complex became redundant and it was added to the at risk register in 1998, where it remained until 2009. A project beginning in 2008 restored and updated the site. The original turntable has been kept in the renovated building as an example of manufacturing and railway heritage. Both the roundhouse and the nearby engine sheds were converted into a venue for Derby College, and the space has been used for a variety of functions, including as a location for the TV programme  Antiques Roadshow, the BBC Spending Review, and Ultra White-Collar Boxing. Sadly not all at the same time. The Roundhouse in Derby is now used to host a variety of functions The Kasbah Conservation Area in Grimsby was given listed status in 2017 and added to the at risk list this year For all the success stories, there are 5,160 entries on the 2018 at risk register. While that is 94 fewer than last year, there remains much to be done to preserve some of the country's historical sites. Added to the latest at risk list is the Kasbah area in Grimsby, a year after it was designated a Conservation Area. Grimsby was once home to the UK's largest fishing trawler fleet, but the fishing industry has been in decline for several decades. Most of the fish at the town's daily auction are now caught by crews from the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. David Bowie 1983: An intimate portrait The place where street art found a home The woman who gave birth to rabbits The town's ""traditionally smoked fish"" has been cured in the Kasbah smokehouses since the mid 19th Century, However, only a handful now exist in the area, which has become rundown. Its owner, Associated British Ports, along with North East Lincolnshire Council and Historic England, are trying to attract funding for a repair programme. The site's owners are trying to attract investment to revitalise the area The original HMS Invincible ran aground off Portsmouth in 1758 The wreck of HMS Invincible lies on Horse and Dean Sand off Portsmouth. The wooden sailing vessel capsized while departing for Louisburg in Canada in 1758 and the wreck was discovered by a fisherman in 1979. The ship was built in 1744 and captured from the French in 1747 at Cape Finisterre, whereupon it was taken into the Royal Navy. It was the first to bear the name Invincible. Sandglasses, a bronze adze and cooper's setter used to open barrels, and cartridge cases have been recovered from the site as have army buttons from 13 different regiments. Some cannon lie 200 metres to the south, confirming that the quarterdeck cannon were jettisoned when the vessel got into difficulty. Storms and shifting sands have left the site vulnerable to biological and physical decay. Historic England placed it on the risk register in 2012, and ongoing work to conserve and record the artefacts is being carried out by the Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust, along with Bournemouth University. A well-preserved gunpowder barrel was retrieved from the seafloor near the Invincible The site of the Battle of Newburn Ford has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development King Charles I's attempt to impose a new prayer book on the Scots led to military conflict in the summer of 1640, and the Battle of Newburn Ford, Newcastle upon Tyne, was the only battle of the Second Bishops' War. The Scottish Army took Newcastle by defeating the English, forcing Charles I to pay them off. This expense meant Charles had to recall Parliament, which proved to be a critical step towards the English Civil War. The battlefield has been subject to piecemeal, peripheral development but an outline action plan has been agreed between Historic England, the local authorities and the Battlefields Trust. The area is heavily industrialised, yet areas of historical and natural heritage interest are numerous. Standing at either end of Newburn Bridge provides a good view of the land over which the battle took place.

"A huge number of tributes have been left outside the club's stadium Tributes left following the death of five people in a helicopter crash outside Leicester City's stadium are set to be moved. Club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was among those who died when the aircraft came down on 27 October. Ahead of Saturday's first home game since the crash, the tributes will be moved to a designated memorial area close to the accident site. A tribute video will also be shown 15 minutes before the 15:00 GMT kick-off. Leicester City players will wear special shirtswith their former owner's name embroidered on it for Saturday's game against Burnley. Fans will be given commemorative scarves, pin badges, clappers and programmes in honour of Mr Vichai. The club said a two-minute silence will be observed before the game in memory of servicemen and women, as well as the five who died in the crash. Additionally, supporters have planned a tribute march from Jubilee Square to King Power Stadium shortly after midday. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought the club in 2010 Leicester City says Mr Vichai's family and everyone at the club have been deeply moved by ""the remarkable volume of generous and thoughtful tributes"". But realistically they need to be moved in order for fans to get inside the King Power Stadium on Saturday afternoon. On Friday, which is also the final day of Mr Vichai's funeral in Bangkok, the floral tributes are being moved to a designated area which is close to the accident site. The club has invited fans to get in touch if they want to help move the vast volume of flowers to the south-east corner of the ground. It also plans to use a number of the gifts of shirts, scarves, flags and personal mementos that have been left among the tributes in a pitchside display for Saturday's match. Mr Vichai revolutionised the way the club raised money for charity, according to the Foxes ambassador Alan Birchenall. The Leicester City Foxes Foundation was renamed the Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Foundation in honour of the late chairman, on Tuesday. Helicopter victims 'had minimal chance' Leicester players attend Thailand funeral Helicopter crash tragic end to fairytale Mr Birchenall said: ""He's been very charitable to Leicester and Leicestershire people."" He added that the Thai billionaire's ""generosity"" saw him make about Â£4m in personal donations to local hospitals, universities and charities. Jamie Vardy's executive box and boots he wore in last Saturday's match at Cardiff are set to be auctioned for the foundation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Juan Mata's free-kick was the first goal Juventus have conceded in the Champions League this season Manchester United stunned Juventus with two goals in the final five minutes to beat the Italian champions in Turin and give themselves a good chance of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stages. Juan Mata curled in a free-kick with five minutes to go, before Ashley Young's set-piece was bundled into his own net by Juventus defender Alex Sandro. Cristiano Ronaldo had put the hosts ahead with an outstanding volley against his former club. Ronaldo watched Leonardo Bonucci's long pass over his shoulder before lashing it past United goalkeeper David De Gea for his first goal in the competition since signing for the Serie A leaders. Juventus had hit the frame of the goal either side of half-time, with Sami Khedira striking a post and Paulo Dybala curling an effort on to the bar. Jose Mourinho's side offered little attacking threat at the other end, until substitute Mata beat goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with a well-placed free-kick from the edge of the box in the 86th minute. Three minutes later and another United free-kick proved Juventus' undoing, as Young's in-swinging delivery was inadvertently turned in under pressure by Sandro from close range. The visitors' late double keeps them second in Group H and two points above Valencia, whobeat Young Boys 3-1in the early kick-off, with two games still to play. Did Mourinho's celebrations go too far or show passion? United 'one final' from knockout stage - Mourinho Why Juve are much more than Ronaldo Jose Mourinho was confronted by Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci after cupping his ear to the home fans United have made a habit of staging late recoveries this season, although manager Mourinho bemoaned his side's inability to do so when they were beaten by Juventus at Old Trafford last month. But, while comeback wins over Newcastle and Bournemouth in the Premier League offered relief rather than the chance to rejoice, this victory was more reminiscent in its nature of United's Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich in 1999. Mourinho's side look a long way from winning the competition 20 years on, but his players' reaction at the final whistle - and Mourinho's cupped ear to the Juventus fans - showed how important taking three points in Turin was to the Reds. Juventus had won three from three and were yet to concede a goal in the Champions League this season before Mata's strike, while United's late winner inflicted only the Serie A champions' second loss at home in the group stages in 36 games. United - without Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku, who is also a doubt for Sunday's Manchester derby - opted for Alexis Sanchez to lead the line, but the Chilean had a bigger influence on the visitors' defensive performance than he did their attack. The same could be said for Anthony Martial, who tracked Juventus right-back Mattia De Sciglio relentlessly as United defended resolutely before Ronaldo's opener. But United, who had just three shots on target, proved clinical in attack when it mattered and will progress from the group if they beat Young Boys at home later this month and Valencia fail to beat Juventus. Cristiano Ronaldo ended a run of six games without a Champions League goal by scoring against his former club It was always going to happen, wasn't it? Ronaldo scoring his first Champions League goal for Juventus against former club United. The Portugal forward, who joined the Italian outfit from Real Madrid for Â£99.2m in the summer, was without a goal in the competition since scoring against Juve for his former side in April. But Ronaldo's first in Europe for the Serie A leaders was worth waiting for, showing superb technique to volley in Bonucci's well-weighted long pass for the opener. The five-time Champions League winner had struggled to make an impact on the tie before his moment of brilliance, though it was from his pull-back that Khedira struck a post in the first half. Dybala was unlucky to not put the hosts ahead moments after Khedira's chance when he cut inside and curled a dipping effort against the crossbar, while De Gea had earlier produced an instinctive save after Juan Cuadrado's cross was deflected goalwards by Nemanja Matic. But when the goal came, it was worthy of a player who has won the Ballon D'Or five times, and the 33-year-old celebrated in trademark fashion - lifting up his shirt to reveal his muscular physique. Ronaldo thought he had stolen the show, but the Portuguese, and his Juventus team-mates, were upstaged by United's late twist. Juan Mata was only on the field 11 minutes, but proved pivotal to Manchester United's comeback after showing great composure to pull the visitors level with the moment of brilliance Jose Mourinho's side needed. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on BT Sport:""A point or three would have changed little for Juventus, but three points makes a big difference to us. ""It is a big victory for us, not just because we needed the points but because it was away from home against an amazing team. ""They are a fantastic team with an amazing record at home. We had to come and not feel inferior. They have more potential than us. Everybody knows their ambitions."" Manchester United goalscorer Juan Mata:""What a nice last five minutes. It is a very good night for us to get three points against Juventus in Italy. It is amazing. ""They have fantastic players and are a top team. We come back to Manchester with three points and that is football."" Juventus lost a Champions League group stage home game for the first time since December 2009, when Bayern Munich beat them, ending a 19-game unbeaten run. United have won more away Champions League matches at Juventus than any other side have in the history of the competition, with three. United have come back to win a Champions League game with two goals in the final five minutes of a match for the first time since the 1999 final against Bayern Munich. Juan Mata scored his first Champions League goal since netting against Wolfsburg in September 2015. Cristiano Ronaldo ended a drought of 20 shots and 453 minutes without a goal in the Champions League. United make the short trip to Etihad Stadium on Sunday to face rivals Manchester City, kick-off 16:30 GMT, while their next Champions League outing is against Young Boys at Old Trafford on 27 November. Juventus face a big game of their own on Sunday, visiting manager Allegri's former club AC Milan in Serie A in a 19:30 kick-off. They host Valencia next in Europe.

"This video can not be played Prince Charles says it would be ""nonsense"" to think he could campaign publicly as king The Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is ""not that stupid"". He has campaigned on issues such as the environment for decades but says he would not do the same as monarch. Speaking in a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Prince Charles said the idea that he would continue making interventions was ""nonsense"". He said he would have to operate within ""constitutional parameters"". In the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people have described as ""meddling"". Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the royal for 12 months, said Prince Charles ""bridled a bit"" at the use of the word ""meddling"" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as ""motivating"". The heir to the throne said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."" The Duchess of Cornwall said Prince Charles had a passion to help He said the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate. ""It's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two,"" he said. Prince Charles 'made me pick up litter' Â£5 coin marks Prince Charles' 70th birthday Prince Charles in a land of princes Prince Charles toasts baby news ""So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir. ""But the idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different."" Asked whether his public campaigning would continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid."" BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy. He said: ""The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn."" By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondent He has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, ""to make a difference"". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others. It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to hisheartfelt ""black spider"" handwritten lettersraising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention. It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop? Prince Charles alongside his grandson Prince George Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his ""campaigning"". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother. However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king. ""You operate,"" he says in the BBC documentary, ""within the constitutional parameters."" It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power. Architecture In 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a ""vast municipal fire station"" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a ""monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend"". Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: ""I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness."" Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: ""Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic."" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: ""The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. ""It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat."" Wildlife conservation Prince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns. In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left."" Homeopathy Prince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself. In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy.

"The children's commissioner for England is calling on internet giants and toy-makers to be more transparent about the data they are collecting on children. Today's children are the first to be ""datafied"" from birth and little thought has been given to the consequences, a report for her says. Who Knows What about Me?,externalcalls for a statutory duty of care between social media giants and their younger users. And it urges the government to consider strengthening data protection laws. The report also highlights how very young children are now using toys that are connected to the internet. These gather personal messages and information that may be insecure and open to attack from hackers, it says. The report quotes research led by Sonia Livingstone, who describes children as the ""canary in the coal mine for wider society"" - the first to encounter new technology and its risks before many adults are even aware of them. It says: children should be taught in schools about how their data is collected and for what purposes where a toy collects any video or audio generated by a child, this should be made explicit in a prominent part of the packaging or its accompanying information using language children understand, companies should explain clearly in their terms and conditions what data is collected and how it will be used The report estimates: between the ages of 11 and 16, children post on social media 26 times a day, on average by the time they reach adulthood, they are likely to have posted 70,000 times by the age of 13, a child's parents will have posted on average 1,300 photos and videos of them to social media There is also: the data gathered when children use the internet tracking devices and apps used by parents to keep tabs on their offspring the biometric data held by public bodies such as schools and the NHS The report warns that there could be risks to young people where profiling of internet usage is utilised in areas of life where it can have deeper ramifications, such as the judicial system or the education system. One worrying scenario it gives is if a health insurance company used information posted by a child on social media about their mental health as part of its decision on whether to issue a policy or how much to charge. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said: ""We need to stop and think about what this means for children's lives now and how it may impact on their future lives as adults. ""We simply do not know what the consequences of all this information about our children will be. ""Companies that make apps, toys and other products used by children need to stop filling them with trackers and put their terms and conditions in language that children understand. ""And crucially the government needs to monitor the situation and refine data protection legislation if needed, so that children are genuinely protected - especially as technology develops.""

"Emile Ratelband described himself as a ""young god"" A Dutch ""positivity trainer"" has launched a legal battle to change his age and boost his dating prospects. Emile Ratelband, 69, wants to shift his birthday from 11 March 1949 to 11 March 1969, comparing the change to identifying as being transgender. ""We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?"" he said. A local court in the eastern city of Arnhem is expected to rule on the case within four weeks. However officials were sceptical about the case, believing there was no legal mechanism allowing a person to change their birth date, local reports said. One of the judges wanted to know what would become of the 20 years that Mr Ratelband wanted to erase. ""Who were your parents looking after then? Who was that little boy?"" he was quoted as saying. Mr Ratelband argues he feels discriminated against because of his age, and that it was affecting his employment chances and his success rate on the dating app, Tinder. ""When I'm 69, I am limited. If I'm 49, then I can buy a new house, drive a different car. I can take up more work,"" he said. Mr Ratelband believes changing his age will improve his chances on dating app Tinder ""When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer. When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position."" Mr Ratelband further argued that according to his doctors he has the body of a 45-year-old, and described himself as a ""young god"". He went on Facebook last year to describe how he had made the decision one day standing in front of a mirror, not because he feared getting old but because he wanted to make the most of life for as long as possible. Man, 67, denied job because of age bias 'Bored stiff' man, 91, retires at last He also said he would renounce his pension if he switched his birth date. The Netherlands' constitution expressly prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of age,external. Mr Ratelband, a media personality and motivational guru, converted to Buddhism earlier this year and is a trainer in neurolinguistic programming. He voiced the character Vladimir Trunkov in the Dutch-language version of the Pixar film Cars 2.

"Wall victims clockwise from top left: Mahamadou Jagana Jagana, Almamo Kinteh Jammeh, Saibo Sumbundu Sillah, Bangally Tunkara Dukuray and Ousman Kaba Diaby A widow whose husband died alongside four others in a wall collapse at a scrap yard in 2016 has still not told her children, an inquest heard. Alimamo Jammeh, 45, was one of five workers killed instantly by the ""catastrophic failure"" of the 15ft (4.6m) of concrete, a jury heard. His wife, Awa Dibba, told a hearing his ""little children ask every day for their dad"". The inquest in Birmingham is set to last two and a half weeks. Ousmane Diaby, 39, Bangally Dukureh, 55, Saibo Sillah, 42, and Muhamadou Jagana, 49, also died at Hawkeswood Metal Recycling, Birmingham, in July 2016. Jurors heard all five men - four from the Gambia and one from Senegal - had been working in Spain, where they had found it increasingly difficult to find employment. After coming to the UK, they began working at the plant in Nechells. West Mids news: Footballer guilty of car park assault, plus more Birmingham and Solihull coroner Emma Brown said: ""They were clearing out a scrap metal storage bay when one of the walls, made of heavy concrete blocks, fell on to them."" When emergency services arrived, ""it was identified that all five men were deceased"", she said. Relatives of the men could be seen crying while others had their heads in their hands as Ms Brown read out post-mortem examination results. Two pathologists reported each man suffered ""devastating blunt force injuries"", which were mainly to the chest, head and pelvis, she said. All had to be identified by their fingerprints, the hearing was told. In evidence, Mr Diaby's widow Aminata Kaba said she learned of his death as word spread on Whatsapp, the inquest heard. She said she was approached by people who got the news on the messaging app. ""Someone told me that someone had put it in WhatsApp because they did not know his close family in Birmingham,"" she said. Emergency crews rushed to the scene in Nechells on 7 July ""Then we went to the mosque and they said someone has died called Ousmane Diaby and that's how I knew about his death. ""Then my husband's uncle heard about it and told me about his death."" Widows of other victims described the effect of the deaths on them and their children. Mr Dukuray's wife Hawa Kaba said the loss of her husband had been ""absolutely devastating"". ""Since my husband's death my son has become very quiet and withdrawn,"" she said. ""I have found life a huge struggle and I miss him daily."" Mr Jammeh's wife Awa Dibba said she had still not told her children about their father's death. ""Almamo worked so hard and loved his family,"" she said. ""The little children ask every day for their dad, they don't know he has died."" The bodies of the men were recovered several days after the wall collapsed Det Insp Nigel Harrison from West Midlands Police told the hearing there was ""catastrophic failure of a wall"" and the men's death would have been ""instantaneous."" He added: ""Due to the weight of the metal ingots in the adjacent bay, the amount of force pushing against the wall caused it to collapse and fall onto the victims."" Ms Brown set out the four main topics for the inquests, which include events at the plant, the medical cause of death, the cause of the wall's collapse and the construction, maintenance and risk assessment of the site. West Midlands Police detectives and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are continuing to investigate the incident.
