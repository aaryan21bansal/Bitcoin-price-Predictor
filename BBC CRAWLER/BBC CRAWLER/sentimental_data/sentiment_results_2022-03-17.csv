"Ben Wallace and Priti Patel are leading members of the cabinet Two UK ministers have revealed they have been targeted with hoax calls linked to the conflict in Ukraine. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace blamed Russian ""dirty tricks"" after revealing a man had called him earlier pretending to be Ukraine's prime minister. He became suspicious and ended the call after the ""imposter"" posed ""several misleading questions"", he said. Home Secretary Priti Patel then tweeted that she had received a similar call earlier this week. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Mr Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry into what happened. It was not immediately clear who was behind the call, but Mr Wallace linked the incident to Russia and President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. In a tweet,externalabout the call, Mr Wallace wrote: ""No amount of Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks can distract from Russia's human rights abuses and illegal invasion of Ukraine. A desperate attempt."" Replying to him shortly afterwards, Ms Patel said: ""This also happened to me earlier this week. Pathetic attempt at such difficult times to divide us. We stand with Ukraine"". A Ministry of Defence source said it was a ""fairly sophisticated"" video call that was not made to Mr Wallace's own mobile phone. The source said the call came to him via ""another government department"", which added to its credibility. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Kyiv residents record life under siege ANALYSIS:Putin will search for a way to save face BUSINESS:The Western brands unable to leave Russia IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict It is understood that Mr Wallace was put through to a Microsoft Teams video call which lasted about 10 minutes. The video call was set up after an email, purportedly from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy in London, was sent to a government department and then forwarded to the Ministry of Defence. The BBC has been told that the call to Mr Wallace involved someone posing as Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in front of a Ukrainian flag, who asked a range of ""wild questions"". Mr Shmyhal later replied to Mr Wallacein a tweet,external, writing: ""Despite all attempts of Russian disinformation, the world can see that the truth is behind Ukraine."" Denys Shmyhal, shown here at a press conference in January, has been Ukraine's PM since March 2020 During the call, Mr Wallace was asked about Nato and the state of the negotiations taking place between Ukraine and Russia, the defence source added. Mr Wallace was apparently asked about whether the UK would send warships to the Black Sea, and if Ukraine should get nuclear weapons. The defence secretary was also apparently asked about the prospect of Ukraine dropping its ambition to join Nato and becoming a ""neutral"" state. The defence source said Mr Wallace ""was asked leading questions to encourage inappropriate comments"" but he ""didn't say anything that was not factual or appropriate"". But defence sources say they are concerned that there may be an attempt to distort or edit Mr Wallace's answers before he terminated the call. Mr Wallace was on a visit to the Polish capital Warsaw when he shared the tweet about the hoax call. The calls come at a time of sensitive peace talks between Ukraine and Russia as the war launched by President Vladimir Putin three weeks ago exacts an ever-higher human cost. The UK government has been providing military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine while imposing punishing economic sanctions on Russia. Since the war started, there have been regular conversations between British and Ukrainian ministers, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"Andriy Yarmolenko celebrates with the home fans after his extra-time winner put West Ham through Andriy Yarmolenko scored an emotional extra-time winner as West Ham overturned a first-leg deficit against Sevilla to reach their first European quarter-final since 1981. Yarmolenko has been on compassionate leave as he tried to deal with the trauma of having friends and relatives back home in war-torn Ukraine. But after making a goalscoring return to the pitch against Aston Villa on Sunday, Yarmolenko swept the Hammers past Sevilla as he converted a rebound after Pablo Fornals' low shot had been parried into his path by visiting keeper Bono. The 32-year-old forward, on as a substitute for Said Benrahma, looked to the skies as he marked his special moment and the London Stadium erupted in jubilation. At the final whistle, he looked almost bewildered in the moment before spotting a fan with a Ukraine flag and handing him his shirt. 'We can write history' - West Ham into first Euro quarter-final since 1981 Trailing by a single goal from last week's opener in Spain, Tomas Soucek had pulled West Ham level in the first-half when he guided Michail Antonio's cross into the far corner with a precise header. A Sevilla side that has won this tournament four times out of the last eight seasons were a major disappointment - and came no closer than Youssef En-Nesyri's early effort which was brilliantly saved by Alphonse Areola. Thursday's European action as it happened, plus reaction and analysis West Ham manager David Moyes had billed this as the tie of the round. The Scot must now be immensely proud at the way his side have navigated their way into a draw that contains, among others, Barcelona and Rangers. The last time Moyes managed a team in the last 16 of a European competition, he secured probably his best night as Manchester United manager, when his side came back from a 2-0 first leg deficit to knock Olympiakos out of the Champions League. As on that night, Moyes' side had levelled the tie by the interval. Tomas Soucek's first-half header was his first European goal for West Ham West Ham controlled the tempo of the game despite having a minority of possession. Fornals and Declan Rice were outstanding in midfield, young defender Ben Johnson superb in a determined defensive display and Antonio - a doubt before the game - ran so hard up front that Sevilla could never rest. In contrast, Anthony Martial was a disappointment on his return to England and, by the end, Sevilla Julen Lopetegui seemed to have run out of ideas as his side tried to claw their way to penalties. Sevilla had not lost a European tie after taking a first-leg lead since 1981. Yarmolenko changed that history in a moment for Ukraine to be proud of, in a dark time at home. West Ham have not had a seamless move from their beloved Boleyn Ground to the London Stadium. However, this game exploded the myth that there is a lack of atmosphere at the stadium solely because of the running track which, in any case, is reduced in its impact since the stands behind each goal were squared off at the start of the season. There was no lack of atmosphere on this occasion, a game, West Ham said, was played in front of the highest number of club supporters ever to see a match. The build-up was heightened by a pre-match light show. The bubbles floated into the night sky and when Soucek's header found the far corner in the 39th minute, the place erupted. Celebration was replaced by tension the longer the game went on. But when Yarmolenko struck the decisive final blow in the 112th minute, the home fans turned up the volume once more. London Stadium has waited six years for a statement night to go alongside the memories that were left behind in the three-and-a-half mile move. Now they have one. And on this evidence, the journey might not be over yet.

"This video can not be played Video shows Mariupol theatre destroyed in bombing Civilians are said to be emerging alive from the ruins of a theatre that, according to Ukrainian authorities, was bombed by Russia in the city of Mariupol. Despite pictures of devastation at the scene, many who were sheltering there are thought to have survived in a basement that withstood Wednesday's attack. For 10 days, that basement was a refuge for Kate, a 38-year-old Mariupol native, and her son, who is 17. Their own home, like many others in the besieged city, had been destroyed by Russian attacks, and they thought the Donetsk Regional Theatre of Drama was a place where they would be relatively safe. Mother and son squeezed in the building's dark rooms, corridors and halls with dozens of other families. Some women, Kate said, carried babies that were just four or five months old. ""In the beginning, it was really tough, because we didn't have a well-organised food supply. So on the first two days, adults didn't have any food,"" Kate, who used to work at the city's zoo shop and did not want to give her full name, said. ""We gave food only to the children."" They slept on improvised beds made with soft parts of auditorium seats which had been put together on the floor. The seats made of wood, she said, were cut in parts and used as firewood for them to cook. ""Around the theatre there wasn't enough trees we could use, and it was too dangerous to go outside"". For almost three weeks, Mariupol has been under constant shelling by Russian forces, which have completely surrounded the city. About 300,000 people are trapped, with no electricity, gas or running water. Food and medicine are running low, as Russia has prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid. Four days after she arrived, Kate said, Ukrainian forces managed to send some food supplies and a field kitchen to the theatre, and ""we [started] cooking something"". They would have soup, and sometimes oatmeal, for lunch, and tea with biscuits for dinner. The imposing Soviet-era building in Mariupol's city centre, next to the Sea of Azov waterfront, had been designated as a shelter for civilians. Sergei Orlov, the city's deputy mayor, said up to 1,200 people had been there. Human Rights Watch, citing interviews with evacuees, put that number at between 500 and 800. As Russia's relentless assault continued, Kate said the buildings around the theatre had been either damaged or destroyed. ""We knew we had to run away because something terrible would happen soon,"" she said. A day before the attack, Kate and her son left the site. ""We jumped in a car while the theatre and the area were being shelled,"" she said. They shared the vehicle with a family of four, who had brought four dogs and a cat. ""We asked to go with them, because we didn't have our own [car],"" she said. They were part of convoy of about 2,000 cars that escaped Mariupol on Tuesday. Mariupol city council said a Russian plane dropped a bomb on the theatre, calling the attack ""deliberate and cynical"". Russia denied it had targeted the site but, in Mariupol alone, its attacks had already hit several civilian buildings including a hospital, a church and countless apartment blocks. Satellite images released by the US company Maxar taken on Monday showed that the Russian word for ""children"" had been marked on the ground in large letters in two locations outside the building, to warn Russian jets away. A convoy of cars carrying evacuees from Mariupol arrives in the city of Zaporizhzhia Video of the aftermath showed smoke billowing from the building's collapsed faÃ§ade. But with communications with the city almost completely cut off, the numbers of survivors or possible casualties were still not clear, almost 20 hours later. Dmytro Gurin, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and originally from Mariupol, said the shelter in the basement of the building withstood the attack, and that teams were trying to clear the rubble which covered the entrance to the site. ""It looks like most of them have survived and are OK,"" he said. But the rescue efforts were tricky, he said, as Russia had continued to attack the area. ""Shelling never stops and artillery never stops and airplanes are dropping bombs,"" he said, ""so it's really difficult"". The city council estimates about 80% to 90% of the city's buildings have either been damaged or destroyed by Russia, which has attacked the city almost non-stop since it invaded Ukraine, three weeks ago. Entire neighbourhoods have been turned into wasteland. Local authorities say at least 2,400 people have been killed in Mariupol, although they acknowledge this is likely to be an underestimate. Many of the dead are being buried in mass graves. After leaving Mariupol, Kate was headed to the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, a region that has been largely spared of attacks. ""The first day after we managed to get out, I couldn't talk. We all just cried"", she said. ""But now it feels like there are no tears left. I don't think this pain will ever disappear.""

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"Interest rates have increased for the third time in four months as the Bank of England tries to calm the rise in the cost of living. The rise from 0.5% to 0.75% means rates are now at their highest level since March 2020, when Covid lockdowns began. Energy bills and food costs are increasing and there is concern the war in Ukraine will push prices up further. The Bank has warned inflation, the rate at which prices rise, may reach 8% and possibly higher, in the coming months. Explaining why it had lifted its forecast, it said that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia ""has led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. ""It is also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and has increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly,"" it added. Prices had already increased by 5.5% in the year to January, the fastest rate for 30 years and well above the Bank's 2% inflation target. The Office for National Statistics  (ONS) said that energy and fuel prices had contributed to the rising cost of living. How the interest rate rise might affect you How high could UK interest rates go? The Bank's policymakers cited the rising cost of living and strong employment as the reasons for the latest rate rise. The members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) felt that ""given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist"", an interest rate rise was justified. It also warned that inflation could hit double-digits later in the year if energy prices push up the energy price cap. The MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 for the move, with deputy Bank governor Jon Cunliffe the only member to vote for keeping rates unchanged. He said this was because of the impact of rapid price rises on household incomes. The committee said that more interest rate rises ""might be appropriate in coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects evolved."" The invasion of Ukraine was likely to push prices up even faster than the Bank expected at its last meeting in February, it added. ""The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was another such shock,"" it wrote. Morag Milligan is the operations manager at Milligan's Coaches Morag Milligan, the operations manager at Milligan's Coaches in East Ayrshire, said that the business had barely recovered from the shock of coronavirus-related lockdowns and travel restrictions. Citing rising fuel prices, she said: ""It feels it's just never-ending for the industry... it's crisis after crisis."" The company has seen an 8% increase in fuel costs which had been a drain on resources. ""The increase just makes it harder and harder to run,"" she said. About two million households will see an immediate increase in their mortgage payments as a result of the rise in rates, according to UK Finance. The increase will add about Â£26 a month to the cost of a typical tracker mortgage, and Â£16 to the cost of a typical standard variable rate mortgage. The Bank said that higher global prices for energy and other goods were responsible for the faster rise in inflation than the MPC predicted at its last rate-setting meeting. However, it expects inflation to ""fall back materially"" once prices stop rising and the impact of inflation on household incomes starts to bite. While the headline impact of a rise in rates will be felt by homeowners on variable rate mortgages, the big change today was in the mood music at the Bank of England. Last month, it indicated that the rise was the first in a series likely over the coming months. That language has been toned down and indeed there was one member of the committee who voted to keep them on hold. This indicates that the Bank is nervous about the economic impact of the massive rise in energy and food prices. More nervous than it is about the fact that already eye-watering 30 year highs for inflation, are not just going to be even higher at 8%, but potentially breach that by the end of the year. The Russian invasion is one of a series of so-called ""stagflationary"" shocks, that send both growth figures and inflation figures in the wrong direction. There is not much the Bank can do to stop the energy price cap and food prices sending the increase in the cost of living to 9 or 10%. But it is signalling its concern about the overall impact on the economy of a prolonged hit to consumers, from events 1,500 miles away. But the union Unite hit out at the Bank's decision, with its general secretary Sharon Graham saying that it comes at a time when ""millions of working people are facing the worst cost-of-living crisis for generations"". ""This rise will put even more pressure on household finances as inflation and energy bills continue to skyrocket."" Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that energy bills were already set to increase in April with the rise in the energy price cap. The British Chambers of Commerce argued that higher rates will do little to curb some of the global causes behind the surge in prices and risk intensifying the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses. Suren Thiru, its head of economics, urged the chancellor to use his Spring Statement on 23 March to tackle the ""cost of doing business crisis"" by delaying the National Insurance rise and introducing a temporary energy price cap for businesses. ""This would give firms the headroom to keep a lid on prices, protect jobs and make investment that is so vital to sustaining our economic prospects.""

"The war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by more than one percentage point in the first year after the invasion, a report suggests. The Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) said the impact could also cause a ""deep recession"" in Russia if it is sustained. It also warned that the conflict could push up prices globally by about 2.5%. The organisation called for targeted financial support for those on the lowest incomes in response. Costs were already going up due to increased demand as Covid restrictions ease. But if the moves in commodity prices and financial markets are sustained, consumers could see the rate of inflation, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time, increase even further, the OECD said. Farmers warn Ukraine war will hit UK food prices IMF: Ukraine economy could shrink as much as 35% What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Prices of oil, gas, metals and chemicals essential to fertiliser production, for example, have jumped as concerns over supplies from the region increase. Although Russia and Ukraine only make up a small percentage of the global economy, they are huge producers of raw materials. The OECD assumes in its new research that oil prices will remain elevated by one-third, gas by 85% and wheat by 90%. Outside Russia and Ukraine, the organisation suggested that most pain would be felt in Europe, with up to 1.4% knocked off the economy. Europe is more dependent on Russia and Ukraine for supplies of energy as well as food. The countries have, in the past, been described as the ""breadbasket"" of Europe. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on why the war in Ukraine is pushing up food prices - and the likely impact on poorer countries Those countries ""that have a common border with either Russia or Ukraine"" would feel the impact most, while bearing the brunt of refugee flows from Ukraine, the OECD said. The price shock, however, might be felt more keenly by those in developing countries. It added that governments could soften the latest blow for household budgets with a ""targeted fiscal response"". ""Well-designed and carefully targeted fiscal support could reduce the negative impact on growth with only a minor extra impetus to inflation."" It suggested that in some countries this could be funded by a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help households cope with higher bills. Spain has already announced something similar, although the UK has so far largely resisted. The government argues that a windfall tax would stop companies investing in the UK. The group of developed economies also said that central banks should mostly stick to the interest rate plans set out before the conflict broke out. ""Monetary policy should remain focused on ensuring well-anchored inflation expectations,"" it said. ""Most central banks should continue their pre-war plans, with the exception of the most affected economies, where a pause may be needed to fully assess the consequences of the crisis."" The war has dominated headlines in every corner of the globe - but between them, Ukraine and Russia account for a relatively tiny part of the world's economy, just Â£1 in every Â£50. However, it's what they produce - one-third of the world's wheat exports, one-fifth of its gas and a tenth of its oil, not to mention vital manufacturing ingredients such as nickel and palladium - that means the conflict universally hits prosperity. If those commodity prices remain at recent elevated levels (and that's not certain), the OECD reckons it will dampen - but not eradicate - what it previously expected to be a ""brisk pace"" of global growth of 4.5%, delaying a return to the norms of the pre-pandemic era. It's the pockets of households and businesses, however, that'll suffer most, from a painful and prolonged bout of accelerating price rises of staple goods. The OECD is urging governments to ease the burden, perhaps using windfall taxes to redistribute funds from energy producers to consumers. Spain is doing just that, but other governments are fully aware that they're more reliant than ever on energy giants to step up and help keep supply plentiful and affordable. But there's a limited amount even the most eager and well-funded government can do. And it's those in places where the state is least likely, or able, to help which may feel the burden most. They are the very places that were already struggling to cast off the economic shadow of the pandemic.

"This video can not be played Sacked P&O employee Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" at losing his job after 22 years' service Seafaring staff at P&O Ferries were told by video message that 800 of them were being sacked immediately as their ships returned to port. The decision has sparked angry protests from staff on ship and shore. Darren Proctor, national secretary for the RMT union, says he woke up to a flurry of messages from people worried about what the company was about to announce. Heading down to Dover, he was told that coaches with private security guards were travelling to the P&O port on the south coast of England, as well as Hull, Larne and Cairnryan. ""They had to be handcuff-trained,"" he says. Then at 11:10 GMT, their worst fears were confirmed: 800 staff were told they were immediately redundant. Mr Proctor says some staff remain on the three ships at Dover, but some have left and security staff have boarded to try and put their replacements in post. P&O Ferries sacks 800 but crew refuse to leave ships 'No one can get on or off the ship until we get guarantees' P&O job losses devastating blow for Dover, MP says P&O ships 'unable to operate' at Larne for week James, a steward on board the Spirit of France ferry at Dover, was on a day off when he heard the redundancy announcement. He was texted half an hour before the three-minute video from P&O management. ""It feels like we have been abandoned by the company, only a few days ago they were ordering new uniforms and giving us all a pay rise and now, completely out the blue, they have sacked us,"" he said. James, who did not want to give his surname, said staff were told that they would be given a ""generous severance package"" in the video message but staff were not able to ask questions after the call and no details about redundancy pay were given. ""How they expect to run an entire fleet of ships with fresh, inexperienced crew I will never know - it won't be smooth sailing,"" he says. Speaking to the BBC as he took the train home, Mark Canet-Baldwin says workers hired to replace P&O staff were ""appalled"" by the company's plans Mark Canet-Baldwin from Hull says he was hired a week ago to work as onboard services manager on a new ship sailing in British waters, but the agency couldn't tell him anything about the ship. He was put up in a hotel in Glasgow and then driven at 05:30 GMT to an undisclosed location, which turned out to be the P&O dock at Cairnryan. Their bus stopped to pick up a security detail of a dozen guards, ""all in black, big handcuffs on the back of them"", Mark says. When they arrived, some agency staff knew the P&O workers as former colleagues and got in touch. ""People on board were just devastated,"" Mark says. ""It was just horrible, we were appalled, there was just a general feeling of uneasiness on the bus and we felt we were like traitors to the cause or something."" One sacked P&O staff member had just taken out a mortgage, he says, and they had all been expecting to arrive home for two weeks of leave, not redundancy. ""I've got kids and I started thinking about them. In this day and age you've got to have morals, you've got to have ethics,"" Mark says. He says he took off his hard hat and overalls and, along with three others, got off the bus and went home. On board the Pride of Hull, staff stayed put after the shock announcement. Gaz Jackson, an RMT officer who boarded the ship in Hull's King George Dock early on Thursday, said cheaper replacement staff were parked outside the port waiting to get on board, while another van held what he believed were security staff. He said the captain made a ""brave decision"" to lift the gangway for the crew's safety, saying security guards were going to ""pull us off if we weren't going to get off"". The RMT union held a protest at Dover following the mass sacking of 800 P&O staff The protest meant other workers with no connection to the P&O dispute had also been trapped on the ship. Keith Davis had been repairing some kitchen equipment with eight other contractors when the captain lifted the gangway. ""We're being held against our will,"" he said. Later on Thursday afternoon, the stern doors of the Pride of Hull were seen to open and a few vehicles came off, however. The P&O Ferries crew told the BBC they intended to stay on board for ""as long as it takes"". But after a stand-off lasting for several hours, the crew eventually disembarked at around 16:30 GMT. Mr Jackson said they ended their protest after the company agreed to provide paperwork requested by the union. ""The crew are absolutely devastated. I've seen grown men crying on there because they don't know where they're going to go from today,"" he said. In Larne, one man who had worked for P&O Ferries for nine years said security staff came on board their ship to make sure everyone left. He said: ""We went through a lot over the last two years with the pandemic and all that kind of stuff, but didn't think it would end like this."" Dozens of workers also blocked roads at Dover in protest, with some clashing with motorists as they stood in the road with banners and flags saying: ""Stop the P&O Jobs carve-up"". Some insisted they would not move until the police came to take them away. One 54-year-old man, who has worked in ferry engine rooms since the 1980s, told the PA news agency: ""I'm fuming, to be honest with you. I've known people who've been with the firm for years - this is no way to treat people. ""It was just a short message this morning saying you've all lost a job, basically - all this service for nothing."" Some staff are refusing to leave the three ships at Dover - and others at three more UK ports The protesting members of staff want P&O Ferries to begin talks with them over their jobs, but the RMT national secretary Mr Proctor says: ""This is a company that doesn't want to negotiate at all, there's been no dialogue with them whatsoever and they've obviously been organising this for a long time."" Asked if it was true, as the company suggested, that P&O management had no choice, he said it had been financially mismanaged for years. ""They've chosen to go for the jugular of UK seafaring,"" he says. Now staff want support from MPs and government and they are trying to drum up international backing from workers in foreign ports. ""If they can do it here, they can do it at another site and that can't be allowed to happen,"" says Mr Proctor.

"The Ukrainian leader expressed outrage that some German companies were still operating in Russia Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has told German MPs that a new type of Berlin Wall is being built, dividing Europe between freedom and oppression. He thanked Germany for its support during Russia's invasion. But it was uncomfortable listening for many MPs as he criticised German energy policy and business interests for contributing to that wall of division. Over the past week, Mr Zelensky has given a master class in how to pitch his message to allies. On Wednesday, he addressed US Congress, referring to Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 terror attacks. On Tuesday he asked Canada's parliament to envisage bombs and missiles falling on Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. Last week, his address to the House of Commons in London was partly a homage to Winston Churchill's wartime speeches. His emotive speech to the German parliament, the Bundestag, was equally tailored to appeal to his audience with well-chosen historical parallels. Some of his audience grew up in communist East Germany behind the Berlin Wall. During the Cold War, Germany's dogged negotiation and engagement with Moscow contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. Since then Germany has tried to use trade, business and energy links to integrate a peaceful Russia into the West. But Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago has destroyed many of those aspirations. The general political consensus in Germany now is that this may have been the wrong approach with Mr Putin's increasingly authoritarian and kleptocratic government. President Zelensky expressed outrage that some German businesses were still operating in Russia. The controversial, now cancelled, Russian-German gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 was ""cement for that new wall"" dividing Europe, he said. Germany's continued reluctance to allow Ukraine into the European Union was ""another brick"" in that new wall. ""Dear Mr Scholz, tear down this wall,"" he demanded of the German chancellor, repeating US President Ronald Reagan's historic demand to the Soviets in 1987 as he stood beside the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Many German ministers listening will agree with him. The Green Party, which in the new governing coalition is now responsible for energy policy within the powerful Economy Ministry, has for years been campaigning against Nord Stream 2. Even those who once supported the pipeline have changed their minds. Until recently Mr Scholz still referred to it as an non-political business matter. But as Russian troops gathered on Ukraine's borders, shortly before the invasion, he unexpectedly announced the newly finished pipeline would not be opening after all. Using another German Cold War analogy, in his speech President Zelensky said that Ukraine needed an airlift, and a no-fly zone to protect it, just as Cold War West Berlin had been saved by the Allied airlift in 1948-49. He also reminded Germany of its responsibility to make up for Nazi crimes in Ukraine, saying Ukrainian towns and cities were being destroyed for the second time in 80 years. This was a well-judged comment - Germany does guilt well. But for now there is no time for national bouts of repentance and soul searching.

The main opposition party, the conservative CDU, expressed outrage that after the address the chamber went on to discuss normal parliamentary business, instead of debating the war in Ukraine. The transition certainly jarred as the parliamentary president announced, amid booing from opposition MPs, a scheduled birthday congratulation message. Pressure is growing from Ukraine, and from German voters, to end German reliance on Russian energy imports. The German government is planning to stop imports of Russian oil and coal this year, with an end to Russian gas as soon as other sources are found. Berlin argues that a sudden ban would harm Germany more than Russia, sparking mass unemployment here. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck is now on a whirlwind global tour to drum up energy from elsewhere. After a visit to Norway yesterday, he announced a deal to boost imports of Norwegian gas and this week he'll fly to Qatar. This may not satisfy German voters. In polls a majority say they want an instant embargo on Russian energy. But then it may be impossible to fulfil the electorate's demands - in other surveys an overwhelming majority of German voters also say that energy costs are already too high.

"Russia has claimed it has made a key interest payment to international investors and avoided a debt default. Western sanctions were imposed on Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine, freezing its access to its foreign currency reserves. Russia says it has made $117m payments on two dollar-denominated bonds, but investors have not yet reportedly been paid. If the payments are not made by 30 April, then Russia would be in default. In announcing that Russia had made the debt payment, Russian finance minister Anton Siluanov said he was not sure if money would go through because of sanctions. ""We have the money, we have made the payment, now the ball is in the court, primarily, of the American authorities."" The US Treasury Department has said that current sanctions would not stop Russia from paying this bill. Despite the confusion, if the debt is not ultimately paid by the end of the 30-day grace period, then Russia will have defaulted on its debts. Credit ratings agencies have warned that a Russian debt default is ""imminent"". The Russian government - and firms such as Gazprom, Lukoil and Sberbank - owe about $150bn to overseas investors. Most of this is in either dollars or euros, and interest and repayments must be made in those currencies. But sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean it has lost access to a large proportion of its $630bn (Â£470bn) in foreign currency reserves. However, it still receives dollars for the oil, gas and other things it sells abroad, and that foreign currency is accessible. If Russia does default, it would be its first debt default since 1998. It would also be its first default on a foreign-currency debt since the 1917 revolution when the new Bolshevik government refused to recognize the debts of the last tsar. Russia could try to pay in roubles. Its foreign ministry has said it would pay international investors in roubles if it were stopped from paying them in dollars or euros. Most of Russia's debts need to be paid in dollars or euros, but debt agreements do allow for different currencies to be used - in which case paying in roubles could be acceptable. This would depend on whether the rouble payment was judged to be the same value as the original dollar or euro amount investors were expecting. Investors in Russia have seen the value of their investments slump in recent days. The problem for many will have been the swiftness of Russia's fall from financial grace, which has left them with little time to react by selling-off their holdings. Credit ratings agency Moody's says that in its 21-point ratings scale, which indicates how reliable a country is as a place to invest, Russia's rating is at its second-lowest, and could fall still further. Moody's says this rating means that it expects Russia to default, and that it is warning investors in Russia that they could lose between 35% and 65% of their money. Investors in Russia have seen the value of their investments slump in recent days The last time Russia defaulted - in 1998 - it sent shocks through the financial markets. A default now would be hugely symbolic but is ""unlikely to have significant ramifications,"" says Capital Economics chief economist William Jackson. The IMF has said it will downgrade its forecast of 4.4% global economic growth in 2022 as a result of the war. However, IMF head Kristalina Georgieva has also discounted the idea of a wider shock to the global financial system from a Russian default. But she warned that the sanctions imposed on Russia would lead to a ""deep recession"" there, and that the war would drive up global food and energy prices. The unknown factor, as yet, is what debt defaults there may be by Russian firms - and what impact these may have on overseas investors who have heavily invested in Russia. Russia's central bank has significantly raised interest rates in a bid to curb inflation Any debt default is likely to exacerbate Russia's financial and economic problems. Before it invaded Ukraine, Russia was considered one of the most creditworthy countries in the world, with low debt levels. But things have dramatically changed. Foreign firms have left in droves, and Moscow has already imposed strict credit controls to limit the outflow of money in order to protect its economy and the rouble. Despite this, Russia's economy is set to shrink 7% this year as a result of sanctions. Inflation in February was already 9.15% before the invasion of Ukraine. It is now forecast to surge significantly this year - despite Russia's central bank raising interest rates from 9.5% to 20%.

"Measures to criminalise cyber-flashing and give a right to appeal against the removal of social media posts are among changes the government has proposed to its Online Harms Bill. The bill, which also seeks to tackle access to harmful material online, has been introduced to parliament. It would give regulator Ofcom the power to fine firms or block access to sites that fail to comply with the new rules. But Labour says delays to the bill mean disinformation in the UK has increased. The bill - originally announced in 2019 - covers a wide array of topics relating to harmful material online. Online Safety Bill: New offences and tighter rules Harmful and illegal content could evade new laws, MPs warn Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Big social media companies will be required to assess risks of the types of legal harms against adults which could arise on their services, and will have to set out how they will deal with them - and enforce these terms consistently. Definitions of these legal harms will be set out in additional legislation, but potential examples could include material promoting self-harm, eating disorders or harassment. Some of the additional aspects of the bill announced as it was introduced to Parliament include: Criminalising the sending of unsolicited sexual images to people using social media, known as cyber-flashing Giving people the right to appeal if they feel their social media posts were removed unfairly Preventing online scams, such as paid-for fraudulent adverts, investment fraud and romance scammers Requiring pornography websites to verify their users' ages Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the bill meant technology companies would not be left to ""check their own homework"". ""Tech firms haven't been held to account when harm, abuse and criminal behaviour have run riot on their platform,"" she said. This video can not be played Fitness influencer Elle Edwards speaks about dealing with explicit messages and cyber-flashing The bill will give new powers to Ofcom, which will be able to request information from companies, and executives who do not comply could face up to two years in prison within two months of the bill becoming law. Senior managers would also be criminally liable if they destroyed evidence, did not attend an Ofcom interview, provided false information, or otherwise obstructed the regulator from entering offices. Any firm breaching the rules would face a fine of up to 10% of its turnover, while non-compliant websites could be blocked entirely. Children's charity Barnardo's welcomed the announcement sites showing pornographic material would have to check the ages of users. ""We know from our work with children and young people across the UK that exposure to pornography can have a harmful impact on their mental health and understanding of what makes a healthy relationship,"" chief executive Lynn Perry said. And a City of London Police Authority Board spokesperson said included paid-for advertising in the legislation was ""a major step forward in the fight to reduce online crime, and helps cement the benefits of including fraud as a priority harm"". But shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell likened said the bill's delays had ""allowed the Russian regime's disinformation to spread like wildfire online"". She added: ""Other groups have watched and learned their tactics, with Covid conspiracy theories undermining public health and climate deniers putting our future at risk."" The legislation has taken some time to reach the stage where a bill is now to be laid before Parliament. An Online Harms White Paperwas first introduced in April 2019by the Conservative government - then led by Theresa May. At the time, privacy organisations such as the Open Rights Group warned that the bill could threaten freedom of expression. Commenting on the length of the delay, Jim Killock, Open Rights Group executive director said: ""The fact that the bill keeps changing its content after four years of debate should tell everyone that it is a mess, and likely to be a bitter disappointment in practice.""

"Ben Wallace and Priti Patel are leading members of the cabinet Two UK ministers have revealed they have been targeted with hoax calls linked to the conflict in Ukraine. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace blamed Russian ""dirty tricks"" after revealing a man had called him earlier pretending to be Ukraine's prime minister. He became suspicious and ended the call after the ""imposter"" posed ""several misleading questions"", he said. Home Secretary Priti Patel then tweeted that she had received a similar call earlier this week. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Mr Wallace had ordered an immediate inquiry into what happened. It was not immediately clear who was behind the call, but Mr Wallace linked the incident to Russia and President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. In a tweet,externalabout the call, Mr Wallace wrote: ""No amount of Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks can distract from Russia's human rights abuses and illegal invasion of Ukraine. A desperate attempt."" Replying to him shortly afterwards, Ms Patel said: ""This also happened to me earlier this week. Pathetic attempt at such difficult times to divide us. We stand with Ukraine"". A Ministry of Defence source said it was a ""fairly sophisticated"" video call that was not made to Mr Wallace's own mobile phone. The source said the call came to him via ""another government department"", which added to its credibility. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Kyiv residents record life under siege ANALYSIS:Putin will search for a way to save face BUSINESS:The Western brands unable to leave Russia IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict It is understood that Mr Wallace was put through to a Microsoft Teams video call which lasted about 10 minutes. The video call was set up after an email, purportedly from an aide at the Ukrainian embassy in London, was sent to a government department and then forwarded to the Ministry of Defence. The BBC has been told that the call to Mr Wallace involved someone posing as Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in front of a Ukrainian flag, who asked a range of ""wild questions"". Mr Shmyhal later replied to Mr Wallacein a tweet,external, writing: ""Despite all attempts of Russian disinformation, the world can see that the truth is behind Ukraine."" Denys Shmyhal, shown here at a press conference in January, has been Ukraine's PM since March 2020 During the call, Mr Wallace was asked about Nato and the state of the negotiations taking place between Ukraine and Russia, the defence source added. Mr Wallace was apparently asked about whether the UK would send warships to the Black Sea, and if Ukraine should get nuclear weapons. The defence secretary was also apparently asked about the prospect of Ukraine dropping its ambition to join Nato and becoming a ""neutral"" state. The defence source said Mr Wallace ""was asked leading questions to encourage inappropriate comments"" but he ""didn't say anything that was not factual or appropriate"". But defence sources say they are concerned that there may be an attempt to distort or edit Mr Wallace's answers before he terminated the call. Mr Wallace was on a visit to the Polish capital Warsaw when he shared the tweet about the hoax call. The calls come at a time of sensitive peace talks between Ukraine and Russia as the war launched by President Vladimir Putin three weeks ago exacts an ever-higher human cost. The UK government has been providing military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine while imposing punishing economic sanctions on Russia. Since the war started, there have been regular conversations between British and Ukrainian ministers, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"Interest rates have increased for the third time in four months as the Bank of England tries to calm the rise in the cost of living. The rise from 0.5% to 0.75% means rates are now at their highest level since March 2020, when Covid lockdowns began. Energy bills and food costs are increasing and there is concern the war in Ukraine will push prices up further. The Bank has warned inflation, the rate at which prices rise, may reach 8% and possibly higher, in the coming months. Explaining why it had lifted its forecast, it said that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia ""has led to further large increases in energy and other commodity prices including food prices. ""It is also likely to exacerbate global supply chain disruptions, and has increased the uncertainty around the economic outlook significantly,"" it added. Prices had already increased by 5.5% in the year to January, the fastest rate for 30 years and well above the Bank's 2% inflation target. The Office for National Statistics  (ONS) said that energy and fuel prices had contributed to the rising cost of living. How the interest rate rise might affect you How high could UK interest rates go? The Bank's policymakers cited the rising cost of living and strong employment as the reasons for the latest rate rise. The members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) felt that ""given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist"", an interest rate rise was justified. It also warned that inflation could hit double-digits later in the year if energy prices push up the energy price cap. The MPC voted by a majority of 8-1 for the move, with deputy Bank governor Jon Cunliffe the only member to vote for keeping rates unchanged. He said this was because of the impact of rapid price rises on household incomes. The committee said that more interest rate rises ""might be appropriate in coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgement depending on how medium-term prospects evolved."" The invasion of Ukraine was likely to push prices up even faster than the Bank expected at its last meeting in February, it added. ""The economy had recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was another such shock,"" it wrote. Morag Milligan is the operations manager at Milligan's Coaches Morag Milligan, the operations manager at Milligan's Coaches in East Ayrshire, said that the business had barely recovered from the shock of coronavirus-related lockdowns and travel restrictions. Citing rising fuel prices, she said: ""It feels it's just never-ending for the industry... it's crisis after crisis."" The company has seen an 8% increase in fuel costs which had been a drain on resources. ""The increase just makes it harder and harder to run,"" she said. About two million households will see an immediate increase in their mortgage payments as a result of the rise in rates, according to UK Finance. The increase will add about Â£26 a month to the cost of a typical tracker mortgage, and Â£16 to the cost of a typical standard variable rate mortgage. The Bank said that higher global prices for energy and other goods were responsible for the faster rise in inflation than the MPC predicted at its last rate-setting meeting. However, it expects inflation to ""fall back materially"" once prices stop rising and the impact of inflation on household incomes starts to bite. While the headline impact of a rise in rates will be felt by homeowners on variable rate mortgages, the big change today was in the mood music at the Bank of England. Last month, it indicated that the rise was the first in a series likely over the coming months. That language has been toned down and indeed there was one member of the committee who voted to keep them on hold. This indicates that the Bank is nervous about the economic impact of the massive rise in energy and food prices. More nervous than it is about the fact that already eye-watering 30 year highs for inflation, are not just going to be even higher at 8%, but potentially breach that by the end of the year. The Russian invasion is one of a series of so-called ""stagflationary"" shocks, that send both growth figures and inflation figures in the wrong direction. There is not much the Bank can do to stop the energy price cap and food prices sending the increase in the cost of living to 9 or 10%. But it is signalling its concern about the overall impact on the economy of a prolonged hit to consumers, from events 1,500 miles away. But the union Unite hit out at the Bank's decision, with its general secretary Sharon Graham saying that it comes at a time when ""millions of working people are facing the worst cost-of-living crisis for generations"". ""This rise will put even more pressure on household finances as inflation and energy bills continue to skyrocket."" Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that energy bills were already set to increase in April with the rise in the energy price cap. The British Chambers of Commerce argued that higher rates will do little to curb some of the global causes behind the surge in prices and risk intensifying the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses. Suren Thiru, its head of economics, urged the chancellor to use his Spring Statement on 23 March to tackle the ""cost of doing business crisis"" by delaying the National Insurance rise and introducing a temporary energy price cap for businesses.

"Patrick Jephson was Princess Diana's private secretary for eight years The BBC has paid damages to the former private secretary of Diana, Princess of Wales, for the ""harm caused to him"" over Martin Bashir's Panorama interview.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin and Joe Biden met virtually after Mr Martin tested positive for Covid US President Joe Biden has warned that too much ""blood, sweat and tears"" have been shed on the Good Friday Agreement to change it now. He also praised the Irish government's response to the Ukrainian conflict in bringing in 7,000 refugees. The president was speaking during a virtual meeting with Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin to celebrate St Patrick's Day. The talks were held remotely after Mr Martin tested positive for Covid. President Biden said he was disappointed the two leaders could not meet in person. In reply the taoiseach said they met virtually last year across the Atlantic because of the pandemic and now they year were meeting virtually across the road. President Biden then reaffirmed his government support for the Good Friday Agreement,the deal which ended the worst of almost 30 years of violenceknown as the Troubles. ""I want to emphasise this administration's unequivocal support for the Good Friday accord,"" he said ""I think too much blood, sweat and tears have been shed to get that done. And this is no time to change it."" Mr Martin tested positive for Covid on Wednesday night Both leaders also talked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the taoiseach praised the president's ""firm and measured"" response to the war President Biden said he was impressed with the Republic of Ireland's response in brining in more than 7,000 Ukrainian refugees. Mr Martin had to isolate after he was informed of a positive Covid test while attending the Ireland Fund dinner in Washington on Wednesday night. At the time he was sitting alongside House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other guests. The taoiseach had been due to receive an international leadership award at the event. However, when the moment arrived Ireland's Ambassador to the United States, Dan Mulhall, took to the stage and confirmed the positive test. He said Mr Martin had tested negative but then was re-tested after a member of his delegation received a positive result. He said the taoiseach had re-tested out of an ""abundance of caution"" and added that he was in ""good form"" but very disappointed. ""It is a sad thing which I have to do which is to deliver the taoiseach's speech on his behalf,"" he said. PARADES:St Patrick's Day events return after pandemic FEATURE:America's most Irish towns celebrate VIDEO:Bartenders toast 'book-end to pandemic craziness' Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, who was at the dinner, said it was a big blow for the taoiseach. ""It is very sad. This is a major event for any taoiseach, going into the White House on St Patrick's Day, and that now won't happen. I feel very sorry for him,"" he said He said the news had left everyone ""deflated"" at the dinner and with the taoiseach's office due to be rotated later this year, he said Mr Martin would not get another chance to celebrate St Patrick's Day in the White House. The water in the White House north lawn fountain was turned green to mark St Patrick's Day in 2021 During the gala dinner on Wednesday, President Biden and Mrs Pelosi addressed the gathering. Mrs Pelosi issued a warning to the UK over the Northern Ireland Protocol. She said that if the ""border is hardened there will be no UK-US trade deal"".

"P&O Ferries operates between Larne and Cairnryan It will be another week before P&O ships can operate from Larne Port after the ferry company sacked 800 staff, a Stormont minister has said. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons was speaking after some crew members refused to leave their ships. Private security officers were sent onto a ship docked at Larne Harbour in County Antrim, to remove staff. The local MP said the tactics were ""Dickensian"". P&O said without changes the business ""would not be viable"". The RMT union said staff at Larne had been told to clear their lockers and leave, but they had advised them to remain at their posts. They said crew members were being replaced with agency staff. RMT union said staff on board in Larne had been told to clear their lockers and leave An RMT spokesman said it was an ""absolutely disgraceful way to treat loyal P&O staff who have worked through the pandemic"". One man who spoke to BBC News NI said he had been working with P&O since 2013 and said he ""didn't think [he] was going to be hit with redundancy today"". ""We got basically calls that there was a company representative coming,"" he said. ""And security came on and made sure that we got off the ship. ""We went through a lot over the last two years with the pandemic and all that kind of stuff, but didn't think it would end like this."" Other workers who were told they had lost their jobs called the move ""disgusting"", while one said if they had been told what was happening, ""it wouldn't have been such a bitter pill to swallow"". ""We just found out through social media. Basically that it was a takeover, there was a new crew coming and all the P&O vessels were tied up,"" one worker said. Mr Lyons said: ""The company have informed us that it will be another week before ships can operate from Larne Port. ""Whilst customers have been directed to Belfast Port in the short term, they will not have the capacity to ramp up operations in a sufficient manner to accommodate demand. ""With over half of all our freight moving through Larne Port, this announcement will also cause supply problems for companies and supermarkets in Northern Ireland, as well as those firms based here who sell to GB."" The union said workers at the company were being replaced with agency staff Mr Lyons is a DUP assembly member for the east Antrim constituency in which Larne is located. He said the chief executive of P&O had assured him ""that there will be no redundancies in the Port of Larne and that the company will be making an investment in the future to enhance the attractiveness of the port"". Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP for East Antrim, said he was ""appalled"" at the way the move had been handled and that the company had done itself ""reputational damage"" through its actions. ""We are in the 21st century and this is kind of Dickensian stuff that we are listening to here,"" he said. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said she was ""shocked"" at P&O's decision and along with Mr Lyons called for the transport secretary to ""take every possible step to save jobs and to maintain connectivity for passengers and freight on Irish Sea routes"". She said Stormont departments were working to ""assess any local impacts, especially for supply chains"". P&O Ferries sacks 800 but crew refuse to leave ships Mickey Smith from the trade union, Nautilus, said he was ""utterly disgusted"" at the treatment of staff. P&O services scheduled included three between Liverpool and Dublin and seven between Larne and Cairnryan in Dumfries and Galloway. Earlier, P&O said its survival was dependent on ""making swift and significant changes now"". The ferry firm said the ""tough decision"" was made to secure the future of the business. Workers who left the European Causeway will tell you that they weren't expecting to be told they were losing their jobs. Several of them took a bus to a security fence and came through the gate trundling their suitcases with them after they made the decision to leave. Staff were told of the company's decision on Thursday Many others decided to stay on board and defy their management. It's now confirmed that no P&O ships are likely to sail for five to seven days whilst the situation sorts itself out. The queues of motorists hoping to get on board from this morning have now gone and the terminal at Larne is largely empty. P&O ferries say they are securing the company's future. That's of little comfort to the seafaring staff who brought the European causeway into harbour, only to be told to clear their lockers and go ashore. Amanda McMaw was due to travel from Larne to Cairnryan on Saturday to visit family in Motherwell but said now ""it's all a bit up in the air"". ""We haven't heard anything directly from P&O ferries, all we've heard is what's been on the news and on social media,"" she said. ""We are trying to get booked with an alternative ferry provider and hoping still to be able to travel on Saturday but prices are going up and everything seems to be getting booked up quite quickly. ""We're not sure what will happen with our current booking, whether that will be refunded."" The ferries were tied up on Thursday morning The Deputy Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Council, Matthew Armstrong, said he did not believe that Belfast port had the capacity to deal with overflow from Larne. ""There are several large supermarkets that exclusively use the port of Larne. There are many small haulage firms who do similar and without someone stepping in with additional ferries, in the meantime, things will begin to grind to a halt,"" he said. Seamus Leheny, of Logistics UK, said the move had implications for perishable goods coming into NI. ""The Larne - Cairnryan route handles around about a quarter of the lorries that move between GB and Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""Larne is the fastest sea connection between Northern Ireland and GB and it makes it very appealing for perishable goods. ""We really need to focus on making sure whatever contingency plans that we have moving the freight onto other routes into Belfast."" It is unclear whether Belfast port will be able to pick up the overflow of business. Patricia Coulter from the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) said this is a ""difficult situation"" for those who have been affected. Ms Coulter said it is ""quite unusual to get something of this scale, and the immediacy of it"". ""There is legislation in place to protect employees in situations where they are being made redundant,"" she said. ""It sets out very clearly what procedures and processes that must be followed and what entitlements they have."" P&O has said that its services will not operate for the ""next few days"", with passengers told to use other companies. ""In its current state, P&O Ferries is not a viable business,"" it said. ""We have made a Â£100m loss year on year, which has been covered by our parent DP World. ""This is not sustainable.  Without these changes there is no future for P&O Ferries.""

"This video can not be played P&O Ferries workers were told via video that it ""was their final day of employment"" P&O Ferries has sparked outrage after sacking 800 staff with plans to replace them with cheaper agency workers. Staff were told in a video call that Thursday was their ""final day of employment"", but some refused to leave their ships in protest and were removed. P&O said it was a ""tough"" decision but it would ""not be a viable business"" without the changes. But the government called the workers' treatment ""wholly unacceptable"". And the RMT union is threatening legal action against the ferry company, calling it one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Further protests on Friday are being organised in Dover, Liverpool and Hull. ""Reports of workers being given zero notice and escorted off their ships... shows the insensitive way in which P&O have approached this issue,"" said Robert Courts, parliamentary under secretary for transport. ""I am extremely concerned and frankly angry at the way workers have been treated by P&O."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Courts said the company had told him it will be suspending services for ""a week to 10 days while they locate new crew"" on the Dover to Calais, Larne to Cairnryan, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam routes. On Friday morning, the company again said on Twitter it would not run services ""for the next few days"". Meanwhile, the Department for Transport says neither the Secretary of State, Grant Shapps, nor Mr Courts, was aware of what was happening with P&O until Thursday. This video can not be played Sacked P&O employee Andrew Smith said he felt ""utter dismay"" at losing his job after 22 years' service The BBC has seen details of a contract for handcuff-trained security professionals which began two days before they were deployed to Dover to remove staff from ferries. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said P&O's ""secret plan"" to sack staff with no notice was ""reprehensible"". P&O passengers were told to use DFDS while services were suspended. RMT union members blocked traffic in Dover on Thursday in response to the 800 redundancies announced by P&O Ferries Crew on one ship docked at Larne Harbour in Northern Ireland had lifted the gangway after private security officers arrived to remove them. The crew has now left the ship and Gary Jackson, a full time officer and RMT union member onboard the Pride of Hull, said they were ""absolutely devastated"". 'We've been abandoned by P&O' say sacked staff ""At 11am ratings and officers were informed there was going to be a pre-recorded Zoom meeting. After that two to three-minute call all the crew were made redundant,"" he said. ""I've seen grown men crying on there because they don't know where they're going to go from today."" This video can not be played Robert Courts says he is ""frankly angry"" at the way P&O Ferries staff have been treated James, who has worked for P&O Ferries in Dover for around four years, said he felt abandoned by the company after all he received ""was a three minute pre-recorded message saying we are out of a job. Nothing else."" ""It was a complete surprise. I would have understood if it was at the height of Covid, but now we're seeing the end of travel restrictions and the start of summer bookings. So this has come completely out of the blue,"" he said. Mark Canet-Baldwin, from Hull, was one of the agency workers brought to Cairnryan to take over from the crew that were being sacked. But after talking it through with his wife, he said: ""I felt I can't do it. I felt sick to my stomach. And I walked off. Two others came with me. It's just wrong."" P&O Ferries are currently suspended Workers are reported to have been escorted off their ships while being told that cheaper alternatives will take up their roles. ""The approach adopted by P&O is not unheard of, but it is exceptional to forego appropriate notice and consultation processes,"" said Nathan Donaldson, employment solicitor at Keystone Law. He said a government review of firing and rehiring in November 2021 did not outlaw the practice but emphasised ""that it should be a process of last resort"". Rustom Tata, chairman and head of the employment group at law firm DMH Stallard, said P&O's actions would affect the brand's reputation due to the ""apparently wholly planned approach being taken to such a large proportion of its workforce ignoring some of the basic fundamentals of employee relations."" Ann Francke, chief executive of The Chartered Management Institute, said P&O had ""got it very wrong"". ""It's shocking and appalling. It's like management behaviour from another era,"" she said. P&O said its survival was dependent on ""making swift and significant changes now"". ""We have made a Â£100m loss year on year, which has been covered by our parent DP World. This is not sustainable. Without these changes there is no future for P&O Ferries."" The cross-Channel operator said on Twitter that sailings between Dover and Calais scheduled for Thursday will no longer run, and customers with tickets were instructed to sail with rival ferry company DFDS. P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. However, like many transport operators it saw demand slump in the pandemic. The firm claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees. P&O is owned by DP World, the multi-national ports and logistics company based in Dubai. It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020. Diane Riley has travelled to Rotterdam for a Northern Soul event Diane Riley has travelled with a friend from Hull to Rotterdam with P&O for a Northern Soul event. She was on a day trip to Amsterdam on Thursday when she heard from her daughter in the UK that P&O had suspended its services. ""It was a shock,"" says Diane, adding: ""I thought she was joking at first."" She got a text from the company at around 4pm, advising her to return to the ferry to spend the night. She says passengers have been told they may be put on a DFDS ferry to Newcastle on Friday morning, and will then be taken back to Hull by coach. ""We don't know anything for certain - we'll have to wait and see what happens when we get back to the ferry,"" she says. Meanwhile, Lauren Shaw and her husband told the BBC they were booked with P&O to travel on a ferry from Cairnryan to Larne at 4pm on Thursday. ""We had a phone call at 10am to tell us there would be no sailings today and that they hadn't been told a reason why,"" she said. They travelled to the port in the hope getting a ferry, but said: ""It's really frustrating."" Are you affected by issues covered in this story? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Limiting the amount of time MPs spend on second jobs would be ""impractical"", the government has said. Boris Johnson called for a review of MPs' outside work last year after a number of high-profile controversies. At the time, the prime minister backed proposals to place ""reasonable limits"" on hours spent on other jobs. But Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay has now said the measure would not work and also cast doubt on a proposed cap on outside earnings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of ""breaking his promise"" to tackle ""a scandal of his own making"" over second jobs. MPs under scrutiny over their second jobs MPs back government plans to curb second jobs The issue of MPs' second jobs came to the fore in 2021 when the then-Conservative MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken lobbying rules. This video can not be played Boris Johnson is ""saying one thing and doing another"" over MPs taking second jobs says Sir Keir Starmer. It caused chaos in government and accusations of sleaze after No 10 attempted an overhaul of the standards system, which would have stopped Mr Paterson from being suspended from the Commons. He later resigned as an MP. The furore led to increased scrutiny of the work MPs do outside of Parliament, with a lot of focus on former Attorney General Sir Geoffrey Cox, who earned around Â£900,000 in 2020 through his work as a lawyer. MPs later backed government plans to prevent them taking on certain jobs, with No 10 saying any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be ""within reasonable limits"" and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents. A definition of what that meant was not given, but International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan suggested 15 hours a week as a reasonable limit. However, in the letter from Mr Barclay, the government now appears to have moved away from that pledge. The minister reiterated the government's desire for a ban on MPs providing paid parliamentary advice, consultancy, or strategy services. But while he acknowledged a time limit was considered ""necessary"" by some, he said it would be ""impractical"". In a submission to the Commons standards committee,first reported by the Guardian,external, Mr Barclay wrote: ""It is the government's initial view that the imposition of fixed constraints such as time limits on the amount of time that members can spend on outside work would be impractical. ""The imposition of time limits would not necessarily serve to address recent concerns over paid advocacy and the primary duty of MPs to serve their constituents."" When it came to a cap on earnings, Mr Barclay also had his doubts, writing that such a rule ""could serve to prohibit activities which do not bring undue influence to bear on the political system"", such as writing books. He said a long-serving MP ""could inadvertently reach the 'ceiling' through earnings accrued over time"", and he questioned ""whether it would be fair to subject that member to a standards investigation"". He added: ""To avoid this issue would require a substantive earning threshold to be set such that it would not serve to prevent MPs from taking on outside work for which they were properly remunerated in line with salaries in that sector. ""The introduction of such an arbitrary cap therefore may not have the intended effect of ensuring that members prioritise their parliamentary duties and the needs of their constituents."" Former Attorney General Sir Geoffrey Cox came under the spotlight last year, after it was revealed he earned Â£900,000 for his legal work But Labour's Sir Keir hit out at the PM for failing to deliver on his promise to tackle the issue. ""[Mr Johnson] said he was going to deal with second jobs and there was going to be this cap,"" he told reporters. ""That was his proposal at the height of this scandal of his own making. ""Now, as soon as he gets the opportunity, he is breaking his promise yet again."" He added: ""It goes to the heart of the problem with this prime minister, which is this problem of trust and moral authority.""

"The Ukrainian leader expressed outrage that some German companies were still operating in Russia Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has told German MPs that a new type of Berlin Wall is being built, dividing Europe between freedom and oppression. He thanked Germany for its support during Russia's invasion. But it was uncomfortable listening for many MPs as he criticised German energy policy and business interests for contributing to that wall of division. Over the past week, Mr Zelensky has given a master class in how to pitch his message to allies. On Wednesday, he addressed US Congress, referring to Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 terror attacks. On Tuesday he asked Canada's parliament to envisage bombs and missiles falling on Toronto, Vancouver and Edmonton. Last week, his address to the House of Commons in London was partly a homage to Winston Churchill's wartime speeches. His emotive speech to the German parliament, the Bundestag, was equally tailored to appeal to his audience with well-chosen historical parallels. Some of his audience grew up in communist East Germany behind the Berlin Wall. During the Cold War, Germany's dogged negotiation and engagement with Moscow contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. Since then Germany has tried to use trade, business and energy links to integrate a peaceful Russia into the West. But Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago has destroyed many of those aspirations. The general political consensus in Germany now is that this may have been the wrong approach with Mr Putin's increasingly authoritarian and kleptocratic government. President Zelensky expressed outrage that some German businesses were still operating in Russia. The controversial, now cancelled, Russian-German gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 was ""cement for that new wall"" dividing Europe, he said. Germany's continued reluctance to allow Ukraine into the European Union was ""another brick"" in that new wall. ""Dear Mr Scholz, tear down this wall,"" he demanded of the German chancellor, repeating US President Ronald Reagan's historic demand to the Soviets in 1987 as he stood beside the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Many German ministers listening will agree with him. The Green Party, which in the new governing coalition is now responsible for energy policy within the powerful Economy Ministry, has for years been campaigning against Nord Stream 2. Even those who once supported the pipeline have changed their minds. Until recently Mr Scholz still referred to it as an non-political business matter. But as Russian troops gathered on Ukraine's borders, shortly before the invasion, he unexpectedly announced the newly finished pipeline would not be opening after all. Using another German Cold War analogy, in his speech President Zelensky said that Ukraine needed an airlift, and a no-fly zone to protect it, just as Cold War West Berlin had been saved by the Allied airlift in 1948-49. He also reminded Germany of its responsibility to make up for Nazi crimes in Ukraine, saying Ukrainian towns and cities were being destroyed for the second time in 80 years. This was a well-judged comment - Germany does guilt well. But for now there is no time for national bouts of repentance and soul searching. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine and nearby WATCH:Kyiv residents record life under siege ANALYSIS:Putin will search for a way to save face BUSINESS:The Western brands unable to leave Russia IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict President Zelensky's speech was greeted by long applause and standing ovations. The main opposition party, the conservative CDU, expressed outrage that after the address the chamber went on to discuss normal parliamentary business, instead of debating the war in Ukraine. The transition certainly jarred as the parliamentary president announced, amid booing from opposition MPs, a scheduled birthday congratulation message. Pressure is growing from Ukraine, and from German voters, to end German reliance on Russian energy imports. The German government is planning to stop imports of Russian oil and coal this year, with an end to Russian gas as soon as other sources are found. Berlin argues that a sudden ban would harm Germany more than Russia, sparking mass unemployment here. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck is now on a whirlwind global tour to drum up energy from elsewhere. After a visit to Norway yesterday, he announced a deal to boost imports of Norwegian gas and this week he'll fly to Qatar. This may not satisfy German voters. In polls a majority say they want an instant embargo on Russian energy. But then it may be impossible to fulfil the electorate's demands - in other surveys an overwhelming majority of German voters also say that energy costs are already too high.

"Ocado has reported a fall in sales as customers return to pre-pandemic shopping habits and costs increase. In the three months to the end of February, retail sales for the online grocer fell 5.7% to Â£574.7m. It said the return to the office by workers and the ""euphoria"" of going back out to restaurants after restrictions eased had reduced demand. Rising costs and changing shopping habits saw the group cut its sales forecast for the year. It now expects annual retail revenue growth ""closer to 10%"", rather than in the mid-teens, as it said last month. But the results for its latest quarter also reflected a tough comparison from a year before, when the UK was in lockdown, Ocado added. Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco Shop prices rise at fastest rate in a decade ""The main thing that we're seeing [now] is people's willingness to behave more like they did pre-Covid,"" Ocado said. ""We've got two off-setting things at the moment though, where some people are still working from home several days a week- and that is a 'basket booster'. ""But that is getting offset by a bit of euphoria about that fact we can go back out to a restaurant, having been cooped up for two years [during Covid-related restrictions]."" Compared with pre-pandemic levels, Ocado's retail sales in the quarter were up 31.7%. ""The last quarter has been encouraging for Ocado Retail despite the clearly evident challenges the industry and consumers are facing,"" said Melanie Smith, Ocado Retail's boss. ""As we have seen since the end of Covid restrictions, the value of the average basket and shape of the week continue to normalise as we return towards the rhythm of our pre-Covid lives."" Although it saw a 15% drop in the average customer's basket size, Ocado said it was encouraged by an increase in the number of new shoppers on the platform. But the retailer acknowledged that war in Ukraine and uncertainty over how demand will change during the cost of living crisis meant it was difficult to predict sales. It said it had increased the prices of some products already ""where costs could not be mitigated"". However, it is not yet seeing price rises as high as the current rate of inflation, which stands at 5.5% - the highest level seen in 30 years. The group also insisted that it was a ""price follower"", which tries to match the prices of its big competitors. Tesco's chairman warned recently that ""the worst is yet to come"" on rising food prices. John Allan told the BBC he was aware people were on very tight budgets and having to choose between food and heating ""troubles us"", but added that grocers and suppliers were not immune from rising energy costs. Ocado noted that it might be affected by rising energy costs in particular, due to the amount required to power the refrigerators in its distribution hubs and fuel required for its drivers. Separately, online delivery giant Deliveroo reported that its losses have deepened as the costs of its rapid expansion stack up. The company posted a Â£298m pre-tax loss for the year, compared with a Â£213m loss in 2020, but stressed that it had a long-term plan for profitability. It said its heavy losses for the past year were driven by big investments in marketing and technology improvements as it sought to keep up the momentum of orders being boosted during lockdowns, similar to Ocado. In its UK business, order numbers increased by 72%. But it also predicted a slowdown in growth over the coming year. Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""For now it does appear that some pandemic habits are sticking around, with restaurant deliveries staying popular, on-call groceries increasingly in demand and a growing source of revenue for Deliveroo. ""But the cost-of-living squeeze is intensifying and as savings are eaten away, there may be less appetite to pay for an easier life.""

"An image used to promote tanning products by one seller Dozens of social-media influencers are promoting banned tanning products to millions of followers, a BBC News investigation has found. It is illegal in the UK to sell nasal sprays or injectables made with ""melanotan-2"", an artificial hormone that can accelerate tanning. The unlicensed drug is dangerous, dermatologists say, and users should stop immediately. And there is evidence the untested products may be linked to skin cancer. The Advertising Standards Authority says all influencers must act responsibly, including ensuring products and the companies they link to are not acting illegally. Watch ' Toxic tans': Dangerous tanning products uncoveredon iPlayer Liv and Elaina both longed for a tan like the models on their social-media feeds. When influencers and friends started sporting golden-brown skin, they wanted to know their secret. Soon, Liv was ordering tanning injections from a UK-based website. Elaina opted for a nasal spray, which she bought on social media. For two months, Liv, from Leeds, jabbed her stomach and then went on a sunbed, which she had been told would ""activate"" the drug. It gave her headaches but she felt it was worth it - until, eight months later, she found a strangely shaped mole on her thigh. ""It was dark and raised, about the size of a pea,"" she says. ""I'm not a 'moley' person, so I knew something wasn't right."" Doctors agreed with Liv. But shortly after the mole was removed, she was diagnosed with stage-one melanoma, a skin cancer that can be life-threatening. Liv needed surgery to remove the cancerous tissue around the area where the mole had been and her dermatologist told her the injections were the likely cause. ""A cancer diagnosis is terrifying, never mind when you're 27 years old,"" she says. Liv was left with a scar the ""size of a letterbox"" Within minutes of her first nasal spray, Elaina's face ""burned up"" and turned bright red. ""I was told my body just needed to get used to it,"" she says. ""A week later, my throat started to close up - I literally couldn't breathe."" The 19-year-old, from Stockton-on-Tees, Durham, needed hospital treatment and was diagnosed with a serious throat and sinus infection. Doctors told her inhaling the tanning product was the cause and they had seen other patients develop similar symptoms after using it. BBC News has spoken to 20 people who have experienced complications, including lesions, fungal infections and abscesses. Melanotan-2 moles are described as ""dark"" and ""oddly shaped"" Melanotan-2 can increase the production of melanin, the pigment that darkens skin, but it has never had rigorous safety testing. Social-media sites have propelled the drug, previously sold in some gyms and salons, into the mainstream, with the trend mainly driven by young, white women. The recent introduction of a nasal spray can also make it seem more appealing. The British Association of Dermatologists is now on the alert for patients with warning signs of ""unusual orange tans"" and ""disordered moles"". Some sellers claim their products are safe - but Dr Catherine Borysiewicz, from the association, says the only safe tan is fake tan. ""We have evidence these products are potentially dangerous and can potentially lead to cancer,"" she says. ""We have cases which have shown melanoma developing after trying them. ""I talk about skin risks - but who knows what else it might be doing?"" An Instagram story by reality-TV star Bethan Kershaw reveals she has tried melanotan nasal sprays Dozens of influencers have posted about using melanotan-2. It is not illegal to use or promote these tanning products, despite the health risks, but it is illegal to sell them. Geordie Shore star Bethan Kershaw recently told her 700,000 followers she had used nasal sprays from a company called Real Tan. Both she and the company declined to comment. Other influencers are more explicit - TikTok star Lauren demonstrated on camera how to inhale the drug. A company had offered the 26-year-old, from Glasgow, free nasal sprays if she would promote their products. But after two months, she stopped taking them because they made her feel sick. ""As an influencer, I need to be more careful what I'm promoting,"" Lauren says. ""I have got to look out for my followers, a lot of them are young."" This video can not be played 'I won't promote banned tan again' BBC News has also seen many examples of celebrities directing their followers to businesses selling melanotan-2 products. The most high-profile example is reality-TV star Charlotte Crosby, who on one occasion told her followers to ""check out"" Real Tan and tagged the company in a separate post talking about her tan. A representative for Ms Crosby, who has 7.6 million Instagram followers, says she ""would never knowingly promote a company illegally selling unlicensed products"". We are told she has only ever used items from Real Tan which do not contain melanotan-2; these are moisturising creams ""gifted to her"" and gels she posted about as a favour, to promote their launch. But these clarifications were not mentioned in her posts. And there was no mention of creams or gels in Real Tan's price list after Ms Crosby posted about the seller, only injections and nasal sprays. A more recent price list says ""sun accelerator creams available soon"". A representative for Charlotte Crosby, says she ""would never knowingly promote a company illegally selling unlicensed products"" BBC News asked research chemists at Imperial College London to analyse 10 tanning kits. They would expect to find about 10 ingredients in a licensed medicine but were shocked to discover some of the products contained more than 100 unidentified ingredients. They also confirmed the presence of melanotan-2. ""If you don't know what you're taking, you should probably avoid it,"" Prof Tony Cass says. He likened the risk to Russian roulette but added: ""It's more like using a machine gun than a pistol."" The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it has spent 10 years targeting melanotan products. Instagram and TikTok say selling the drug on their platforms is banned and promotional content will be taken down. ""We care deeply about the health and wellbeing of our community. We do not allow the promotion of controlled substances,"" says A TikTok spokesperson. But despite this, the illegal tanning industry is thriving.

"This video can not be played Video shows Mariupol theatre destroyed in bombing Civilians are said to be emerging alive from the ruins of a theatre that, according to Ukrainian authorities, was bombed by Russia in the city of Mariupol. Despite pictures of devastation at the scene, many who were sheltering there are thought to have survived in a basement that withstood Wednesday's attack. For 10 days, that basement was a refuge for Kate, a 38-year-old Mariupol native, and her son, who is 17. Their own home, like many others in the besieged city, had been destroyed by Russian attacks, and they thought the Donetsk Regional Theatre of Drama was a place where they would be relatively safe. Mother and son squeezed in the building's dark rooms, corridors and halls with dozens of other families. Some women, Kate said, carried babies that were just four or five months old. ""In the beginning, it was really tough, because we didn't have a well-organised food supply. So on the first two days, adults didn't have any food,"" Kate, who used to work at the city's zoo shop and did not want to give her full name, said. ""We gave food only to the children."" They slept on improvised beds made with soft parts of auditorium seats which had been put together on the floor. The seats made of wood, she said, were cut in parts and used as firewood for them to cook. ""Around the theatre there wasn't enough trees we could use, and it was too dangerous to go outside"". For almost three weeks, Mariupol has been under constant shelling by Russian forces, which have completely surrounded the city. About 300,000 people are trapped, with no electricity, gas or running water. Food and medicine are running low, as Russia has prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid. Four days after she arrived, Kate said, Ukrainian forces managed to send some food supplies and a field kitchen to the theatre, and ""we [started] cooking something"". They would have soup, and sometimes oatmeal, for lunch, and tea with biscuits for dinner. The imposing Soviet-era building in Mariupol's city centre, next to the Sea of Azov waterfront, had been designated as a shelter for civilians. Sergei Orlov, the city's deputy mayor, said up to 1,200 people had been there. Human Rights Watch, citing interviews with evacuees, put that number at between 500 and 800. As Russia's relentless assault continued, Kate said the buildings around the theatre had been either damaged or destroyed. ""We knew we had to run away because something terrible would happen soon,"" she said. A day before the attack, Kate and her son left the site. ""We jumped in a car while the theatre and the area were being shelled,"" she said. They shared the vehicle with a family of four, who had brought four dogs and a cat. ""We asked to go with them, because we didn't have our own [car],"" she said. They were part of convoy of about 2,000 cars that escaped Mariupol on Tuesday. Mariupol city council said a Russian plane dropped a bomb on the theatre, calling the attack ""deliberate and cynical"". Russia denied it had targeted the site but, in Mariupol alone, its attacks had already hit several civilian buildings including a hospital, a church and countless apartment blocks. Satellite images released by the US company Maxar taken on Monday showed that the Russian word for ""children"" had been marked on the ground in large letters in two locations outside the building, to warn Russian jets away. A convoy of cars carrying evacuees from Mariupol arrives in the city of Zaporizhzhia Video of the aftermath showed smoke billowing from the building's collapsed faÃ§ade. But with communications with the city almost completely cut off, the numbers of survivors or possible casualties were still not clear, almost 20 hours later. Dmytro Gurin, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and originally from Mariupol, said the shelter in the basement of the building withstood the attack, and that teams were trying to clear the rubble which covered the entrance to the site. ""It looks like most of them have survived and are OK,"" he said. But the rescue efforts were tricky, he said, as Russia had continued to attack the area. ""Shelling never stops and artillery never stops and airplanes are dropping bombs,"" he said, ""so it's really difficult"". The city council estimates about 80% to 90% of the city's buildings have either been damaged or destroyed by Russia, which has attacked the city almost non-stop since it invaded Ukraine, three weeks ago. Entire neighbourhoods have been turned into wasteland. Local authorities say at least 2,400 people have been killed in Mariupol, although they acknowledge this is likely to be an underestimate. Many of the dead are being buried in mass graves. After leaving Mariupol, Kate was headed to the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, a region that has been largely spared of attacks. ""The first day after we managed to get out, I couldn't talk. We all just cried"", she said. ""But now it feels like there are no tears left. I don't think this pain will ever disappear.""

"The Pride of York was originally built in 1986 and was refurbished and refitted in 2017 Ferry operator P&O Ferries is to scrap its route between Hull and Belgium due to a sharp drop in demand because of coronavirus. It is understood the number of services between Dover and Calais will also be reduced and 140 jobs are at risk across the company. The RMT union said it was working with the ferry operator to protect jobs. P&O said due to the ""extended impact of Covid-19"" it was taking ""difficult action"" in making redundancies. The route connecting Hull with Zeebrugge in Belgium has been described as loss-making and is expected to close in the next few months The scrapping of the route means the Pride of York and the Pride of Bruges vessels will be taken out of service. The Dover to Calais crossing will continue to operate, but will be reduced from six ferries to four, with the freight ferry European Seaway and the Pride of Burgundy being stopped. The Pride of Burgundy is one of four ferries on the Dover to Calais route In a leaked consultation document sent to staff earlier this week, the company said a fall in tourist demand due to the pandemic and ongoing Brexit uncertainty were to blame. Darren Procter, national secretary for the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said the Hull to Zeebrugge crossing had been a ""challenging route for a number of years"" and the pandemic had compounded the problem. He added: ""The Pride of York is an ageing vessel and because of the future financial costs P&O made the decision to cut their losses."" Mr Proctor said scrapping the route would have a wider economic impact on Hull. ""The individuals travelling on these vessels will use local amenities, they might have a pub meal or stay in a hotel so it's going to have a knock on effect. ""Obviously Hull has a rich maritime heritage and a lot of industry connected to the sea so it's a shame it's going."" The Pride of York has not been running since the pandemic while the Pride of Bruges had returned to operation for a short period of time. Read more stories from across Hull and East Yorkshire Mr Proctor said the two affected ferries on the Dover to Calais route had not been in operation for some time and were both laid up in the Port of Leith in Edinburgh. A spokesperson for P&O said: ""Due to the extended impact of Covid-19, we are having to take further difficult action in which some jobs will be made redundant - but as a result thousands more jobs will be saved. ""These necessary steps will ensure we are a slimmer and more agile business that is better able to give customers the service they want and the value they demand."" Earlier this year theferry operator was criticised for announcing 1,100 job cutsafter taking advantage of the government's furlough scheme.

"This video can not be played P&O Ferries workers were told via video that it ""was their final day of employment"" P&O Ferries has sparked outrage after sacking 800 staff with plans to replace them with cheaper agency workers. Staff were told in a video call that Thursday was their ""final day of employment"", but some refused to leave their ships in protest and were removed. P&O said it was a ""tough"" decision but it would ""not be a viable business"" without the changes. But the government called the workers' treatment ""wholly unacceptable"". And the RMT union is threatening legal action against the ferry company, calling it one of the ""most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations"". Further protests on Friday are being organised in Dover, Liverpool and Hull.

The cross-Channel operator said on Twitter that sailings between Dover and Calais scheduled for Thursday will no longer run, and customers with tickets were instructed to sail with rival ferry company DFDS. P&O Ferries is one of the UK's leading ferry companies, carrying more than 10 million passengers a year before the pandemic and about 15% of all freight cargo in and out of the UK. However, like many transport operators it saw demand slump in the pandemic. The firm claimed almost Â£15m in government grants in 2020, which included furlough payments for its employees.

"This video can not be played Video shows Mariupol theatre destroyed in bombing Ukraine has accused Russian forces of bombing a theatre where civilians were sheltering in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov told the BBC that between 1,000 and 1,200 people had sought refuge in the building. While the number of casualties is unclear, a local MP said the basement where people were gathered had withstood the bombing. ""It looks like most of them have survived,"" Dmytro Gurin told the BBC. But Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the city's mayor, earlier said emergency workers were struggling to reach the building due to constant shelling. Images of the theatre, verified by the BBC, showed extensive damage and smoke rising from the site. Russia's air strikes and shells have previously hit a maternity hospital, a church and apartment buildings. Mariupol's city council said in a statement that Russian forces ""deliberately and cynically destroyed"" the theatre, saying a ""plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding"". Both Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, and the city council accused Russia of a ""war crime"" in the wake of the attack. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the bombing and said Russia had deliberately targeted the theatre. ""Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people. To our Mariupol,"" he said in a video address late on Wednesday evening. Satellite pictures taken on 14 March - released by the US company Maxar - showed the Russian word for ""children"" had been marked on the ground in large letters to warn Russian jets away from the building. The BBC was earlier told that many children and elderly people were sheltering inside, and that conditions were quickly deteriorating. Local authorities say at least 2,400 people have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war, although they acknowledge this is likely to be an underestimate. Many of the dead are being buried in mass graves. An estimated 300,000 residents are trapped inside the city, where running water, electricity and gas have been cut off. Food and water supplies are running low, as Russian troops have not allowed the delivery of humanitarian aid. Hours after news of the destruction emerged, the Russian defence ministry denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre, the RIA news agency reported. About 1,500 cars had managed to flee Mariupol on Wednesday, according to Mr Orlov, the deputy mayor. But, he said, an attack by Russia on the convoy left at least five wounded, including a child. Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called for better access to civilians caught up in the war, which he said was causing ""enormous suffering"". Mr Maurer, who arrived in Ukraine for a five-day visit, described the situation in Mariupol as a ""waking nightmare"". Elsewhere, at least 10 people waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv were killed by Russian shelling on Wednesday, the country's prosecutor general said. Unverified footage released by a local outlet showed bodies on a street.

"Measures to criminalise cyber-flashing and give a right to appeal against the removal of social media posts are among changes the government has proposed to its Online Harms Bill. The bill, which also seeks to tackle access to harmful material online, has been introduced to parliament. It would give regulator Ofcom the power to fine firms or block access to sites that fail to comply with the new rules. But Labour says delays to the bill mean disinformation in the UK has increased. The bill - originally announced in 2019 - covers a wide array of topics relating to harmful material online. Online Safety Bill: New offences and tighter rules Harmful and illegal content could evade new laws, MPs warn Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Big social media companies will be required to assess risks of the types of legal harms against adults which could arise on their services, and will have to set out how they will deal with them - and enforce these terms consistently. Definitions of these legal harms will be set out in additional legislation, but potential examples could include material promoting self-harm, eating disorders or harassment.

"Measures to criminalise cyber-flashing and give a right to appeal against the removal of social media posts are among changes the government has proposed to its Online Harms Bill. The bill, which also seeks to tackle access to harmful material online, has been introduced to parliament. It would give regulator Ofcom the power to fine firms or block access to sites that fail to comply with the new rules. But Labour says delays to the bill mean disinformation in the UK has increased. The bill - originally announced in 2019 - covers a wide array of topics relating to harmful material online. Online Safety Bill: New offences and tighter rules Harmful and illegal content could evade new laws, MPs warn Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Big social media companies will be required to assess risks of the types of legal harms against adults which could arise on their services, and will have to set out how they will deal with them - and enforce these terms consistently. Definitions of these legal harms will be set out in additional legislation, but potential examples could include material promoting self-harm, eating disorders or harassment.

"This video can not be played St Patrick's Day parades return to Ireland Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets on the island of Ireland as St Patrick's Day events returned for the first time in three years. Parades and other festivities were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Events returned across the globe and about 400,000 people attended the parade in Dublin. Major events also took place in cities such as New York and Washington. Crowds gathered to watch the parade in Belfast city centre In Northern Ireland, there were St Patrick's Day parades in Downpatrick, County Down, and Armagh, each with special connections to Ireland's patron saint. In pictures: St Patrick's Day events return The city's council has been hosting a series of events this year from10-20 March, including the Beat Carnival Parade which passed through the city centre on Thursday. This video can not be played Belfast is set to stage its first St Patrick's Day parade since the coronavirus pandemic After promising the city would""come alive with colour and performances"", Belfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl said ""it means so much to have St Patrick's Day back"". During the event on Thursday, she told BBC News NI people had deserved ""a bit of a party"" after the challenges posed by the pandemic. However, despite encouraging people to enjoy the day, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said ""unruly behaviour caused by people who celebrate to excess will not be tolerated"". NEWS:Irish PM leaves Washington dinner after positive Covid test FEATURE:America's most Irish towns celebrate VIDEO:Bartenders toast 'book-end to pandemic craziness' Ch Insp Gavin Kirkpatrick urged young people to ""stay away from the Holyland"" area of south Belfast, explaining it was a residential area and ""not a party or nightlife destination"". In previous years, there have beenclashes with police and antisocial behaviour in the area, which is home to many students, around St Patrick's Day. Ch Insp Gavin Kirkpatrick said the Holyland area was not a party destination ""We are keen to ensure that all young people are aware of the risks associated with criminal and anti-social behaviour, for their safety and future educational and career prospects,"" Ch Insp Gavin Kirkpatrick said. He added the warning was also ""to protect local residents who are feeling particularly vulnerable"" because of the day's events. As legend has it, St Patrick worked on Slemish in County Antrim when he was first brought to Ireland. And following his footsteps on Thursday, big crowds climbed to the top to mark his feast day. Crowds gathered at Slemish on Thursday, where legend has it St Patrick worked when first brought to Ireland Mid and East Antrim Borough Council expected 1,500 trekkers throughout the day. Bus loads took crowds from the nearby village of Broughshane where a festival took place with traditional music and dance, street theatre and an artisan market. In Londonderry, the city's spring carnival festival took place, with the council estimating a crowd of about 35,000 spectators. Thousands watched the St Patrick's Day parade in Belfast for the first time in three years The theme was based around rebirth and renewal. Earlier, members of the Apprentice Boys, one of the Protestant Loyal Orders, paraded for St Patrick's Day in the city. The march is held separately from the main St Patrick's Day parade in Derry. ""For too many years people thought it wasn't something people from the Apprentice Boys or from the Protestant tradition should be engaged in, but it is a day for everyone,"" Stephen Porter from the Apprentice Boys toldBBC Radio Foyle. ""It has been a great success,"" he said. Downpatrick's parade is popular because of the town's many links with St Patrick In Downpatrick, where Ireland's saint is believed to have been buried beside the town's cathedral, there was a concert in the town. Armagh City, where historians believe St Patrick established a church in 445 AD, held a community parade, with another large parade in Newry on Thursday afternoon. Large crowds gathered to watch the St Patrick's Day parade in Derry The St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin also made a comeback on Thursday after a break because of the pandemic. Its parade left Parnell Road at midday and crossed O'Connell Bridge on its way to a finish in Kevin Street. Many turned out to watch the parade through Dublin A special St Patrick's Day video greeting from Ireland to the world, with Paul Brady's iconic The Island song, was published to mark Ireland's solidarity and support with the people of Ukraine.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin and Joe Biden met virtually after Mr Martin tested positive for Covid US President Joe Biden has warned that too much ""blood, sweat and tears"" have been shed on the Good Friday Agreement to change it now.

In reply the taoiseach said they met virtually last year across the Atlantic because of the pandemic and now they year were meeting virtually across the road. President Biden then reaffirmed his government support for the Good Friday Agreement,the deal which ended the worst of almost 30 years of violenceknown as the Troubles. ""I want to emphasise this administration's unequivocal support for the Good Friday accord,"" he said ""I think too much blood, sweat and tears have been shed to get that done. And this is no time to change it."" Mr Martin tested positive for Covid on Wednesday night Both leaders also talked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the taoiseach praised the president's ""firm and measured"" response to the war President Biden said he was impressed with the Republic of Ireland's response in brining in more than 7,000 Ukrainian refugees. Mr Martin had to isolate after he was informed of a positive Covid test while attending the Ireland Fund dinner in Washington on Wednesday night. At the time he was sitting alongside House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other guests. The taoiseach had been due to receive an international leadership award at the event. However, when the moment arrived Ireland's Ambassador to the United States, Dan Mulhall, took to the stage and confirmed the positive test. He said Mr Martin had tested negative but then was re-tested after a member of his delegation received a positive result.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Marina Ovsyannikova speaks to reporters about the reasons for her live TV protest A Russian journalist has been fined and released after she protested against the war in Ukraine on a live TV news programme and made an anti-war video. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at state-controlled Channel 1, was detained after she ran on to the set on Monday holding a sign saying ""no war"". She said she had been questioned for 14 hours and not slept for two days, and was not given access to legal help. The 30,000 rouble (Â£214; $280) fine relates to her video message. She had pleaded not guilty to the charge of organising an unauthorised public event. In the video, she called on the Russian people to protest against the war, saying only they have the power to ""stop all this madness"". ""Don't be afraid of anything. They can't imprison us all,"" she said. It is not clear if she will face separate charges relating to her protest on live TV, and there had been fears she would be prosecuted under a more serious, new criminal law that bans calling Russia's military action in Ukraine an ""invasion"" or spreading ""fake news"" about the conflict. After the court hearing Ms Ovsyannikova told reporters that she needed to rest after two days without sleep. ""The interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours, I wasn't allowed to get in touch with my family or friends, I was denied access to a lawyer,"" she said. She also stressed that she came up with the idea of the protest alone. ""It was my anti-war decision. I made this decision by myself because I don't like Russia starting this invasion. It was really terrible,"" she said in English as she left the courthouse. Lawyers were unable to locate Ms Ovsyannikova for several hours after she was detained on Monday evening. Her whereabouts were unknown until an image circulated on Russian media which showed her in court with lawyer Anton Gashinsky. Marina Ovsyannikova appeared in court on Tuesday with lawyer Anton Gashinsky Images of Ms Ovsyannikova's protest were quickly shared across the world after she ran on to the set of one of Russia's most-watched news programmes, Vremya, holding a sign reading ""No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."" She could also be heard repeating the words ""no war, stop the war"". The placard was clearly visible for a few seconds before the programme cut away from the live broadcast to a pre-recorded report. Before the incident she recorded a video in which she said she was ashamed to work for what she called Kremlin propaganda. ""I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to tell lies from the television screen. Ashamed that I allowed Russians to be turned into zombies,"" she explained. ""We just silently watched this inhumane regime."" This video can not be played Watch: Anti-war demonstrator disrupts Russia's state TV news Ms Ovsyannikova, who said her father was Ukrainian, said the whole world had turned against Russia. ""The next 10 generations won't be able to clean themselves from the shame of this fratricidal war."" Her colleagues at Channel 1 were reportedly surprised by her actions. Onetold the Faridaily blog,external- run by former BBC Russian Service journalist Farida Rustamova - that Ms Ovsyannikova, who has two children, had never discussed politics, but spoke ""mostly about children, dogs and the house"". From the moment her identity became known, Ms Ovsyannikova received dozens of comments on her Facebook page in Ukrainian, Russian and English, thanking her for her actions. Ukraine's President Zelensky also praised her for ""telling the truth"". French President Emmanuel Macron said France would launch an effort to offer her protection, either at the embassy or through asylum, and said he would discuss it in his next conversation with President Putin. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called her actions an act of ""hooliganism"".

It is also unusual for employees of state-controlled news organisations to express an opinion that differs from the official Kremlin position. But since the war in Ukraine began, at least three journalists have resigned from top Russian TV channels: Zhanna Agalakova from Channel 1, and Lilia Gildeyeva and Vadim Glusker from NTV. State-controlled Russian media refer to the war as a ""special military operation"" and paint Ukraine as the aggressor, describing Ukraine's elected government as neo-Nazis. Several of the remaining independent media outlets in Russia have stopped broadcasting or publishing after pressure from the authorities, including the radio station Echo of Moscow, and TV Rain - an online TV channel. Others, like newspaper Novaya Gazeta, are attempting to report on the situation without falling foul of the new censorship laws. Access to the BBC has also been restricted inside Russia, leading the corporation to issueguidance over how to continue using its services,external.

"This video can not be played ""I can communicate with someone just like me."" The mother of a boy born without hearing in one ear has criticised delays to Northern Ireland's sign language bill. The parties agreed two years ago tolegally recognise British and Irish sign language through new legislation,external. But the bill will not be able to be passed at Stormont without a functioning executive. Gillian Douglas-Rea said politicians were ""doing a disservice to the whole deaf community"". ""This is about recognising their culture and identity,"" she said. Ms Douglas-Rea's son, Jensen, was also born non-verbal, so she decided to take up sign language but initially found it difficult to access support and ended up paying to take classes online. Gillian Douglas-Rea had to find resources herself in case her son Jensen's hearing deteriorated in the future ""We had to seek out charities and places and at the beginning of our journey, we didn't know what to do,"" she said. She said she was glad she had persevered as it had given her son the ""tools"" he needed in case Jensen's hearing deteriorated in the future. But she would like to see a sign language act in place as soon as possible. ""Our politicians need to get moving,"" she added. Schoolboy teaching sign language to classmates during lockdown Plans to introduce a sign language bill for Northern Ireland are facing a delaywithout a functioning Stormont executive, according to Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey. The Sinn FÃ©in minister said her officials had been developing the bill for some time, but executive approval would be needed. Without it, Northern Ireland could become the only part of the UK without such laws. Deirdre Hargey says plans to introduce a sign language bill are facing a delay without a functioning executive A sign language act would require the government to ensure the use of British and Irish sign language across public services. It would also ensure a duty to promote sign language in educational settings and allow more people to learn it for free. Scotland has had laws in place since 2015 recognising sign language, and theRepublic of Ireland followed suit in 2017,external. Later this week, Westminster will debate plans tochange the laws in England and Wales, but it will not apply in Northern Ireland. TheNew Decade New Approach,externaldeal said the parties were committed to bringing forward a bill for British and Irish sign language ""at an early stage"".

Russia, when it was part of the Soviet Union, controlled a massive biological weapons programme The US says it has warned Russia of ""consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"". Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke over the phone on Wednesday with the secretary of the Russian Security Council, General Nikolay Patrushev. The White House said it had requested the call, its highest-level diplomatic engagement with Moscow since a February call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Both countries have accused the other of housing and preparing to use biological weapons inside Ukraine. General Patrushev is one of three Putin loyalists who have served with him since the 1970s. Here's more on the general and other members of Putin's inner circle. Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova Russian prima ballerina Olga Smirnova has left the Bolshoi Ballet, Russia's internationally renowned company, after saying she is ""against war with all the fibres of my soul"". She joins the Dutch National Ballet, which describes her as one of the Bolshoi's leading stars, and that it had become ""untenable"" for her to continue working in Russia after she condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, she said on Telegram: ""I never thought I would be ashamed of Russia, I have always been proud of talented Russian people, of our cultural and athletic achievements. But now I feel that a line has been drawn that separates the before and the after. ""It hurts that people are dying, that people are losing the roofs over their heads or are forced to abandon their homes."" You can read more about Smirnova's move here. The UK's Ministry of Defence has released its latest update on Russia's military, saying that it has probably had to resort to using older and less precise weapons, which are more likely to result in civilian casualties. It adds that Russia probably resorted to using these weapons as a result of failing to achieve its military objectives. So far the UN has confirmed the deaths of 729 civilians in Ukraine, though the actual number is expected to be far higher. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents of Melitopol held protests in the occupied city after Federov's arrest The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian
forces five days ago, was freed after Ukraine agreed to exchange nine
captured Russian soldiers for him, according to a senior Ukrainian presidential aide. The capture of Ivan Federov - the leader of one of the first
cities captured by Russia - led President Zelensky to accuse Russia of starting
a ""new stage of terror"". The Russian soldiers exchanged had all been born between 2002-03, making them ""actually children"", Zelensky press aide Darya Zarivnaya said in a televised address. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian presidential aides said that
Federov had been released after an ""operation"", but did not provide
further details. Chernihiv residents queue for food among bare shelves on Tuesday The number of people who were reportedly killed while waiting in a queue for bread in the northern city of Chernihiv has now risen to 13, according to a senior official. Police Chief Vladimir Nidzelsky said the victims died after shells hit a high-rise building, before falling to the ground below. Officials had previously confirmed 10 deaths as a result of the bombing, which happened around 10:00 local time on Wednesday. Dozens more were injured, according to Nidzelsky. Some more reaction now to reports that Russian forces have
bombed a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol,which authorities claim was housing over 1,000 civilians. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian MP Vadym Halaichuk said the
building was being used as a shelter by residents who had lost homes in the
fighting. ""The place has a special shelter in the basement that was
specifically designed to provide shelter during bombings,"" he said. Halaichuk accused Russian forces of knowing this. He said that information was ""provided to the commanding
officers of the occupying troops. So they perfectly knew that a lot of people
had come there for refuge"". ""We are very hopeful that most people survive since this it
is a special bomb shelter that should provide for protection under such
circumstances,"" he added. Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment reporter, BBC World Service A lion in private captivity in Ukraine, just before it was rescued in January 2022 Lions and bears are among the animals being left uncared for in Ukrainian homes as people flee Russian forces, animal welfare campaigners say. They estimate there are thousands of captive animals in private homes in Ukraine, including lions, tigers, bears, wolves, crocodiles and pythons. It's legal for people to buy these animals as long as they are bred in captivity. One animal that's been left to fend for itself is two-year-old lioness, Rura. Asya Serpinska, 78, runs one of the biggest dog shelters in Ukraine. When her neighbour's barn in Hostomel, near Kyiv, caught fire after a Russian shell attack on 2 March, Asya ran inside to release birds, rabbits and foxes from the cages she knew they were trapped in. But she knew her neighbour also had a lioness, Rura - and eventually found her in a basement. Asya Serpinska, 78, cares for 1,000 dogs and 200 cats ""She had no-one to feed her and she looked quite restless and disturbed. So we started giving her dog food and water,"" Asya said. Heavy shelling stopped Asya from leaving home for the nine days after that, by which time the area around Rura's cage had been mined. ""What is going to happen to these thousands of wild animals in private captivity during this war is a huge issue,"" says Iryna Korobko, an activist with the Ukrainian Association for Animal Advocates. Ukraine has now killed a fourth senior Russian military general, President Volodymyr Zelensky says. He didn't identify the target, but another government adviser named the officer as Maj Gen Oleg Mityaev and said he'd been killed by Ukraine's far-right Azov Battalion. If confirmed to be true - it would mean one-fifth of the roughly 20 Russian generals believed to be leading Moscow's invasion have been killed in combat so far. It's a high number, andwe've been reportingon how it's leading some experts to believe that Ukraine may be deliberately targeting high-level Russian officers with lethal force. The Ukrainian retired tennis player Alexandr Dolgopolov - who
once ranked world number 13 - has arrived in Kyiv to help defend the country. In amessage shared on Instagram,,externalDolgopolov
said he had been practising shooting and undergoing weapons training with an
ex-soldier before travelling to Ukraine. ""I'm not Rambo in a week, but quite comfortable with the
weapons,"" he wrote. ""This is my home, and we will defend it! With all
the people that stayed!"" Dolgopolov, 33, who won three ATP titles before retiring last
year, also posted a picture of a gun and military gear on Twitter with the
caption: ""Used to be rackets and strings, now this."" Other famous sports professionals have also headed to Ukraine to
fight - including fellow tennis starSergiy Stakhovskyand boxersOleksandr Usykand
Vasiliy Lomachenko. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ukrainian refugees in Poland queue for a coach to carry them to other parts of the country on Wednesday If you're just joining our live coverage, or want a recap, here are the latest headlines: Russian warships are shelling areas around Odesa, US intelligence says We've had a new update from a US senior defence official about the latest
on how the Russian invasion is going. According to the official, the Russian advances continue to be generally
stalled - and there are indications that Russia is deliberating the degree to
which it needs to bring in replacement troops from outside Ukraine to join the
fight. The official added: US-made Stinger missiles en route to Kyiv As we reported earlier, the US is releasing $1bn (Â£764m) in weapons to Ukraine. The package consists of $800m in newly approved security assistance and $200 million committed last weekend. The new military aid includes 800 Stinger missiles to help Ukrainian ground forces deal with low-flying helicopters and airplanes, and 2,000 Javelins with which to engage enemy tanks. The Ukrainian government has asked for both. For the first time, the US will also send Ukraine 100 ""cutting edge"" tactical drones to use as guided missiles against enemy tanks or artillery positions. Other weapons listed in the package are rifles, pistols, machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers. The administration is also sending body armour, helmets and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition to Kyiv. The White House says its current levels of military aid to Ukraine are ""more than we had ever provided before"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Biden made the remark after speaking at an event unrelated to Ukraine One by one, diplomatic bridges between the United States and
Russia are being set ablaze. The latest bit of rhetorical demolition came when Joe Biden
labelled Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a move Russia said was ""unforgivable"". Mr Bidenâs statement was an odd one, albeit not out of keeping
for a politician who has a history of making monumental policy shifts in
seemingly off-the-cuff remarks (see, for instance, his comments on gay marriage
in 2012). After initially telling a reporter he did not think Mr Putin was
a criminal, he came back and reversed himself. If there had been an internal
debate at the White House over how to handle the growing calls in Congress and
the press to condemn Mr Putin in this way, the president settled it in an
aside, not a set-piece speech. This, of course, will make it harder for Mr Biden and his
administration to work with the Russians going forward. Every concession or
negotiated agreement, on whatever topic, will invite the rejoinder: How can you
associate with a criminal? Perhaps Mr Biden, in his comments, was simply acknowledging the
new reality - that the world's political order has irrevocably shifted, and
thereâs no going back to the way things were. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv ""The best way to stop the threat of another Mariupol is
more far-reaching political conversations on peace and ceasefire negotiations,""
the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer
told the BBC on a visit to Kyiv. Asked about the ICRCâs description of conditions in the besieged
southern port city as ""apocalyptic"", Maurer said it was ""important
to recognise this wasn't only the ICRC's voice, but the voice of so many
civilians trapped in the city"". He said the lack of trust between the warring sides was ""the
biggest problem"" in rescuing civilians stuck between front lines. Maurer, who has been in close contact with senior Ukrainian and
Russian officials, said more people were now escaping through agreed
humanitarian corridors. But he said Mariupol, a key target for Russian forces advancing
on Ukraineâs southern coast, was more difficult ""in military strategy and
political significance"". However, even there, he said some civilians were
now managing to get out. Maurer also pointed to another major worry which has brought the
head of the ICRC, the guardian of the rules governing war, to Ukraine: ""Respect
for international humanitarian law and the obligations under the Geneva
Conventions with regards to prisoners of war, dead soldiers, missing and
detained civilians."" The ICRCâs special role is founded on confidential dialogue with
warring sides. Asked about accusations that Russia was targeting civilian
infrastructure, Maurer replied that ""basic principles of proportionality
and precaution which inform the conduct of hostilities, and the Geneva
Conventions, are interpreted in very different ways which is why we try to
establish minimal agreement on what we mean by these words"". A satellite image, taken by Maxar two days ago, shows the word
""children"" written in large white letters in Russian at the front and
the rear of the Mariupol theatre. As we've been reporting, local officials said the theatre was
being used by hundreds of civilians for shelter before it was bombed by Russian
forces today. They said it was deliberately and cynically targeted by a
Russian warplane, but the details have not been independently verified.
Russia's defence ministry denied attacking the theatre.  This video can not be played Ukraine war: Boris Johnson says Putin invasion has failed In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"". The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"". He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"". Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"". ""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says. ""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour. ""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support."" As we just reported, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the very first time. According to the TASS news agency, the Kremlin says Biden's comments are ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"". The mayor of Melitopol, who was reportedly kidnapped by Russia forces five days ago, has been freed, according to advisers to the Ukrainian president. President Volodymyr Zelensky had accused Russia of moving to a ""new stage of terror"" after Ukraine showed footage of what it said was the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, being led away blindfolded. Melitopol was one of the first cities to fall to Russian forces, and a new mayor was installed. Ukraine's government also accused Russia of abducting the mayor of the town of Dniprorudne. After announcing Fedorov's release, Ukrainian officials posted a video on social media of Zelensky calling the mayor and telling him he was ""glad to hear the voice of a living man"". Fedorov is heard thanking the president for ""not abandoning me"" and to say he will need ""one or two days to recover, and then I will be at your command to contribute to our victory"".
