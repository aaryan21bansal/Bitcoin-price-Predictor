"The prime minister saw the production line for vaccines when he visited the factory Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said a Wrexham laboratory could provide ""salvation for humanity"" when it starts producing coronavirus vaccines. Mr Johnson visited Wockhardt UK Ltd on Monday, which he said would be making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine if it is approved. The PM said ""if we're lucky"" the vaccine could be available within weeks. It was a very exciting and ""moving moment"", he added. The Wrexham plant has the capability to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine a year and preparations to produce 150,000 vials a day of the vaccine have been under way for weeks. As the drugs were being developed, preparations for transferring large vats of the vaccine into single-dose vials have been ramped up. Wrexham factory to help virus vaccine production When can I get the Covid vaccine? UK regulator to assess Oxford Covid jab Ravi Limaye, managing director, said the company expected to start delivering the first doses of the vaccine soon. ""We are immensely proud to have been selected to partner with the UK government on this project,"" he said. ""We have a sophisticated sterile manufacturing facility and a highly skilled workforce."" Unite union official Dave Griffiths said the Wrexham site had taken on 40 staff to deal with the demand and planned to produce 150,000 vials a day, five days a week.

"Scientists say the Amazon has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since Jair Bolsonaro took office Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has surged to its highest level since 2008, the country's space agency (Inpe) reports. A total of 11,088 sq km (4,281 sq miles) of rainforest were destroyed from August 2019 to July 2020. This is a 9.5% increase from the previous year. The Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. Scientists say it has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. The Brazilian president has encouraged agriculture and mining activities in the world's largest rainforest. The Amazon is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. Amazon under threat: Fires, loggers and now virus Deforested Amazon areas 'net emitters of CO2' The latest data marked a major increase from the 7,536 sq km announced by Inpe in 2018 - the year before Mr Bolsonaro took office. The new figures are preliminary, with the official statistics set to be released early next year. This video can not be played A section of the Amazon forest is systematically removed over a three-year period Brazil had set a goal of slowing the pace of deforestation to 3,900 sq km annually by 2020. In addition to encouraging development in the rainforest, President Bolsonaro has also cut funding to federal agencies that have the power to fine and arrest farmers and loggers breaking environmental law. Mr Bolsonaro has previously clashed with Inpe over its deforestation data. Last year, he accused the agency of smearing Brazil's reputation. In a statement, Brazilian non-governmental organisation Climate Observatory said the figures ""reflect the result of a successful initiative to annihilate the capacity of the Brazilian State and the inspection bodies to take care of our forests and fight crime in the Amazon"". But some officials said the fact that the rate of increase was lower than that recorded last year was a sign of progress. ""While we are not here to celebrate this, it does signify that the efforts we are making are beginning to bear fruit,"" Vice-President Hamilton MourÃ£o told reporters. How your chicken burger is linked to deforestation Protecting the rainforest through your shopping basket The scale of destruction in the Amazon rainforest is hard to comprehend. Last year I experienced the silent aftermath of deforestation where huge trees had been bulldozed and would later be burned. This is done to create fields for cattle grazing and soya cultivation - big earners for Brazil. At the time it was said that an area of forest the size of a football pitch was cleared every single minute. But soon that calculation was overtaken, and this year has seen the largest fires for a decade. None of this should be a surprise: Jair Bolsonaro, was elected on a promise of development. Keen to promote mining as well as agriculture, he described the Amazon as ""a periodic table"" of valuable minerals, and he resents what he sees as outside interference. But climate scientists say the billions of trees are a vast store of carbon and, without them, the rise in global temperatures will accelerate.

"Rita Ora says she's ""deeply sorry"" for breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday. The singer says she attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday. ""Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,"" she wrote in a statement. It's reported up to 30 people were at the party, although she describes the event as a ""small gathering"". She says it was a ""spur of the moment"" decision. London's Metropolitan Police confirmed officers went to the Casa Cruz restaurant after a report about a potential breach of Covid lockdown regulations. ""I'm deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk,"" she posted. ""This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement."" Rita Ora wrote an apology and posted it on her Instastory Current lockdown regulations in England mean you can only meet one other person outside. Pubs and restaurants are currently closed (although they can serve non-alcoholic takeaways) and you shouldn't be with people from outside your house or support bubbles indoors. Police have the power to break up groups larger than six and those who ignore officers could be fined Â£100, doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200. So far, the singer has not been fined. Kensington and Chelsea Council, which is responsible for issuing Covid fines against businesses in the area, says it is still investigating what happened at Casa Cruz. Allow Instagram content?

"England's national lockdown has helped to bring coronavirus ""back under control"" but vigilance is still needed, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock hailed the restrictions a success and saidinfections in England dropped by about 30% in the last week. The lockdown ends on Wednesday and will be replaced with tiered restrictions. Mr Hancock stressed the need for the regional system, saying ""while we can let up a little, we can't afford to let up a lot"". Speaking at a Downing Street news briefing on Monday, he said people following the lockdown rules meant ""we've reduced pressures on the NHS, we've brought down the number of coronavirus cases, we've got this virus back under control."" He added: ""The success of our collective efforts means that from Wednesday, everyone in England, even those in tier three, can have some greater freedoms - but we don't have much headroom."" Mr Hancock pointed to a major study from Imperial College London that has suggested that the number of infections has fallen by a third since the lockdown was introduced a month ago. However, the health secretary called for vigilance and said the country could not risk Covid cases rising again as we head towards Christmas. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, told the same briefing that it was ""crucial"" to have infection rates under control ahead of January, when the NHS is at its busiest. Covid infections fall by 30% over lockdown - study Government publishes data behind stricter tiers NHS Covid-19 app to gain self-isolation payments He said he was ""confident people will act sensible over Christmas"" - when restrictions are to be relaxed for five days - and the country will go into the new year with the number of infections staying down and falling. Prof Powis also said that the NHS had ""started to turn the corner"" as the number of people in hospital with coronavirus is falling, but said it was ""critical"" that cases remained low. He said: ""We have the evidence that infection rates are now falling and have been falling during this period of lockdown. ""And we are now just beginning to see that translate through into hospital admissions, which have been falling, and into the overall number of people in hospital which in recent days has started to turn the corner, and is now falling."" Mr Hancock pointed to thegovernment's newly-published impact assessmentin needing the toughened tiered approach in England, following criticism from some Tory MPs. He said it ""clearly"" demonstrated the move was ""necessary to avoid a much worse outcome"", and called for vigilance. Asked whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England during a Commons vote on Tuesday are being irresponsible, Mr Hancock said he urged all MPs to vote for the measures. He said the tiered system was the ""best way to avoid a third lockdown"" and the  ""most proportionate way to take the action that we need to keep people safe, and to stop the NHS being overwhelmed"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer confirmed his party's MPs would be encouraged to abstain from Tuesday's vote - meaning it is likely to pass, even as Tory backbenchers threaten to rebel. Sir Keir said he remained ""deeply concerned that Boris Johnson's government has failed to use this latest lockdown to put a credible health and economic plan in place"". LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? The health secretary repeated the government's earlier pledge to roll out mass community testing in tier three areas, including testing people without symptoms, after the lockdown ends. Mr Hancock said mass testing hadsuccessfully brought down infections in Liverpool- where 300,000 people were tested for Covid-19 - and would give tier three areas a ""faster way out of the toughest restrictions"". He appealed to anyone who was offered a test to take one, as ""you might just save a life"". However, health leaders have warned thatmass testing plans in England threaten to be a ""distraction""from other priorities such as the rollout of a vaccine. Mr Hancock said mass testing and vaccination needed to ""run alongside each other"", which had already been happening in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases - people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this. They may only pick up three quarters of positive cases, dropping to a half if carried out by untrained people. The government is pushing the boundaries. That may be understandable in a pandemic, but the effectiveness of this programme is far from certain. Mass coronavirus testing of students, so they can safely return home for the Christmas break,has already begun at many UK universities. Mr Hancock urged students to take a test if they are offered one but defended the fact that the scheme is not mandatory. Meanwhile on Monday, the government recorded another 12,330 daily coronavirus cases and a further 205 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"Cole (left) and Walsh (centre) appear in a promotional image for Revolution of the Daleks Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole will make their final appearances as the Doctor's companions in the Doctor Who special on New Year's Day, the BBC has revealed. Walsh said viewers should ""expect a lot of poignancy"" from the episode. The pair have been at Jodie Whittaker's side since 2018. Cole said it had been ""an honour"" to play Ryan opposite Walsh's Graham and Whittaker's Doctor. Titled Revolution of the Daleks, the special will also see John Barrowman return as Captain Jack Harkness. Barrowman said it was ""great being back"" and that returning to the show had been ""like going home"". Barrowman first appeared as Captain Jack in 2005 Walsh and Cole made their Doctor Who debuts at the start of Whittaker's first full series as the time-travelling Time Lord. They went on to appear in two series as well as the 2019 special Resolution, which also featured the villainous Daleks. Meet the Doctor's three new companions Why Doctor Whoâs assistant is my real hero Walsh said it was ""amazing"" to be ""only one of a few people on the planet"" to have battled the Doctor's long-time robotic nemeses. The comedian and host of game show The Chase said he had ""absolutely loved"" being on the long-running sci-fi programme and would miss ""everyone and everything"" involved. Meanwhile, Cole said filming his last scene had been ""emotional"". Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole made their Doctor Who debuts in 2018 Barrowman, who has played Captain Jack in both Doctor Who and its spin-off Torchwood, said the Daleks were the show's ""quintessential"" villains. ""They are never to be underestimated as they will always find a way to survive, which is exactly why they have survived over centuries,"" he added. Cole said: ""Working with the Daleks is sort of like working with Doctor Who royalty. You have to respect them because they are so iconic."" The Christmas special will see Mandip Gill resume her role as companion Yasmin, while Chris Noth returns as business tycoon Jack Robertson. It will also see Dame Harriet Walter make her Doctor Who debut alongside Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, of Utopia and Misfits fame.

"England and Wales' contact-tracing app is to add a Self-Isolation Payment feature as soon as next week. The version 4 update will address a discrepancy that currently exists. Those told to stay at home by human contact-tracers can qualify for Â£500 of support. But privacy safeguards built into the NHS Covid-19 app had complicated making the same offer to those who had received an automated self-isolate notification. It is hoped the move will encourage more people to install the app and follow its guidance over the Christmas period, when there are concerns that cases of the coronavirus could spike again. The charity Citizens Advice has warned that many people ordered to stop work by the app have faced an ""impossible choice"", as they can experience a big drop in income if they act to help stop the spread of the virus. England's NHS Test and Trace scheme,externalandWales's NHS Test, Trace, Protect counterpart,externalboth allow affected people on low incomes, who cannot work from home, to apply for financial help. Checks can be made against a register to prevent fraud. But because the app keeps the identity of users who have received self-isolation alerts secret, the process had to be adapted. Last week Labour had called on the government to address this issue. At present, users of the app cannot claim a support grant if told to self-isolate Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Many people will be astonished to find that people using the Covid-19 app can't access support to self-isolate - even if they're eligible for the payment."" The team behind the app is aware that many of those instructed to self-isolate for up to 14 days are not doing so. It is thought the absence of a financial incentive is an important factor. Before the version 4 release, there will be another update this week to show users what restrictions are being enforced in their local authority, rather than their post code. This has been timed to coincide with England's switch from national rules to a tier-based approach on 2 December, which will be based on council boundaries. Longer-term, there is speculation that vaccination records could be a further feature to be added. This has been sparked by remarks made by the head of Test and Trace, Baroness Dido Harding. Speaking to a private meeting organised by the Health Service Journal andfirst reported by the Times newspaper,external, she said work was going on to help people log both tests and their vaccinations. The first Covid-19 vaccines should be administered in the UK next month The idea would be ""to have a single record as a citizen of your test results and whether you've been vaccinated."" It is not clear whether such a record would be stored in the NHS Covid-19 app or elsewhere. For months, all kinds of companies have been touting so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a pub by showing proof that they were not infectious. The trouble with all of these schemes was that without official approval from a government body, nobody would trust them. Call to expand Â£500 grant for Covid self-isolators Covid-19 app users can't get isolation payment Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled I spoke to one person who played a leading role in the early development of the NHS Covid-19 app. He remembered that building this kind of immunity ID card into it had been considered. But he said it was deemed an unnecessary complication at that early stage, and the idea was handed to a separate group to consider. The idea is not without controversy. Privacy experts warned early on in the app's development that using it to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory. Now, though, the government seems keen to press ahead. Mr Zahawi has been made responsible for the deployment of the coronavirus vaccine in England England's new vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology"". Speaking on Radio 4's The World at One, he added: ""I think you'll probably find restaurants and bars and cinemas and sports venues will probably also use that system, as they've done with the app."" He pointed out that the QR barcode feature of the app - which registers visits to pubs, cafes and other businesses - had helped drive uptake. But with vaccinations due to start as early as next week, it appears unlikely that any immunity passport will be ready by then. Complex decisions will be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus. ""At present we do not have an authorised vaccine and we do not know if a vaccine will impact transmission of the disease,"" said a spokesman from the Department of Health and Social Care, when asked about the matter. ""Should a vaccine pass our rigorous safety standards the NHS stands ready to immediately deploy it to those most at risk and this will allow us to see what impact a vaccine has on the epidemic as a whole. ""Then we will have the information needed to decide the next steps to a path back to normality.""

"A public inquiry into state collusion in the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane will not take place at this time, the government has said. Mr Finucane was shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in February 1989. His family had fought a long campaign, involving numerous legal actions, in a bid to have London fulfil a commitment given 20 years ago to hold an inquiry. Several examinations of the case found state forces colluded in his murder. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said he had taken the decision due to other review processes needing to run their course. He discussed the outcome with Mr Finucane's family, shortly before outlining the details in the House of Commons. This video can not be played No inquiry into Finucane murder announced ""I am not taking the possibility of a public inquiry off the table at this stage, but it is important we allow ongoing PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) and Police Ombudsman processes to move forward,"" he said. But Mr Finucane's widow Geraldine said the government's decision ""makes a mockery"" of previous rulings. ""The proposal falls so far short of what it required in this case that it beggars belief,"" she said in a statement on Monday. ""It makes a mockery of the decision by the UK Supreme Court and the forthright comments of Belfast High Court. ""It is yet another insult added to a deep and lasting injury."" This video can not be played âNothing short of insultingâ Her son, John Finucane, who is the Sinn FÃ©in MP for North Belfast, said his family was angry and upset at the decision. ""To sit in a room with us today and present this as something credible, and ask for us to support that, it was astonishing,"" he said. Q&A: The murder of Pat Finucane A murder with 'collusion at its heart' ""I thought it was exceptionally arrogant and cruel of the secretary of state on behalf of his government. ""The British government, at every opportunity, will continue to make the wrong decision, and will put all of their efforts into ensuring that the truth as to what happened with the murder of my father - the full truth - will not see the light of day."" But Mr Lewis said while he understood the family's disappointment, he believed his approach was the ""right way forward"". The government had been forced into taking a decision following two legal actions - oneinvolving the UK Supreme Court in February last year. The Supreme Court found there hadnever been an adequate investigation,externalinto the murder, but stopped short of directing a public inquiry, ruling it was entirely a matter for the government. Further government information including details that were not presented during the Supreme Court casehave now been published,external, said Mr Lewis. Mr Lewis said the PSNI also intends to begin a process of review into the murder of Mr Finucane early next year. This was an important development and a factor in determining the next steps in the case, he said. PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrnesaid it was his organisation's view,externalthat there were ""currently no new lines of inquiry"", and would now determine if a further review was merited given previous investigations. Any review would need to be conducted independently, he added. ""A review itself is not an investigation. Any decision to investigate would only be made following the review process,"" Mr Byrne said. This was a decision the Finucane family has heard before - but their anger has been compounded by how they say the government has handled the matter this time. Clearly the government says it is something that can be revisited, but the process has already lasted decades. It is not clear how long the PSNI and Police Ombudsman reviews will take - it does not seem like they will be resolved quickly. Will this Conservative government end up having to address the matter again, or could it end up in the hands of a Labour administration, who have expressed support for a public inquiry? There are also wider questions now about where this leaves the current government's handling of legacy issues in Northern Ireland more generally, let alone in handling the Finucane case. The government said it will determine at the end of these current processes whether further investigation would be required, to ensure it has complied with its legal obligations. In his role as a defence solicitor, Mr Finucane had represented both loyalists and republicans, including prominent members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The claim made by his killers, that he was a member of the IRA himself, was rejected by the police and strongly denied by his family. Geraldine Finucane has long maintained that a public inquiry into her husband's death is the only way to establish the full truth The 39-year-old was shot 14 times by two gunmen who burst into his north Belfast home during a family dinner in February 1989. They have claimed that collusion went to the top of government and maintain only a public inquiry can bring full disclosure. Such an inquiry had been supported by the Irish government,Labourandfour Northern Ireland political parties - Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said he was disappointed by the decision and would study the detail of the announcement in full. Labour's Shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh criticised her Conservative counterpart's approach, and said confidence in his handling of legacy issues was ""in short supply amongst victims"". Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said only a full public inquiry would get to the truth, and accused the government of being ""determined to hide the story of collusion"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the outcome as a ""disgraceful"" attempt to bury the truth, and said the British government was ""unilaterally dismantling the agreed approach to legacy"". Alliance MP Stephen Farry said Mr Lewis had failed miserably and expressed concerns that the government was ""turning back the clock"" on historical legacy investigations. But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) welcomed Mr Lewis's decision. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said what was needed was a ""holistic approach"", and a wider legacy process to deal with all outstanding cases. UUP assembly member (MLA) Doug Beattie said there could not be a ""hierarchy of victims"".

"A DeepMind model of a protein from the Legionnaire's disease bacteria (Casp-14) One of biology's biggest mysteries has been solved using artificial intelligence, experts have announced. Predicting how a protein folds into a unique three-dimensional shape has puzzled scientists for half a century. London-based AI lab, DeepMind, has largely cracked the problem, said the organisers of a scientific challenge. A better understanding of protein shapes could play a pivotal role in the development of novel drugs to treat disease. The advance by Google-owned DeepMind is expected to accelerate research into a host of illnesses, including Covid-19. Their program determined the shape of proteins at a level of accuracy comparable to expensive and time-consuming lab methods, said independent scientists. Dr Andriy Kryshtafovych, from University of California (UC), Davis in the US, one of the panel of scientific adjudicators, described the achievement as ""truly remarkable"". ""Being able to investigate the shape of proteins quickly and accurately has the potential to revolutionise life sciences,"" he said. DeepMind's Demis Hassabis on The Life Scientific (BBC Radio 4) Proteins are present in all living things where they play a central role in the chemical processes essential for life. Made up of strings of amino acids, they fold up in an infinite number of ways into elaborate shapes that hold the key to how they carry out their vital functions. A protein bound to a receptor shown on computer Many diseases are linked to the roles of proteins in catalysing chemical reactions (enzymes), fighting disease (antibodies) or acting as chemical messengers (hormones such as insulin). ""Even tiny rearrangements of these vital molecules can have catastrophic effects on our health, so one of the most efficient ways to understand disease and find new treatments is to study the proteins involved,"" said Dr John Moult of the University of Maryland, US, the chair of the panel of scientific adjudicators. ""There are tens of thousands of human proteins and many billions in other species, including bacteria and viruses, but working out the shape of just one requires expensive equipment and can take years."" In 1972, Christian Anfinsen was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work showing that it should be possible to determine the shape of proteins based on the sequence of their amino acid building blocks. Every two years, scores of teams from more than 20 countries blindly attempt to predict using computers the shape of a set of around 100 proteins from amino acid sequences alone. At the same time, the 3-D structures are worked out in the lab by biologists using traditional techniques like X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, which determine the location of each atom relative to each other in the protein molecule. A team of scientists from Casp (the Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) then compares these predictions with 3-D structures solved using experimental methods. Casp uses a metric known as the global distance test to assess accuracy, ranging from 0-100. A score of around 90, which DeepMind's AlphaFold program achieved, is regarded as comparable with lab techniques. In the latest round of the challenge, Casp-14, AlphaFold determined the shape of around two thirds of the proteins with accuracy comparable to laboratory experiments. The assessors said accuracy with most of the other proteins was also high, though not quite at that level. AlphaFold is based on a concept called deep learning. In this process, the structure of a folded protein is represented as a spatial graph. The program then ""learns"" using information on the 3-D shapes of known proteins held in aworldwide database.,external The AI program was able to do in a matter of days what might take years at the laboratory bench. DeepMind is a company and research lab best known for complex AI games with superhuman skills. It was acquired by Google in 2014. Knowing the 3-D structure of a protein is important in drug design and in understanding human diseases, including cancer, dementia and infectious diseases. The virus that causes Covid-19 has distinctive spike proteins (in red) One example is Covid-19, where scientists have been studying how the spike protein on the surface of the Sars-CoV-2 virus interacts with receptors in human cells. Prof Andrew Martin from University College London (UCL), a former Casp entrant and assessor, told BBC News: ""Understanding how a protein sequence folds up into three dimensions is really one of the fundamental questions of biology. ""The whole way in which a protein functions is dependent on its three-dimensional structure and protein function is relevant to everything in health and disease. ""By knowing the three-dimensional structures of proteins we can help to design drugs and intervene with health problems whether those be infections or inherited disease."" How proteins fold to create ""exquisitely unique three-dimensional structures"" is one of biology's biggest mysteries, said Prof Dame Janet Thornton of EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK. ""A better understanding of protein structures and the ability to predict them using a computer means a better understanding of life, evolution and, of course, human health and disease,"" she explained. Other scientists will want to look at the data to determine how accurate the AI method is and how well it performs at a very detailed level. There's still a knowledge gap, including working out how multiple proteins fit together and how proteins interact with other molecules, such as DNA and RNA. ""Now that the problem has been largely solved for single proteins, the way is open for development of new methods for determining the shape of protein complexes - collections of proteins that work together to form much of the machinery of life, and for other applications,"" said Dr Kryshtafovych.

"The UK's high level of obesity has fuelled a much-increased death rate from Covid-19, says the former chief medical officer for England. Prof Dame Sally Davies said high obesity rates - and high levels of deprivation and overcrowded housing - had cost lives. The poor state of public health meant it was not surprising that the UK had struggled during the pandemic. Dame Sally called for tougher policies to combat obesity. Obesity 'increases risks from Covid-19' How bad is our obesity problem? She said: ""The fact that we are one of the fattest nations in the developed world has undoubtedly led to more deaths than we should have had. ""Our poor public health - whether it is deprivation, overweight, or other chronic illnesses, alongside crowding in urban areas - have led to a much increased death rate over what we could have had if we had a healthier basic population."" The UK became the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths earlier this month. Dame Sally said stricter recent restrictions had reduced social encounters and so brought down coronavirus infections. But she added that she expected a third wave of the virus, possibly in the New Year, and that it was going to be a difficult winter. Dame Sally left her role as the government's chief medical adviser to become head of Cambridge University's Trinity College a few months before Covid-19 struck. Dame Sally wants tough measures to tackle obesity She has co-authored a book arguing for more effective measures to promote healthier living. Among the measures she supports are taxes on foods high in salt or sugar. She said: ""It is incontrovertible that if you are overweight - particularly if you are obese - you increase your risk of death. ""All of the diseases associated with overweight, whether it is hypertension, diabetes or others, increase the risk of getting very ill. ""Clearly it is terribly important that we sort out obesity and overweight to improve the health of the nation."" She said that while average life expectancy in the UK had increased, the average number of years of healthy life had not, and among the most deprived sections of the population it had come down. The UK government unveiled a plan to tackle rates of obesity in July, which included a ban on ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food in England, restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. There will also be a national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily, a consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether, and a review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops. Dame Sally Davies has made very few comments about the Covid-19 pandemic. She has been understandably keen not to tread on the toes of her successor Chris Whitty. She knows that any future review of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis will partly cover her time as chief medical adviser. But she has always been passionate about the need to improve health and wellbeing and implement tough anti-obesity policies. So her broader arguments about the vulnerability of the UK population to Covid because of long-standing structural health inequalities is consistent with her stated views when in Whitehall. It is a sobering thought that more people died in the UK with coronavirus than in many other leading industrialised nations because of poor underlying health. Dame Sally has the issue out there for others to consider as they look for lessons to be learned. With her put stature and experience, the message cannot be ignored.

She said that while average life expectancy in the UK had increased, the average number of years of healthy life had not, and among the most deprived sections of the population it had come down. The UK government unveiled a plan to tackle rates of obesity in July, which included a ban on ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food in England, restrictions on where foods high in fat and sugar can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. There will also be a national campaign to help people lose weight and eat more healthily, a consultation on whether to stop fast food adverts online altogether, and a review of traffic light labelling on food and drinks sold in shops. Dame Sally Davies has made very few comments about the Covid-19 pandemic. She has been understandably keen not to tread on the toes of her successor Chris Whitty. She knows that any future review of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis will partly cover her time as chief medical adviser. But she has always been passionate about the need to improve health and wellbeing and implement tough anti-obesity policies. So her broader arguments about the vulnerability of the UK population to Covid because of long-standing structural health inequalities is consistent with her stated views when in Whitehall. It is a sobering thought that more people died in the UK with coronavirus than in many other leading industrialised nations because of poor underlying health. Dame Sally has the issue out there for others to consider as they look for lessons to be learned. With her put stature and experience, the message cannot be ignored.

"Cole (left) and Walsh (centre) appear in a promotional image for Revolution of the Daleks Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole will make their final appearances as the Doctor's companions in the Doctor Who special on New Year's Day, the BBC has revealed. Walsh said viewers should ""expect a lot of poignancy"" from the episode. The pair have been at Jodie Whittaker's side since 2018. Cole said it had been ""an honour"" to play Ryan opposite Walsh's Graham and Whittaker's Doctor. Titled Revolution of the Daleks, the special will also see John Barrowman return as Captain Jack Harkness. Barrowman said it was ""great being back"" and that returning to the show had been ""like going home"". Barrowman first appeared as Captain Jack in 2005 Walsh and Cole made their Doctor Who debuts at the start of Whittaker's first full series as the time-travelling Time Lord. They went on to appear in two series as well as the 2019 special Resolution, which also featured the villainous Daleks. Meet the Doctor's three new companions Why Doctor Whoâs assistant is my real hero Walsh said it was ""amazing"" to be ""only one of a few people on the planet"" to have battled the Doctor's long-time robotic nemeses. The comedian and host of game show The Chase said he had ""absolutely loved"" being on the long-running sci-fi programme and would miss ""everyone and everything"" involved. Meanwhile, Cole said filming his last scene had been ""emotional"". Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole made their Doctor Who debuts in 2018 Barrowman, who has played Captain Jack in both Doctor Who and its spin-off Torchwood, said the Daleks were the show's ""quintessential"" villains. ""They are never to be underestimated as they will always find a way to survive, which is exactly why they have survived over centuries,"" he added. Cole said: ""Working with the Daleks is sort of like working with Doctor Who royalty. You have to respect them because they are so iconic."" The Christmas special will see Mandip Gill resume her role as companion Yasmin, while Chris Noth returns as business tycoon Jack Robertson. It will also see Dame Harriet Walter make her Doctor Who debut alongside Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, of Utopia and Misfits fame. ""We've crammed this year's Doctor Who festive special with an explosion of extraordinary acting talent,"" executive producer Chris Chibnall said.

""Particularly during the month of December, officers and police staff will be working hard to tackle crime, keep communities safe, and play our part in reducing the spread of coronavirus. ""We encourage the public to follow the rules in place for their part of the country, and to remain vigilant as shops begin to open again in time for Christmas as criminals may seek to exploit opportunities to commit crime.""

"An ex-manager of an insulation maker whose product was used on Grenfell Tower has apologised for dismissing fire safety concerns and threatening legal action in internal emails. Philip Heath, who works for Kingspan, forwarded a customer's fire test query and wrote that they were ""getting me confused with someone who gives a dam"". Mr Heath admitted his reaction was ""unprofessional"". The inquiry heard last week the firm""stretched the truth"" on fire safety. On Monday, the inquiry heard that Mr Heath used strong language in an internal email response. Ex-employee Ivor Meredith, who was the firm's technical director, told the inquiry last week that Kingspan fire-tested its cladding in 2005, but changed the formulation the next year. The first phase of the Grenfell inquiry concluded that cladding put on the west London tower block during its refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017 in which 72 people died. Kingspan K15 insulation was used in the flammable cladding system mounted on to Grenfell Tower, alongside Celotex RS5000. In October 2008 emails, an employee of facade engineers Wintech asked Kingspan for clarity on what basis its Kooltherm K15 insulation was suitable for buildings taller than 18 metres. Grenfell insulation firm 'stretched the truth' No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Grenfell insulation firm behaved 'dishonestly' A Kingspan employee said it was ""getting tricky what to write"" without ""putting ourselves in a legal situation"". In an internal email, Mr Heath responded using strong language: ""Wintech can go f'#ck themselves, and if they are not careful we'll sue the a'#se of them"". Inquiry lawyer Kate Grange QC challenged Mr Heath on his comment, saying: ""Can you explain why you wrote that, given Wintech were giving entirely accurate advice to their customers?"" He replied: ""It was totally unprofessional and on reflection I wouldn't have said that. I think it was frustration we were going around in circles with them."" He was asked if it reflected a ""culture"" within Kingspan ""in terms of its response to these kinds of requests"". Mr Heath said: ""I don't believe so. Like in any organisation, you have your good times and your difficult times. ""We were just going around in circles and a bit of frustration came out there on a Friday. ""I think we did take life safety seriously. We provided Wintech with the data we had for them to make the appropriate analysis."" Mr Heath, now divisional business development director at Kingspan, also apologised after reacting to a similar query by writing that the firm making the request was ""getting me confused with someone who gives a dam"". He added in the forwarded email: ""I'm trying to think of a way out of this one, imagine a fire running up this tower !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Mr Heath told the inquiry he had forwarded the email to a terminally ill friend, adding: ""I can only apologise for the contents of this email at the time made in 2008. ""Keith was a dear friend of mine who was terminally ill at the time. I was just forwarding him an email to give a snapshot of some of the work I was working on. ""It had no reflection on how I felt, I was just trying to lighten his load and lighten my load.""

"This video can not be played FM thanks healthcare staff with Â£500 payment Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The SNP leader announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The first minister also announced that Â£100 grants will be given to low-income families who may struggle over winter. Ms Sturgeon said these payments could be made before Christmas, and would help households ""pay their fuel bills and make sure children don't go hungry"". SNP pledge free school meals for all primary pupils Sturgeon defends handling of Covid pandemic In her speech to the SNP conference, Ms Sturgeon said ""clap for carers"" events earlier in the pandemic had been ""really important"", but that the applause ""was never enough"". She said appreciation must be ""shown in a more tangible way"" through the Â£500 payment, which would be completed before the end of the current financial year. She added: ""There are no strings attached. Of course a payment like this can never come close to expressing our full admiration for those who have cared for us so heroically. ""But to our health and care workers, it is a demonstration of what we collectively owe you - and a heartfelt thank you for the sacrifices you have made."" She also urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to use the UK government's powers to make sure the payments are tax-free. A spokesperson from HM Treasury said: ""The income tax on these payments is paid to Scotland, not Westminster - and the Scottish government has the powers and funding to gross up the payment if it wishes."" The bonus is expected to be paid to about 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff, and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Ms Sturgeon said the cash payment was a ""more tangible"" way of thanking health staff than applause The Royal College of Nursing in Scotland said its members would be ""happy"" with the payment - but that it did not address ""the years of pay restraint or the ongoing demands that nursing staff face"". Associate director Norman Provan called for ""a pay deal that truly values the skills, clinical expertise and contribution of nursing staff"". Ms Sturgeon said the payment had ""no strings attached"" and was separate from any negotiations about pay in the longer term. The SNP leader also announced payments of Â£100 to households which are currently in receipt of free school meals, as part of a Â£100m fund to help low-income Scots this winter. About a quarter of this is to be spent on winter grants to low income families, benefiting about 150,000 households. Grants will be given to low-income families ahead of Christmas to help them through winter The cash is designed to support those who would have received the Scottish government's new weekly Â£10 child payment, which was due to be introduced around now but has been deferred to February. A further Â£25m will be distributed to vulnerable people through local authorities and Â£15m will go to charities, with further allocations to help the homeless and tackle fuel poverty. The first minister said the pandemic had shown that it should no longer be accepted that problems with poverty and inequality are ""inevitable or insoluble"". She added: ""Initiatives like this are not just about providing practical help to those who need it most - they are an expression of our values and of the kind of country we are seeking to build."" Coping with and recovering from Covid was the key theme of Nicola Sturgeon's speech to the SNP conference. As well as the ""thank you"" payments to NHS and social care staff, there was the Â£100m winter hardship fund and extra cash for apprenticeships. Aside from this extra spending - funded from the Scottish government's share of coronavirus cash from the Treasury - there was a more fundamental question. Nicola Sturgeon invited her online audience to consider who should be trusted to rebuild Scotland after the pandemic and any disruption Brexit might bring. Westminster or Holyrood? The UK government or the government of an independent Scotland? That is the question she hopes will be resolved in a further independence referendum in the early part of the next Scottish Parliament, after next May's election. While her opponents in pro-UK parties regard talk of indyref2 as irresponsible while the covid crisis is still unfolding, critics in her own party don't think she's nearly bold enough. They want her to set out a plan B for achieving independence if the UK government continues to refuse to agree a 2014 style referendum. Ms Sturgeon also used her speech to look ahead to May's Scottish Parliament election, saying she would seek the authority of the people of Scotland to hold a new independence referendum in the ""early part"" of the new Holyrood term. She denied that she should instead be focusing on the pandemic, saying: ""Independence is not a distraction from the task of post-Covid reconstruction, it is essential to getting that right."" And she questioned whether Scots wanted ""Boris Johnson's band of Brexiteers"" making decisions for them rather than an ""outward looking, internationalist"" SNP government. On Saturday the SNP pledged to extend free school meals to all primary school children if they retain power after the Holyrood elections in May. Opposition parties have accused Ms Sturgeon and her party of focusing on independence at the cost of other issues, including dealing with Covid-19. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon had made ""a series of promises brought to you by [Chancellor] Rishi Sunak's spending"", and that the UK government had supplied ""vast sums"" to fight the pandemic. He added: ""All weekend she's been talking up another divisive referendum next year, while we're in the middle of a pandemic - it's completely out of touch with people across Scotland."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the Â£500 payment was ""no substitute at all for the significant increase in salary that all Scotland's health and care workers deserve"". He added: ""This sum announced by Nicola Sturgeon will not make up for the years of pay restraint and austerity that staff in these sectors have had imposed on them by Tory and SNP ministers."" Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie also said the ""welcome"" payment to health staff ""must not become an alternative to a proper uplift in the Scottish government's pay policy"". And Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon had ""put independence first"", adding: ""Everything else that needs to be done in Scotland, the mammoth task of recovery in front of us, all of that will have to wait for years in the queue behind another referendum.""

"Adamo Canto admitted stealing medals and photographs from the Palace A Buckingham Palace catering assistant has admitted stealing medals and photographs from the Queen's residence. Adamo Canto, 37, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court to three counts of theft between 11 November 2019 and 7 August 2020. Police found a ""significant quantity"" of stolen items at his quarters at the Royal Mews in Buckingham Palace. Canto, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court at a later date. More stories from around Yorkshire During the Covid-19 pandemic, Canto's role was changed to include more cleaning which offered him access to offices and other areas he would not normally have been given, the court was told. Some of the stolen goods, worth between Â£10,000 and Â£100,000, were listed for sale on eBay, prosecutor Simon Maughan said. A total of 37 items were offered for sale ""well under"" their true value on eBay, Mr Maughan said, with Canto making Â£7,741. One item was a royal state banquet photo album of US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK, worth Â£1,500. Canto also took official signed photographs of the Duke of Sussex and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Some 77 items were taken from the palace shop, while others were stolen from places such as staff lockers, the Queen's Gallery shop and the Duke of York's storeroom, the court heard. Canto admitted stealing a Companion of Bath medal belonging to the Master of the Household, which was sold online for Â£350. In a statement, Vice Admiral Master Tony Johnstone-Burt said he first realised the medal was missing because he needed to wear it for the Queen's Trooping the Colour and was later told by staff that stolen items were for sale online. Canto also stole a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order medal from the locker of former British Army officer Maj Gen Richard Sykes, which was given to him by the Queen in 2010. District Judge Alexander Jacobs released Canto on conditional bail and warned he faced a possible jail sentence. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the âplan through to Easterâ would see areas âcome down in the tiers they are inâ. No 10 has published data behind its decisions over England's new tier system as it tries to win MPs' support. Downing Street's report said it sought to ""balance the many complex impacts"" of restrictions and keep them in place ""for as short a time as possible"". It said allowing the virus to spread exponentially ""would lead to impacts... considered intolerable for society"". But senior Tory MP Mark Harper said the ""wheels are coming off the government's arguments"". MPs will vote on the plans on Tuesday. The government announced itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus last week, with Boris Johnson telling reporters on Monday: ""We can't afford to take our foot off the throat of the beast... to let it out of control again."" But a number of Tory backbenchers have threatened to vote against the motion when it comes to the Commons, including the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of MPs - chaired by Mr Harper. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would abstain on the vote, saying he had ""serious misgivings"" about the measures. But he said it was ""in the national interest"" to let the restrictions pass through the Commons without Labour's opposition to ensure some measures were in place. A No 10 spokesman accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic, instead of working with the government to find a way through this difficult time for the British people"". PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? What are the new rules for going to the pub? England's current lockdown will end in the early hours of Wednesday 2 December and will see the country placed into one of three tiers: medium (one), high (two) and very high (three). However, the majority of the country, over 55 million, will be under the strictest two sets of measures. The announcement led to criticism from some Tory MPs, who were concerned about the impact in their constituencies. Mr Johnson wrote to his party twice over the weekend to appeal for their backing and to grant some of the CRG's demands. They included the publication of the data on the health, social and economic impact of the tiers, and the promise MPs could vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. But the government report -published on Monday,external- said it was ""not possible to forecast the precise economic impact of a specific change to a specific restriction with confidence"". The document is largely made up of information already available. It said the challenge of balancing health and societal impacts was not straightforward, but the government would continue to pursue the best overall outcomes. The chair of the Treasury select committee, Tory MP Mel Stride, condemned the report as ""a rehashed document [that] offers very little further in economic terms"". He told the BBC he would support the government to ensure there were some restrictions in place, but added: ""It's frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country. ""Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document."" The CRG chair, Mr Harper, said the report ""seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny"". He repeated accusations that the government's modelling on deaths and hospital capacity had been wrong, adding: ""We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections and they have not been forthcoming."" While Labour will abstain, the Liberal Democrats have said they will not back the plan - although it is not clear whether they will vote against or abstain. The SNP will abstain in the vote, as it only covers restrictions in England. With many of the opposition MPs abstaining, it would take a huge Tory rebellion for the measures to fall, which is unlikely. At first glance there doesn't appear to be much, if any, new information in this document. The government's analysis draws on studies and data already in the public domain to try to assess the impact of the tiered system of restrictions. So will it convince Conservative MPs sceptical about the need for tighter restrictions that they are, in fact, necessary? Yes and no. Some Tory backbenchers may be satisfied the government has at least attempted to provide further evidence that tougher measures are needed. They've made their point. Others will flick through the 48 pages and discard it, knowing all along that without some elusive magic formula the government could provide, they would never have been convinced. The government is likely to win Tuesday's vote, but as the pandemic wears on, it is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep its own MPs on side. Speaking shortly before the data was published, Mr Johnson said he ""understood people's frustration"" with the stricter tiers. He said: ""The tiering system is tough, but it is designed to be tough to keep [the virus] under control."" ""What we can't do is forsake and abandon all the gains we have made now just when we are starting to see real progress in the science."" In the report, the government pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a rapid increase in people testing positive for the virus between September and November - from 59,800 a week to 633,000 a week. It said the new ""strengthened"" tier system was ""designed to keep R [the infection rate] below one so that prevalence continues to fall, the significant impacts of the virus are reduced, and so that, ultimately, fewer restrictions are required."" It added that a ""stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy"", with the government's view being ""the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society"". The document also pointed to the economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which were published alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spending review last week - predicting the value of the economy will fall by 11.3% by the end of the financial year. But, while the report conceded there would be ""major impacts"" on the economy from the restrictions, it added: ""Any attempt to estimate the specific economic impacts of precise changes to individual restrictions for a defined period of time would be subject to such wide uncertainty as to not be meaningful for precise policy making"". This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Labour leader Sir Keir defended his party's decision to abstain on the vote for measures, saying it was ""better that these regulations can be amended and put in place than if there are no regulations"". He said the ""serious misgivings"" he had included over the performance of the test and trace system and ""real concerns"" over the level of economic support for those in the highest tiers. But, Sir Keir added: ""Although the number of cases is coming down as a result of lockdown, the virus is still a significant risk and in principal we accept there is going to have to be continued restrictions."" However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs.

"An ex-manager of an insulation maker whose product was used on Grenfell Tower has apologised for dismissing fire safety concerns and threatening legal action in internal emails. Philip Heath, who works for Kingspan, forwarded a customer's fire test query and wrote that they were ""getting me confused with someone who gives a dam"". Mr Heath admitted his reaction was ""unprofessional"". The inquiry heard last week the firm""stretched the truth"" on fire safety. On Monday, the inquiry heard that Mr Heath used strong language in an internal email response. Ex-employee Ivor Meredith, who was the firm's technical director, told the inquiry last week that Kingspan fire-tested its cladding in 2005, but changed the formulation the next year. The first phase of the Grenfell inquiry concluded that cladding put on the west London tower block during its refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017 in which 72 people died. Kingspan K15 insulation was used in the flammable cladding system mounted on to Grenfell Tower, alongside Celotex RS5000. In October 2008 emails, an employee of facade engineers Wintech asked Kingspan for clarity on what basis its Kooltherm K15 insulation was suitable for buildings taller than 18 metres. Grenfell insulation firm 'stretched the truth' No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Grenfell insulation firm behaved 'dishonestly' A Kingspan employee said it was ""getting tricky what to write"" without ""putting ourselves in a legal situation"". In an internal email, Mr Heath responded using strong language: ""Wintech can go f'#ck themselves, and if they are not careful we'll sue the a'#se of them"". Inquiry lawyer Kate Grange QC challenged Mr Heath on his comment, saying: ""Can you explain why you wrote that, given Wintech were giving entirely accurate advice to their customers?"" He replied: ""It was totally unprofessional and on reflection I wouldn't have said that. I think it was frustration we were going around in circles with them."" He was asked if it reflected a ""culture"" within Kingspan ""in terms of its response to these kinds of requests"". Mr Heath said: ""I don't believe so. Like in any organisation, you have your good times and your difficult times. ""We were just going around in circles and a bit of frustration came out there on a Friday. ""I think we did take life safety seriously. We provided Wintech with the data we had for them to make the appropriate analysis."" Mr Heath, now divisional business development director at Kingspan, also apologised after reacting to a similar query by writing that the firm making the request was ""getting me confused with someone who gives a dam"". He added in the forwarded email: ""I'm trying to think of a way out of this one, imagine a fire running up this tower !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Mr Heath told the inquiry he had forwarded the email to a terminally ill friend, adding: ""I can only apologise for the contents of this email at the time made in 2008. ""Keith was a dear friend of mine who was terminally ill at the time. I was just forwarding him an email to give a snapshot of some of the work I was working on. ""It had no reflection on how I felt, I was just trying to lighten his load and lighten my load.""

"Adamo Canto admitted stealing medals and photographs from the Palace A Buckingham Palace catering assistant has admitted stealing medals and photographs from the Queen's residence. Adamo Canto, 37, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court to three counts of theft between 11 November 2019 and 7 August 2020. Police found a ""significant quantity"" of stolen items at his quarters at the Royal Mews in Buckingham Palace. Canto, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court at a later date. More stories from around Yorkshire During the Covid-19 pandemic, Canto's role was changed to include more cleaning which offered him access to offices and other areas he would not normally have been given, the court was told. Some of the stolen goods, worth between Â£10,000 and Â£100,000, were listed for sale on eBay, prosecutor Simon Maughan said. A total of 37 items were offered for sale ""well under"" their true value on eBay, Mr Maughan said, with Canto making Â£7,741. One item was a royal state banquet photo album of US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK, worth Â£1,500. Canto also took official signed photographs of the Duke of Sussex and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Some 77 items were taken from the palace shop, while others were stolen from places such as staff lockers, the Queen's Gallery shop and the Duke of York's storeroom, the court heard. Canto admitted stealing a Companion of Bath medal belonging to the Master of the Household, which was sold online for Â£350. In a statement, Vice Admiral Master Tony Johnstone-Burt said he first realised the medal was missing because he needed to wear it for the Queen's Trooping the Colour and was later told by staff that stolen items were for sale online. Canto also stole a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order medal from the locker of former British Army officer Maj Gen Richard Sykes, which was given to him by the Queen in 2010. District Judge Alexander Jacobs released Canto on conditional bail and warned he faced a possible jail sentence. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Business periodically throws up pantomime villains who vault from the financial pages to the front of the tabloids and become the subject of public vilification. Edward Heath called Tiny Rowland, the corporate raider, ""the unacceptable face of capitalism"", Robert Maxwell was excoriated for raiding the Mirror Group pensions, and more recently Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron, went to jail for 12 years for enriching himself at the expense of shareholders and suppliers. Sir Philip Green, the boss (but not the owner) of Arcadia Group, is the latest business leader to be put in the pillory. It began with his sale of the department store BHS to Dominic Chappell for a token sum in 2015. BHS, which was part of Arcadia, collapsed a year later, leaving a big hole in the pension fund. Sir Philip sold BHS for Â£1 in 2015, a year before it went bust with a Â£571m pension deficit, to little-known businessman Dominic Chappell Sir Philip was accused of having sold the company to Mr Chappell deliberately to avoid the retirement plan liability, a claim he vigorously denied. He later paid Â£363m to make good the scheme. The looming administration of Arcadia puts Sir Philip in the firing line again. He will face calls to repair any deficit in the Arcadia scheme, despite he and the company's owner, his wife Lady Cristina Green, having put substantial additional sums into the pension in recent years. There will also be accusations of his having been a poor manager. While the rest of the fashion retail world was getting out of the High Street and moving online as quickly as possible, Sir Philip was reluctant to take the plunge, and eventually laid low by the fatal combination of the internet and pandemic-related shop closures. But has he actually done anything wrong? Lawyers will argue that the company - not its owners - is the legal entity responsible for maintaining the financial health of the pension scheme. Sir Philip - who runs Arcadia - and Monaco-based Lady Cristina Green - who owns it As far as is known, Arcadia did not ignore any directions from the pension regulator to mend the pension, and indeed received an endorsement from the Pension Protection Fund  for a company voluntary arrangement - a form of insolvency that allows a business to restructure its finances  - in June last year. Several prominent retail businesses have gone into administration in the past two years, but in no case has there been an outcry for the owners to finance pension deficits personally. There may be no infringement of the law, but what attracts attention to Sir Philip's case is that he and his wife have become immensely rich on Arcadia's back. In 2005 the company paid Lady Green a Â£1.2bn dividend, the foundation of the Green fortune. Now that the company has fallen on hard times, should there be a moral duty on the family to help those thrown out of work? The relevant example here is not Robert Maxwell or Tiny Rowland, but a group of businessmen who were also vilified for their management of a British icon. John Towers, Peter Beale, Nick Stephenson and John Edwards were the ""Phoenix Four"", who bought MG Rover from BMW in 2000 with the implicit backing of the Labour government and a hefty dowry from the German carmaker. The Phoenix Four bought MG Rover which collapsed in 2005 with the loss of 6,000 jobs They proceeded to enrich themselves to the tune of several million pounds apiece while the company slowly spiralled downwards and eventually collapsed. They did nothing wrong - a government report into the collapse found their behaviour ""inappropriate"" - but they quietly volunteered to be banned as directors in future. What the inquiry into MG Rover's demise showed was that ownership means just that. Once sold to the Phoenix Four, the once-great Birmingham carmaker became a piece of personal property to be used as the Phoenix Four saw fit. The same is true of the Greens and Arcadia. Yet even if there is no legal claim for them to refill the Arcadia pension, they might consider the wider court of public opinion, which is much less forgiving than any judge. Sir Philip can contemplate whether he wants to be remembered as the man who enriched his family, but left others out of pocket, or as the retail tycoon who put his staff first, even when his empire ran out of steam.

"The collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia is likely to result in a cut in the value of thousands of shopworkers' pensions. Theretailer's demisehas led to calls for Sir Philip Green and Lady Green, who run and own the company respectively, to fill the financial gap. However, as with any business that goes bust, there is a system in place to protect the majority of pension payouts to ensure staff do not lose out entirely. When you work for a company, you are offered membership of a pension scheme, into which the employer makes a contribution and you add to via your pay. If that businesses collapses, then the contributions stop. A new owner may take on the pension scheme, or - in many cases - certain types of pension scheme go into a rescue scheme called the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). It pays pensioners already receiving their company pension, and protects those who have yet to reach pension age. The PPF is paid for, in part, by a levy on other pension funds. No. Anyone with adefined contribution pension,externalhas built up a pension pot which belongs to them. This is often managed through a separate investment company and will not go to the PPF. The individual can decide how it is invested and what to do with it when they reach retirement. The PPF gets involved with so-calleddefined benefit pensions,external- when the employer effectively gives a pension promise about how much you will receive at retirement. This is often based on your final salary, or an average of your career salary. The PPF usually takes on a failed company's pension scheme and makes payments (officially compensation) to its members. Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Arcadia's two defined benefit pension schemes are now expected to go into the PPF, after assessors have gone through the books of the schemes. In a statement, the trustees of the schemes said: ""Because Arcadia Group Limited is in administration, the schemes are now expected to enter a Pension Protection Fund (PPF) assessment period. ""The trustees will now liaise closely with the administrators while continuing to work with the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund to ensure the best return possible is achieved from asset sales and to make sure the schemes' entry to PPF assessment is as seamless as possible."" That depends on your stage in life. The PPF promises to pay your pension in full, if you are already receiving pension payments. However, there are some caveats. The first is that the pension may not increase in value each year as much as expected. This increase is pegged to the rising cost of living as measured by inflation. The PPF uses the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, which is generally lower than another measure - the Retail Prices Index (RPI) - used by many active pension schemes. The annual increase only relates to pension accrued since 1997. Any pension built up before that is not increased in line with inflation which is a further blow to older members, and those who worked at the shops more than two decades ago, particularly those who are approaching retirement now. For people yet to receive their pension because they are too young, or those who have retired early, the PPF only pays 90% of their pension promise when they hit pension age. There is a cap on how much someone can receive each year. At present, at the age of 65, that limit is Â£37,315 a year. Taken together, all this means, on average, a person with a pension administered by the PPF may receive about 75% to 80% of what they would have expected to have received. There are an estimated 10,000 people with defined benefit pensions from Arcadia - the majority in the Arcadia Group Pension Scheme and the rest in the Arcadia Group Senior Executives Pension Scheme. In recent times, these defined benefit schemes were closed to new members of staff who work for Arcadia's brands such as Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, so most of those affected are more long-serving workers or people who have left, or already retired. At present, the pension scheme does not have the money to pay all future pension obligations. This deficit, according to pensions consultant John Ralfe, is Â£350m. This is large, but not unprecedented. Some, but not all, of this shortfall can be made up by a Â£50m promise from Arcadia-owner Lady Green, and by administrators selling certain properties owned by the company, Mr Ralfe said. There have been calls for the Greens to make up the shortfall. If this were to happen, members would receive all of the pension they were promised. Sir Philip Green and Lady Green have a widely-publicised fortune Labour MP Stephen Timms, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund."" This demand is based on what Mr Timms and others would regard as a moral obligation from the Greens who have huge wealth based on a Â£1.2bn dividend Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife, tax-free in 2005. There is also the backdrop of a scandal when BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a large pension deficit. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme, after having been accused of earlier selling the business for Â£1 to avoid pension obligations, something he vigorously denied. This time, at this stage, there appears to be no legal case which could be pursued by the regulator to oblige the Greens to make any further payment into the pension scheme. The Pension Protection Fund said: ""Insolvency events are a concerning time for employees and scheme members and we want to assure the members of Arcadia's defined benefit pension schemes of our ongoing protection. The robust negotiations at the time of the CVA last year have ensured that both schemes are now in a better financial position.""

"This video can not be played An Irish bar has been ""turned into a coffee shop"" by the new rules, its owner says Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"". Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00. The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November. Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter. How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What are you allowed to do? The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector. ""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another."" The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added. The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality withinlevel three areas in Scotland. However the rule allowingfour people from four different householdsto meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed. The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week. Dai Dearden said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"" The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants. ""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea. Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants. ""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said. Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"". ""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"". This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford defends the new rules Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that."" ""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes."" Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties. She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade."" ""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are."" Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year."" Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business. A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules. ""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous. ""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said. Folly Farm zoo said it would be closing its doors as a result of the announcement The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell. ""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said. ""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time."" BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission. Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November. Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"". According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales. Hospitality businesses are being offered extra support, the Welsh Government said Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover."" Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown. ""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said. Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"". Pubs have been allowed to open in Wales since the end of the firebreak lockdown The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000. The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support. A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses. The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000. The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before. But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders. Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to. Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual. Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade. The money they are getting from the Welsh Government might well pay overheads like rent and insurance but these are businesses that have already taken a huge hit this year.

"Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia has gone into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. The High Street giant has hired administrators from Deloitte after the pandemic ""severely impacted"" sales across the group. No redundancies would be announced immediately, it said in a statement. And Arcadia's stores will continue to trade as Deloitte considers all options available to the group. All orders made over the Black Friday weekend will also be honoured, the administrators added. Sir Philip Green's retail empire had failed to secure extra funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough. The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business. Has Topshop boss Philip Green done anything wrong? Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was Ian Grabiner, the boss of Arcadia, said it marked an ""incredibly sad"" day for the group. ""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands,"" he said. ""Throughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group, in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side. ""Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe."" Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said that it would be working with Arcadia management to assess all of the options available to the group's brands, which also include Evans and Outfit. He said Deloitte would rapidly seek expressions of interest and expected to identify one, or more, buyers to hopefully ensure the future of the businesses. Fashion retailer Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of Arcadia Group's big name brands, such as Topshop. In the pastit has bought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. The prospects for the 13,000 workers look very challenging. There is a lot of industry chatter that online-only retailers might want to snap up the names that still have some consumer power - such as Topshop and Topman. But while the likes of Boohoo and Asos may want the brands, they will not want to take on a portfolio of physical stores - which is where most of the jobs are. Other brands like Wallis, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton are not considered very relevant to a new generation of consumers. And what of Sir Philip? His gruff and combative style belies - or is perhaps explained by - the fact he is much more thin-skinned and sensitive than you might think. He will feel this failure personally - but that will be little comfort to the thousands of employees facing an uncertain future with Christmas round the corner and rising unemployment limiting their other job options. He is also very stubborn. That resistance to change, and insisting he knew best, was at the heart of Arcadia's demise. It's hard to see another act in what has been a career full of drama and controversy. As many have said, at heart he was not really a retailer - he was a shrewd financier - a money man. The future of retail requires a very different skill-set. Arcadia was once a darling of the High Street, but long before coronavirus, Sir Philip's brands were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""While the Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the company's decline, in reality, the writing had been on the wall for Arcadia for some time. ""Its competitors forged ahead with high-profile online propositions that it simply failed to match."" In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn. The pandemic did also lead to a huge drop-off in sales as stores had to shut for long stretches. While the business persuaded its landlords to lower its rents in June, it was not enough to steady the ship. Arcadia's 13,000 workers now face an anxious wait. One store manager told the BBC they felt ""angry, sad and disappointed"" on Monday. ""I've now got a large team that's all terrified of what's going to happen to them and their futures"", they said. ""I am just hoping that something can be done to preserve the brands and the employees' jobs."" This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Dave Gill, from retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""It is crucial that the voice of staff is heard over the future of the business. ""We are seeking urgent meetings [with the administrators] and need assurances on what efforts are being made to save jobs, the plan for stores to continue trading and the funding of the pension scheme."" Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund, which has 10,000 members. Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group's workers. Business Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted on Monday that the independent Pensions Regulator ""has a range of powers to protect pension schemes"", and that he would be keeping a ""very close eye"" on the administrators' report on director conduct. Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile,Mr Chappell was recently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. Arcadia is the latest major retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the pandemic. Competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March. The collapse of Arcadia could also affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans across the department store chain. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores. Are you an Arcadia employee?

"Over the past week, BBC Wales has asked readers to submit their questions about the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. We asked if there was anything you wanted to know and whether the rules are confusing you - and pledged to try and answer. Here's what you wanted to know. People die with coronavirus, not of coronavirus - just as people die with cancer, not of cancer. That is because the actual cause of death is the effect the virus - or cancer - has on the body. For example, Covid-19 can cause a huge degree of inflammation which becomes multi-organ failure and this is the cause of death. Similarly some cancers can, for example, damage blood vessels which causes bleeding in the brain - a stroke - which can be fatal. Therefore the damage to the body which causes death has been caused by coronavirus, but coronavirus is not the direct cause of death - the cause of death in this example would be organ failure. So the deaths are with, not of, coronavirus. In recording deaths with Covid-19, medical professionals will consider: ""Would this person be alive today if they had not caught coronavirus?"" It has been estimated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that 88.9% of deaths in Wales where doctors have mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, that it was the underlying cause of death. So in October, 236 deaths were due to Covid-19. But there were another 49 when Covid-19 was involved and mentioned on the death certificate, and a factor in the death. In Wales, Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 2,629 of deaths registered up to 7 November. It is important to note the figures released daily by Public Health Wales or weekly by the ONS do not include all people who have tested positive in 28 days. Rather, they include people who have had confirmed or suspected coronavirus within the past 28 days which isbelieved to have been a factor in their death. Taking safety measures such as working from home, staying home as much as possible and respecting the rules will put you in the best position to avoid the virus. However, anyone can catch coronavirus and anyone can pass it on. It only takes one interaction with someone who may not even realise they are infected to potentially catch coronavirus. While coronavirus is mostly transmitted when people cough, sneeze or talk, there are also some studies showing it can be transmitted by touching an infected surface - such as on groceries or packages delivered to your home. These studies have mostly been done in lab conditions and some experts have thrown doubt on the actual threat posed by surface transmission in real life. Either way - to best protect yourself from catching coronavirus from surfaces, regularly wash your hands for 20 seconds. If and when a vaccine (or more than one vaccine) is approved for use in the UK and begins to be rolled out, safety measures such as those you've listed will still need to be in place for some time. That's because it will take months to vaccinate everyone who wishes to be vaccinated. As you've correctly implied, there are still questions over whether uptake of the vaccine will be high due to misinformation and myths on social media, and there may be some people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. We have fact checked some of the most widely shared false claims. Even if the uptake is good, we are likely to be well into 2021 before all the relevant groups have been offered the vaccination - which will probably begin with front-line NHS staff and care staff, followed by the elderly and others most vulnerable to the virus. So we'll need to continue taking safety measures for the time being. It is early days, but it's likely the Welsh Government will continue to look at infection rates the way they have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic, and allow these measures to be dropped when scientific advisers believe it is safe to do so. It has been recognised throughout the pandemic that Welsh people have made sacrifices and continue to make sacrifices - and Mark Drakeford has repeated during news briefings that every death is a tragedy. In making decisions over lockdown measures, the Welsh Government looks at several factors including the R number - the average number of people a sick person could pass the virus on to. The aim of lockdowns is to reduce the R number below one, which means case numbers would begin to fall - therefore fewer people are getting ill, leading to fewer hospital admissions so the NHS does not become overwhelmed, and fewer deaths. Lockdown restrictions since March, along with social distancing and other safety measures, have served to shrink the R number. This modelling chart looks at the worse case scenario for deaths by day, if there is a slow response in Wales However, as the country has moved out of lockdowns, the R number has risen again. In September, a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for this winter was published by Swansea University experts, mentioning 636,000 infections, leading to 18,200 hospital admissions - peaking in January - and potentially 6,300 deaths. Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales If the NHS becomes overwhelmed, this does not just affect Covid patients but it restricts the organisation in how well other services such as cancer referrals and A&E can operate. This shows how the range of the R-number has changed in Wales. The Welsh Government's latest estimate is that it could be as high as 1.4 It is expected to take years before NHS waiting times are back to pre-coronavirus levels in Wales, according to the organisation's boss. The number of people waiting more than 36 weeks for planned hospital treatments is six times higher than at the start of 2020. Waiting list figures,published in November for the first time since March, showed nearly 169,000 people waiting. The number has grown after most non-urgent treatment was postponed to prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave. Since then, the service has been trying to restart non-emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave. The fear, of course, is that people who have missed out on early intervention as a result will have missed an opportunity for early treatment - such as in the case of Simon Green whose scan was delayed and brain tumour subsequently found to be inoperable. This video can not be played Why this cancer patient feels coronavirus has 'cost me a future' As a result of such delays, Prof Tom Crosby of the Wales Cancer Network said as many as 2,000 people could die. The Welsh Government said work was under way to address the issue with health boards. But there are fears had such measures not been taken to reduce pressures on the NHS, the organisation could have been overwhelmed - which would also result in deaths. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? 'I want to know how my dad got coronavirus' How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? ""Not acting would have meant that not only would the health service have been overwhelmed with very poor care of Covid and non-Covid patients, but it also would have been disastrous for our staff,"" Vaughan Gething said. Bacterial infections and viruses are different and, for example, antibiotics only work on bacterial infections and not viruses. However, anti-bacterial hand sanitisers or cleaning products can also be effective on some viruses if the alcohol concentration is high enough. Viruses similar to the structure of coronavirus are sensitive to alcohol and detergents, which can help break down their oily, fatty shells. Hand washing with soap is still the best cleaning practice, according to the NHS. This data is not routinely released, and there could be data protection issues if it were. But local authorities and the Welsh Government have occasionally referenced why lockdown measures have needed to be tightened in certain areas. For example, schools in Cardigan have closed for two weeks after a spike in cases in the area, with Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn blaming ""super-spreader events"" such as ""parties"" and ""pub crawls"". When parts of the south Wales valleys were placed under stricter lockdown measures, transmissions were believed to have been occurring due topeople going into each others' homes and not adhering to social distancing. And measures have been taken in hospitals and care homes when there is evidence of transmission there. So while this data is not routinely made available to the public, when it leads to specific decisions on restrictions, an explanation is usually given. While it takes a few weeks or even longer to fully understand the impact any change in restrictions has made, there are promising early signs the firebreak has helped, the Welsh Government says. The chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Mark Drakeford said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Yes - to some areas. Travel in and out of Wales from England was previously banned unless you had a valid and essential reason, but Welsh Government rules updated on 3 December have changed this. From 18:00 GMT on Friday, travel is only banned between Wales and tier 3 areas of England and tier 3 and 4 areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland. This means you are now able to travel to and from tier 1 and 2 areas - replacing the previous blanket travel ban - although the government strongly advises against travelling to those areas at all. Here's how to find out which tier an area of England is in. Between 23 and 27 December, you can travel anywhere in the UK to form your Christmas bubble. There were calls earlier this year for a spike in excess deaths in January and February in Ceredigion to be investigated. In the first 17 weeks of the year 342 deaths were registered in Ceredigion, according to figures obtained by Newyddion S4C - 22% more than the five-year average. MP Ben Lake wanted to know if Covid-19 was present before it was realised. Cardiff University's Rhian Daniel said this was not ""highly likely"" and was likely due to a similar infection. However, due to antibodies potentially fading to undetectable levels a few months after infection, taking an antibody test now probably wouldn't identify whether that virus you had last winter really was Covid-19 or another virus causing similar symptoms. Scientists and doctors in some European countries haveclaimed to have found evidence of coronavirus circulating earlier than previously thought. And with evidence of coronavirus arriving in the UK onat least 1,300 separate occasions, we may never know exactly when the UK saw its patient zero. Long Covid has now been recognised as a medical condition, and healthcare workers are receiving guidance on it. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life, and it is not necessarily people who were severely ill in hospital who are struck by it. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. Read more on Long Covid here.

"A delay in reporting an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests in Wales has led to a big jump in case rates. Public Health Wales (PHW) said planned IT maintenance meant there was a ""significant under-reporting"" but anyone who tested positive had been contacted in the usual way. The delayed results came from Lighthouse Laboratories, which process about 70% of Wales' tests. The Welsh Conservatives said the news was ""staggering"". The 11,000 extra positive tests were taken between 9 and 15 December. PHW said the ""vast majority"" have been added to itsdashboard,,externalwhich records the figures, on Thursday. 52 more Covid deaths reported in Wales Covid: You asked and we answered How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures show an additional 4,221 cases have been added to the total for the week ending 11 December, an adjustment to what was reported on Wednesday. A total of 11,250 - including the usual daily cases - have been added, meaning the latest weekly case rates have increased as a result. Wales, already at its highest case rate so far, saw a jump to 530.2 cases per 100,000 for the most recent seven days, to 12 December. The case rate stood at 377.8 on Wednesday, although PHW warned this was an underestimation of what we should expect. The new figures showed the case rate for Merthyr Tydfil - already the highest in the UK - is now 1,032.7 cases per 100,000 - with 623 positive tests in the past seven days. Eight council areas in Wales are in the 10 hardest-hit areas in the UK for case rates in latest comparison. There are 14 out of 22 council areas which have their highest case rates so far - including Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Three others would have reported their highest figures on Wednesday, had all the figures been available. PHW said its previous data collection system was ""on its last legs"". ""The system would collapse very frequently and it was proving to be unsustainable to run with its existing system,"" said PHW incident director Dr Giri Shankar. ""This was not an unplanned activity. We knew it was going to have an impact, therefore weconstantly communicated before it actually happened,externaland while it was happening and even after it had happened, to say that this is affecting the results."" The planned maintenance of the NHS Welsh Laboratory Information Management System (WLMS) ""has not affected individuals receiving their results"", PHW insisted. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""The story is not about missing data or computer problems, it's about the seriousness of the situation. ""You were told in advance that this was going to happen. The data was never missing it was always there, waiting to be uploaded into the system."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""With positive cases in Wales rising to record levels it is crucial that the reporting of data is both timely and robust. ""The public need a complete and current picture of the situation to realise the gravity of what we are facing. ""We need urgent reassurance that the failings have been addressed.""

"Sir Philip Green and Jane Shepherdson, former director of Topshop, pictured in 2006 Sir Philip Green's failure to invest in his retail empire Arcadia has made its downfall ""inevitable"", a former boss of its best-known brand Topshop has said. Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is facing collapse putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Jane Shepherdson CBE, credited with turning Topshop into a global brand, said she expected an online retailer to buy the brand and close most stores. Arcadia had been seeking extra cash following lost sales amid the pandemic. But Ms Shepherdson, who ran Topshop until 2006, said that its problems went back much further than the coronavirus outbreak. She told the BBC's World at One programme that Sir Philip had ignored the rise of online shopping, and was now lumbered with a large and expensive store estate which was largely shut due to Covid. ""In addition to that I think the fact that he absolutely declined to invest all of the businesses [in Arcadia] means it was pretty much inevitable [it would fail]."" Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was How high could unemployment go? She said the ""most likely scenario"" for Topshop was that an online retailer would buy the brand, add it to their own portfolio and close most of the stores. ""It's incredibly sadâ¦ the worst thing is for all of the store staff, which are mostly women who are going to be unemployed. ""The supply chains are also going to take a massive hit. I imagine that orders will start to be cancelled very, very shortly."" Ms Shepherdson also accused Sir Philip of being a bully when she worked for him, adding that he used ""to shout at people all the time, he was disrespectful, dismissive, rude"". ""The reason I left was I spent five years keeping him at arm's length from what I considered to be my business, Topshop, and I realised at that point that I couldn't keep him at arm's length any longer and I would actually have to work with him if I stayed and I absolutely didn't want to do that."" The BBC has asked Sir Philip for a comment. Arcadia is a sprawling retail business that owns a chunk of the High Street's fashion brands, including Miss Selfridge, Topman, Wallis and Evans. Questions over the future of Sir Philip's retail empire were raised on Friday, after it emerged that talks with potential lenders for a Â£30m loan had failed. Arcadia was seeking extra cash as coronavirus had caused ""a material impact on trading"" across its businesses, it said. It now needs a breathing space from its creditors and, to gain that, is expected to file for administration. Administration gives a business protection from its creditors while it is put back on an even keel, or while parts or all of it are sold off. It needs the court to grant the appointment of specialist insolvency practitioners, who then look at the best way of raising money to repay its debts, keeping the business or parts of the business going if possible. The process can take up to a year. Even before coronavirus, Arcadia's best-known names were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Former City minister and once chairman of Marks and Spencer, Paul Myners, told the BBC: ""Covid has obviously been a significant factor but the truth is this group of brands has been haemorrhaging now for 15 years. It's become an insignificance. ""Sir Philip never really accepted the opportunity or challenge of online trading. He made no investment in that area at all."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List On Sunday, a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack: ""We tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" The whole retail sector is under pressure. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Sir Philip bought Arcadia Group in 2002. His wife, Lady Cristina Green, is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. In a colourful career, Sir Philip has been both lauded as the ""King of the High Street"" and branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". Read more about the businessman's journey here Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund which has 10,000 members. On Sunday, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Stephen Timms, called on the Green family to plug the gap. ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" the Labour MP said, adding he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip used his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme received their full pension. But he said that even if he did not provide a full top up, Arcadia workers should still receive the majority of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. Sir Philip sold BHS for Â£1 in 2015, a year before it went bust with a Â£571m pension deficit Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell wasrecently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. The collapse of Arcadia could affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans at the department store group JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". Some stores could close, but Arcadia's brands are household names, and are likely to survive in some form. Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of its big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it hasbought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. Arcadia's 13,000 workers face an anxious wait. One told the BBC: ""I'm really worried about what is going to happen to us, especially as it is so close to Christmas. ""It's already been a very tough time, I'm in a role where I can work from home, but I'm not relying on anything being there for me - I've started applying for other jobs."" Holders of vouchers and gift cards with the various Arcadia brands also face uncertainty - with the risk that these cards will become worthless. Administrators and any future owners will decide whether they will be accepted. If the brand folds, then cardholders are owed the money, but are a long way down on the priority list of creditors who need to be paid back after assets are sold. The BBC's business correspondent, Dominic O'Connell, says as with many other clothing retailers struggling with the pandemic shutdown, insolvency looks the only option. But, he says, two questions remain: Can the individual businesses find new owners to take them on, and what amount of public pressure will there be on the Greens to make good any shortfall in the Arcadia pension schemes?

"Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia has gone into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. The High Street giant has hired administrators from Deloitte after the pandemic ""severely impacted"" sales across the group. No redundancies would be announced immediately, it said in a statement. And Arcadia's stores will continue to trade as Deloitte considers all options available to the group. All orders made over the Black Friday weekend will also be honoured, the administrators added. Sir Philip Green's retail empire had failed to secure extra funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough. The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business. Has Topshop boss Philip Green done anything wrong? Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was Ian Grabiner, the boss of Arcadia, said it marked an ""incredibly sad"" day for the group. ""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands,"" he said. ""Throughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group, in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side. ""Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe."" Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said that it would be working with Arcadia management to assess all of the options available to the group's brands, which also include Evans and Outfit. He said Deloitte would rapidly seek expressions of interest and expected to identify one, or more, buyers to hopefully ensure the future of the businesses. Fashion retailer Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of Arcadia Group's big name brands, such as Topshop. In the pastit has bought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. The prospects for the 13,000 workers look very challenging. There is a lot of industry chatter that online-only retailers might want to snap up the names that still have some consumer power - such as Topshop and Topman. But while the likes of Boohoo and Asos may want the brands, they will not want to take on a portfolio of physical stores - which is where most of the jobs are. Other brands like Wallis, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton are not considered very relevant to a new generation of consumers. And what of Sir Philip? His gruff and combative style belies - or is perhaps explained by - the fact he is much more thin-skinned and sensitive than you might think. He will feel this failure personally - but that will be little comfort to the thousands of employees facing an uncertain future with Christmas round the corner and rising unemployment limiting their other job options. He is also very stubborn. That resistance to change, and insisting he knew best, was at the heart of Arcadia's demise. It's hard to see another act in what has been a career full of drama and controversy. As many have said, at heart he was not really a retailer - he was a shrewd financier - a money man. The future of retail requires a very different skill-set. Arcadia was once a darling of the High Street, but long before coronavirus, Sir Philip's brands were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""While the Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the company's decline, in reality, the writing had been on the wall for Arcadia for some time. ""Its competitors forged ahead with high-profile online propositions that it simply failed to match."" In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn. The pandemic did also lead to a huge drop-off in sales as stores had to shut for long stretches. While the business persuaded its landlords to lower its rents in June, it was not enough to steady the ship. Arcadia's 13,000 workers now face an anxious wait. One store manager told the BBC they felt ""angry, sad and disappointed"" on Monday. ""I've now got a large team that's all terrified of what's going to happen to them and their futures"", they said. ""I am just hoping that something can be done to preserve the brands and the employees' jobs."" This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Dave Gill, from retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""It is crucial that the voice of staff is heard over the future of the business. ""We are seeking urgent meetings [with the administrators] and need assurances on what efforts are being made to save jobs, the plan for stores to continue trading and the funding of the pension scheme."" Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund, which has 10,000 members. Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group's workers. Business Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted on Monday that the independent Pensions Regulator ""has a range of powers to protect pension schemes"", and that he would be keeping a ""very close eye"" on the administrators' report on director conduct. Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile,Mr Chappell was recently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. Arcadia is the latest major retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the pandemic. Competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March. The collapse of Arcadia could also affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans across the department store chain. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year.

"Plans for this year's TT Festival were scrapped in March Next year's TT races on the Isle of Man have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The festival, worth about Â£30m to the Manx economy, bringstens of thousands of visitorseach year. It had been due to take place from 29 May to 12 June. Enterprise Minister Laurence Skelly said the ""logical decision"" to cancel the event for a second year was needed to protect residents and visitors. Current support for affected businesses has been extended by a month. Three schemes designed to help the tourism and travel industry will now be in place until 30 April. Loans will be available to relieve the immediate pressure of offering refunds to those who had booked for the TT. Ferry passengers will have the option to transfer their bookings to 2022 or apply for a full refund, a spokesman for the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The 2020 TT Festivalwas cancelled in Marchas the first wave of Covid-19 ripped through much of Europe. The cancellation of next year's motorcycling festival represents another huge blow for the island's tourism industry. The border has been closed for months to the vast majority of non-residents as the Manx government battles to prevent the island from suffering the high rates of Covid-19 transmission seen throughout much of the UK. More than 26,000 people visited the island during the 2018 event Mr Skelly said the decision had been taken early to ""provide certainty and clarity"" to everyone involved. The races depend on thousands of volunteers, many of whom travel to the island. Moving the festival to later in the year had been ruled out due to the ""complexities and risks"" of holding an event of its size outside of the usual timeframe. An announcement over the running of the Classic TT races and Manx Grand Prix, which are scheduled to go ahead between 21 August and 3 September, will be made by the end of March. As a result of the TT Festival's cancellation, the Senior Race Day bank holiday originally due to take place on 11 June has been moved to 27 August. Mr Skelly said despite the progress towards a vaccine, the government could not commit to ""welcoming tens of thousands of people to the island in June"". The decision did ""not necessarily"" mean the island's border restrictions would remain in place until then, he added. Anne Rostron and Judith Curtis said cancelling the event was the right decision Douglas resident Anne Rostron, whose husband Brian is a former TT competitor, said she could see why the decision had been taken, because it would be ""letting everybody in"" to the island. Her friend Judith Curtis said there were arguments for and against cancelling the event, adding: ""It's going to hit the island again financially, but you've got to think about the safety of the people."" James McLaren and Peter Keig said the cancellation could prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 James McLaren said although it would be ""a disappointment"", it was ""better to be safe than sorry"". ""It's a huge influx of people at the end of the day and with a pandemic going on I don't want a resurgence over here of Covid,"" he said. ""I know the TT is a big part of the tourism economy of the island, but I can't see us risking the entire economy for one event being a great idea,"" he added. Michelle Rivera, who moved to the island in February, said the cancellation was ""sad"" as she had been ""looking forward"" to watching the event for the first time next year. Michelle Rivera (right) said she had been looking forward to watching the races Ken Beilby, who regularly marshals at the event, said it would be ""another blow"" to the community and the economy. ""There always a shortage of accommodation anyway for people coming over - it's going to be even worse if there is no accommodation available,"" he said, suggesting that some businesses would not be able to survive the loss of two consecutive TT Festivals. Ken Beiby said it was a blow to racing fans on the island Peter Boussougou said making an early decision over the event was ""definitely the right thing to do"" as it would prevent many from booking travel and accommodation only to have to claim the money back. Tom Baker said the cancellation could help local businesses as it could encourage Manx residents to spend their money on the island rather than travelling away to avoid the festival. Peter Boussougou (left) and Tom Baker had been looking forward to the atmosphere of the festival Twenty-three time TT winner John McGuinness said that although he was ""not surprised"" by the decision, he was ""super disappointed"" by it. He said: ""I'm sure we're going to miss it and I'm sure it'll be back. It gives everybody - the organisers and everybody else - time to try and make the event stronger and better."" McGuinness set a new absolute course record of 132.701mph in 2015 Fellow TT champion Ian Hutchinson said the event was a ""massive thing for all the teams"" involved. ""To hear it's not going ahead is going to break a lot of hearts,"" he added. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external?

"Rita Ora says she's ""deeply sorry"" for breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday. The singer says she attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday. ""Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,"" she wrote in a statement. It's reported up to 30 people were at the party, although she describes the event as a ""small gathering"". She says it was a ""spur of the moment"" decision. London's Metropolitan Police confirmed officers went to the Casa Cruz restaurant after a report about a potential breach of Covid lockdown regulations. ""I'm deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk,"" she posted. ""This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement."" Rita Ora wrote an apology and posted it on her Instastory Current lockdown regulations in England mean you can only meet one other person outside. Pubs and restaurants are currently closed (although they can serve non-alcoholic takeaways) and you shouldn't be with people from outside your house or support bubbles indoors. Police have the power to break up groups larger than six and those who ignore officers could be fined Â£100, doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200. So far, the singer has not been fined.

"Drinkers in tier two areas of England could order a Scotch egg with their pint to keep in line with post-lockdown rules, a cabinet minister has said. Under new restrictions from Wednesday, pubs in those high risk areas can only open if they function as a restaurant. And alcohol can only be served as part of a ""substantial meal"". Environment Secretary George Eustice told LBC Radio that Scotch eggs would constitute such a meal ""if there were table service"". Downing Street has not ruled out tier two drinkers being able to order a Scotch egg, but would not set out the difference between a snack and a meal. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""I'm obviously not going to get into the detail of every possible meal. ""But we've been clear: bar snacks do not count as a substantial meal but it's well established practice in the hospitality industry what does."" Pubs and restaurants are currently closed across England, apart from for takeaways. Postcode check - what is your tier from Wednesday? When does lockdown actually end? And other questions Shops allowed to open 24-hours a day over Christmas Mr Eustice said the ""substantial meal"" provision in tier two was ""understood very much by the restaurant trade"". He said: ""I think a Scotch egg probably would count as a substantial meal if there were table service. ""Often that might be as a starter but yes I think it would, but this is a term that's understood in licensing... you can have the concept of a table licence for alcohol that also requires you to serve a substantial meal. ""That is the model that is being followed."" When England's current lockdown ends, the rules will change according to where you live. Intier one, medium level, people can meet inside or outside in groups of up to six. Intier tworegions, pubs and restaurants must shut at 23:00 GMT, with last orders an hour earlier. You can only socialise inside with people you live with, or those in your support bubble if you live alone. Groups of up to six can meet outside, but social distancing must be adhered to. Intier three, very high risk areas, you cannot mix with anyone outside your household either indoors or in pub gardens or private gardens. Hospitality venues - such as bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants - must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services. Most of England is in tier two or three, with only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly in tier one. Mr Eustice added that there had been issues with pubs ""where you had large groups of people congregating and actually not maintaining social distancing, they were just drinking"". ""They were more likely to maintain social distancing sat down and having a meal,"" he said. On Sky News, Mr Eustice was asked whether people in tier two would have to leave the pub as soon as they had finished their meals. The environment secretary said people could finish their drinks, but should not have a ""small meal and then sit at the table all night ordering drinks"". It comes after Downing Street suggested drinkers visiting pubs in tier two regionswould have to leave once they had finished their meal. The government's latest guidance forhospitality in tier two,externalstates: ""Venues must close unless they operate as if they were a restaurant. ""This means serving substantial meals, like a main lunchtime or evening meal. They may only serve alcohol as part of such a meal."" Meanwhile, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Wales will bebanned from serving alcohol from Fridayand will be forced to close at 18:00 GMT, under new rules to tackle a surge in coronavirus cases. The concept of a ""substantial meal"" is not actually a new one in pubs, bars and restaurants. It's an extension of the law that covers 16 and 17 year olds drinking alcoholin pubs with table meals,external. In October, under England's previous three-tiered system, there was confusion over the definition of a ""substantial meal"". Under those restrictions, it was only pubs and bars in tier three areas that faced extra curbs - and were forced to close unless they were serving substantial meals. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick responded by saying that a ""plated meal"" of a Cornish pasty with chips or a side saladwould count as a ""normal meal"".

"Plans for this year's TT Festival were scrapped in March Next year's TT races on the Isle of Man have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The festival, worth about Â£30m to the Manx economy, bringstens of thousands of visitorseach year. It had been due to take place from 29 May to 12 June. Enterprise Minister Laurence Skelly said the ""logical decision"" to cancel the event for a second year was needed to protect residents and visitors. Current support for affected businesses has been extended by a month. Three schemes designed to help the tourism and travel industry will now be in place until 30 April. Loans will be available to relieve the immediate pressure of offering refunds to those who had booked for the TT. Ferry passengers will have the option to transfer their bookings to 2022 or apply for a full refund, a spokesman for the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said. The 2020 TT Festivalwas cancelled in Marchas the first wave of Covid-19 ripped through much of Europe. The cancellation of next year's motorcycling festival represents another huge blow for the island's tourism industry. The border has been closed for months to the vast majority of non-residents as the Manx government battles to prevent the island from suffering the high rates of Covid-19 transmission seen throughout much of the UK. More than 26,000 people visited the island during the 2018 event Mr Skelly said the decision had been taken early to ""provide certainty and clarity"" to everyone involved. The races depend on thousands of volunteers, many of whom travel to the island. Moving the festival to later in the year had been ruled out due to the ""complexities and risks"" of holding an event of its size outside of the usual timeframe. An announcement over the running of the Classic TT races and Manx Grand Prix, which are scheduled to go ahead between 21 August and 3 September, will be made by the end of March. As a result of the TT Festival's cancellation, the Senior Race Day bank holiday originally due to take place on 11 June has been moved to 27 August. Mr Skelly said despite the progress towards a vaccine, the government could not commit to ""welcoming tens of thousands of people to the island in June"". The decision did ""not necessarily"" mean the island's border restrictions would remain in place until then, he added. Anne Rostron and Judith Curtis said cancelling the event was the right decision Douglas resident Anne Rostron, whose husband Brian is a former TT competitor, said she could see why the decision had been taken, because it would be ""letting everybody in"" to the island. Her friend Judith Curtis said there were arguments for and against cancelling the event, adding: ""It's going to hit the island again financially, but you've got to think about the safety of the people."" James McLaren and Peter Keig said the cancellation could prevent a resurgence of Covid-19 James McLaren said although it would be ""a disappointment"", it was ""better to be safe than sorry"". ""It's a huge influx of people at the end of the day and with a pandemic going on I don't want a resurgence over here of Covid,"" he said. ""I know the TT is a big part of the tourism economy of the island, but I can't see us risking the entire economy for one event being a great idea,"" he added. Michelle Rivera, who moved to the island in February, said the cancellation was ""sad"" as she had been ""looking forward"" to watching the event for the first time next year. Michelle Rivera (right) said she had been looking forward to watching the races Ken Beilby, who regularly marshals at the event, said it would be ""another blow"" to the community and the economy. ""There always a shortage of accommodation anyway for people coming over - it's going to be even worse if there is no accommodation available,"" he said, suggesting that some businesses would not be able to survive the loss of two consecutive TT Festivals. Ken Beiby said it was a blow to racing fans on the island Peter Boussougou said making an early decision over the event was ""definitely the right thing to do"" as it would prevent many from booking travel and accommodation only to have to claim the money back. Tom Baker said the cancellation could help local businesses as it could encourage Manx residents to spend their money on the island rather than travelling away to avoid the festival. Peter Boussougou (left) and Tom Baker had been looking forward to the atmosphere of the festival Twenty-three time TT winner John McGuinness said that although he was ""not surprised"" by the decision, he was ""super disappointed"" by it. He said: ""I'm sure we're going to miss it and I'm sure it'll be back. It gives everybody - the organisers and everybody else - time to try and make the event stronger and better."" McGuinness set a new absolute course record of 132.701mph in 2015 Fellow TT champion Ian Hutchinson said the event was a ""massive thing for all the teams"" involved. ""To hear it's not going ahead is going to break a lot of hearts,"" he added. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external?

Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing.

"England and Wales' contact-tracing app is to add a Self-Isolation Payment feature as soon as next week. The version 4 update will address a discrepancy that currently exists. Those told to stay at home by human contact-tracers can qualify for Â£500 of support. But privacy safeguards built into the NHS Covid-19 app had complicated making the same offer to those who had received an automated self-isolate notification. It is hoped the move will encourage more people to install the app and follow its guidance over the Christmas period, when there are concerns that cases of the coronavirus could spike again. The charity Citizens Advice has warned that many people ordered to stop work by the app have faced an ""impossible choice"", as they can experience a big drop in income if they act to help stop the spread of the virus. England's NHS Test and Trace scheme,externalandWales's NHS Test, Trace, Protect counterpart,externalboth allow affected people on low incomes, who cannot work from home, to apply for financial help. Checks can be made against a register to prevent fraud. But because the app keeps the identity of users who have received self-isolation alerts secret, the process had to be adapted. Last week Labour had called on the government to address this issue. At present, users of the app cannot claim a support grant if told to self-isolate Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Many people will be astonished to find that people using the Covid-19 app can't access support to self-isolate - even if they're eligible for the payment."" The team behind the app is aware that many of those instructed to self-isolate for up to 14 days are not doing so. It is thought the absence of a financial incentive is an important factor. Before the version 4 release, there will be another update this week to show users what restrictions are being enforced in their local authority, rather than their post code. This has been timed to coincide with England's switch from national rules to a tier-based approach on 2 December, which will be based on council boundaries. Longer-term, there is speculation that vaccination records could be a further feature to be added. This has been sparked by remarks made by the head of Test and Trace, Baroness Dido Harding. Speaking to a private meeting organised by the Health Service Journal andfirst reported by the Times newspaper,external, she said work was going on to help people log both tests and their vaccinations. The first Covid-19 vaccines should be administered in the UK next month The idea would be ""to have a single record as a citizen of your test results and whether you've been vaccinated."" It is not clear whether such a record would be stored in the NHS Covid-19 app or elsewhere. For months, all kinds of companies have been touting so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a pub by showing proof that they were not infectious. The trouble with all of these schemes was that without official approval from a government body, nobody would trust them. Call to expand Â£500 grant for Covid self-isolators Covid-19 app users can't get isolation payment Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled I spoke to one person who played a leading role in the early development of the NHS Covid-19 app. He remembered that building this kind of immunity ID card into it had been considered. But he said it was deemed an unnecessary complication at that early stage, and the idea was handed to a separate group to consider. The idea is not without controversy. Privacy experts warned early on in the app's development that using it to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory. Now, though, the government seems keen to press ahead. Mr Zahawi has been made responsible for the deployment of the coronavirus vaccine in England England's new vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology"". Speaking on Radio 4's The World at One, he added: ""I think you'll probably find restaurants and bars and cinemas and sports venues will probably also use that system, as they've done with the app."" He pointed out that the QR barcode feature of the app - which registers visits to pubs, cafes and other businesses - had helped drive uptake. But with vaccinations due to start as early as next week, it appears unlikely that any immunity passport will be ready by then. Complex decisions will be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus. ""At present we do not have an authorised vaccine and we do not know if a vaccine will impact transmission of the disease,"" said a spokesman from the Department of Health and Social Care, when asked about the matter. ""Should a vaccine pass our rigorous safety standards the NHS stands ready to immediately deploy it to those most at risk and this will allow us to see what impact a vaccine has on the epidemic as a whole. ""Then we will have the information needed to decide the next steps to a path back to normality.""

"Moderna is filing for US and European emergency regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use. Regulators will look at trial data for the mRNA vaccine and decide if it is safe and effective enough to recommend for roll out. Clinical studies show the jab is more than 94% effective at protecting people from becoming ill with Covid-19. Pfizer, which has a similar jab, has already filed for the same US approval. UK regulators are also reviewing data on the Pfizer vaccine, as well as another type of Covid vaccine fromAstraZenca and Oxford Universityfor emergency approval. Moderna says it hopes to gain UK approval soon, now that it has trial data from 30,000 volunteers - including high risk groups like the elderly - that suggests it works. In those studies, 15,000 people received the real vaccine while the other participants got placebo injections. No serious side effects were reported. During the studies, 185 people in the placebo group fell ill with Covid-19, and some severely so. In comparison, there were 11 cases in the vaccine group and none were severe. Full trial data has not been released, but will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? The three front-runner vaccines have different pros and cons. The AstraZeneca jab is cheaper - around Â£3 ($4) for a dose, compared to around Â£15 ($20) for the Pfizer vaccine and Â£25 ($33) for Moderna's. And it is potentially easier to distribute because it does not need to be stored under ultra-low temperatures. But its efficacy in trials - between 62% and 90% - is a bit lower than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Russian Covid vaccine shows encouraging results The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines: 7m of the Moderna jab 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech one 100m of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: ""This is great news indeed - the more trial data that we have, the greater confidence we have that vaccines can be used to blunt the human cost of Covid-19. ""As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public."" Meanwhile, the UK's new minister responsible for vaccine rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, said vaccination would not be compulsory, but that society might expect people to get immunised. He told BBC's World At One: ""I think the very strong message that you will see, this is the way we return the whole country, and so it's good for your family, it's good for your community, it's good for your country to be vaccinated. ""And, ultimately people will have to make a decision.""

"This video can not be played An Irish bar has been ""turned into a coffee shop"" by the new rules, its owner says Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"". Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00. The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November. Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter. How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What are you allowed to do? The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector. ""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another."" The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added. The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality withinlevel three areas in Scotland. However the rule allowingfour people from four different householdsto meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed. The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week. Dai Dearden said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"" The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants. ""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea. Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants. ""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said. Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"". ""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"". This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford defends the new rules Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that."" ""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes."" Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties. She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade."" ""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are."" Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year."" Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business. A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules. ""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous. ""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said. Folly Farm zoo said it would be closing its doors as a result of the announcement The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell. ""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said. ""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time."" BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission. Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November. Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"". According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales. Hospitality businesses are being offered extra support, the Welsh Government said Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover."" Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown. ""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said. Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"". Pubs have been allowed to open in Wales since the end of the firebreak lockdown The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000. The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support. A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses. The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000. The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before. But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders. Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to. Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual. Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade.

"England and Wales' contact-tracing app is to add a Self-Isolation Payment feature as soon as next week. The version 4 update will address a discrepancy that currently exists. Those told to stay at home by human contact-tracers can qualify for Â£500 of support. But privacy safeguards built into the NHS Covid-19 app had complicated making the same offer to those who had received an automated self-isolate notification. It is hoped the move will encourage more people to install the app and follow its guidance over the Christmas period, when there are concerns that cases of the coronavirus could spike again. The charity Citizens Advice has warned that many people ordered to stop work by the app have faced an ""impossible choice"", as they can experience a big drop in income if they act to help stop the spread of the virus. England's NHS Test and Trace scheme,externalandWales's NHS Test, Trace, Protect counterpart,externalboth allow affected people on low incomes, who cannot work from home, to apply for financial help. Checks can be made against a register to prevent fraud. But because the app keeps the identity of users who have received self-isolation alerts secret, the process had to be adapted. Last week Labour had called on the government to address this issue. At present, users of the app cannot claim a support grant if told to self-isolate Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""Many people will be astonished to find that people using the Covid-19 app can't access support to self-isolate - even if they're eligible for the payment."" The team behind the app is aware that many of those instructed to self-isolate for up to 14 days are not doing so. It is thought the absence of a financial incentive is an important factor. Before the version 4 release, there will be another update this week to show users what restrictions are being enforced in their local authority, rather than their post code. This has been timed to coincide with England's switch from national rules to a tier-based approach on 2 December, which will be based on council boundaries. Longer-term, there is speculation that vaccination records could be a further feature to be added. This has been sparked by remarks made by the head of Test and Trace, Baroness Dido Harding. Speaking to a private meeting organised by the Health Service Journal andfirst reported by the Times newspaper,external, she said work was going on to help people log both tests and their vaccinations. The first Covid-19 vaccines should be administered in the UK next month The idea would be ""to have a single record as a citizen of your test results and whether you've been vaccinated."" It is not clear whether such a record would be stored in the NHS Covid-19 app or elsewhere. For months, all kinds of companies have been touting so-called immunity passports, which would allow people to get on a plane or visit a pub by showing proof that they were not infectious. The trouble with all of these schemes was that without official approval from a government body, nobody would trust them. Call to expand Â£500 grant for Covid self-isolators Covid-19 app users can't get isolation payment Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled I spoke to one person who played a leading role in the early development of the NHS Covid-19 app. He remembered that building this kind of immunity ID card into it had been considered. But he said it was deemed an unnecessary complication at that early stage, and the idea was handed to a separate group to consider. The idea is not without controversy. Privacy experts warned early on in the app's development that using it to display a user's vaccination status might lead to employers or public places making its use compulsory. Now, though, the government seems keen to press ahead. Mr Zahawi has been made responsible for the deployment of the coronavirus vaccine in England England's new vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC: ""We are looking at the technology"". Speaking on Radio 4's The World at One, he added: ""I think you'll probably find restaurants and bars and cinemas and sports venues will probably also use that system, as they've done with the app."" He pointed out that the QR barcode feature of the app - which registers visits to pubs, cafes and other businesses - had helped drive uptake. But with vaccinations due to start as early as next week, it appears unlikely that any immunity passport will be ready by then. Complex decisions will be involved, such as whether the app simply records immunisation or the results of later immunity tests proving that the user is no longer capable of spreading the virus. ""At present we do not have an authorised vaccine and we do not know if a vaccine will impact transmission of the disease,"" said a spokesman from the Department of Health and Social Care, when asked about the matter. ""Should a vaccine pass our rigorous safety standards the NHS stands ready to immediately deploy it to those most at risk and this will allow us to see what impact a vaccine has on the epidemic as a whole. ""Then we will have the information needed to decide the next steps to a path back to normality.""

And thank you for tuning into our BBC 100 Women digital event, we hope you enjoyed it and learned something new. Wow, what a way to finish. Weâve heard from incredible women today who are pushing the boundaries of human progress, from the Black
Lives Matter Founders to climate change activist Jane Fonda. Whether itâs saving money, becoming an ally, making our
voices heard or boosting body positivity, the women in these masterclasses have offered
something for everyone, and given plenty of food for thought too. Weâd like to say a particular thank you to all of our experts,
our presenters and of course theBBC 100 Women 2020. The BBC 100 Women Masterclasses are coming to an end, but before we go, we want to share two playlists with you. The ""Queen of African music"" AngÃ©lique Kidjo has put togethersome of her favourite tunes,externalespecially curated for BBC 100 Women. And trailblazing rapper Ana Tijoux has also made a bespoke playlist for us too - you canlisten to it here,external. Madame Gandhi has createda playlist of ""must-listen"" tunes,externalfor our special BBC 100 Women Masterclass, all about finding and
creating music that can empower rather than disempower women. ""I do think we canât tell other people how to make their
music, but we can provide and design an alternative. I do want to turn up and
party but I donât want to turn up to the sound of my own oppression,"" she tells
BBC Radio 1Xtraâs Jamz Supernova. ""You want the level of energy and good vibes but not the
misogyny that comes with it. I see the role of a DJ and artist to provide an
alternative."" We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) is the theme music of hit Chilean drama La JaurÃ­a. As well as writing the music, Ana Tijoux also stars in the Amazon Prime series. After a teacher is caught abusing his female pupils, a young protestor goes missing. Three female police officers from a gender crimes unit launch an investigation, uncovering an online game that recruits men to commit acts of aggression toward women. We Are Not Alone is a song about the importance of standing together. How many disappeared? How many were swallowed by the earth? Life kills us, the press bleeds out. We scream justice when we are silenced. Ana Tijoux, We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) ""Growing up there were misogynistic songs everywhere,"" Grammy award-winning singer AngÃ©lique Kidjo tells our music masterclass. ""The thing that was important to me was the empowerment of
other women, I followed their example and just went for it."" She told her fiancÃ© to leave after he wouldnât let her sing. ""My father always said to me, âtalent has no gender, so go
out there and show them.' All the songs that play down women just show
a manâs fragility and insecurity, his fear of women."" Kiran Gandhi, who performs as Madame Gandhi, is a musician and activist on a mission is to elevate and celebrate gender liberation. She has been on tour with acts such as MIA and Thievery Corporation. ""We as musicians have the power to score the emotions of our time. To that end, I have been taking that role rather seriously and making more music infused with love, sex positivity, hopefulness and big dreams,"" she says. This video can not be played How do you write a song that becomes a rallying-cry for women around the world? She told the BBC about her song Waiting For Me's lyric, ""We always assume our own powerlessness but never our own power."" Her inspiration was the words of Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, who earlier featured in the BBC 100 Women Masterclasses. Patrisse said ""we all have the potential to step into our power and often we chose not toâ. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Four-time Grammy Award winner AngÃ©lique Kidjo has been described as ""the undisputed queen of African music"" - and for a reason! Benin-born AngÃ©lique has cross-pollinated the West African traditions of her childhood with elements of American R&B, funk and jazz. In her 2020 Grammy acceptance speech, AngÃ©lique spoke about her album Celia, an homage to queen of salsa Celia Cruz. ""She is one of those artists that taught you at a young age that gender cannot define who you are,"" she said. AngÃ©lique passionately advocates for girls to have access to education and helped found The Batonga Foundation, which empowers Benin's young women to challenge expectations. When she's not hosting the 100 Women Masterclasses, Jamz Supernova has a weekly show onBBC Radio 1Xtra, where she has the privilege and platform to discover and showcase new talent. She describes her radio show as ""a musical journey, where you'll discover the very best in emerging alternative R&B, new-wave Jazz and left-field electronica"". She also runs record label, Future Bounce and has a club residency in London and Bristol. And she created DIY Generation which focuses on young people building and owning their own careers, highlighting women and people of colour.

She's got tips on how you can find ways to listen, learn and support others. Weâve heard the word ""ally"" a lot this year, but what does it really mean? And how can you be one? For award-winning disability specialist Shani Dhanda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, it's about people acting on each otherâs behalf to address systemic problems. She says being an ally is very different from being a friend. ""An ally is not a friend, just like being non-racist is very different from being actively anti-racist. ""Being an ally doesnât necessarily mean you fully understand what it feels like to be oppressed. It just means you take on the struggle as your own.""

Dr Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu, a psychriatrist working in Uganda, has been helping her community deal with the effects of the pandemic on mental health. Etheldreda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, has struggled with depression in the past, and shares her coping strategies: Inform yourself.Ethel read extensively about stress and depression, so was able to notice when she was sliding into it herself. Open up.Those you trust will offer emotional support that will lessen the burden you have to carry. A problem shared is already half solved. Stay proactive and connect. Make time for friends and don't neglect your relationships when life gets busy. Develop positive coping skills.Recall something in your life you're grateful for and practice acceptance for things out of your power.

make-up artist and the photographer that goes beyond body image, beyond race, about what can be done to make things more inclusive so everyone can love
themselves."" The key, she says, is to ""push past what happens online and
find your own mentors and communities and stand up for yourself, because not
everyone is going to love how you look or the things that you say."" Social scientist Deepa Narayan wanted to investigate the root of abuse.

"A number of people visited the beach at Helen's Bay on Sunday morning There has been confusion after police asked beach-goers at Helen's Bay to leave the area on Sunday, citing Covid-19 regulations. Swimmers were using the popular County Down spot when officers arrived and asked them to disperse. One man had been finishing a ""mile a day"" swimming challenge raising money for charity. No fines were issued by police officers but they said they would ""not shy away from enforcement when it is necessary"". Police said that they believed a large number of people had gathered to watch the charity swimming event. However, a local businessman who was swimming at the beach said he was ""absolutely baffled"" by the police's approach. Gareth Murphy told BBC News NI: ""I felt a huge level of frustration that we could have been in Ikea or Tesco but we were on the beach taking part in the sport which we love and we had to deal with that afterwards. ""More or less everyone left the beach. I just find it incredibly sad that the public resources of the police are being used to close down beaches for no reason."" Mr Murphy said after he came out of the sea and was getting changed he was approached by six police officers. He said he had seen them from the water walking ""systematically, approaching groups and threatening them with Â£200 fines"". ""I pointed out we could be at Ikea or Tesco. They said: 'This is an organised event'. We pointed out this is not, this is people taking part in something healthy."" Cathy Martin, who lives in Helen's Bay, said she took a walk down to the beach with her children and dog. She told the Stephen Nolan Show it was busy, but that a lot of people there were residents. She said she was then told by police officers that she would have to leave the beach as well. ""They basically came with the attitude that everyone was there for an organised event,"" she said. ""They're under a lot of pressure, they're under-resourced and they have a lot to cover, and I do respect that they have to respond to every complaint and I do respect that there probably was a complaint from residents about a lot of cars there or a lot of people there. ""But Helen's Bay is a big enough beach to hold 200 people, it doesn't justify them coming to break it up."" In a statement the PSNI said: ""Our approach has been that we will engage, explain and encourage members of the community to comply with the Health Protection Regulations. ""The vast majority of our community are complying with the restrictions, which we all recognise, are asking people to restrict their personal and professional lives in a way none of us would ever have thought possible. ""While enforcement is our last resort, we have not, and will not, shy away from enforcement when it is necessary.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the âplan through to Easterâ would see areas âcome down in the tiers they are inâ. No 10 has published data behind its decisions over England's new tier system as it tries to win MPs' support. Downing Street's report said it sought to ""balance the many complex impacts"" of restrictions and keep them in place ""for as short a time as possible"". It said allowing the virus to spread exponentially ""would lead to impacts... considered intolerable for society"". But senior Tory MP Mark Harper said the ""wheels are coming off the government's arguments"". MPs will vote on the plans on Tuesday. The government announced itstougher three tiersto tackle the virus last week, with Boris Johnson telling reporters on Monday: ""We can't afford to take our foot off the throat of the beast... to let it out of control again."" But a number of Tory backbenchers have threatened to vote against the motion when it comes to the Commons, including the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of MPs - chaired by Mr Harper. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would abstain on the vote, saying he had ""serious misgivings"" about the measures. But he said it was ""in the national interest"" to let the restrictions pass through the Commons without Labour's opposition to ensure some measures were in place. A No 10 spokesman accused Sir Keir of ""playing politics in the middle of a global pandemic, instead of working with the government to find a way through this difficult time for the British people"". PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? What are the new rules for going to the pub? England's current lockdown will end in the early hours of Wednesday 2 December and will see the country placed into one of three tiers: medium (one), high (two) and very high (three). However, the majority of the country, over 55 million, will be under the strictest two sets of measures. The announcement led to criticism from some Tory MPs, who were concerned about the impact in their constituencies. Mr Johnson wrote to his party twice over the weekend to appeal for their backing and to grant some of the CRG's demands. They included the publication of the data on the health, social and economic impact of the tiers, and the promise MPs could vote again on the measures in January - with the possibility the tier system could end on 3 February. But the government report -published on Monday,external- said it was ""not possible to forecast the precise economic impact of a specific change to a specific restriction with confidence"". The document is largely made up of information already available. It said the challenge of balancing health and societal impacts was not straightforward, but the government would continue to pursue the best overall outcomes. The chair of the Treasury select committee, Tory MP Mel Stride, condemned the report as ""a rehashed document [that] offers very little further in economic terms"". He told the BBC he would support the government to ensure there were some restrictions in place, but added: ""It's frustrating that there is little here that sets out how the different tiers might impact on the specific sectors and regions across the country. ""Those looking for additional economic analysis of the new tiered system will struggle to find it in this document."" The CRG chair, Mr Harper, said the report ""seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny"". He repeated accusations that the government's modelling on deaths and hospital capacity had been wrong, adding: ""We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections and they have not been forthcoming."" While Labour will abstain, the Liberal Democrats have said they will not back the plan - although it is not clear whether they will vote against or abstain. The SNP will abstain in the vote, as it only covers restrictions in England. With many of the opposition MPs abstaining, it would take a huge Tory rebellion for the measures to fall, which is unlikely. At first glance there doesn't appear to be much, if any, new information in this document. The government's analysis draws on studies and data already in the public domain to try to assess the impact of the tiered system of restrictions. So will it convince Conservative MPs sceptical about the need for tighter restrictions that they are, in fact, necessary? Yes and no. Some Tory backbenchers may be satisfied the government has at least attempted to provide further evidence that tougher measures are needed. They've made their point. Others will flick through the 48 pages and discard it, knowing all along that without some elusive magic formula the government could provide, they would never have been convinced. The government is likely to win Tuesday's vote, but as the pandemic wears on, it is having to go to greater and greater lengths to keep its own MPs on side. Speaking shortly before the data was published, Mr Johnson said he ""understood people's frustration"" with the stricter tiers. He said: ""The tiering system is tough, but it is designed to be tough to keep [the virus] under control."" ""What we can't do is forsake and abandon all the gains we have made now just when we are starting to see real progress in the science."" In the report, the government pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics, showing a rapid increase in people testing positive for the virus between September and November - from 59,800 a week to 633,000 a week. It said the new ""strengthened"" tier system was ""designed to keep R [the infection rate] below one so that prevalence continues to fall, the significant impacts of the virus are reduced, and so that, ultimately, fewer restrictions are required."" It added that a ""stable and fully functioning health system is one of the pillars that underpins our society and our economy"", with the government's view being ""the severe loss of life and other health impacts of allowing the NHS to be overwhelmed would be intolerable for our society"". The document also pointed to the economic forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility - which were published alongside Chancellor Rishi Sunak's spending review last week - predicting the value of the economy will fall by 11.3% by the end of the financial year. But, while the report conceded there would be ""major impacts"" on the economy from the restrictions, it added: ""Any attempt to estimate the specific economic impacts of precise changes to individual restrictions for a defined period of time would be subject to such wide uncertainty as to not be meaningful for precise policy making"". This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Labour leader Sir Keir defended his party's decision to abstain on the vote for measures, saying it was ""better that these regulations can be amended and put in place than if there are no regulations"". He said the ""serious misgivings"" he had included over the performance of the test and trace system and ""real concerns"" over the level of economic support for those in the highest tiers. But, Sir Keir added: ""Although the number of cases is coming down as a result of lockdown, the virus is still a significant risk and in principal we accept there is going to have to be continued restrictions."" However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns - such as working with local authorities and supporting pubs.

"PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks when he was killed The driver of a car which dragged PC Andrew Harper to his death should be given a life sentence, the attorney general has told the Court of Appeal. Suella Braverman QC said PC Harper paid the ""ultimate price for his bravery"" when he was killed on duty in Berkshire in August 2019. The driver, Henry Long, was jailed for 16 years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were both sentenced to 13 years each. Mrs Braverman has argued the teenagers' sentences were ""unduly lenient"". Long, Bowers and Cole were all cleared of murder following a trial at the Old Bailey, but were convicted of manslaughter. Addressing judges at the Court of Appeal, Mrs Braverman said the bravery of PC Harper should be ""reflected"" in the sentence of 19-year-old Long. Referring to his sentence, Mrs Braverman said: ""A life sentence was the appropriate sentence for the first offender, who was and remains dangerous... if not in a case such as this, then when?"" She told Dame Victoria Sharp, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mr Justice William Davis that Long's jail term did not reflect ""the seriousness of the offence"" and was ""contrary to the interests of justice"". Mrs Braverman also argued that the sentencing judge ""accorded too great a reduction"" to Bowers' and Cole's sentences ""for their age and learning difficulties"". Jessie Cole (l) and Albert Bowers (r) were convicted along with Henry Long (centre) in July In written submissions, Mrs Braverman said the sentences had ""caused and continue to cause widespread public concern"". ""It appears to me that the sentences passed on the offenders were unduly lenient."" She told the court the judge ""correctly observed this was a very serious case of manslaughter"" and was ""a case of manslaughter very close to murder in its seriousness"". PC Harper, 28, died from catastrophic injuries after he was dragged behind a getaway car for more than a mile. He got caught in a strap attached to the back of a car driven by Long as he tried to apprehend the teenagers suspected of stealing a quad bike. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died The unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme allows people to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are too low. It requires only one complaint for the attorney general's office to consider whether to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal. In response to Mrs Braverman's argument, Rossano Scamardella QC, representing Long, said the attorney general's comments about ""widespread public concern"" should have ""no influence on the issue of whether this sentence ought to be adjusted one way or the other"". He said PC Harper's death was the result of ""a freakish accident"" and said ""there was no intentional application of force or violence... there was no intent whatsoever to cause serious bodily harm or death"". Mr Scamardella said there was public concern expressed following the acquittals for murder and that the ""narrative became that no jury would possibly"" have cleared them unless there was some sort of ""tampering"". Timothy Raggatt QC, representing Bowers, said the idea the sentences were unduly lenient was ""to be blunt, far-fetched in the extreme"". Lawyers representing Long, Bowers and Cole are also applying for permission to appeal against the length of their sentences, arguing that they were ""manifestly excessive"". Mr Scamardella told the court Long's sentence was excessive due to the trial judge, Mr Justice Edis, adopting ""too high a starting point"" and failing to give Long ""full credit"" for his guilty plea. He also said his client had been ""wrongly"" deemed dangerous. Long, Bowers and Cole appeared at the hearing by video link from HMP Belmarsh. PC Harper, 28, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, had been married for only four weeks to his wife Lissie when he died. Lissie Harper spoke to the media outside the Royal Courts of Justice Following the hearing, PC Harper's widow Lissie, told reporters outside the Royal Courts of Justice the proceedings had been ""as harrowing as you can all expect"", but added she left the court ""with at least a sense of balance"". ""I feel pride in myself for not settling for something that I see as unacceptable,"" she said. Mrs Harper, 29, is campaigning for new legislation to be created known as Harper's Law, which proposes life sentences with mandatory minimum terms for an offenders ""guilty of killing an emergency services worker due to a criminal act... no ifs, no buts"". She said she had ""every respect"" for the attorney general for ""reaching the right decision in referring this case for review"". ""I know that the majority of our country stands with her and with me wanting change,"" she added. The judges said their decisions on the applications would be delivered at a later date.

And thank you for tuning into our BBC 100 Women digital event, we hope you enjoyed it and learned something new. Wow, what a way to finish. Weâve heard from incredible women today who are pushing the boundaries of human progress, from the Black
Lives Matter Founders to climate change activist Jane Fonda. Whether itâs saving money, becoming an ally, making our
voices heard or boosting body positivity, the women in these masterclasses have offered
something for everyone, and given plenty of food for thought too. Weâd like to say a particular thank you to all of our experts,
our presenters and of course theBBC 100 Women 2020. The BBC 100 Women Masterclasses are coming to an end, but before we go, we want to share two playlists with you. The ""Queen of African music"" AngÃ©lique Kidjo has put togethersome of her favourite tunes,externalespecially curated for BBC 100 Women. And trailblazing rapper Ana Tijoux has also made a bespoke playlist for us too - you canlisten to it here,external. Madame Gandhi has createda playlist of ""must-listen"" tunes,externalfor our special BBC 100 Women Masterclass, all about finding and
creating music that can empower rather than disempower women. ""I do think we canât tell other people how to make their
music, but we can provide and design an alternative. I do want to turn up and
party but I donât want to turn up to the sound of my own oppression,"" she tells
BBC Radio 1Xtraâs Jamz Supernova. ""You want the level of energy and good vibes but not the
misogyny that comes with it. I see the role of a DJ and artist to provide an
alternative."" We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) is the theme music of hit Chilean drama La JaurÃ­a. As well as writing the music, Ana Tijoux also stars in the Amazon Prime series. After a teacher is caught abusing his female pupils, a young protestor goes missing. Three female police officers from a gender crimes unit launch an investigation, uncovering an online game that recruits men to commit acts of aggression toward women. We Are Not Alone is a song about the importance of standing together. How many disappeared? How many were swallowed by the earth? Life kills us, the press bleeds out. We scream justice when we are silenced. Ana Tijoux, We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) ""Growing up there were misogynistic songs everywhere,"" Grammy award-winning singer AngÃ©lique Kidjo tells our music masterclass. ""The thing that was important to me was the empowerment of
other women, I followed their example and just went for it."" She told her fiancÃ© to leave after he wouldnât let her sing. ""My father always said to me, âtalent has no gender, so go
out there and show them.' All the songs that play down women just show
a manâs fragility and insecurity, his fear of women."" Kiran Gandhi, who performs as Madame Gandhi, is a musician and activist on a mission is to elevate and celebrate gender liberation. She has been on tour with acts such as MIA and Thievery Corporation. ""We as musicians have the power to score the emotions of our time. To that end, I have been taking that role rather seriously and making more music infused with love, sex positivity, hopefulness and big dreams,"" she says. This video can not be played How do you write a song that becomes a rallying-cry for women around the world? She told the BBC about her song Waiting For Me's lyric, ""We always assume our own powerlessness but never our own power."" Her inspiration was the words of Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, who earlier featured in the BBC 100 Women Masterclasses. Patrisse said ""we all have the potential to step into our power and often we chose not toâ. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Four-time Grammy Award winner AngÃ©lique Kidjo has been described as ""the undisputed queen of African music"" - and for a reason! Benin-born AngÃ©lique has cross-pollinated the West African traditions of her childhood with elements of American R&B, funk and jazz. In her 2020 Grammy acceptance speech, AngÃ©lique spoke about her album Celia, an homage to queen of salsa Celia Cruz. ""She is one of those artists that taught you at a young age that gender cannot define who you are,"" she said. AngÃ©lique passionately advocates for girls to have access to education and helped found The Batonga Foundation, which empowers Benin's young women to challenge expectations. When she's not hosting the 100 Women Masterclasses, Jamz Supernova has a weekly show onBBC Radio 1Xtra, where she has the privilege and platform to discover and showcase new talent. She describes her radio show as ""a musical journey, where you'll discover the very best in emerging alternative R&B, new-wave Jazz and left-field electronica"". She also runs record label, Future Bounce and has a club residency in London and Bristol. And she created DIY Generation which focuses on young people building and owning their own careers, highlighting women and people of colour. What can we do about those misogynistic lyrics in tunes that you like - and maybe even sing along to? In our music masterclass, we'll ask three award-winning female artists for tips on how to curate a better playlist. BBC Radio 1XtraâsJamz Supernovais joined by special guestsAngÃ©lique Kidjo, Ana TijouxandMadame Gandhifor our final masterclass of the day.

She's got tips on how you can find ways to listen, learn and support others. Weâve heard the word ""ally"" a lot this year, but what does it really mean? And how can you be one? For award-winning disability specialist Shani Dhanda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, it's about people acting on each otherâs behalf to address systemic problems. She says being an ally is very different from being a friend. ""An ally is not a friend, just like being non-racist is very different from being actively anti-racist. ""Being an ally doesnât necessarily mean you fully understand what it feels like to be oppressed. It just means you take on the struggle as your own.""

As a survivor of an attack in her twenties, the popular musician wants to encourage other women to feel confident to speak up. Dr Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu, a psychriatrist working in Uganda, has been helping her community deal with the effects of the pandemic on mental health. Etheldreda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, has struggled with depression in the past, and shares her coping strategies: Inform yourself.Ethel read extensively about stress and depression, so was able to notice when she was sliding into it herself. Open up.Those you trust will offer emotional support that will lessen the burden you have to carry. A problem shared is already half solved. Stay proactive and connect. Make time for friends and don't neglect your relationships when life gets busy. Develop positive coping skills.Recall something in your life you're grateful for and practice acceptance for things out of your power. Enam Asiama is a model and online influencer who is pushing past the abuse she has received on the internet. ""I am representing queer fat women all over the world
and that is the greatest reward for me,"" she says. ""[As a model] Iâm getting to have conversations with the
make-up artist and the photographer that goes beyond body image, beyond race, about what can be done to make things more inclusive so everyone can love
themselves."" The key, she says, is to ""push past what happens online and
find your own mentors and communities and stand up for yourself, because not
everyone is going to love how you look or the things that you say."" Social scientist Deepa Narayan wanted to investigate the root of abuse.

"A number of people visited the beach at Helen's Bay on Sunday morning There has been confusion after police asked beach-goers at Helen's Bay to leave the area on Sunday, citing Covid-19 regulations. Swimmers were using the popular County Down spot when officers arrived and asked them to disperse. One man had been finishing a ""mile a day"" swimming challenge raising money for charity. No fines were issued by police officers but they said they would ""not shy away from enforcement when it is necessary"". Police said that they believed a large number of people had gathered to watch the charity swimming event. However, a local businessman who was swimming at the beach said he was ""absolutely baffled"" by the police's approach. Gareth Murphy told BBC News NI: ""I felt a huge level of frustration that we could have been in Ikea or Tesco but we were on the beach taking part in the sport which we love and we had to deal with that afterwards. ""More or less everyone left the beach. I just find it incredibly sad that the public resources of the police are being used to close down beaches for no reason."" Mr Murphy said after he came out of the sea and was getting changed he was approached by six police officers. He said he had seen them from the water walking ""systematically, approaching groups and threatening them with Â£200 fines"". ""I pointed out we could be at Ikea or Tesco. They said: 'This is an organised event'. We pointed out this is not, this is people taking part in something healthy."" Cathy Martin, who lives in Helen's Bay, said she took a walk down to the beach with her children and dog. She told the Stephen Nolan Show it was busy, but that a lot of people there were residents. She said she was then told by police officers that she would have to leave the beach as well. ""They basically came with the attitude that everyone was there for an organised event,"" she said. ""They're under a lot of pressure, they're under-resourced and they have a lot to cover, and I do respect that they have to respond to every complaint and I do respect that there probably was a complaint from residents about a lot of cars there or a lot of people there. ""But Helen's Bay is a big enough beach to hold 200 people, it doesn't justify them coming to break it up."" In a statement the PSNI said: ""Our approach has been that we will engage, explain and encourage members of the community to comply with the Health Protection Regulations. ""The vast majority of our community are complying with the restrictions, which we all recognise, are asking people to restrict their personal and professional lives in a way none of us would ever have thought possible. ""While enforcement is our last resort, we have not, and will not, shy away from enforcement when it is necessary.""

"Harley Watson's family described him as a ""good, kind, helpful and lovely boy"" A man has admitted killing a 12-year-old boy in a hit-and-run near a school. Harley Watson was struck by a car which ploughed into children outside Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, on 2 December 2019. Terence Glover, 51, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility. He also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of 23-year-old Raquel Jimeno, and six boys and three girls aged between 12 and 16 who cannot be named. Terence Glover pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility Glover, who is being held at a mental health facility, appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court by videolink. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder, which the crown accepted, and also admitted driving a Ford Ka dangerously in Willingale Road. Prosecutor Christine Agnew told the court the defendant had ""suffered an abnormality of the mind"" at the time of the crash. She said two psychiatrists would give evidence ahead of sentencing on 8 January. Harley's mother sat in the public gallery and wept during the 15-minute hearing. His family previously said they were ""devastated"" by what happened, describing Harley as a ""good, kind, helpful and lovely boy"".

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third over lockdown, according to a major study. Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements - but, despite this progress, cases remained relatively high across England. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the data showed the country could not ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"". The findings by Imperial College London were based on swabbing more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November. TheReact-1 study,externalis highly respected and gives us the most up-to-date picture of Covid-19 in the country. Its researchers estimatedthe virus's reproduction (R) ratehad fallen to 0.88. That means on average every infection translated to less than one other new infection, so the epidemic is shrinking. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Run alongside pollster Ipsos MORI, the Imperial study involved testing a random sample of people for coronavirus, whether or not they had symptoms. The results of these tests suggested a 30% fall in infections between the last study and the period of 13-24 November. Before that, cases were accelerating - doubling every nine days when the study last reported at the end of October. Now cases are coming down, but more slowly than they shot up - halving roughly every 37 days. PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers UK R number below 1 for first time since August Has England's lockdown worked? In the North West and North East, though - regions with some of the highest numbers of cases - infections fell by more than half. The findings suggest cases are now highest in the East Midlands and West Midlands. Lockdown came into force across England on 5 November but national data, based on people with symptoms, suggests there was a spike in cases in the week after. This was put down to pre-lockdown socialising, since it takes five days on average after catching the infection for it to be detectable by a test. R was last below 1 on the 14 August Despite clear improvements, overall cases remain high. An estimated one in 100 people have coronavirus - double the rate in September when infections began to rise. The study also found certain groups had a higher chance of testing positive over this period: People of Asian ethnicity People living in the most deprived neighbourhoods People living in the largest households It estimated that: Roughly 96 people in every 10,000 had coronavirus, down from 132 per 10,000 just before lockdown There were about 72,000 new infections a day, compared with 100,000 at the end of October Prof Paul Elliott, who leads the study, said the data offered ""encouraging signs"" for England's epidemic. ""These trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in [the worst-affected areas] and that lockdown has added to this effect. But he said: ""As we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to continue to pay attention to public-health messaging, as cases remained high. ""It's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control,"" he added. Prof Kevin McConway, a statistics professor at the Open University, urged caution over the figures. He said: ""Things have started moving in the right direction again, but we're by no means in the position we were at the end of the summer, or even the start of the summer.  We can't stop taking great care yet by any means."" The government suggestedEngland's new tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, would be ""crucial"" to keeping infections falling. The three-tier system is tougher than the similar one in place before 5 November, under which cases continued to rise. It will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. Elsewhere in the UK,Northern Ireland has beguna two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has beenplaced in one of five tiers. In Wales,First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. These findings of the React-1 study are interim, meaning they still need to be reviewed.

"Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said. Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalRobert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"". Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added. Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules. The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday. Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business. The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday. ""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote. ""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport."" Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day. Retail giant Arcadia faces collapse within hours Black Friday comes early for shoppers this year The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times. But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"". ""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC. ""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions. But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains. Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently thatit was cutting 3,500 jobswith the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters. In August, M&S announced it was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Over the past week, BBC Wales has asked readers to submit their questions about the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. We asked if there was anything you wanted to know and whether the rules are confusing you - and pledged to try and answer. Here's what you wanted to know. People die with coronavirus, not of coronavirus - just as people die with cancer, not of cancer. That is because the actual cause of death is the effect the virus - or cancer - has on the body. For example, Covid-19 can cause a huge degree of inflammation which becomes multi-organ failure and this is the cause of death. Similarly some cancers can, for example, damage blood vessels which causes bleeding in the brain - a stroke - which can be fatal. Therefore the damage to the body which causes death has been caused by coronavirus, but coronavirus is not the direct cause of death - the cause of death in this example would be organ failure. So the deaths are with, not of, coronavirus. In recording deaths with Covid-19, medical professionals will consider: ""Would this person be alive today if they had not caught coronavirus?"" It has been estimated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that 88.9% of deaths in Wales where doctors have mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, that it was the underlying cause of death. So in October, 236 deaths were due to Covid-19. But there were another 49 when Covid-19 was involved and mentioned on the death certificate, and a factor in the death. In Wales, Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 2,629 of deaths registered up to 7 November. It is important to note the figures released daily by Public Health Wales or weekly by the ONS do not include all people who have tested positive in 28 days. Rather, they include people who have had confirmed or suspected coronavirus within the past 28 days which isbelieved to have been a factor in their death. Taking safety measures such as working from home, staying home as much as possible and respecting the rules will put you in the best position to avoid the virus. However, anyone can catch coronavirus and anyone can pass it on. It only takes one interaction with someone who may not even realise they are infected to potentially catch coronavirus. While coronavirus is mostly transmitted when people cough, sneeze or talk, there are also some studies showing it can be transmitted by touching an infected surface - such as on groceries or packages delivered to your home. These studies have mostly been done in lab conditions and some experts have thrown doubt on the actual threat posed by surface transmission in real life. Either way - to best protect yourself from catching coronavirus from surfaces, regularly wash your hands for 20 seconds. If and when a vaccine (or more than one vaccine) is approved for use in the UK and begins to be rolled out, safety measures such as those you've listed will still need to be in place for some time. That's because it will take months to vaccinate everyone who wishes to be vaccinated. As you've correctly implied, there are still questions over whether uptake of the vaccine will be high due to misinformation and myths on social media, and there may be some people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. We have fact checked some of the most widely shared false claims. Even if the uptake is good, we are likely to be well into 2021 before all the relevant groups have been offered the vaccination - which will probably begin with front-line NHS staff and care staff, followed by the elderly and others most vulnerable to the virus. So we'll need to continue taking safety measures for the time being. It is early days, but it's likely the Welsh Government will continue to look at infection rates the way they have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic, and allow these measures to be dropped when scientific advisers believe it is safe to do so. It has been recognised throughout the pandemic that Welsh people have made sacrifices and continue to make sacrifices - and Mark Drakeford has repeated during news briefings that every death is a tragedy. In making decisions over lockdown measures, the Welsh Government looks at several factors including the R number - the average number of people a sick person could pass the virus on to. The aim of lockdowns is to reduce the R number below one, which means case numbers would begin to fall - therefore fewer people are getting ill, leading to fewer hospital admissions so the NHS does not become overwhelmed, and fewer deaths. Lockdown restrictions since March, along with social distancing and other safety measures, have served to shrink the R number. This modelling chart looks at the worse case scenario for deaths by day, if there is a slow response in Wales However, as the country has moved out of lockdowns, the R number has risen again. In September, a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for this winter was published by Swansea University experts, mentioning 636,000 infections, leading to 18,200 hospital admissions - peaking in January - and potentially 6,300 deaths. Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales If the NHS becomes overwhelmed, this does not just affect Covid patients but it restricts the organisation in how well other services such as cancer referrals and A&E can operate. This shows how the range of the R-number has changed in Wales. The Welsh Government's latest estimate is that it could be as high as 1.4 It is expected to take years before NHS waiting times are back to pre-coronavirus levels in Wales, according to the organisation's boss. The number of people waiting more than 36 weeks for planned hospital treatments is six times higher than at the start of 2020. Waiting list figures,published in November for the first time since March, showed nearly 169,000 people waiting. The number has grown after most non-urgent treatment was postponed to prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave. Since then, the service has been trying to restart non-emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave. The fear, of course, is that people who have missed out on early intervention as a result will have missed an opportunity for early treatment - such as in the case of Simon Green whose scan was delayed and brain tumour subsequently found to be inoperable. This video can not be played Why this cancer patient feels coronavirus has 'cost me a future' As a result of such delays, Prof Tom Crosby of the Wales Cancer Network said as many as 2,000 people could die. The Welsh Government said work was under way to address the issue with health boards. But there are fears had such measures not been taken to reduce pressures on the NHS, the organisation could have been overwhelmed - which would also result in deaths. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? 'I want to know how my dad got coronavirus' How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? ""Not acting would have meant that not only would the health service have been overwhelmed with very poor care of Covid and non-Covid patients, but it also would have been disastrous for our staff,"" Vaughan Gething said. Bacterial infections and viruses are different and, for example, antibiotics only work on bacterial infections and not viruses. However, anti-bacterial hand sanitisers or cleaning products can also be effective on some viruses if the alcohol concentration is high enough. Viruses similar to the structure of coronavirus are sensitive to alcohol and detergents, which can help break down their oily, fatty shells. Hand washing with soap is still the best cleaning practice, according to the NHS. This data is not routinely released, and there could be data protection issues if it were. But local authorities and the Welsh Government have occasionally referenced why lockdown measures have needed to be tightened in certain areas. For example, schools in Cardigan have closed for two weeks after a spike in cases in the area, with Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn blaming ""super-spreader events"" such as ""parties"" and ""pub crawls"". When parts of the south Wales valleys were placed under stricter lockdown measures, transmissions were believed to have been occurring due topeople going into each others' homes and not adhering to social distancing. And measures have been taken in hospitals and care homes when there is evidence of transmission there. So while this data is not routinely made available to the public, when it leads to specific decisions on restrictions, an explanation is usually given. While it takes a few weeks or even longer to fully understand the impact any change in restrictions has made, there are promising early signs the firebreak has helped, the Welsh Government says. The chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Mark Drakeford said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Yes - to some areas. Travel in and out of Wales from England was previously banned unless you had a valid and essential reason, but Welsh Government rules updated on 3 December have changed this. From 18:00 GMT on Friday, travel is only banned between Wales and tier 3 areas of England and tier 3 and 4 areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland. This means you are now able to travel to and from tier 1 and 2 areas - replacing the previous blanket travel ban - although the government strongly advises against travelling to those areas at all. Here's how to find out which tier an area of England is in. Between 23 and 27 December, you can travel anywhere in the UK to form your Christmas bubble. There were calls earlier this year for a spike in excess deaths in January and February in Ceredigion to be investigated. In the first 17 weeks of the year 342 deaths were registered in Ceredigion, according to figures obtained by Newyddion S4C - 22% more than the five-year average. MP Ben Lake wanted to know if Covid-19 was present before it was realised. Cardiff University's Rhian Daniel said this was not ""highly likely"" and was likely due to a similar infection. However, due to antibodies potentially fading to undetectable levels a few months after infection, taking an antibody test now probably wouldn't identify whether that virus you had last winter really was Covid-19 or another virus causing similar symptoms. Scientists and doctors in some European countries haveclaimed to have found evidence of coronavirus circulating earlier than previously thought. And with evidence of coronavirus arriving in the UK onat least 1,300 separate occasions, we may never know exactly when the UK saw its patient zero. Long Covid has now been recognised as a medical condition, and healthcare workers are receiving guidance on it. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life, and it is not necessarily people who were severely ill in hospital who are struck by it. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. Read more on Long Covid here. Covid-19 simply references the year the virus was first identified in Wuhan - 2019. Official names were announced for the virus responsible for Covid-19 - previously known as ""2019 novel coronavirus"". The virus is calledsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the illness it causes is calledcoronavirus disease (Covid-19). Referencing the word SARShas been avoided by the World Health Organisation,externaldue to its potential for spreading fear, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol and will have to close at 18:00 starting on Friday Cinemas, bingo halls, museums and other indoor attractions will have to close completely from 18:00 on Friday New Covid guidance for hospitals could see more patients receiving face-to-face visits from loved ones Mass Covid testing of students begins at UK universities to ensure they can go home safely for Christmas Unemployment in Wales could rise to heights not seen in 30 years due to the pandemic, experts say Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts That brings our live coverage of today's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing and Public Health Wales update to a close. Here's a summary of the main points:  Thank you for joining us - there'll be continued coverage on the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good afternoon. There have been three new deaths involving coronavirus reported on Monday across Wales, taking the official total to 2,540. The latest deaths were reported in the Hywel Dda Health Board area of west Wales. A further three deaths involving coronavirus have been reported to Public Health Wales, taking the total in Wales to 2,540. It has also recorded another 802 cases, taking the total to 80,342. New rules in Wales from Friday will prevent the sale of alcohol in pubs, cafes and restaurants which will also have to close at 18:00 daily. Cinemas, bingo halls and other indoor entertainment will have to close completely from Friday. There's no decision yet on whether restrictions on travel to England will be lifted when the lockdown there ends on Wednesday. An outdoor festive lights showhas been cancelled after police and council officials said it breached coronavirus regulations, organisers say. The Fonmon Festive Lights Show had been due to get under way at Fonmon Castle, in the Vale of Glamorgan, on Friday. But just hours after organisers said it had been given the ""all clear"" from environmental health officials, it was cancelled. Organisers of the show saythe new regulations,externalwhich took effect after the firebreak lockdown ended prohibit outdoor events attended by more than 30 people over the age of 11 at any one time. Vale of Glamorgan Council has been asked to comment. The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK. Universities are opening temporary testing centreswhere hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave. Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December. But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities. The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"". The ""severe"" restrictions on selling alcohol and closing times have dealt a ""major blow"" to pubs and restaurants in Wales, a group representing them says. The Wales Independent Restaurant Collective said the measures - which see alcohol sales from licensed premises banned from Friday evening and pubs and cafes having to close from 18:00 - were hard to take after hard work to make hospitality venues safe amid constantly changing restrictions. Hospitality had ""borne the brunt of restrictions"" across the UK, the group said, despite proving venues could be safe with the right measures in place. Pub and restaurant owner Cerys Furlong said: âNot being able to serve alcohol and early closing means that trading will be a long way from viable for the majority of the sector, particularly in this Christmas period, which is crucial to the success or otherwise of most businesses in hospitality. ""However, we welcome the support funding from Welsh Government which we understand is intended to reflect more closely the scale of the challenges we face."" Cerys Furlong says trading will be 'a long way from viable' in the run-up to Christmas for many firms Plaid Cymruâs health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the Welsh Government should provide support to allow the hospitality and tourism industries to âhibernateâ for the winter. He said businesses ""need to be able to plan ahead"". ""The sensible thing for them to do now, knowing they have the support to do it, would be to say âletâs just put everything to one side for the time being, do what needs to be done to look after our staff, make sure our businesses are there for next year and hibernate'."" Mr ap Iorwerth said it was not good for businesses to âbounce from once lockdown to anotherâ. Wales will be ready to run a vaccine programme once it is approved after carrying out a ""large and successful test"" of practical matters that need to be in place, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford told a coronavirus briefing: ""That could be as early as this week and we will be ready for it."" He said there had been a ""terrific response"" to the mass-testing programme in Merthyr Tydfil, with more than 10,000 people tested in the first eight days. Care homes will begin using lateral-flow tests this week ""to help reunite families who have been separated for many months"", Mr Drakeford said. Advice will be published later aboutvisiting in hospitalsto offer hope that both parents can be ""more involved"" in their baby's antenatal care, he added. The Conservative leader in the Senedd said the nationwide ban on the sale of alcohol in pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. Paul Davies said the move was âdisproportionateâ and heâd prefer to see âa much more regional approachâ. He was also concerned there would be more domestic alcohol consumption. âWith pubs and bars not selling alcohol, there is a danger that people will then drink at home and then perhaps mix even more than we are seeing at the moment,â he said. Chef Tom Simmons from Cardiff fears his restaurant's takings will be seriously hit by the instruction to close at 18:00 daily from Friday. He says evening trade accounts for more than 60% of his takings, which have already been hit by cutting the number of diners to ensure social distancing. Allow Twitter content?

The first minister says the system to ensure businesses in the hospitality sector in Wales can get the support they need will be ""as automatic as we can make it"". Firms affected will receive between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 in support through the new ""restrictions business fund"". Mark Drakeford told journalists: ""In terms of the help we'll be using the systems that we've used up until now. ""So the help you get on the basis of your rateable value will be as automatic as we can make it. ""As long as we know that you wanted it [support], the system is as automatic as we can manage."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was not changing the approach to selling alcohol in off-licences and supermarkets, but admitted it was a ""difficult conundrum"". Asked about the decision to stop the sale of alcohol in controlled hospitality settings but allowing it to be sold elsewhere - and potentially drunk in unregulated environments - the first minister said: ""The judgment was that if you made a 6pm cut-off [for shops] it wouldn't make any difference."" ""People would simply buy what they needed earlier in the day so it would have been an action without a consequence and, as a result, we decided not to take it."" The rule allowing people from four different households to meet in pubs and restaurants ""is essentially driven by our wish to make sure that our young people have a legal way of getting together"", according to the first minister. In Scotland,level three restrictions,externalmean pubs and restaurants cannot sell alcohol, must close at 6pm, but also that only six people from up to two separate households can meet in those venues. Asked at the Welsh Government's press conference why they have not also tightened the rules around the number of households, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""When you allow simply households to meet it really doesn't work for younger people. ""They can't meet their friends, they can't meet up with the people that they socialise with normally and I was very keen, and our cabinet was very keen, not to devise a system where the only way that people could meet up together was by going outside the rules."" Wales' first minister has said that the evidence ""is there"" for new restrictions on the hospitality sector - and could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell. Mark Drakeford said: ""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket."" And he added: ""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time, and the evidence I'm afraid is just there."" The first minister said he hoped the latest measures would mean that when the restrictions are eased over the Christmas period ""the risk to one another and to our health service can be contained"". He said that when people get together for a significant period of time ""whether it's in our homes or in a hospitality setting, the virus thrives"". ""The cases rise and we end up with the position we see in Wales today,"" Mr Drakeford added. ""It's a matter of deep regret because of all the work the sector has done and the people who work in it."" The first minister told the coronavirus briefing there would be no change to the other restrictions in place across Wales at present. Mark Drakeford said: ""The rest
of the national measures will remain the same â there will be no changes to
household bubbles, how many people can meet in public indoor or outdoor places
or restrictions on other businesses. ""The
English lockdown will end as of Wednesday this week. In that context we are
looking at travel restrictions in and out of Wales and will make a further
announcement later this week."" First Minister Mark Drakeford say the Welsh Government will provide Â£340m to support businesses affected by the new Covid-19 restrictions, which include a ban on the sale of alcohol in pubs and the closure of indoor entertainment. He said this was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"". A Â£160m ""restrictions business fund"" would support up to 60,000 businesses on the non-domestic rating list across Wales. Mr Drakeford said: ""Businesses, including those in retail, tourism, leisure and hospitality, and their supply chains, which are materially affected by the restrictions will receive payments of between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000. ""Discretionary grants of up to Â£2,000 will continue to be available for those not on the non-domestic rating list. ""This fund will be delivered by local authorities. I am very grateful for their ongoing support and help to deliver this part of the package. ""The second element is a Â£180m fund targeted at hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses.

It will provide grants of up to Â£100,000 for SMEs and Â£150,000 for larger businesses. ""The grants will be linked to the number of people employed and their operating costs with up to 10,000 businesses being supported."" Cinemas will be one of the venue types affected Cinemas, bingo halls and other indoor entertainment will also have to close in Wales under new national restrictions coming into effect on Friday at 18:00. First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will have to close by 18:00 daily and will not be allowed to serve alcohol. After that time they will only be able to provide takeaway food. He added: âFrom the same date, indoor entertainment venues, including cinemas, bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades, must close."" Indoor visitor attractions, such as museums, galleries and heritage sites will also have to close. Outdoor visitor attractions will remain open. First Minister Mark Drakeford says there is a âstarkâ rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Wales. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs briefing, Mr Drakeford said the facts were âstarkâ and current modelling suggests an extra 1,600 people could lose their lives over the winter period. He said the all-Wales seven-day incidence rate was 187 cases per 100,000 people last week, but today that had risen to almost 210 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Drakeford said there had been further rises among the under-25 age group in 17 of the 22 council areas in Wales but âmore worryinglyâ he said cases of coronavirus were beginning to rise in the over-60 age group in most parts of the country.

"Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third over lockdown, according to a major study. Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements - but, despite this progress, cases remained relatively high across England. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the data showed the country could not ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"". The findings by Imperial College London were based on swabbing more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November. TheReact-1 study,externalis highly respected and gives us the most up-to-date picture of Covid-19 in the country. Its researchers estimatedthe virus's reproduction (R) ratehad fallen to 0.88. That means on average every infection translated to less than one other new infection, so the epidemic is shrinking. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Run alongside pollster Ipsos MORI, the Imperial study involved testing a random sample of people for coronavirus, whether or not they had symptoms. The results of these tests suggested a 30% fall in infections between the last study and the period of 13-24 November. Before that, cases were accelerating - doubling every nine days when the study last reported at the end of October. Now cases are coming down, but more slowly than they shot up - halving roughly every 37 days. PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers UK R number below 1 for first time since August Has England's lockdown worked? In the North West and North East, though - regions with some of the highest numbers of cases - infections fell by more than half. The findings suggest cases are now highest in the East Midlands and West Midlands. Lockdown came into force across England on 5 November but national data, based on people with symptoms, suggests there was a spike in cases in the week after. This was put down to pre-lockdown socialising, since it takes five days on average after catching the infection for it to be detectable by a test. R was last below 1 on the 14 August Despite clear improvements, overall cases remain high. An estimated one in 100 people have coronavirus - double the rate in September when infections began to rise. The study also found certain groups had a higher chance of testing positive over this period: People of Asian ethnicity People living in the most deprived neighbourhoods People living in the largest households It estimated that: Roughly 96 people in every 10,000 had coronavirus, down from 132 per 10,000 just before lockdown There were about 72,000 new infections a day, compared with 100,000 at the end of October Prof Paul Elliott, who leads the study, said the data offered ""encouraging signs"" for England's epidemic. ""These trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in [the worst-affected areas] and that lockdown has added to this effect. But he said: ""As we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to continue to pay attention to public-health messaging, as cases remained high. ""It's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control,"" he added. Prof Kevin McConway, a statistics professor at the Open University, urged caution over the figures. He said: ""Things have started moving in the right direction again, but we're by no means in the position we were at the end of the summer, or even the start of the summer.  We can't stop taking great care yet by any means."" The government suggestedEngland's new tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, would be ""crucial"" to keeping infections falling. The three-tier system is tougher than the similar one in place before 5 November, under which cases continued to rise. It will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. Elsewhere in the UK,Northern Ireland has beguna two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has beenplaced in one of five tiers. In Wales,First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. These findings of the React-1 study are interim, meaning they still need to be reviewed.

"Sir Philip Green and Jane Shepherdson, former director of Topshop, pictured in 2006 Sir Philip Green's failure to invest in his retail empire Arcadia has made its downfall ""inevitable"", a former boss of its best-known brand Topshop has said. Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is facing collapse putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Jane Shepherdson CBE, credited with turning Topshop into a global brand, said she expected an online retailer to buy the brand and close most stores. Arcadia had been seeking extra cash following lost sales amid the pandemic. But Ms Shepherdson, who ran Topshop until 2006, said that its problems went back much further than the coronavirus outbreak. She told the BBC's World at One programme that Sir Philip had ignored the rise of online shopping, and was now lumbered with a large and expensive store estate which was largely shut due to Covid. ""In addition to that I think the fact that he absolutely declined to invest all of the businesses [in Arcadia] means it was pretty much inevitable [it would fail]."" Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was How high could unemployment go? She said the ""most likely scenario"" for Topshop was that an online retailer would buy the brand, add it to their own portfolio and close most of the stores. ""It's incredibly sadâ¦ the worst thing is for all of the store staff, which are mostly women who are going to be unemployed. ""The supply chains are also going to take a massive hit. I imagine that orders will start to be cancelled very, very shortly."" Ms Shepherdson also accused Sir Philip of being a bully when she worked for him, adding that he used ""to shout at people all the time, he was disrespectful, dismissive, rude"". ""The reason I left was I spent five years keeping him at arm's length from what I considered to be my business, Topshop, and I realised at that point that I couldn't keep him at arm's length any longer and I would actually have to work with him if I stayed and I absolutely didn't want to do that."" The BBC has asked Sir Philip for a comment. Arcadia is a sprawling retail business that owns a chunk of the High Street's fashion brands, including Miss Selfridge, Topman, Wallis and Evans. Questions over the future of Sir Philip's retail empire were raised on Friday, after it emerged that talks with potential lenders for a Â£30m loan had failed. Arcadia was seeking extra cash as coronavirus had caused ""a material impact on trading"" across its businesses, it said. It now needs a breathing space from its creditors and, to gain that, is expected to file for administration. Administration gives a business protection from its creditors while it is put back on an even keel, or while parts or all of it are sold off. It needs the court to grant the appointment of specialist insolvency practitioners, who then look at the best way of raising money to repay its debts, keeping the business or parts of the business going if possible. The process can take up to a year. Even before coronavirus, Arcadia's best-known names were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Former City minister and once chairman of Marks and Spencer, Paul Myners, told the BBC: ""Covid has obviously been a significant factor but the truth is this group of brands has been haemorrhaging now for 15 years. It's become an insignificance. ""Sir Philip never really accepted the opportunity or challenge of online trading. He made no investment in that area at all."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List On Sunday, a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack: ""We tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" The whole retail sector is under pressure. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Sir Philip bought Arcadia Group in 2002. His wife, Lady Cristina Green, is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. In a colourful career, Sir Philip has been both lauded as the ""King of the High Street"" and branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". Read more about the businessman's journey here Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund which has 10,000 members. On Sunday, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Stephen Timms, called on the Green family to plug the gap. ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" the Labour MP said, adding he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip used his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme received their full pension. But he said that even if he did not provide a full top up, Arcadia workers should still receive the majority of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. Sir Philip sold BHS for Â£1 in 2015, a year before it went bust with a Â£571m pension deficit Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell wasrecently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. The collapse of Arcadia could affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans at the department store group JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". Some stores could close, but Arcadia's brands are household names, and are likely to survive in some form. Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of its big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it hasbought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. Arcadia's 13,000 workers face an anxious wait. One told the BBC: ""I'm really worried about what is going to happen to us, especially as it is so close to Christmas. ""It's already been a very tough time, I'm in a role where I can work from home, but I'm not relying on anything being there for me - I've started applying for other jobs."" Holders of vouchers and gift cards with the various Arcadia brands also face uncertainty - with the risk that these cards will become worthless. Administrators and any future owners will decide whether they will be accepted. If the brand folds, then cardholders are owed the money, but are a long way down on the priority list of creditors who need to be paid back after assets are sold. The BBC's business correspondent, Dominic O'Connell, says as with many other clothing retailers struggling with the pandemic shutdown, insolvency looks the only option. But, he says, two questions remain: Can the individual businesses find new owners to take them on, and what amount of public pressure will there be on the Greens to make good any shortfall in the Arcadia pension schemes?

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Moderna is filing for US and European emergency regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use. Regulators will look at trial data for the mRNA vaccine and decide if it is safe and effective enough to recommend for roll out. Clinical studies show the jab is more than 94% effective at protecting people from becoming ill with Covid-19. Pfizer, which has a similar jab, has already filed for the same US approval. UK regulators are also reviewing data on the Pfizer vaccine, as well as another type of Covid vaccine fromAstraZenca and Oxford Universityfor emergency approval. Moderna says it hopes to gain UK approval soon, now that it has trial data from 30,000 volunteers - including high risk groups like the elderly - that suggests it works. In those studies, 15,000 people received the real vaccine while the other participants got placebo injections. No serious side effects were reported. During the studies, 185 people in the placebo group fell ill with Covid-19, and some severely so. In comparison, there were 11 cases in the vaccine group and none were severe. Full trial data has not been released, but will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? The three front-runner vaccines have different pros and cons. The AstraZeneca jab is cheaper - around Â£3 ($4) for a dose, compared to around Â£15 ($20) for the Pfizer vaccine and Â£25 ($33) for Moderna's. And it is potentially easier to distribute because it does not need to be stored under ultra-low temperatures. But its efficacy in trials - between 62% and 90% - is a bit lower than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Russian Covid vaccine shows encouraging results The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines: 7m of the Moderna jab 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech one 100m of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: ""This is great news indeed - the more trial data that we have, the greater confidence we have that vaccines can be used to blunt the human cost of Covid-19. ""As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public."" Meanwhile, the UK's new minister responsible for vaccine rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, said vaccination would not be compulsory, but that society might expect people to get immunised. He told BBC's World At One: ""I think the very strong message that you will see, this is the way we return the whole country, and so it's good for your family, it's good for your community, it's good for your country to be vaccinated. ""And, ultimately people will have to make a decision.""

Madame Gandhi has createda playlist of ""must-listen"" tunes,externalfor our special BBC 100 Women Masterclass, all about finding and
creating music that can empower rather than disempower women. ""I do think we canât tell other people how to make their
music, but we can provide and design an alternative. I do want to turn up and
party but I donât want to turn up to the sound of my own oppression,"" she tells
BBC Radio 1Xtraâs Jamz Supernova. ""You want the level of energy and good vibes but not the
misogyny that comes with it. I see the role of a DJ and artist to provide an
alternative."" We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) is the theme music of hit Chilean drama La JaurÃ­a. As well as writing the music, Ana Tijoux also stars in the Amazon Prime series. After a teacher is caught abusing his female pupils, a young protestor goes missing. Three female police officers from a gender crimes unit launch an investigation, uncovering an online game that recruits men to commit acts of aggression toward women. We Are Not Alone is a song about the importance of standing together. How many disappeared? How many were swallowed by the earth? Life kills us, the press bleeds out. We scream justice when we are silenced. Ana Tijoux, We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) ""Growing up there were misogynistic songs everywhere,"" Grammy award-winning singer AngÃ©lique Kidjo tells our music masterclass. ""The thing that was important to me was the empowerment of
other women, I followed their example and just went for it."" She told her fiancÃ© to leave after he wouldnât let her sing. ""My father always said to me, âtalent has no gender, so go
out there and show them.' All the songs that play down women just show

She has been on tour with acts such as MIA and Thievery Corporation. ""We as musicians have the power to score the emotions of our time.

Four-time Grammy Award winner AngÃ©lique Kidjo has been described as ""the undisputed queen of African music"" - and for a reason! Benin-born AngÃ©lique has cross-pollinated the West African traditions of her childhood with elements of American R&B, funk and jazz. In her 2020 Grammy acceptance speech, AngÃ©lique spoke about her album Celia, an homage to queen of salsa Celia Cruz. ""She is one of those artists that taught you at a young age that gender cannot define who you are,"" she said. AngÃ©lique passionately advocates for girls to have access to education and helped found The Batonga Foundation, which empowers Benin's young women to challenge expectations.

For award-winning disability specialist Shani Dhanda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, it's about people acting on each otherâs behalf to address systemic problems. She says being an ally is very different from being a friend. ""An ally is not a friend, just like being non-racist is very different from being actively anti-racist. ""Being an ally doesnât necessarily mean you fully understand what it feels like to be oppressed. It just means you take on the struggle as your own.""

"This video can not be played An Irish bar has been ""turned into a coffee shop"" by the new rules, its owner says Welsh pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol from Friday and will be unable to open to customers beyond 18:00 GMT. First Minister Mark Drakeford announced the new rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Business groups said the move would devastate Wales' hospitality industry, with closures ""guaranteed"". Indoor entertainment and visitor attractions, including cinemas, museums and galleries, will also have to shut. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 18:00, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 22:00. The Conservative leader in the Senedd, Paul Davies, said the national approach from the Welsh Government was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. Plaid Cymru said hospitality was ""paying the price"" for a lack of stricter measures after the firebreak lockdown ended on 9 November. Mr Drakeford said without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter. How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What are you allowed to do? The first minister said firms hit by the restrictions would be offered Â£340m in support which he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference: ""I know these new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at the one of the busiest times of the year for the sector. ""Unfortunately, we continue to face a virus which is moving incredibly quickly across Wales and a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another."" The case rate has risen from 187 per 100,000 people over seven days on Friday, to 210 cases per 100,000 people, Mr Drakeford added. The restrictions come into effect at 18:00 on Friday, and are similar to the restrictions on hospitality withinlevel three areas in Scotland. However the rule allowingfour people from four different householdsto meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. Meanwhile current restrictions on travel into England, implemented while a lockdown is in place over the border, are being reviewed. The first minister said he would make a further announcement later this week. Dai Dearden said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"" The chief executive of one of Wales' largest breweries says she wants the Welsh Government to prove that Covid is being spread in pubs and restaurants. ""Where is the scientific evidence that you are more at risk in a pub than you are at home or in a supermarket?"" said Connie Parry of Tomos Watkin brewery in Swansea. Ian Price, director of business lobby group CBI Wales, warned closures and job losses were ""all but guaranteed"" in pubs and restaurants. ""The first minister's announcement is devastating for a Welsh hospitality sector that's already reeling from a damaging cycle of restrictions,"" he said. Dai Dearden, general manager of The Grange pub in Cardiff, said the announcement was a ""hammer-blow"". ""I think it will close us for the time being at one of the busiest times of the year"", he said, adding it would have ""a massive effect on the health and well-being, and mental state, of my staff and our customers"". This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford defends the new rules Tom Simmons, the chef and co-owner of Thomas in Pontcanna, Cardiff, said: ""The spend in our restaurant is around 70% on food and drink - and we will lose customers who know they can't have a drink with their meal. Many won't come back because of that."" ""I don't see any reason or logic behind this. All it will do is lead to people gathering at home and drinking instead - it would be structured with restaurants and pubs, not in people's homes."" Joanne Cooney runs the Irish Bar in Llandudno in Conwy county, which currently has the lowest coronavirus case rate out of Wales' 22 counties. She said: ""The numbers are high in big towns and we're being penalised for them. Our numbers are low. We should've been able to open and trade."" ""People are not going to come in. You've just turned us into a coffee shop, the town has loads of coffee shops - that's not what we are."" Ben Francis, of the Federation of Small Business, said it was ""incredibly important"" that promised funding ""can be rolled out as a matter of urgency"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that today's announcement will come as a devastating blow to those indoor entertainment and hospitality firms that have fought tooth and nail to protect jobs, remain viable and provide a safe environment for their staff and customers this year."" Meanwhile, Folly Farm adventure park and zoo in Pembrokeshire announced it would be closing, saying it was ""heavily reliant"" on the indoor part of the business. A spokesman for the Welsh Association of Visitor Attractions, which represents more than 70 family attractions in Wales, said the Welsh Government did not consult with tourism leaders before deciding the new rules. ""The health of Wales is paramount, but the way tourism decisions are now being taken is scandalous. ""Some members have stated that the stop-go, no-consultation policy of the Welsh Government is affecting both their health and well-being, and that the Welsh tourism industry is in a state of utter despair at the way it is being treated,"" it said. Folly Farm zoo said it would be closing its doors as a result of the announcement The first minister told the press conference that the evidence ""is there"" that the virus is spreading in hospitality - and said it could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell. ""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket,"" he said. ""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time."" BBC Wales has asked to see the evidence cited by Mr Drakeford. A Welsh Government spokesman referred to a report from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in September which estimated that closing bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants would have a ""moderate impact"" on Covid transmission. Hospitality businesses were allowed to open after the firebreak ended earlier in November. Mr Drakeford said scientific and medical experts had warned that by 12 January, the total number of people with Covid in hospital could rise to 2,200 ""unless we respond now"". According to the House Of Commons Library there are 2,190 pubs in Wales. Hospitality businesses are being offered extra support, the Welsh Government said Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, said: ""This blanket approach across all of Wales is disproportionate and will unfairly affect parts of the country where infection rates are significantly lower than others, and will harm the sector to such an extent that large parts of it may not recover."" Plaid Cymru said it had called for stricter measures as Wales came out of its firebreak lockdown. ""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price,"" Helen Mary Jones, Plaid's economy spokeswoman, said. Caroline Jones, of the Independent Reform Alliance in the Senedd, said the national approach would ""strangle the hospitality sector further at the very time of year in the run up to Christmas where many pubs, cafes and restaurants make their profits"". Pubs have been allowed to open in Wales since the end of the firebreak lockdown The Â£160m ""Restrictions Business Fund"" will offer firms in the hospitality, tourism and leisure sectors that pay non-domestic rates (NDR) grants of up to Â£5,000. The Welsh Government estimated around 60,000 businesses with a rateable value of under Â£150,000 would receive the support. A ""sector-specific"" Â£180m Economic Resilience Fund would be made available for hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses. The Welsh Government said small and medium sized businesses meeting the criteria could receive up to Â£100,000, while larger firms could receive up to a maximum of Â£150,000. The financial support for the hospitality industry is significant and much more than it has been given before. But coming just a month after the two-week firebreak, these restrictions will be a deadly blow for some traders. Once again the Welsh Government is having to walk a fine line, beating the virus by reducing the amount we meet others, while at the same time trying to protect the businesses we usually go out to. Urban pubs may still attract shoppers for a ""dry"" lunch but they are unlikely to spend nearly as much as usual. Rural pubs, often a community's main place to meet, are more dependent on their evening trade. The money they are getting from the Welsh Government might well pay overheads like rent and insurance but these are businesses that have already taken a huge hit this year.

"Scott Morrison said the post was a ""shameful"" and ""appalling"" action Australia has demanded China apologise for posting a fake picture on a government Twitter account that depicted an Australian soldier murdering an Afghan child. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Beijing should be ""utterly ashamed"" for sharing the ""repugnant"" image. It comes amid escalating political tensions between the two countries. The image referred to alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers - murders of Afghan civilians and prisoners. Warning: This story contains an image some people might find distressing. Earlier this month, a report found ""credible information"" that 25 Australian soldiers were involved in the murders of 39 Afghan civilians and prisoners between 2009 and 2013. The findings from the Australian Defence Force (ADF) inquiry sparked widespread condemnation, and are now being investigated by police. Australia to sack troops over Afghan killings On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao posted a fabricated image which portrayed an Australian soldier with a bloody knife next to a child. The child is seen holding a lamb. The image appears to be a reference to previously reported allegations that elite Australian soldiers used knives to murder two 14-year-old Afghan boys. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported the ADF report did not substantiate those allegations. Chinese official Lijian Zhao posted the fake image on Monday However it did find ""credible evidence"" of unlawful killings and a ""warrior culture"" within elite units. The allegations included that junior soldiers were encouraged to shoot prisoners for their first kill. Mr Zhao's tweet said: ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, and call for holding them accountable."" Australia has requested Twitter remove the post from its platform, describing it as ""disinformation"". Mr Morrison described the post as ""truly repugnant, deeply offensive, utterly outrageous"". ""The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world's eyes,"" he said. ""It is a false image and terrible slur on our defence forces."" He added that Australia had established a transparent process to investigate the alleged war crimes, as was expected of a ""democratic, liberal"" country. Mr Morrison went on to acknowledge that there are ""undoubtedly"" tensions between the two nations, but said: ""This is not how you deal with it."" He warned Beijing that other countries around the world were watching its actions towards Australia. This video can not be played Australia and China have disagreed on important political issues This is a new low in an already very tense relationship between the two key trading partners. Last week, Mr Zhao said the war crimes' report ""fully exposed the hypocrisy of the human rights and freedom these Western countries are always chanting"". But his tweet shocked Scott Morrison into his most undiplomatic language yet. It's another indication of how bad things have become between Canberra and Beijing. The Australian prime minister acknowledged that the two countries have had their problems but this tweet, he said, had gone too far. This comes at a very sensitive time for Australia. The country and its military are reeling from the findings of the war crimes inquiry - 19 Special Air Service (SAS) troops could face prosecution for the murders. For China to use this against Australia is one thing, but a senior Chinese official doing so accompanied by a fake inflammatory image has clearly pushed the Morrison government over the edge. Australian exporters are on tenterhooks about what other tariffs they can expect from China amid the escalating spat. There's a lot at stake here: crucial diplomatic relations and billions of dollars' worth of trade. Both sides know that but it seems that only Australia, despite its fury, is still willing to extend a hand. It's worth noting that in his angry comments today, Mr Morrison still left room for diplomatic manoeuvre. ""Despite this terribly offensive post today, I would ask again and call on China to re-engage in that dialogue,"" he said, adding that he hoped this ""awful"" event would lead to a type of ""reset"". But China is unrepentant. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: ""It's not China which should be ashamed, but Australia."" The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' Bilateral relations between the two countries have rapidly deteriorated this year after Australia led calls for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, and ongoing discussion about Beijing's alleged interference in Australian affairs. In recent months, China has imposed a series of economic blows - including trade stoppages and tariffs - on about a dozen Australian imports including wine, barley and beef. Australia has described China's actions as ""economic coercion"". Earlier this month, China's embassy in Australia circulated a list to local media outlining 14 policy areas where it said Australia had acted in a way that aggravated relations. How reliant is Australia on China? China puts up to 200% tariffs on Australian wine These included Australia's decision to block Chinese investment projects, ban Chinese tech firm Huawei from its 5G tender, and ""incessant wanton interference in China's Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs"". Australia has said it will not change its policy positions. On Monday, Mr Morrison confirmed that Australia's requests for meetings with senior Chinese ministers continued to be rebuffed.

"Rita Ora says she's ""deeply sorry"" for breaking English lockdown rules to celebrate her 30th birthday. The singer says she attended a party at a restaurant in west London on Saturday. ""Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility,"" she wrote in a statement. It's reported up to 30 people were at the party, although she describes the event as a ""small gathering"". She says it was a ""spur of the moment"" decision. London's Metropolitan Police confirmed officers went to the Casa Cruz restaurant after a report about a potential breach of Covid lockdown regulations. ""I'm deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk,"" she posted. ""This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement."" Rita Ora wrote an apology and posted it on her Instastory Current lockdown regulations in England mean you can only meet one other person outside. Pubs and restaurants are currently closed (although they can serve non-alcoholic takeaways) and you shouldn't be with people from outside your house or support bubbles indoors. Police have the power to break up groups larger than six and those who ignore officers could be fined Â£100, doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200. So far, the singer has not been fined. Kensington and Chelsea Council, which is responsible for issuing Covid fines against businesses in the area, says it is still investigating what happened at Casa Cruz. Allow Instagram content?

Four-time Grammy Award winner AngÃ©lique Kidjo has been described as ""the undisputed queen of African music"" - and for a reason! Benin-born AngÃ©lique has cross-pollinated the West African traditions of her childhood with elements of American R&B, funk and jazz. In her 2020 Grammy acceptance speech, AngÃ©lique spoke about her album Celia, an homage to queen of salsa Celia Cruz. ""She is one of those artists that taught you at a young age that gender cannot define who you are,"" she said. AngÃ©lique passionately advocates for girls to have access to education and helped found The Batonga Foundation, which empowers Benin's young women to challenge expectations.

She's got tips on how you can find ways to listen, learn and support others. Weâve heard the word ""ally"" a lot this year, but what does it really mean? And how can you be one? For award-winning disability specialist Shani Dhanda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, it's about people acting on each otherâs behalf to address systemic problems. She says being an ally is very different from being a friend. ""An ally is not a friend, just like being non-racist is very different from being actively anti-racist. ""Being an ally doesnât necessarily mean you fully understand what it feels like to be oppressed. It just means you take on the struggle as your own.""

Dr Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu, a psychriatrist working in Uganda, has been helping her community deal with the effects of the pandemic on mental health. Etheldreda, one of this yearâsBBC 100 Women, has struggled with depression in the past, and shares her coping strategies: Inform yourself.Ethel read extensively about stress and depression, so was able to notice when she was sliding into it herself. Open up.Those you trust will offer emotional support that will lessen the burden you have to carry. A problem shared is already half solved. Stay proactive and connect.

make-up artist and the photographer that goes beyond body image, beyond race, about what can be done to make things more inclusive so everyone can love

party but I donât want to turn up to the sound of my own oppression,"" she tells
BBC Radio 1Xtraâs Jamz Supernova. ""You want the level of energy and good vibes but not the
misogyny that comes with it. I see the role of a DJ and artist to provide an
alternative."" We Are Not Alone (No Estamos Solas) is the theme music of hit Chilean drama La JaurÃ­a. As well as writing the music, Ana Tijoux also stars in the Amazon Prime series. After a teacher is caught abusing his female pupils, a young protestor goes missing.

We Are Not Alone is a song about the importance of standing together. How many disappeared? How many were swallowed by the earth? Life kills us, the press bleeds out. We scream justice when we are silenced.

""The thing that was important to me was the empowerment of
other women, I followed their example and just went for it."" She told her fiancÃ© to leave after he wouldnât let her sing. ""My father always said to me, âtalent has no gender, so go

She has been on tour with acts such as MIA and Thievery Corporation. ""We as musicians have the power to score the emotions of our time.

Harley Watson was struck by a car which ploughed into children outside Debden Park High School in Loughton, Essex, on 2 December 2019. Terence Glover, 51, pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility. He also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of 23-year-old Raquel Jimeno, and six boys and three girls aged between 12 and 16 who cannot be named.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third over lockdown, according to a major study. Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements - but, despite this progress, cases remained relatively high across England. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the data showed the country could not ""take our foot off the pedal just yet"". The findings by Imperial College London were based on swabbing more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November. TheReact-1 study,externalis highly respected and gives us the most up-to-date picture of Covid-19 in the country. Its researchers estimatedthe virus's reproduction (R) ratehad fallen to 0.88. That means on average every infection translated to less than one other new infection, so the epidemic is shrinking. This video can not be played Covid symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate for? Run alongside pollster Ipsos MORI, the Imperial study involved testing a random sample of people for coronavirus, whether or not they had symptoms. The results of these tests suggested a 30% fall in infections between the last study and the period of 13-24 November. Before that, cases were accelerating - doubling every nine days when the study last reported at the end of October. Now cases are coming down, but more slowly than they shot up - halving roughly every 37 days. PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers UK R number below 1 for first time since August Has England's lockdown worked? In the North West and North East, though - regions with some of the highest numbers of cases - infections fell by more than half. The findings suggest cases are now highest in the East Midlands and West Midlands. Lockdown came into force across England on 5 November but national data, based on people with symptoms, suggests there was a spike in cases in the week after. This was put down to pre-lockdown socialising, since it takes five days on average after catching the infection for it to be detectable by a test. R was last below 1 on the 14 August Despite clear improvements, overall cases remain high. An estimated one in 100 people have coronavirus - double the rate in September when infections began to rise. The study also found certain groups had a higher chance of testing positive over this period: People of Asian ethnicity People living in the most deprived neighbourhoods People living in the largest households It estimated that: Roughly 96 people in every 10,000 had coronavirus, down from 132 per 10,000 just before lockdown There were about 72,000 new infections a day, compared with 100,000 at the end of October Prof Paul Elliott, who leads the study, said the data offered ""encouraging signs"" for England's epidemic. ""These trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in [the worst-affected areas] and that lockdown has added to this effect. But he said: ""As we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was important to continue to pay attention to public-health messaging, as cases remained high. ""It's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control,"" he added. Prof Kevin McConway, a statistics professor at the Open University, urged caution over the figures. He said: ""Things have started moving in the right direction again, but we're by no means in the position we were at the end of the summer, or even the start of the summer.  We can't stop taking great care yet by any means."" The government suggestedEngland's new tier system, coming into force on Wednesday, would be ""crucial"" to keeping infections falling. The three-tier system is tougher than the similar one in place before 5 November, under which cases continued to rise. It will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. Elsewhere in the UK,Northern Ireland has beguna two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has beenplaced in one of five tiers. In Wales,First Minister Mark Drakeford saidpubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. These findings of the React-1 study are interim, meaning they still need to be reviewed.

This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home.

"This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: The three women who founded a global movement The year 2020 will be remembered for a lot of things - not least the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement around the world. The organisation has led huge street rallies and high-profile campaigns against racism and police brutality. Now the three women who founded the movement have told the BBC they believe it has transformed politics. ""Black people alongside our allies stood up to change the course of history and we won,"" said Alicia Garza. Garza and her BLM co-founders, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, spoke as part of the BBC 100 Women Masterclass 2020, a digital live event of masterclasses, big interviews and guests on 30 November. BBC 100 Women 2020 - Join us for the BBC 100 Women Masterclasses The trio started the Black Lives Matter movement in the US in 2013 after the not guilty verdict against George Zimmerman, who shot dead unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. Protests erupted again this year after the killing of George Floyd, who died in May after a police officer knelt on his neck during his arrest in Minneapolis. ""Black Lives Matter, after seven years, is now really in the DNA and the muscle memory of this country,"" said Garza. ""We all have watched how our community members, our family members, are being murdered on camera. ""There are so many ways in which, even as this movement was exploding for the second time, major news outlets continue to focus on the wrong thing. 2016 also saw a wave of Black Lives Matter demonstrations over the killings of black men by police officers ""Over and over again, the burden and responsibility for violence gets placed at our feet, but nobody talks about the violence that our communities are experiencing both at the hands of government neglect, but also at the hands of police officers. ""Now we have a new element which is vigilante and white supremacist violence."" Despite the ongoing struggle, the founders of BLM struck a cautiously optimistic note, especially when speaking about the defeat of Donald Trump in the US election. Black women in particular have been credited for playing a major role in President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The BLM trio welcomed the acknowledgement of this by Kamala Harris, who has made history as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president-elect. But they said they would lobby for her to be not just a ""symbol but a fighter for our communities"". ""I'm heartened by seeing the ways in which the BLM movement but also a number of other movements have risen to the occasion and have brought forward political thought and action that really reflects the best of who we are,"" said Opal Tometi. ""I think our movements are showing a whole other way is possible and I'm very moved and grateful to be alive for a time such as this."" BLM protests have spanned the generations Describing how its role has changed this year, Garza said BLM was increasingly making connection across the world, including elevating the #EndSars protests against police violence in Nigeria. ""We are transforming politics as we know it but we are very focused on transforming power, the way that it operates, and making sure there is more power in the hands of more people,"" she said. How BLM went from Facebook post to global movement Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Patrisse Cullors said the achievements of BLM in 2020 would go down in the history books.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Officers seized 70 shisha pipes from the venue in Sheffield city centre on Friday night A Sheffield shisha bar which breached Covid-19 regulations has been fined Â£2,000 and had 70 pipes seized. Officers found 20 people inside the venue on the Wicker on Friday, with Â£200 fixed penalty notices handed out to all inside. South Yorkshire Police said it had received numerous reports about the bar breaching rules. Both police and the council had made previous visits to the business advising it of the regulations. South Yorkshire Police said the building, formerly used as shop called the Furniture Factory, had 20 people inside Insp John Mallows, from the force's city centre neighbourhood team, said: ""We want the public to know that police and local authorities will take action to address Covid-19 breaches and the warrant is one example of our partnership working to tackle repeated issues.

"This video can not be played ""My partner had to leave 20 minutes after I gave birth"" New Covid guidance for hospitals could see more patients receiving face-to-face visits from loved ones. NHS Wales has given health boards and hospices flexibility to allow visits based on local levels of Covid-19. Until now accompanying people to medical appointments and hospital visits have not been allowed,with a few  exceptions.,external It also allows for pregnant women in low Covid rate areas to take their partners to maternity appointments. The Welsh Government said the new flexibility was ""due to the changing picture of coronavirus transmission across Wales, with significant variations in community transmission across different parts of the country and differences in the rate of nosocomial transmission"". Pregnant women 'opt for C-section' to ensure partners at birth Pregnancy in a pandemic adds a 'lot of stress' 'Outbreak added more anxiety' Room sizes, the ability to social distance and infection prevention and control will all be considered when considering visits to maternity wards. Chief nursing officer for Wales, Jean White, said for women in very low areas of transmission ""it would almost be like it was before Covid"". Angharad Phillips from Cardiff was on a maternity ward waiting to give birth to her first child as the first lockdown in Wales was announced in March. ""I just remember lots of women breaking down and crying quite loudly and wailing,"" she said. Angharad Phillips and partner Gareth with baby Eli Gwen The mum of eight month old Eli Gwen considers herself lucky to have had partner Gareth present at the birth but said it was both emotionally and physically difficult when he had to leave 20 minutes after she came out of surgery. ""I had an epidural and so I was immobile and having to pick baby up, shuffle to the edge of the bed, pick her up for feeding and changing when I was struggling already myself,"" she said. The 37-year-old, who discharged herself after three days on the ward, said leaving was also surreal. ""It was very much like a chemical warzone. I remember being escorted down off the ward and my partner waiting outside...we looked at each other through the glass,"" she said. ""I remember thinking this is really bizarre and emotional, I just wanted to run and hug him."" She said she was hugely relieved to learn there will be more flexibility for other families so they can ""go through that special moment together"". New mother Angharad Phillips says she is hugely relieved there will be more flexibility for other families Ms White said the most noticeable changes would be to maternity services. ""So for a very high risk (area) you may say the woman would only have support during childbirth and the very limited amount of contact with partner in the various stages,"" she said. ""In a very low area you would almost be like it was before Covid, you would have partner at most appointments and they would be able to stay longer...and allow more visiting and interaction."" In other health areas, Ms White said the biggest change was the introduction of essential support assistants. ""If you're coming into hospital for appointments or you're going to be an inpatient, you can have somebody with you, whether that's because you have difficulty understanding information if you need an interpreter, or if you actually need some psychological support for you to cope, you're able to nominate that person. ""It could be a family member."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he recognised that the restrictions on visiting has a huge impact on patients, their families and loved ones. ""It is important to remember that the virus has not gone away and the health, safety and wellbeing of patients, communities and NHS staff remain an absolute priority for both the Welsh Government and health care providers,"" he added. The director of the Welsh NHS Confederation Darren Hughes said it was ""only right that we have the flexibility based on local circumstances in terms of visitors to hospitals where it is safe to do so"". Eli Gwen's father had to leave the hospital shortly after she was born He added: ""This change gives our members the opportunity to take sensible, evidence-based precautions where necessary and it will also be a boost to patients and families who are desperate to support their loved ones."" Nadia Higson, from the maternity charity AIMS, said any relaxation was going to be ""very welcome"". ""We've had a lot of calls and a lot of emails from people feeling extremely stressed about the fact that they are having to attend appointments on their own,"" she said. ""And the kind of situations [they discuss] are potentially going along and hearing bad news about their baby, potentially hearing that the sonographer can't hear the baby's heartbeat."" She added: ""The more that partners are able to be involved to be supporting the women, and be involved themselves in the pregnancy, that can only be good."" Angharad Phillips, with baby Eli Gwen, missed her partner who had to leave 20 minutes after the birth Care home visitors to get 20-minute Covid-19 test Mums 'opting for C-section' due to Covid rules At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Apprentices miss out as pandemic cuts work Wales is potentially facing levels of unemployment not seen since the recession of the early 1990s, according to new modelling. Research commissioned by the BBC suggests the number of long-term jobless could rise to about 44,000 people. That would be a four-fold increase on the current number. The Welsh Government said investment was needed to soften the blow, but tough times lie ahead. While the rate of unemployment is broadly similar in Wales and England, unemployment in Wales has risen at double the rate across the border since the beginning of 2020. There has been a 41% increase in Wales compared to just 18% in England - meaning an estimated additional 20,000 people are looking for work in Wales. And despite recent good news about vaccines and a possible end to lockdowns in the New Year, experts say there could be worse to come. David Hagendyk, director of the Learning and Work Institute in Wales, has been modelling how the country's unemployment figures could look. For the long-term unemployed, the picture is bleak. Currently, there are 11,000 people in that category in Wales, but Mr Hagendyk said that figure could rise steeply. ""Our modelling shows that could go up and be between 29,000 or 67,000 people being long-term unemployed. ""That gives us a mid-range of about 44,000. ""It blows out of the water the 2008 financial crisis in terms of long-term unemployment numbers. ""It takes us back to the early 1990s and the kind of recession we had then."" Christmas Covid warning Loan claims disputed Mr Hagendyk said that, while the numbers were eye-catching, it was important to remember the human stories behind them. ""These are real people with real jobs, real families and we know there is a long-term scarring impact. ""It's absolutely critical that the government acts quickly in order to stop this kind of modelling potential that we might see."" David Hagendyk says government action is needed now to avoid huge rises in the long-term unemployed number in Wales James Aubrey said he wanted to be a pilot for as long as he could remember, tailoring his exams and work experience to that goal. He had to fund a two-year training course - borrowing Â£100,000 which he has to pay back over the next decade. That shouldn't have been a problem for the 22-year-old from Cardiff, but the aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. James Aubrey borrowed Â£100,000 to train as a pilot ""The starting salaries most airlines were offering was about Â£40,000 which meant there was enough to pay off the loan and be able to live as well,"" said James. But pilots are being laid off rather than being recruited, so James has decided to look for a job in retail - where he worked before his training - to ensure he has an income in the short-term. ""The loan is bonded to my parents' house,"" he said. ""So it means there's an added extra bit of pressure on top just to meet those repayments, just to make sure it doesn't affect my family as well as me."" Though still determined to work as a pilot, James is concerned it could take him far longer than planned to get back into aviation. The Welsh Government said it had allocated more than Â£1bn to support businesses and protect jobs during the pandemic. Despite this, unemployment is rising faster in Wales than in England. Mr Hagendyk said the underlying reasons for that lie in the way some sectors employ more people in Wales. ""Our research has shown that about one in five workers here in Wales are working in shutdown sectors - the parts of the economy that have been most affected by the first lockdown,"" he said. ""These are companies in hospitality and tourism, aviation and high street retail - that's about a quarter of a million workers here in Wales."" Because so many people work in these vulnerable sectors, it does not bode well for the future, said Mr Hagendyk. ""They're more likely to be letting people go, making redundancies,"" he said. ""They're also most likely not to be hiring new people."" Pub manager Heidi Bakewell had taken on and trained new staff Across Wales the hospitality sector has been amongst the hardest hit - takings have plummeted for hotels, pubs and restaurants. On the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd, the Bryncynan pub began the year by spending Â£1m on a refit. The pub's manager Heidi Bakewell was forecast to take a similar amount in revenue over the year but in reality the pub has taken about a quarter. Heidi had also taken on and trained new staff, with some facing losing their jobs because restrictions and lockdowns meant the pub couldn't trade normally. ""I haven't slept the last couple of nights just through thinking, what are we going to do? ""Do we share the hours out, so they all get a few hours? It doesn't really work then because it's not enough for them to live on. ""We've still got three chefs. I think we've got 11 out-front staff still. ""Those numbers will probably go, I would say, to two chefs at the very most and we'll probably cut our front staff, maybe down to five."" It's been a challenging year for Emma and Rez Jamal who run Kookoo Madame When Pontypridd fashion boutique Kookoo Madame reopened in September, people queued down the street for the few jobs on offer. Among the hopefuls hoping to land a shop floor job were senior managers, people with degrees and those who were qualified but couldn't get into their chosen industries. For owners Emma and Rez Jamal, 2020 has thrown up many obstacles. First they were flooded out by Storm Dennis, and as they recovered from that, the first lockdown came. To save their business, they moved to a new premises and had to choose between paying for the move or topping up staff wages when furlough ended. ""We had to make some redundancies, which was a really tough decision to make,"" said Emma. ""They were our staff who'd been with us for quite some time. ""It was awful, absolutely awful. I wouldn't want to go through it again."" Although they were able to open in September, the firebreak meant they had to shut again. ""Everybody's scared, everybody's worried, nobody knows what's round the corner,"" said Emma. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates has called for ""jobs, jobs and more jobs"" Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said the way to combat the testing times to come was to invest in ""jobs, jobs and more jobs"". He said: ""We've a proven track record in investing in people and supporting people through the most difficult economic times. ""We are confident that we have got plans, policies and schemes in place to prevent the devastating long-term scars that mass, long-term unemployment can inflict on our country."" But Mr Skates admitted none of the forecasts he had seen had been ""rosy"". ""There is no forecast that suggests we will come out of this incredibly rapidly and are going to instantly bounce back,"" he said. Many people across Wales face the prospect of having to learn a new profession as jobs dwindle. Mr Hagendyk said to train even half the number of people who could end up long-term unemployed would be hugely expensive, possibly costing as much as Â£218m. ""This is investment above and beyond what we have already seen going into schools and colleges, so this is new money,"" he said. ""We have seen the Welsh Government expand training college places and apprenticeships to try to offset some of this challenge. ""But I think at the moment the scale of the response is not sufficient to meet the scale of the challenge."" The Welsh Government said it would need additional funding from Westminster to help with retraining. Additional funding to support skills has been announced by the UK government for England, and Wales will receive a consequential through the Barnett formula. However, there are fears that this funding alone will fall far short of what might be needed.

"Sir Philip Green and Jane Shepherdson, former director of Topshop, pictured in 2006 Sir Philip Green's failure to invest in his retail empire Arcadia has made its downfall ""inevitable"", a former boss of its best-known brand Topshop has said. Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is facing collapse putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Jane Shepherdson CBE, credited with turning Topshop into a global brand, said she expected an online retailer to buy the brand and close most stores. Arcadia had been seeking extra cash following lost sales amid the pandemic. But Ms Shepherdson, who ran Topshop until 2006, said that its problems went back much further than the coronavirus outbreak. She told the BBC's World at One programme that Sir Philip had ignored the rise of online shopping, and was now lumbered with a large and expensive store estate which was largely shut due to Covid. ""In addition to that I think the fact that he absolutely declined to invest all of the businesses [in Arcadia] means it was pretty much inevitable [it would fail]."" Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was How high could unemployment go? She said the ""most likely scenario"" for Topshop was that an online retailer would buy the brand, add it to their own portfolio and close most of the stores. ""It's incredibly sadâ¦ the worst thing is for all of the store staff, which are mostly women who are going to be unemployed. ""The supply chains are also going to take a massive hit. I imagine that orders will start to be cancelled very, very shortly."" Ms Shepherdson also accused Sir Philip of being a bully when she worked for him, adding that he used ""to shout at people all the time, he was disrespectful, dismissive, rude"". ""The reason I left was I spent five years keeping him at arm's length from what I considered to be my business, Topshop, and I realised at that point that I couldn't keep him at arm's length any longer and I would actually have to work with him if I stayed and I absolutely didn't want to do that."" The BBC has asked Sir Philip for a comment. Arcadia is a sprawling retail business that owns a chunk of the High Street's fashion brands, including Miss Selfridge, Topman, Wallis and Evans. Questions over the future of Sir Philip's retail empire were raised on Friday, after it emerged that talks with potential lenders for a Â£30m loan had failed. Arcadia was seeking extra cash as coronavirus had caused ""a material impact on trading"" across its businesses, it said. It now needs a breathing space from its creditors and, to gain that, is expected to file for administration. Administration gives a business protection from its creditors while it is put back on an even keel, or while parts or all of it are sold off. It needs the court to grant the appointment of specialist insolvency practitioners, who then look at the best way of raising money to repay its debts, keeping the business or parts of the business going if possible. The process can take up to a year. Even before coronavirus, Arcadia's best-known names were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Former City minister and once chairman of Marks and Spencer, Paul Myners, told the BBC: ""Covid has obviously been a significant factor but the truth is this group of brands has been haemorrhaging now for 15 years. It's become an insignificance. ""Sir Philip never really accepted the opportunity or challenge of online trading. He made no investment in that area at all."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List On Sunday, a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack: ""We tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" The whole retail sector is under pressure. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Sir Philip bought Arcadia Group in 2002. His wife, Lady Cristina Green, is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. In a colourful career, Sir Philip has been both lauded as the ""King of the High Street"" and branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". Read more about the businessman's journey here Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund which has 10,000 members. On Sunday, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Stephen Timms, called on the Green family to plug the gap. ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" the Labour MP said, adding he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip used his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme received their full pension. But he said that even if he did not provide a full top up, Arcadia workers should still receive the majority of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. Sir Philip sold BHS for Â£1 in 2015, a year before it went bust with a Â£571m pension deficit Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell wasrecently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. The collapse of Arcadia could affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans at the department store group JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". Some stores could close, but Arcadia's brands are household names, and are likely to survive in some form. Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of its big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it hasbought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. Arcadia's 13,000 workers face an anxious wait. One told the BBC: ""I'm really worried about what is going to happen to us, especially as it is so close to Christmas. ""It's already been a very tough time, I'm in a role where I can work from home, but I'm not relying on anything being there for me - I've started applying for other jobs."" Holders of vouchers and gift cards with the various Arcadia brands also face uncertainty - with the risk that these cards will become worthless. Administrators and any future owners will decide whether they will be accepted. If the brand folds, then cardholders are owed the money, but are a long way down on the priority list of creditors who need to be paid back after assets are sold. The BBC's business correspondent, Dominic O'Connell, says as with many other clothing retailers struggling with the pandemic shutdown, insolvency looks the only option. But, he says, two questions remain: Can the individual businesses find new owners to take them on, and what amount of public pressure will there be on the Greens to make good any shortfall in the Arcadia pension schemes?

"Moderna is filing for US and European emergency regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use. Regulators will look at trial data for the mRNA vaccine and decide if it is safe and effective enough to recommend for roll out. Clinical studies show the jab is more than 94% effective at protecting people from becoming ill with Covid-19. Pfizer, which has a similar jab, has already filed for the same US approval. UK regulators are also reviewing data on the Pfizer vaccine, as well as another type of Covid vaccine fromAstraZenca and Oxford Universityfor emergency approval. Moderna says it hopes to gain UK approval soon, now that it has trial data from 30,000 volunteers - including high risk groups like the elderly - that suggests it works. In those studies, 15,000 people received the real vaccine while the other participants got placebo injections. No serious side effects were reported. During the studies, 185 people in the placebo group fell ill with Covid-19, and some severely so. In comparison, there were 11 cases in the vaccine group and none were severe. Full trial data has not been released, but will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? The three front-runner vaccines have different pros and cons. The AstraZeneca jab is cheaper - around Â£3 ($4) for a dose, compared to around Â£15 ($20) for the Pfizer vaccine and Â£25 ($33) for Moderna's. And it is potentially easier to distribute because it does not need to be stored under ultra-low temperatures. But its efficacy in trials - between 62% and 90% - is a bit lower than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Russian Covid vaccine shows encouraging results The UK has already pre-ordered doses of all three vaccines: 7m of the Moderna jab 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech one 100m of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: ""This is great news indeed - the more trial data that we have, the greater confidence we have that vaccines can be used to blunt the human cost of Covid-19. ""As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public."" Meanwhile, the UK's new minister responsible for vaccine rollout, Nadhim Zahawi, said vaccination would not be compulsory, but that society might expect people to get immunised. He told BBC's World At One: ""I think the very strong message that you will see, this is the way we return the whole country, and so it's good for your family, it's good for your community, it's good for your country to be vaccinated.

"Sir Philip Green and Jane Shepherdson, former director of Topshop, pictured in 2006 Sir Philip Green's failure to invest in his retail empire Arcadia has made its downfall ""inevitable"", a former boss of its best-known brand Topshop has said. Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is facing collapse putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Jane Shepherdson CBE, credited with turning Topshop into a global brand, said she expected an online retailer to buy the brand and close most stores. Arcadia had been seeking extra cash following lost sales amid the pandemic. But Ms Shepherdson, who ran Topshop until 2006, said that its problems went back much further than the coronavirus outbreak. She told the BBC's World at One programme that Sir Philip had ignored the rise of online shopping, and was now lumbered with a large and expensive store estate which was largely shut due to Covid. ""In addition to that I think the fact that he absolutely declined to invest all of the businesses [in Arcadia] means it was pretty much inevitable [it would fail]."" Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was How high could unemployment go? She said the ""most likely scenario"" for Topshop was that an online retailer would buy the brand, add it to their own portfolio and close most of the stores. ""It's incredibly sadâ¦ the worst thing is for all of the store staff, which are mostly women who are going to be unemployed. ""The supply chains are also going to take a massive hit. I imagine that orders will start to be cancelled very, very shortly."" Ms Shepherdson also accused Sir Philip of being a bully when she worked for him, adding that he used ""to shout at people all the time, he was disrespectful, dismissive, rude"". ""The reason I left was I spent five years keeping him at arm's length from what I considered to be my business, Topshop, and I realised at that point that I couldn't keep him at arm's length any longer and I would actually have to work with him if I stayed and I absolutely didn't want to do that."" The BBC has asked Sir Philip for a comment. Arcadia is a sprawling retail business that owns a chunk of the High Street's fashion brands, including Miss Selfridge, Topman, Wallis and Evans. Questions over the future of Sir Philip's retail empire were raised on Friday, after it emerged that talks with potential lenders for a Â£30m loan had failed. Arcadia was seeking extra cash as coronavirus had caused ""a material impact on trading"" across its businesses, it said. It now needs a breathing space from its creditors and, to gain that, is expected to file for administration. Administration gives a business protection from its creditors while it is put back on an even keel, or while parts or all of it are sold off. It needs the court to grant the appointment of specialist insolvency practitioners, who then look at the best way of raising money to repay its debts, keeping the business or parts of the business going if possible. The process can take up to a year. Even before coronavirus, Arcadia's best-known names were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Former City minister and once chairman of Marks and Spencer, Paul Myners, told the BBC: ""Covid has obviously been a significant factor but the truth is this group of brands has been haemorrhaging now for 15 years. It's become an insignificance. ""Sir Philip never really accepted the opportunity or challenge of online trading. He made no investment in that area at all."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List On Sunday, a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack: ""We tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" The whole retail sector is under pressure.

"Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said. Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalRobert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"". Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added. Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules. The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday. Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business. The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday. ""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote. ""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport."" Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day. Retail giant Arcadia faces collapse within hours Black Friday comes early for shoppers this year The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times. But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"". ""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC. ""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions. But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains. Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently thatit was cutting 3,500 jobswith the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters. In August, M&S announced it was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"This video can not be played Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was buried in Tehran following his assassination on Friday Iran believes Israel and an exiled opposition group used a remote-control weapon to shoot dead top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on Friday. Security chief Ali Shamkhani said the attackers had ""used electronic equipment"" when Fakhrizadeh's car was fired on east of the capital Tehran. He was speaking at the funeral of the scientist Israel accused of secretly helping to develop nuclear weapons. Israel has not publicly commented on the allegations of its involvement. What were the motives behind the killing? After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words In the early 2000s, Fakhrizadeh played a crucial role in Iran's nuclear programme but the government insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful. It has been subjected to crippling Western sanctions aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons. Iranian versions of what happened have changed significantly but it appears that Fakhrizadeh was mortally wounded when his car was sprayed with bullets in the town of Absard, to the east of Tehran. During the attack a bomb in a Nissan pickup truck is also reported to have exploded. Pictures on social media show a road strewn with wreckage and blood, and a bullet-riddled vehicle. First the defence ministry reported a gunfight between Fakhrizadeh's bodyguards and several gunmen. One Iranian report quoted witnesses as saying ""three to four individuals, who are said to have been terrorists, were killed"". Then Iranian media said the scientist had in fact been killed by a ""remote-controlled machine gun"" or weapons ""controlled by satellite"". And on Monday, Rear Admiral Shamkhani, who heads the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed it had been a remote attack, using ""special methods"". This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh ""It was a very complex mission using electronic equipment,"" he said at the funeral. ""There was no-one present at the scene."" He said Iranian intelligence and security services had been aware of a plot to assassinate Fakhrizadeh, and had even predicted where the attack might take place. On who was to blame, he singled out exiled Iranian opposition group the Mujahideen-e Khalq and Israel. Who are the Mujahideen-e Khalq? Israel's Intelligence Minister, Eli Cohen, said on Monday in an interview with a radio station that he did not know who was behind the killing. However, an unnamed senior Israeli official involved in tracking Iranian nuclear activities wasquoted by the New York Times as saying,externalthat ""Iran's aspirations for nuclear weapons, promoted by Mr Fakhrizadeh, posed such a menace that the world should thank Israel"". Machine guns and other remotely controlled ground weapons are now widely used across the Middle East,external, according to a report by Forbes. They are employed both by professional armies, such as those mounted on combat vehicles, but also by militants who are known to have put them in vehicles or stationary posts. Iran's conflicting versions of how its top nuclear scientist was ambushed and killed appear to contradict each other. The initial account spoke of a dozen armed assailants opening fire on the scientist's convoy and exchanging shots with his bodyguards. The later version, involving both a remote-controlled vehicle and even more bizarrely, a remote-controlled gun, sounds less plausible, although not impossible. The only way an assassination squad could make sure they had finished the job would be to have eyes on the target. If the earlier version were true then Iran's powerful security and intelligence establishment would face the embarrassing challenge of having to hunt down a large team of assassins just a short drive from the capital. One thing is clear though: this has been a massive failure of counter-intelligence for Iran's security chiefs and some hard questions are now being asked. Fakhrizadeh's funeral was held at the defence ministry in Tehran after which his remains were transferred to a cemetery in the north of the capital. General Amir Hatami said Iran would continue the path of the ""martyr doctor"" State television showed the flag-draped coffin being carried by troops, and senior officials - including Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, Revolutionary Guards commander Gen Hossein Salami and nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi - paying their respects. In his own speech at the funeral, Defence Minister General Amir Hatami reiterated Iran's determination to avenge Fakhrizadeh's killing. ""The enemies know, and I as a soldier tell them, that no crime, no terror and no stupid act will go unanswered by the Iranian people,"" he said. As head of Iran's Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, known by its Persian acronym SPND, Fakhrizadeh had carried out ""considerable work"" in the area of ""nuclear defence"", the general said. The government would double the SPND's budget in order to continue the path of the ""martyr doctor"" with ""more speed and more power"", he added. Iranian mediaare focusing on projecting two main messages - the threat of revenge for the scientist's killing, and a warning that Iran should not ""fall into the trap"" of what they say are Israel's attempts to escalate tensions over the Iranian nuclear programme. Israeli mediaare highlighting the timing of the attack, with analysts interpreting this as a signal to US President-elect Joe Biden that Israel ""won't go quietly"" if he seeks to rejoin the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. There is also much speculation about possible Iranian retaliation. Saudi mediaare reporting the assassination prominently and with interest, given the kingdom's opposition to its regional rival's nuclear programme. A cartoon in the Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper appears to mock the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' capabilities. Al Arabiya TV's website meanwhile asks: ""Will Fakhrizadeh's assassination affect Biden's approach to Iran?"" Israeli and Western security sources say Fakhrizadeh was instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. The physics professor is said to have led ""Project Amad"", a covert programme that Iran allegedly established in 1989 to carry out research on a potential nuclear bomb. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive The project was shut down in 2003, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency,  though Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said in 2018 that documents obtained by his country showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme that was secretly continuing Project Amad's work. In a presentation, Mr Netanyahu urged people to ""remember that name"". Iran has previously accused Israel of assassinating four other Iranian nuclear scientists between 2010 and 2012. Analysts have speculated that the latest assassination was not meant to cripple the Iranian nuclear programme but rather to put an end to the prospect of the US rejoining the 2015 Iran nuclear deal when President-elect Joe Biden takes office next year. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, saying it was ""defective at its core"", and reinstated US sanctions in an attempt to force Iran's leaders to negotiate a replacement. Iran has refused to do so and retaliated by breaching a number of key commitments, such as increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium. Enriched uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors but also potentially nuclear bombs.

"PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks when he was killed The driver of a car which dragged PC Andrew Harper to his death should be given a life sentence, the attorney general has told the Court of Appeal. Suella Braverman QC said PC Harper paid the ""ultimate price for his bravery"" when he was killed on duty in Berkshire in August 2019. The driver, Henry Long, was jailed for 16 years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were both sentenced to 13 years each. Mrs Braverman has argued the teenagers' sentences were ""unduly lenient"". Long, Bowers and Cole were all cleared of murder following a trial at the Old Bailey, but were convicted of manslaughter. Addressing judges at the Court of Appeal, Mrs Braverman said the bravery of PC Harper should be ""reflected"" in the sentence of 19-year-old Long. Referring to his sentence, Mrs Braverman said: ""A life sentence was the appropriate sentence for the first offender, who was and remains dangerous... if not in a case such as this, then when?"" She told Dame Victoria Sharp, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mr Justice William Davis that Long's jail term did not reflect ""the seriousness of the offence"" and was ""contrary to the interests of justice"". Mrs Braverman also argued that the sentencing judge ""accorded too great a reduction"" to Bowers' and Cole's sentences ""for their age and learning difficulties"". Jessie Cole (l) and Albert Bowers (r) were convicted along with Henry Long (centre) in July In written submissions, Mrs Braverman said the sentences had ""caused and continue to cause widespread public concern"". ""It appears to me that the sentences passed on the offenders were unduly lenient."" She told the court the judge ""correctly observed this was a very serious case of manslaughter"" and was ""a case of manslaughter very close to murder in its seriousness"". PC Harper, 28, died from catastrophic injuries after he was dragged behind a getaway car for more than a mile. He got caught in a strap attached to the back of a car driven by Long as he tried to apprehend the teenagers suspected of stealing a quad bike. The last picture of Mr and Mrs Harper was taken four days before the officer died The unduly lenient sentence (ULS) scheme allows people to ask law officers to review sentences for certain crimes that they believe are too low. It requires only one complaint for the attorney general's office to consider whether to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal. In response to Mrs Braverman's argument, Rossano Scamardella QC, representing Long, said the attorney general's comments about ""widespread public concern"" should have ""no influence on the issue of whether this sentence ought to be adjusted one way or the other"". He said PC Harper's death was the result of ""a freakish accident"" and said ""there was no intentional application of force or violence... there was no intent whatsoever to cause serious bodily harm or death"". Mr Scamardella said there was public concern expressed following the acquittals for murder and that the ""narrative became that no jury would possibly"" have cleared them unless there was some sort of ""tampering"". Timothy Raggatt QC, representing Bowers, said the idea the sentences were unduly lenient was ""to be blunt, far-fetched in the extreme"". Lawyers representing Long, Bowers and Cole are also applying for permission to appeal against the length of their sentences, arguing that they were ""manifestly excessive"". Mr Scamardella told the court Long's sentence was excessive due to the trial judge, Mr Justice Edis, adopting ""too high a starting point"" and failing to give Long ""full credit"" for his guilty plea. He also said his client had been ""wrongly"" deemed dangerous. Long, Bowers and Cole appeared at the hearing by video link from HMP Belmarsh. PC Harper, 28, from Wallingford, Oxfordshire, had been married for only four weeks to his wife Lissie when he died. Lissie Harper spoke to the media outside the Royal Courts of Justice Following the hearing, PC Harper's widow Lissie, told reporters outside the Royal Courts of Justice the proceedings had been ""as harrowing as you can all expect"", but added she left the court ""with at least a sense of balance"". ""I feel pride in myself for not settling for something that I see as unacceptable,"" she said. Mrs Harper, 29, is campaigning for new legislation to be created known as Harper's Law, which proposes life sentences with mandatory minimum terms for an offenders ""guilty of killing an emergency services worker due to a criminal act... no ifs, no buts"". She said she had ""every respect"" for the attorney general for ""reaching the right decision in referring this case for review"". ""I know that the majority of our country stands with her and with me wanting change,"" she added. The judges said their decisions on the applications would be delivered at a later date.

"This video can not be played Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was buried in Tehran following his assassination on Friday Iran believes Israel and an exiled opposition group used a remote-control weapon to shoot dead top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on Friday. Security chief Ali Shamkhani said the attackers had ""used electronic equipment"" when Fakhrizadeh's car was fired on east of the capital Tehran. He was speaking at the funeral of the scientist Israel accused of secretly helping to develop nuclear weapons. Israel has not publicly commented on the allegations of its involvement. What were the motives behind the killing? After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words In the early 2000s, Fakhrizadeh played a crucial role in Iran's nuclear programme but the government insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful. It has been subjected to crippling Western sanctions aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons. Iranian versions of what happened have changed significantly but it appears that Fakhrizadeh was mortally wounded when his car was sprayed with bullets in the town of Absard, to the east of Tehran. During the attack a bomb in a Nissan pickup truck is also reported to have exploded. Pictures on social media show a road strewn with wreckage and blood, and a bullet-riddled vehicle. First the defence ministry reported a gunfight between Fakhrizadeh's bodyguards and several gunmen. One Iranian report quoted witnesses as saying ""three to four individuals, who are said to have been terrorists, were killed"". Then Iranian media said the scientist had in fact been killed by a ""remote-controlled machine gun"" or weapons ""controlled by satellite"". And on Monday, Rear Admiral Shamkhani, who heads the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed it had been a remote attack, using ""special methods"". This video can not be played The road near Tehran where gunmen opened fire on Mohsen Fakhrizadeh ""It was a very complex mission using electronic equipment,"" he said at the funeral. ""There was no-one present at the scene."" He said Iranian intelligence and security services had been aware of a plot to assassinate Fakhrizadeh, and had even predicted where the attack might take place. On who was to blame, he singled out exiled Iranian opposition group the Mujahideen-e Khalq and Israel. Who are the Mujahideen-e Khalq? Israel's Intelligence Minister, Eli Cohen, said on Monday in an interview with a radio station that he did not know who was behind the killing. However, an unnamed senior Israeli official involved in tracking Iranian nuclear activities wasquoted by the New York Times as saying,externalthat ""Iran's aspirations for nuclear weapons, promoted by Mr Fakhrizadeh, posed such a menace that the world should thank Israel"". Machine guns and other remotely controlled ground weapons are now widely used across the Middle East,external, according to a report by Forbes. They are employed both by professional armies, such as those mounted on combat vehicles, but also by militants who are known to have put them in vehicles or stationary posts. Iran's conflicting versions of how its top nuclear scientist was ambushed and killed appear to contradict each other. The initial account spoke of a dozen armed assailants opening fire on the scientist's convoy and exchanging shots with his bodyguards. The later version, involving both a remote-controlled vehicle and even more bizarrely, a remote-controlled gun, sounds less plausible, although not impossible. The only way an assassination squad could make sure they had finished the job would be to have eyes on the target. If the earlier version were true then Iran's powerful security and intelligence establishment would face the embarrassing challenge of having to hunt down a large team of assassins just a short drive from the capital. One thing is clear though: this has been a massive failure of counter-intelligence for Iran's security chiefs and some hard questions are now being asked. Fakhrizadeh's funeral was held at the defence ministry in Tehran after which his remains were transferred to a cemetery in the north of the capital. General Amir Hatami said Iran would continue the path of the ""martyr doctor"" State television showed the flag-draped coffin being carried by troops, and senior officials - including Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, Revolutionary Guards commander Gen Hossein Salami and nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi - paying their respects. In his own speech at the funeral, Defence Minister General Amir Hatami reiterated Iran's determination to avenge Fakhrizadeh's killing. ""The enemies know, and I as a soldier tell them, that no crime, no terror and no stupid act will go unanswered by the Iranian people,"" he said. As head of Iran's Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, known by its Persian acronym SPND, Fakhrizadeh had carried out ""considerable work"" in the area of ""nuclear defence"", the general said. The government would double the SPND's budget in order to continue the path of the ""martyr doctor"" with ""more speed and more power"", he added. Iranian mediaare focusing on projecting two main messages - the threat of revenge for the scientist's killing, and a warning that Iran should not ""fall into the trap"" of what they say are Israel's attempts to escalate tensions over the Iranian nuclear programme. Israeli mediaare highlighting the timing of the attack, with analysts interpreting this as a signal to US President-elect Joe Biden that Israel ""won't go quietly"" if he seeks to rejoin the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. There is also much speculation about possible Iranian retaliation. Saudi mediaare reporting the assassination prominently and with interest, given the kingdom's opposition to its regional rival's nuclear programme. A cartoon in the Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper appears to mock the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' capabilities. Al Arabiya TV's website meanwhile asks: ""Will Fakhrizadeh's assassination affect Biden's approach to Iran?"" Israeli and Western security sources say Fakhrizadeh was instrumental in Iran's nuclear programme. The physics professor is said to have led ""Project Amad"", a covert programme that Iran allegedly established in 1989 to carry out research on a potential nuclear bomb. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive The project was shut down in 2003, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency,  though Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said in 2018 that documents obtained by his country showed Fakhrizadeh led a programme that was secretly continuing Project Amad's work. In a presentation, Mr Netanyahu urged people to ""remember that name"". Iran has previously accused Israel of assassinating four other Iranian nuclear scientists between 2010 and 2012. Analysts have speculated that the latest assassination was not meant to cripple the Iranian nuclear programme but rather to put an end to the prospect of the US rejoining the 2015 Iran nuclear deal when President-elect Joe Biden takes office next year. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, saying it was ""defective at its core"", and reinstated US sanctions in an attempt to force Iran's leaders to negotiate a replacement. Iran has refused to do so and retaliated by breaching a number of key commitments, such as increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium. Enriched uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors but also potentially nuclear bombs.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will be banned from serving alcohol and will have to close at 18:00 starting on Friday Cinemas, bingo halls, museums and other indoor attractions will have to close completely from 18:00 on Friday New Covid guidance for hospitals could see more patients receiving face-to-face visits from loved ones Mass Covid testing of students begins at UK universities to ensure they can go home safely for Christmas Unemployment in Wales could rise to heights not seen in 30 years due to the pandemic, experts say Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts That brings our live coverage of today's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing and Public Health Wales update to a close. Here's a summary of the main points:  Thank you for joining us - there'll be continued coverage on the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good afternoon. There have been three new deaths involving coronavirus reported on Monday across Wales, taking the official total to 2,540. The latest deaths were reported in the Hywel Dda Health Board area of west Wales. A further three deaths involving coronavirus have been reported to Public Health Wales, taking the total in Wales to 2,540. It has also recorded another 802 cases, taking the total to 80,342. New rules in Wales from Friday will prevent the sale of alcohol in pubs, cafes and restaurants which will also have to close at 18:00 daily. Cinemas, bingo halls and other indoor entertainment will have to close completely from Friday. There's no decision yet on whether restrictions on travel to England will be lifted when the lockdown there ends on Wednesday. An outdoor festive lights showhas been cancelled after police and council officials said it breached coronavirus regulations, organisers say. The Fonmon Festive Lights Show had been due to get under way at Fonmon Castle, in the Vale of Glamorgan, on Friday. But just hours after organisers said it had been given the ""all clear"" from environmental health officials, it was cancelled. Organisers of the show saythe new regulations,externalwhich took effect after the firebreak lockdown ended prohibit outdoor events attended by more than 30 people over the age of 11 at any one time. Vale of Glamorgan Council has been asked to comment. The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK. Universities are opening temporary testing centreswhere hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave. Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December. But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities. The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"". The ""severe"" restrictions on selling alcohol and closing times have dealt a ""major blow"" to pubs and restaurants in Wales, a group representing them says. The Wales Independent Restaurant Collective said the measures - which see alcohol sales from licensed premises banned from Friday evening and pubs and cafes having to close from 18:00 - were hard to take after hard work to make hospitality venues safe amid constantly changing restrictions. Hospitality had ""borne the brunt of restrictions"" across the UK, the group said, despite proving venues could be safe with the right measures in place. Pub and restaurant owner Cerys Furlong said: âNot being able to serve alcohol and early closing means that trading will be a long way from viable for the majority of the sector, particularly in this Christmas period, which is crucial to the success or otherwise of most businesses in hospitality. ""However, we welcome the support funding from Welsh Government which we understand is intended to reflect more closely the scale of the challenges we face."" Cerys Furlong says trading will be 'a long way from viable' in the run-up to Christmas for many firms Plaid Cymruâs health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the Welsh Government should provide support to allow the hospitality and tourism industries to âhibernateâ for the winter. He said businesses ""need to be able to plan ahead"". ""The sensible thing for them to do now, knowing they have the support to do it, would be to say âletâs just put everything to one side for the time being, do what needs to be done to look after our staff, make sure our businesses are there for next year and hibernate'."" Mr ap Iorwerth said it was not good for businesses to âbounce from once lockdown to anotherâ. Wales will be ready to run a vaccine programme once it is approved after carrying out a ""large and successful test"" of practical matters that need to be in place, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford told a coronavirus briefing: ""That could be as early as this week and we will be ready for it."" He said there had been a ""terrific response"" to the mass-testing programme in Merthyr Tydfil, with more than 10,000 people tested in the first eight days. Care homes will begin using lateral-flow tests this week ""to help reunite families who have been separated for many months"", Mr Drakeford said. Advice will be published later aboutvisiting in hospitalsto offer hope that both parents can be ""more involved"" in their baby's antenatal care, he added. The Conservative leader in the Senedd said the nationwide ban on the sale of alcohol in pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales was unfair on areas with low Covid rates. Paul Davies said the move was âdisproportionateâ and heâd prefer to see âa much more regional approachâ. He was also concerned there would be more domestic alcohol consumption. âWith pubs and bars not selling alcohol, there is a danger that people will then drink at home and then perhaps mix even more than we are seeing at the moment,â he said. Chef Tom Simmons from Cardiff fears his restaurant's takings will be seriously hit by the instruction to close at 18:00 daily from Friday. He says evening trade accounts for more than 60% of his takings, which have already been hit by cutting the number of diners to ensure social distancing. Allow Twitter content?

The first minister says the system to ensure businesses in the hospitality sector in Wales can get the support they need will be ""as automatic as we can make it"". Firms affected will receive between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 in support through the new ""restrictions business fund"". Mark Drakeford told journalists: ""In terms of the help we'll be using the systems that we've used up until now. ""So the help you get on the basis of your rateable value will be as automatic as we can make it. ""As long as we know that you wanted it [support], the system is as automatic as we can manage."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was not changing the approach to selling alcohol in off-licences and supermarkets, but admitted it was a ""difficult conundrum"". Asked about the decision to stop the sale of alcohol in controlled hospitality settings but allowing it to be sold elsewhere - and potentially drunk in unregulated environments - the first minister said: ""The judgment was that if you made a 6pm cut-off [for shops] it wouldn't make any difference."" ""People would simply buy what they needed earlier in the day so it would have been an action without a consequence and, as a result, we decided not to take it."" The rule allowing people from four different households to meet in pubs and restaurants ""is essentially driven by our wish to make sure that our young people have a legal way of getting together"", according to the first minister. In Scotland,level three restrictions,externalmean pubs and restaurants cannot sell alcohol, must close at 6pm, but also that only six people from up to two separate households can meet in those venues. Asked at the Welsh Government's press conference why they have not also tightened the rules around the number of households, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""When you allow simply households to meet it really doesn't work for younger people. ""They can't meet their friends, they can't meet up with the people that they socialise with normally and I was very keen, and our cabinet was very keen, not to devise a system where the only way that people could meet up together was by going outside the rules."" Wales' first minister has said that the evidence ""is there"" for new restrictions on the hospitality sector - and could be seen from a series of reports from the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell. Mark Drakeford said: ""When people meet together in a hospitality setting, you're not just having a glancing encounter with somebody as you do if you're going round a supermarket."" And he added: ""You're sitting together with people for a significant period of time, and the evidence I'm afraid is just there."" The first minister said he hoped the latest measures would mean that when the restrictions are eased over the Christmas period ""the risk to one another and to our health service can be contained"". He said that when people get together for a significant period of time ""whether it's in our homes or in a hospitality setting, the virus thrives"". ""The cases rise and we end up with the position we see in Wales today,"" Mr Drakeford added. ""It's a matter of deep regret because of all the work the sector has done and the people who work in it."" The first minister told the coronavirus briefing there would be no change to the other restrictions in place across Wales at present. Mark Drakeford said: ""The rest
of the national measures will remain the same â there will be no changes to
household bubbles, how many people can meet in public indoor or outdoor places
or restrictions on other businesses. ""The
English lockdown will end as of Wednesday this week. In that context we are
looking at travel restrictions in and out of Wales and will make a further
announcement later this week."" First Minister Mark Drakeford say the Welsh Government will provide Â£340m to support businesses affected by the new Covid-19 restrictions, which include a ban on the sale of alcohol in pubs and the closure of indoor entertainment. He said this was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"". A Â£160m ""restrictions business fund"" would support up to 60,000 businesses on the non-domestic rating list across Wales. Mr Drakeford said: ""Businesses, including those in retail, tourism, leisure and hospitality, and their supply chains, which are materially affected by the restrictions will receive payments of between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000. ""Discretionary grants of up to Â£2,000 will continue to be available for those not on the non-domestic rating list. ""This fund will be delivered by local authorities. I am very grateful for their ongoing support and help to deliver this part of the package. ""The second element is a Â£180m fund targeted at hospitality, tourism and leisure businesses.

It will provide grants of up to Â£100,000 for SMEs and Â£150,000 for larger businesses. ""The grants will be linked to the number of people employed and their operating costs with up to 10,000 businesses being supported."" Cinemas will be one of the venue types affected Cinemas, bingo halls and other indoor entertainment will also have to close in Wales under new national restrictions coming into effect on Friday at 18:00. First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will have to close by 18:00 daily and will not be allowed to serve alcohol. After that time they will only be able to provide takeaway food. He added: âFrom the same date, indoor entertainment venues, including cinemas, bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades, must close."" Indoor visitor attractions, such as museums, galleries and heritage sites will also have to close. Outdoor visitor attractions will remain open. First Minister Mark Drakeford says there is a âstarkâ rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Wales. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs briefing, Mr Drakeford said the facts were âstarkâ and current modelling suggests an extra 1,600 people could lose their lives over the winter period. He said the all-Wales seven-day incidence rate was 187 cases per 100,000 people last week, but today that had risen to almost 210 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Drakeford said there had been further rises among the under-25 age group in 17 of the 22 council areas in Wales but âmore worryinglyâ he said cases of coronavirus were beginning to rise in the over-60 age group in most parts of the country.

"The beavers were released on to the Holnicote Estate in Exmoor at the end of January Beavers have built a dam on Exmoor for the first time in more than 400 years. The rodents were released into the wild in Somerset in January this yearas part of a National Trust projectto restore streams and reduce flooding. Beavers became extinct in the UK in the 16th Century due to hunting, buthave been successfully reintroduced at a handful of sitesin recent years. The trust said the dam ""might look modest, but [it] is incredibly special"" and had ""created an instant wetland"". Wildlife camera footage shows the beavers gnawing trees and collecting vegetation to build the dam at the Holnicote Estate near Minehead. Their construction can allow for deep pools of water which offer animals shelter from predators and a place to store food. Theycan also work as natural flood-defences, helping to reduce the risk of homes flooding downstream. Why 2020 has been good for England's beavers National Trust project manager Ben Eardley said: ""It might look modest, but this beaver dam is incredibly special - it's the first to appear on Exmoor for almost half a millennium and marks a step change in how we manage the landscape. ""What's amazing is that it's only been here a few weeks but has created an instant wetland. ""We've already spotted kingfishers at the site, and over time, as the beavers extend their network of dams and pools, we should see increased opportunities for other wildlife, including amphibians, insects, bats and birds."" The National Trust said the dam ""might look modest, but it is incredibly special"" The beavers were the first to be released into the wild by the trust in its 125-year history. Mr Eardley added: ""The recent rain we've had is a reminder of the significant role beavers can play in engineering the landscape. ""As we face into the effects of climate change and more frequent extreme weather events, natural interventions like this need to be part of the solution."" Beavers were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century for their meat, furry water-resistant pelts, and a substance they secrete called castoreum, used in food, medicine and perfume, but have been reintroduced in Britain since the 2000s. The Eurasian beavers were relocated to the Exmoor estate from wild populations on the River Tay in Scotland at the end of January, as part of the trust's Â£10m Riverlands project to ""bring UK rivers back to life"".

"This video can not be played Music producer Michel Zecler is seen being beaten up by officers in his studio A French judge has placed four police officers under criminal investigation over the beating of a black music producer at his studio in Paris earlier this month. Video of the white officers attacking producer Michel Zecler emerged last week, causing widespread outrage. The four suspects are facing charges of ""intentional violence by a person holding authority"", judicial sources told French media on Monday. Two have been remanded in custody. The decision to open a formal investigation comes amid growing concern over police violence in France. Macron 'shame' at police beating of black man On Saturday, protests were held across the country against a security bill that would restrict the right to film or take photos of police. In Parisdemonstrators clashed with officers. Opponents say the bill would make it difficult to document police brutality. Advocates say it will protect police from harassment. CCTV footage published by the news website Loopsider on Thursday shows Mr Zecler being kicked and punched for several minutes by three officers at his Paris studio on 21 November. A fourth is later seen throwing a tear gas canister into the building. The incident reportedly began with a dispute over whether the 41-year-old producer was wearing a face mask, as required during the Covid-19 pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Zecler, who needed stitches, says he was also racially abused during the attack. In addition to the ""intentional violence"" charge, all four officers are accused of forgery. That charge relates to the police report filed after the incident, which said ""a strong smell of cannabis"" had emanated from Mr Zecler and that he resisted a search. At the weekend, prosecutors said the officers had admitted that their violence against Mr Zecler was unjustified but said they acted out of panic after he resisted them in the cramped surroundings of the studio entrance. The prosecutors said three of the policemen should be remanded into custody to stop any attempt to co-ordinate their stories. But the judge said only two would remain in detention. This video can not be played Clashes erupted on Saturday as a Paris protest against the new security bill Stars of France's victorious World Cup football team are among a number of public figures who have expressed anger over the footage. President Emmanuel Macron described the incident as ""unacceptable"" and ""shameful"", demanding quick government proposals on how to rebuild trust between police and citizens. Separately, the government has ordered police to provide a full report after they violently dismantled a makeshift migrant camp in Paris last week, clashing with migrants and activists. Paris police in 'shocking' clash at migrant camp The legislation on ""global security"" was backed last week by the lower house of the French parliament, and is now awaiting senate approval. Article 24 makes it a criminal offence to publish images of on-duty police officers with the intent to harm their ""physical or psychological integrity"". Protesters in Paris hold slogans that read ""Journalists under arrest"" (left) and ""Smile, you're being filmed"" It says offenders could face up to a year in prison and be fined â¬45,000 (Â£40,500; $54,000). The government argues that the bill does not jeopardise the rights of the media and ordinary citizens to report police abuses, and is only aimed at giving protection to police officers. But opponents say that without such images, none of the incidents which took place over the past week would have come to light. In the face of growing public criticism, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Friday that Article 24 would be amended. CCTV shows Paris police beating black man.

"England's countryside will radically change after the Brexit transition period, the government has confirmed. There will be more trees, meadows and wetlands - and fewer sheep and cows as controversial EU farm subsidies are phased out. Ministers say it represents the most fundamental shift in farming policy for 50 years. Under the outgoing EU system, farmers got taxpayers' money based on the amount of land they farm. So in many cases, that has meant the richer the farmers, the bigger the grant they get. This scheme will be replaced in the UK when the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The new system, named Environmental Land Management (ELM), will pay farmers if they prevent floods, plant woods and help wildlife. End of Brexit talks 'hugely concerning' for farmers Green plans diluted as government protects farmers Why do farmers get paid by taxpayers? Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast the changes would not happen overnight, and that prices for food ""will remain broadly stable"". ""This will be an evolution not a revolution,"" he said, although farmers warned of a chaotic future with supermarkets engaged in a price war, and uncertainty over new trading rules after Brexit. A document published on Monday confirms that the old area-based subsidies will be halved by 2024 - and abolished by 2028. The cash saved will be transferred into the new environmental ELM system. Ministers say the EU policy was morally wrong, because it paid the biggest government subsidies to the richest farmers. A billionaire Saudi was evensubsidised to breed racehorses. Protecting 'heritage' farm buildings and stone walls Expanding hedges Capturing carbon in soils and cutting pesticides Natural flood management including restoring river bends Landscape recovery, restoring peatland and planting new woods Reducing antibiotics Improving animal health and welfare The changeover will mean upheaval for farmers, and some may be unwilling or unable to adjust. Ministers have confirmed a lump-sum payment for those who decide they want to retire ""with dignity"". This should increase the UKâs low levels of farm productivity, because experts say younger farmers are typically more willing to try new methods. The total being transferred from area-based payments to environmental payments is Â£1.8bn a year for England. Ministers say the changes will lead to a ârenewedâ agricultural sector producing healthy food for consumption at home and abroad, and to environmental improvements across the country. Sussex farmer Martin Hole was a victim of the quirks of the EU grants system. Like other land owners, he was claiming grants based on the area of land heâs farming. He decided to help wild birds by letting some pasture flood naturally in the winter, and allowing trees and scrubs to regenerate. Farm inspectors measured the areas he had set aside for conservation â deducted grants accordingly, then backdated it and sent him a bill. Then they said theyâd sue him for fraud. âIt was absolute madnessâ, he says. More details of the new policies will appear over time, but environmentalists say the National Farmers' Union has already persuaded the government to water down its original intentions. Farmers complained that the original hurdles to qualify for ELM grants were too high. So, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has created what it calls the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI). This will reward farmers for basic activities such as crop rotation, soil conservation and stopping chemicals polluting waterways. Environmentalists say actions like this are normal good practice, and shouldn't always be funded by the taxpayer. The SFI is the first tier of the new grants system. Tier 2 is Local Nature Recovery, for actions such as creating, managing or restoring habitats, natural flood management and species management. Tier 3 is Landscape Recovery, which will focus on landscape and ecosystem recovery. This will include creation of large forests, peatland restoration, or the creation and restoration of wetlands and salt marshes. The Queen has received around half a million a year in direct farm payments Ministers are launching an advisory booklet with a timetable of steps towards the end date for direct payments. Theyâll be offering help and advice to farmers. They will also offer grants, for instance, for farmers to manage livestock slurry more carefully â itâs a major cause of water pollution. Polluters will receive a warning letter instead of an automatic fine. But the government says itâll target repeat offenders, and focus on sensitive areas. Richard Benwell, from the green umbrella group Wildlife and Countryside Link, told the BBC: âItâs absolutely right to take a less bureaucratic approach on one-off minor breaches, but this should be accompanied by more consistent monitoring and enforcement of major or persistent breaches. âThose words are in the governmentâs document, but a plan for actually delivering it is noticeably absent.â He said of the whole plan: âThe overall impression here is an abiding lack of detail.â NFU president Minette Batters said: âFarmers are up for a new world of carbon neutral food. We need fewer inputs of pesticide and fertiliser and better animal health â but the incentives have to be there. âThereâs going to be real pain for lowland beef, upland beef, and sheep farmers. How much pain we donât know until weâve seen the details weâve been waiting four years for.â Craig Bennett, from the Wildlife Trusts, criticised the announcement for what he called a lack of clarity and urgency. He said: ""The [EU's] Common Agricultural Policy wreaked devastation on our wildlife whilst causing deep-seated issues in farming communities by affecting rents and production. ""We must not spend the next few years just talking; nature needs the help promised by this government and we cannot afford to waste any more time."" The government aims to use the new payments scheme to improve wildlife management. Thereâs a big disparity between government and NFU estimates of the likely impact from the changes on farmers. Experts say some environmental solutions will be hard to define. Take soil: the government wants to conserve soil because it improves productivity and captures planet-heating carbon emissions. But Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University asks: âWhat soil properties should be measured and monitored? Different soils will have naturally variable levels of soil carbon, irrespective of how they are managed.â Prof Rickson said an alternative approach is to ignore measurement of soil properties and reward farmers for farming in ways that typically improve soil carbon, such reduced ploughing, planting âcover cropsâ that hold soil together in winter, and grass buffer strips to catch soil running off fields in the rain. The government has accepted that the great farm transition is very much a work in progress â and details will follow on the road to the revolution in 2028. The changes apply to England only. Devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are devising their own plans. Scotland, for instance, may keep some direct payments to farmers in case Scotland becomes independent and is admitted to the EU. This may cause confusion and resentment in border country.

"White Island was a popular tourist spot New Zealand's health and safety authorities have filed charges against 13 parties over last year's deadly White Island disaster. Some 22 people died when the country's most active volcano suddenly erupted last December with tourists on it. Ten parties now face charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act, which carries a maximum fine of NZ$1.5m ($1.06m; Â£0.79m). A further three have been charged as directors or individuals. These individuals, who have been accused of neglecting health and safety obligations, will face a maximum fine of NZ$300,000. WorkSafe NZ said those charged could not be identified as they had a right to seek a suppression order on their names at a court appearance on 15 December. NZ scientists invent new volcano alert system NZ police release full list of volcano victims The eruption on White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, happened on 9 December. There were 47 people on the island: 24 from Australia, nine from the US, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two from China, two from the UK, and one from Malaysia. The once popular tourist destination was visited by thousands every year, despite the fact that it had been erupting in some form since 2011. This video can not be played Tourists could be seen waiting to be evacuated from White Island The volcano had been showing signs of unrest for weeks before the eruption in 2019, and was rated at Volcanic Alert Level 2, indicating ""moderate to heightened volcanic unrest"". Yet the sudden nature of the eruption took everyone - including authorities - by surprise. Tourists have not been back to the island since. Shortly after the tragedy, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that an investigation would be held, adding that this could take up to a year.

"Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said. Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalRobert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"". Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added. Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules. The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday. Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business. The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday. ""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote. ""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport."" Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day. Retail giant Arcadia faces collapse within hours Black Friday comes early for shoppers this year The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times. But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"". ""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC. ""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions. But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains. Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently thatit was cutting 3,500 jobswith the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters. In August, M&S announced it was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Boris Johnson has agreed to publish the health, economic and social data behind England's new tier system later, as he seeks to avert a Commons rebellion. MPs will vote on the measures on Tuesday, and numerous Conservative MPs have demanded to see the evidence government is basing its new system on. Writing to a group of around 70 MPs - who are sceptical of the new rules - Mr Johnson called for ""unity and resolve"". Labour is expected to support the PM, but is yet to confirm its stance. If Labour does decide to get behind the new tier system, the government should easily win the vote - even if there is a sizeable revolt among Conservative MPs. The information is expected to include data first published by the Office for Budget Responsibility last week. Covid infections fall by 30% over lockdown - study Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus Covid 'could delay cancer advances by over a year' England's new system - due to replace the national lockdown when it expires on Wednesday - will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. Nearly all of England will be in the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. The PM's letter to Tories from the Covid Recovery Group is his second letter to colleagues over the weekend, as he seeks to reassure them about the measures. In an earlier letterto all MPs and peers, the prime minister said the rules in some areas could be eased in December, MPs could vote again on the measures in January, and the tier system could end on 3 February. But some Conservative MPs have complained their constituencies are entering one of the tougher tiers, despite cases in their areas falling, and asked to see the data behind the measures. The contents of one document could determine the size of Tuesday's Conservative revolt. The government has conceded a key demand of the rebels - to produce an assessment of the economic and social impact of the restrictions. Put very crudely, MPs want to know if the lives these tiers will save will outweigh livelihoods that will be lost. Privately, some other potential rebels are indicating they are prepared to be convinced by the government's arguments. And Mr Johnson's efforts to win over his sceptics seem to be making some headway. The former minister Conor Burns - an old ally of Mr Johnson's - had been critical of how the government intended to impose its restrictions. But he told the Westminster Hour he won't be voting against them, saying: ""We've got the vaccine coming over the horizon. If the government really feels we need to do this then I'm probably prepared to swallow hard and support them."" But some other potential rebels have told the BBC that they are withholding their support unless and until they see the hard data behind the PM's decisions. In his letter to the Covid Recovery Group, Mr Johnson said he'd ""responded positively"" to their ""constructive proposals"". The next 24 hours will see him continue the campaign of persuasion with his own backbenchers. Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said he was ""particularly concerned about some of the non-Covid health implications these restrictions have been having"". And he urged the government to publish details of what extra support would be made available, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of the new tier system before Tuesday's vote. Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to increase the grants given to businesses. He said the hospitality sector in his region is ""facing crisis"". Speaking during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturers in Wales, Mr Johnson said he understood people's ""frustrations"" particularly those in the hospitality sector. He said the best thing for the industry would be to ""keep the virus under control, use mass testing, roll that out in ever greater numbers, plus the vaccine if, as I hope, we can start to distribute them."" In his letter to MPs, the PM also said the government would: Introduce daily testing for those who have had close contact with a Covid case - an alternative to the current requirement for contacts to self isolate for 10 days Carry out more rapid tests to identify asymptomatic carriers and protect the vulnerable Publish the results of surveys on compliance, which reveal why people breach self-isolation Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice acknowledged a large number of Conservative MPs were ""unsettled"" and said the prime minister would be ""working very hard"" to reassure those MPs that he doesn't want to ""maintain the measures for a moment longer than is necessary"". He added he would be surprised if Labour voted against the steps, adding ""it is not the moment for any party to play politics."" Speaking at a virtual town hall with residents from Lancaster and Morecambe, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""need for restrictions"" and that the Labour Party ""has to act in the national interest"". He expressed concerned that the government ""doesn't have the support package right"" and said people in the North West ""are tearing their hair out saying ""we've been in restrictions for months and need better support.'"" Sir Keir and other members of the shadow cabinet are due to meet England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance later, as they decide whether to vote with the government. However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns. The party is urging the government to release the evidence underpinning the new system; commit to involving local authorities; and offer urgent support to pubs. Meanwhile, a major study from Imperial College London has found that coronavirus infections in Englandfell by about a third over lockdown. Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, but cases still remained high across England. Researchers estimated thatthe virus's reproduction (R) ratehad fallen to 0.88, meaning the epidemic is shrinking. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announcednew rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus caseswhich will come into force from 18:00 GMT on Friday. On Sunday, a further 12,155 positive coronavirus test results were recorded across the UK, bringing the total to 1,617,327. A further 215 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded, bringing the total to 58,245. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

We need fewer inputs of pesticide and fertiliser and better animal health â but the incentives have to be there. âThereâs going to be real pain for lowland beef, upland beef, and sheep farmers. How much pain we donât know until weâve seen the details weâve been waiting four years for.â Craig Bennett, from the Wildlife Trusts, criticised the announcement for what he called a lack of clarity and urgency. He said: ""The [EU's] Common Agricultural Policy wreaked devastation on our wildlife whilst causing deep-seated issues in farming communities by affecting rents and production. ""We must not spend the next few years just talking; nature needs the help promised by this government and we cannot afford to waste any more time."" The government aims to use the new payments scheme to improve wildlife management. Thereâs a big disparity between government and NFU estimates of the likely impact from the changes on farmers. Experts say some environmental solutions will be hard to define. Take soil: the government wants to conserve soil because it improves productivity and captures planet-heating carbon emissions. But Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University asks: âWhat soil properties should be measured and monitored? Different soils will have naturally variable levels of soil carbon, irrespective of how they are managed.â Prof Rickson said an alternative approach is to ignore measurement of soil properties and reward farmers for farming in ways that typically improve soil carbon, such reduced ploughing, planting âcover cropsâ that hold soil together in winter, and grass buffer strips to catch soil running off fields in the rain. The government has accepted that the great farm transition is very much a work in progress â and details will follow on the road to the revolution in 2028. The changes apply to England only. Devolved administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are devising their own plans. Scotland, for instance, may keep some direct payments to farmers in case Scotland becomes independent and is admitted to the EU. This may cause confusion and resentment in border country.

But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"During the 1980s KMS trained the Special Task Force, an elite unit of the Sri Lankan police, and also taught the countryâs air force British mercenaries who were involved in the Sri Lankan civil war are being investigated for war crimes by the Metropolitan Police. Private security company Keenie Meenie Services (KMS) trained an elite unit of the Sri Lankan police called the Special Task Force (STF) in the 1980s to fight Tamil separatists. The STF has been implicated in a number of human rights abuses. These have included executions without trial and killings of Tamil civilians. The investigation is believed to be the first time British mercenaries have been investigated by the Met, which is the UK force responsible for investigating accusations of war crimes or human rights abuses. A police spokesperson said the Met had received a referral in March concerning allegations of war crimes committed by British mercenaries and following a ""scoping exercise"", it had launched an investigation. Allegations of war crimes committed by British mercenaries in Sri Lanka are detailed in Phil Millerâs book Much of the evidence concerning KMS's involvement in Sri Lanka has come from declassified UK government documents and freedom of information requests submitted by journalist Phil Miller, whose book, Keenie Meenie: The British Mercenaries Who Got Away With War Crimes, was published in January. He said the investigation was being closely followed by the UK's 200,000 strong Tamil community - many of whom fled to London during the civil war in Sri Lanka. ""A lot of Tamil people became refugees in the 1980s, that's when KMS were there,"" Mr Miller said. ""People remember being attacked by helicopter gunships so I think people are quite shocked to learn that in many of those cases helicopters were flown by British mercenaries."" The Sri Lankan army defeated Tamil Tiger rebels in May 2009 after 26 years of bloody conflict. The war divided Sri Lanka along ethnic lines - pitting the majority Buddhist Sinhalese-dominated government against Tamil rebels who wanted a separate state. The fighting killed an estimated 100,000 people and left about 20,000, mostly Tamils, missing. At the end of the war, the United Nations accused both sides of atrocities, especially during the conflict's final stages. Earlier this year,Sri Lanka's president acknowledged for the first timethat those who had disappeared were dead. KMS was founded by David Walker, a former SAS officer. KMS no longer exists but the 78-year-old is one of the directors of a subsequent company, Saladin Security, which is based in Kensington. Mr Walker has strongly maintained that nobody from KMS was complicit in war crimes in Sri Lanka. In a statement, his representative said: ""The allegations that David Walker or staff of KMS Limited were complicit in war crimes in Sri Lanka in the mid-1980s is categorically denied. ""[Saladin Security] is an entirely separate company from KMS and had no involvement in Sri Lanka. Mr Walker was neither a shareholder or director of KMS. ""The [War Crimes] Unit has not yet asked for assistance from Saladin or Mr Walker but they will be happy to co-operate if asked.""

"Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said. Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalRobert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"". Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added. Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules. The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday. Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business. The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday. ""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote. ""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport."" Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day. Retail giant Arcadia faces collapse within hours Black Friday comes early for shoppers this year The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times. But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"". ""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC. ""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions. But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains. Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently thatit was cutting 3,500 jobswith the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says lockdown brought coronavirus under control in England but people must remain vigilant It means people could have greater freedoms in tiers from Wednesday ""but we don't have much headroom"", he says The data behind government decisions over the new tier system is published as No 10 tries to win its own MPs' backing Pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes across Wales will not be able to serve alcohol and must close by 18:00 from Friday The retail empire Arcadia, which has been hit by the pandemic, could collapse Singer Rita Ora apologises for breaking lockdown rules with a 30th birthday party Moderna files for US regulatory approval of its coronavirus vaccine so that it can be recommended for widespread use Globally more than 62.7 million people have been infected and 1.46 million have died with Covid, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Julian Joyce and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman Thanks for being with us for our coverage today. Updates were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, Claire Heald, George Bowden, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Julian Joyce. We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are some of the main developments in the UK this evening: Health Secretary Matt Hancock thanks the public for adhering to the lockdown in England. This video can not be played Hancock: 'We have got this virus back under control' Maguito Vilela tested positive for coronavirus at the end of October The city of Goiania in central Brazil elected a new mayor on Sunday. But the victor, Maguito Vilela, was unaware of the result. Thatâs because since mid-November, Vilela has been in an induced coma, as he receives treatment for Covid-19 at an intensive-care unit. Aged 71, the former senator tested positive for Covid-19 on 20 October. He was admitted to hospital a week later and was intubated on 30 October. He came off the ventilator on 8 November, but was back on by 15 November, when he also progressed to a second-round runoff of the mayoral election. On Sunday, Vilela was elected with 52.6% of the vote. When the result was announced, he remained unconscious on a ventilator in a stable condition, local media reported. A prayer was held for him at a news conference after his victory. Brazil has the second-highest number of virus deaths in the world. Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has urged Americans who travelled for Thanksgiving or celebrated in large groups - against medical advice - to assume they have been infected with Covid-19 and get tested. ""We know people may have made mistakes over the Thanksgiving time period,"" Dr Birx said on CBS News on Sunday. ""If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later. But you need to assume that you're infected."" Experts have warned of an uptick in infections following last Thursday's holiday, which rivals Christmas in size and typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Though the number of holiday air travellers dropped by about half this year, more than one million people passed through security at US airports on the day before Thanksgiving alone. New cases of Covid-19 dropped worldwide last week for the first time since September, according to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attributed the drop to the ""difficult but necessary"" measures put in place by European countries in the throes of a second wave. But with cases rising in many countries and the festive season fast approaching, the WHO chief cautioned against complacency, urging people to reevaluate their holiday plans and avoid travel, indoor gatherings and shopping. ""It will be safe to do all these things soon, it's a matter of time,"" he said. ""The pandemic will end."" Mark LowenBBC News, Rome An army field hospital in Calabria, meant to help with Covid-19 patients. Calabria is Italy's poorest region. And while its infection rate and intensive care numbers are lower than northern Italy, its fragile health system is buckling. This region in Italy's southern toe was quickly declared a ""red zone"" in early November. And while it battles its Covid-19 case load, it also faces the damage wrought by decades of political mismanagement and plunder by its mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, which infiltrated the healthcare system. Criminal gangs seized resources and ran up massive debts, leading to 18 of its public hospitals being closed and savage cuts to beds and staff. Read more about Calabria's two pandemics - coronavirus and the mafia. Health and care workers in Scotland are to be given a Â£500 payment as a ""thank you"" for their work during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the one-off payment to thank NHS and care staff for their ""extraordinary service"" in 2020. It will be paid to all full-time NHS and adult social care staff, with a proportional share for part-time staff. The bonus is expected to be paid out to around 300,000 doctors, nurses, porters, care home and hospice staff and other frontline health workers, at a cost of Â£180m. Read more about the payment here. Today's coronavirus briefing by the UK government has just finished. Here are some of the key
points from the news conference: Bringing the news conference to a close, Mr Hancock urges leaders of local authorities to come forward with proposals for community testing in their areas. He says: ""We want to work hand in glove with local NHS, with local authorities... to make sure we can use this community testing programme as effectively as possible to root out this virus."" Hancock is asked about concerns that the resources required for mass testing could detract from the Covid vaccination programme. In response he stresses that testing and vaccination ""need to run alongside each other"", and this has already happened in vaccine trials to find out if people who are vaccinated have caught Covid-19. He is also asked if the expansion of mass testing is an admission that NHS Test and Trace has not worked as well as the government would have liked. Hancock denies this and says it is only because of the hard work of NHS Test and Trace that testing capability has improved, enabling the expansion of mass testing. PA Media's David Hughes asks whether Conservative backbenchers considering voting against the government's proposed new tier system for England are being irresponsible. Mr Hancock says he urges all MPs to vote for the tier system as it has fewer restrictions than a national lockdown and is more targeted. It has a ""less detrimental impact on the economy"", he says, but tier three is needed to keep the virus down across the country. ""That is the best way to avoid a third lockdown,"" he adds. ""I hope we get a very significant proportion of MPs voting for the proposals.""  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to
get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive. This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic
cases â people who do not have symptoms. It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago. Local authorities are being given access to these tests to
try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it. It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the
past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold. Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people
in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces
like food factories. Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and
help university students return home for Christmas. But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of
caution. These tests were never intended for community use like this.
When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases. The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness
of this programme is far from certain. The Financial Times's Jim Pickard asks how many of those hospitalised in England are inpatients with Covid, or with other illnesses. Prof Powis says that the vast majority of those recorded as being in hospital with Covid will be there due to the infection. But he adds there will be a proportion who come into hospital without Covid and then subsequently test positive. ""We are very careful to ensure we are testing people on a regular basis in their first week in hospital,"" he says. Prof
Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, is asked how worried he is about a new wave of infections putting pressure on the NHS in January, after restrictions are eased over Christmas. He says it is ""crucial"" to get infection rates down ahead of January when the NHS is at its busiest. He adds that he is ""confident people will act sensibly
over Christmasâ and the country will go into the New Year with infections staying down and falling. Hancock is asked by the BBC's Hugh Pym how effective mass testing of students can be if this is voluntary and not available to all students. The health secretary says the government's goal is to make testing available to as many students as possible but this is ""best done on a voluntary basis"". However, he adds that he thinks the programme will ""still make a difference"". Anyone who has a concerns about the need to access testing should speak to their university, he says. Channel 5 News's Andy Bell asks if there is any chance of an area in England moving down a tier before Christmas. Mr Hancock says that there will be a review on 16 December and confirms it will be possible for an area to move into a lower tier with fewer restrictions. He warns there are some areas ""I am worried about"" and there are still areas with rising infections. ""We do still have to be cautious,"" he says. ITV's Emily Morgan asks Mr Hancock how he expects to have the same success seen in Liverpool in the new tier three areas from Wednesday. The health secretary says there will be extra funding for local authorities to get mass testing done - of up to Â£14 per test done - reflecting the Liverpool model. General Sir Gordon Messenger, the head of operations for the community testing programme, says that tailoring testing to the needs of local areas is crucial to success. He says that there will be a ""great deal of support... a great deal of signposting"" for what is available for councils - from extremely targeted testing - to widespread community screening like that in Merseyside. He rules out the military support being used across all areas, as they were in Liverpool - the assumption is that testing will be delivered locally with support from central government. Adrian asks about the provision for Covid-19 testing at all universities before the Christmas holiday. Mr Hancock says a programme across all UK universities will ensure as many as possible can get a test before they travel home. He says this is a useful example of how the mass testing capability ""can have a real-world impact"" on managing the pandemic - students should contact their university for specific advice on testing. ""I hope students will engage with this enthusiastically,"" he adds. Ella in Southampton asks what the rules are for those in long-term relationships, but living apart, in tier two areas. Mr Hancock says rules about what is exactly permitted are on the government's website and promoted through advertising. He adds that he understands the dilemma facing those in relationships but maintains that the general rule is that - in tier two - the rule of six applies outdoors but, indoors, people should only mix with their household.

"Shops in England will be allowed to stay open for 24 hours a day in the run-up to Christmas and in January, the housing secretary has said. Local authorities will be able to temporarily waive the rules restricting retail opening hours. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalRobert Jenrick said the relaxation of the rules would allow shopping to be ""more pleasant and safer"". Shopkeepers and councils would decide how long stores stay open, he added. Primark has become one of the first to say that it will take advantage of the new rules. The clothing retailer plans to open 11 of its stores for 24 hours when they are allowed to begin trading again once England's lockdown is lifted on Wednesday. Months of restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus have hit the High Street hard, and the hope is the relaxation of opening hours will boost business. The new rules would run from Monday to Saturday. ""None of us, I suspect, enjoys navigating the crowds, and none would relish that when social distancing is so important to controlling the virus,"" Mr Jenrick wrote. ""These changes mean your local shops can open longer, ensuring more pleasant and safer shopping, with less pressure on public transport."" Mr Jenrick urged local councils to offer retailers ""the greatest possible flexibility"" when determining trading hours. Shops and supermarkets would also be given more leeway over stock delivery times he said, to keep the roads clearer during the day. Retail giant Arcadia faces collapse within hours Black Friday comes early for shoppers this year The British Retail Consortium (BRC) welcomed the move. ""With just over three weeks until Christmas, shoppers will welcome the additional opportunities to shop that the government's statement supports,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said. She encouraged Christmas shoppers not to leave it until the last minute and to avoid peak times. But Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, described the relaxing of rules for retail as ""arbitrary and unfair"". ""You are reopening broad swathes of the economy with next to no restrictions in the middle of what is still set out by the government to be a really significant pandemic,"" she told the BBC. ""The government has chosen hospitality as the primary tool for controlling transmission with very limited evidence."" She is calling for more support for hospitality venues after a study showed that nine out of 10 businesses in the sector were unviable under current restrictions. But the government hopes the new rules will provide a much-needed boost for bricks-and-mortar retail, after many shops were forced to close during lockdown. That pushed shoppers online, exacerbating a trend which was already putting pressure on some High Street chains. Sir Philip Green's retail empire Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is likely to enter administration within the next 24 hours, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia is far from the only recent casualty in the retail sector - although it could be the biggest. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Thousands of retailing jobs have also been lost at other businesses. Sainsbury's announced recently thatit was cutting 3,500 jobswith the closure of 420 Argos outlets and all meat, fish and deli counters. In August, M&S announced it was set to cut 7,000 jobs over three months. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"This video can not be played Black Lives Matter: The three women who founded a global movement The year 2020 will be remembered for a lot of things - not least the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement around the world. The organisation has led huge street rallies and high-profile campaigns against racism and police brutality. Now the three women who founded the movement have told the BBC they believe it has transformed politics. ""Black people alongside our allies stood up to change the course of history and we won,"" said Alicia Garza. Garza and her BLM co-founders, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, spoke as part of the BBC 100 Women Masterclass 2020, a digital live event of masterclasses, big interviews and guests on 30 November. BBC 100 Women 2020 - Join us for the BBC 100 Women Masterclasses The trio started the Black Lives Matter movement in the US in 2013 after the not guilty verdict against George Zimmerman, who shot dead unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. Protests erupted again this year after the killing of George Floyd, who died in May after a police officer knelt on his neck during his arrest in Minneapolis. ""Black Lives Matter, after seven years, is now really in the DNA and the muscle memory of this country,"" said Garza. ""We all have watched how our community members, our family members, are being murdered on camera. ""There are so many ways in which, even as this movement was exploding for the second time, major news outlets continue to focus on the wrong thing. 2016 also saw a wave of Black Lives Matter demonstrations over the killings of black men by police officers ""Over and over again, the burden and responsibility for violence gets placed at our feet, but nobody talks about the violence that our communities are experiencing both at the hands of government neglect, but also at the hands of police officers. ""Now we have a new element which is vigilante and white supremacist violence."" Despite the ongoing struggle, the founders of BLM struck a cautiously optimistic note, especially when speaking about the defeat of Donald Trump in the US election. Black women in particular have been credited for playing a major role in President-elect Joe Biden's victory. The BLM trio welcomed the acknowledgement of this by Kamala Harris, who has made history as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president-elect. But they said they would lobby for her to be not just a ""symbol but a fighter for our communities"". ""I'm heartened by seeing the ways in which the BLM movement but also a number of other movements have risen to the occasion and have brought forward political thought and action that really reflects the best of who we are,"" said Opal Tometi. ""I think our movements are showing a whole other way is possible and I'm very moved and grateful to be alive for a time such as this."" BLM protests have spanned the generations Describing how its role has changed this year, Garza said BLM was increasingly making connection across the world, including elevating the #EndSars protests against police violence in Nigeria. ""We are transforming politics as we know it but we are very focused on transforming power, the way that it operates, and making sure there is more power in the hands of more people,"" she said. How BLM went from Facebook post to global movement Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Black Lives Matter in the UK: 'We're still not being heard' Patrisse Cullors said the achievements of BLM in 2020 would go down in the history books. ""What I'm excited about is that my child gets to say that his mom, alongside other fierce black women, did everything that she could, and we could, to make this place better for us.

"This video can not be played How will I travel home in time for Christmas? The mass Covid testing of students, so they can go home safely for the Christmas break, is starting at many universities across the UK. Universities are opening temporary testing centres where hundreds of thousands of students will be checked for Covid this week before they leave. Students have been asked to take two tests, three days apart. If they test negative, many students will leave university in the ""travel window"" starting from 3 December. But testing is voluntary and it will not be available in all universities. The UCU lecturers' union has warned about the reliability of the testing plans and says there could be ""chaos"". Inshaal says students in Bradford are concerned about bringing back the virus to elderly relatives Caleb Shaw, a journalism student at the University of the West of England in Bristol, is taking a test on Monday. ""I know I'm less likely to get seriously ill with it,"" he says, but he wants to get a test to protect his family. ""If I get a test then I can make sure I don't bring it home to them. It would be stupid to not take advantage of it,"" Caleb says. Two Covid tests for students and then leave in 24 hours Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November Universities to oversee exodus of students at end of term Rapid mass testing plan to get students home at Christmas The university is using its sports centre as a temporary testing site until 6 December with 90 staff and students helping with the testing process. Inshaal Ahmad, a students' union sabbatical officer at the University of Bradford, says most students seem supportive of the testing. A student taking a swab sample at the University of St Andrews He says many students at Bradford live in multi-generational households, including older relatives, and want to ""be on the safe side"" and not risk bringing the virus back from university. Testing at Bradford will continue until 6 December and as with other universities, booking slots for tests will also be a way of staggering the times when students can leave, within the ""travel window"" that ends on 9 December. The mass testing is intended to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus as students travel away from their term-time addresses. Sports halls and rooms on campus are being converted into testing centres, where students will take ""lateral flow"" swab tests, which will provide results within an hour, with the outcome sent by email or text. Caleb will be among the students taking the Covid test on Monday Two tests are recommended to increase accuracy - and students will be expected to travel soon after a second negative result, with students in England and Wales encouraged to leave within 24 hours. If students get a positive result, they will have to take another test to confirm - and if they have coronavirus they will have to stay and self-isolate. Most universities are providing testing - 130 ""expressed an interest"" in taking part in the scheme, according to the Department for Health and Social Care. But the National Union of Students says there should be capacity for all students who want a test to get one before Christmas. ""We are not aware of how universities will decide which students are tested if testing is oversubscribed,"" says the NUS. The UCU lecturers' union says the approach to testing has been rushed and confused and the last-minute arrangements will be a ""recipe for chaos"". The union said it had ""grave concerns"" and ""testing so many people and following necessary safety measures would be an extremely challenging operation"". England's Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has urged students ""to take the tests on offer"". In Wales, testing will begin and students are expected to travel by 9 December, but there have beenconcerns about not all students having access to a test. In Scotlandtesting will be available for students from Monday, with an encouragement to leave for home soon after a second negative test. In Northern Ireland, Grian Ni Dhaimhin, student union president at Queen's University Belfast, said: ""We are all in this together and I'd encourage students to take part in this important programme."" But not all universities in Northern Ireland are planning to offer testing. ""Testing will help to break the line of transmission amongst students, especially when they are infected but are not aware of it,"" said Professor Steve West, vice chancellor at the University of the West of England.

"Simone is one of hundreds of thousands struggling to find work during the pandemic A Â£20 a week uplift to universal credit has helped keep 700,000 people out of poverty during the pandemic and should remain in place beyond March, says a right-leaning think tank. Nearly 700,000 more people have fallen into poverty but there would be twice this number without the extra Â£20, says the Legatum Institute. People who have lost jobs and have high housing costs are worst hit, it adds. The government confirmed the uplift will be secure until March. Universal credit claimants were given a Â£20-a-week boost in response to the coronavirus pandemic in April, but this is due to end by next April. Campaigners have raised concerns that the chancellordid not commit to extend the extra paymentin last week's spending review. Legatum's warning is the latest to the government on the need for continued support for families and individuals caught up in the economic fallout from the pandemic. Last month the government's formerhomelessness adviser warned of a ""period of destitution"" And the OECD said the pandemicrisked worsening child poverty and inequality in the UK For single mum Simone, the outlook is ""terrifying"". She gave up her job as a sales supervisor in a clothes shop at the end of last year, hoping for a better-paid role in customer relations. But since the lockdown began in March, finding a job has proved impossible. ""I'm very worried because there's a lot of uncertainty, especially on benefits... some days are really, really difficult,"" she says. ""Food has been difficult. Occasionally it has picked up a little bit. I have been able to do a little bit more of a weekly shop, but it is difficult making sure the money lasts for the whole month... and there are no luxuries."" Covid infections fall by 30% over lockdown - study PM calls for 'unity' from MPs on new Covid tiers The idea of being unable to buy clothes and other essentials for her seven-year-old daughter is a major point of stress. The pair live with Simone's mum but, as a care worker, she herself is on a low income, so they are still stretched financially - and then there's the issue of space, with three people in a two-bedroom flat. ""You're basically living on top of each other. We manage. We're grateful to have a roof over our heads but it is difficult... especially during lockdown when you're cramped indoors."" Legatum says before the pandemic about 14.4 million people were estimated to be in poverty in the UK, according to a measure that looks at both income and unavoidable living costs, such as housing. But its analysis suggests that during the pandemic another 690,000 were left struggling to pay bills and put food on the table. It says younger and older workers with high housing costs have been hardest hit, as well as people with disabilities. However, Legatum calculates that another 700,000 people have been kept out of poverty by the extra Â£20 a week, and fears many would be unable to cope if it was stopped. ""Our analysis shows that, at a time of crisis, government action can protect many of those who are vulnerable to poverty,"" said Legatum chief executive Baroness Philippa Stroud. She told the BBC she wants to see the uplift continue beyond March because ""it takes a while to get yourself up and out and back into work"". Sectors like hospitality where 81% have been furloughed or made redundant, could take a while to recover, she said, arguing that the Â£20 should remain long enough ""to see people through that process and to a place where they can work themselves out of poverty the other side"". Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, urged the government ""to see sense"" as removing the uplift would mean ""taking Â£1,000 a year from Britain's families at the peak of the unemployment crisis"". ""This crisis has highlighted how important it is that we support each other but the Conservatives expect the poorest households to shoulder the burden,"" said Mr Reynolds. A government spokesperson said: ""We are wholly committed to supporting people on lower incomes and have paid out more than Â£100bn in welfare support this year. ""The Â£20 increase to universal credit continues to be in place until the end of March 2021.""

"This video can not be played Apprentices miss out as pandemic cuts work Wales is potentially facing levels of unemployment not seen since the recession of the early 1990s, according to new modelling. Research commissioned by the BBC suggests the number of long-term jobless could rise to about 44,000 people. That would be a four-fold increase on the current number. The Welsh Government said investment was needed to soften the blow, but tough times lie ahead. While the rate of unemployment is broadly similar in Wales and England, unemployment in Wales has risen at double the rate across the border since the beginning of 2020. There has been a 41% increase in Wales compared to just 18% in England - meaning an estimated additional 20,000 people are looking for work in Wales. And despite recent good news about vaccines and a possible end to lockdowns in the New Year, experts say there could be worse to come. David Hagendyk, director of the Learning and Work Institute in Wales, has been modelling how the country's unemployment figures could look. For the long-term unemployed, the picture is bleak. Currently, there are 11,000 people in that category in Wales, but Mr Hagendyk said that figure could rise steeply. ""Our modelling shows that could go up and be between 29,000 or 67,000 people being long-term unemployed. ""That gives us a mid-range of about 44,000. ""It blows out of the water the 2008 financial crisis in terms of long-term unemployment numbers. ""It takes us back to the early 1990s and the kind of recession we had then."" Christmas Covid warning Loan claims disputed Mr Hagendyk said that, while the numbers were eye-catching, it was important to remember the human stories behind them. ""These are real people with real jobs, real families and we know there is a long-term scarring impact. ""It's absolutely critical that the government acts quickly in order to stop this kind of modelling potential that we might see."" David Hagendyk says government action is needed now to avoid huge rises in the long-term unemployed number in Wales James Aubrey said he wanted to be a pilot for as long as he could remember, tailoring his exams and work experience to that goal. He had to fund a two-year training course - borrowing Â£100,000 which he has to pay back over the next decade. That shouldn't have been a problem for the 22-year-old from Cardiff, but the aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. James Aubrey borrowed Â£100,000 to train as a pilot ""The starting salaries most airlines were offering was about Â£40,000 which meant there was enough to pay off the loan and be able to live as well,"" said James. But pilots are being laid off rather than being recruited, so James has decided to look for a job in retail - where he worked before his training - to ensure he has an income in the short-term. ""The loan is bonded to my parents' house,"" he said. ""So it means there's an added extra bit of pressure on top just to meet those repayments, just to make sure it doesn't affect my family as well as me."" Though still determined to work as a pilot, James is concerned it could take him far longer than planned to get back into aviation. The Welsh Government said it had allocated more than Â£1bn to support businesses and protect jobs during the pandemic. Despite this, unemployment is rising faster in Wales than in England. Mr Hagendyk said the underlying reasons for that lie in the way some sectors employ more people in Wales. ""Our research has shown that about one in five workers here in Wales are working in shutdown sectors - the parts of the economy that have been most affected by the first lockdown,"" he said. ""These are companies in hospitality and tourism, aviation and high street retail - that's about a quarter of a million workers here in Wales."" Because so many people work in these vulnerable sectors, it does not bode well for the future, said Mr Hagendyk. ""They're more likely to be letting people go, making redundancies,"" he said. ""They're also most likely not to be hiring new people."" Pub manager Heidi Bakewell had taken on and trained new staff Across Wales the hospitality sector has been amongst the hardest hit - takings have plummeted for hotels, pubs and restaurants. On the Llyn Peninsula in Gwynedd, the Bryncynan pub began the year by spending Â£1m on a refit. The pub's manager Heidi Bakewell was forecast to take a similar amount in revenue over the year but in reality the pub has taken about a quarter. Heidi had also taken on and trained new staff, with some facing losing their jobs because restrictions and lockdowns meant the pub couldn't trade normally. ""I haven't slept the last couple of nights just through thinking, what are we going to do? ""Do we share the hours out, so they all get a few hours? It doesn't really work then because it's not enough for them to live on. ""We've still got three chefs. I think we've got 11 out-front staff still. ""Those numbers will probably go, I would say, to two chefs at the very most and we'll probably cut our front staff, maybe down to five."" It's been a challenging year for Emma and Rez Jamal who run Kookoo Madame When Pontypridd fashion boutique Kookoo Madame reopened in September, people queued down the street for the few jobs on offer. Among the hopefuls hoping to land a shop floor job were senior managers, people with degrees and those who were qualified but couldn't get into their chosen industries. For owners Emma and Rez Jamal, 2020 has thrown up many obstacles. First they were flooded out by Storm Dennis, and as they recovered from that, the first lockdown came. To save their business, they moved to a new premises and had to choose between paying for the move or topping up staff wages when furlough ended. ""We had to make some redundancies, which was a really tough decision to make,"" said Emma. ""They were our staff who'd been with us for quite some time. ""It was awful, absolutely awful. I wouldn't want to go through it again."" Although they were able to open in September, the firebreak meant they had to shut again. ""Everybody's scared, everybody's worried, nobody knows what's round the corner,"" said Emma. Wales' Economy Minister Ken Skates has called for ""jobs, jobs and more jobs"" Welsh Economy Minister Ken Skates said the way to combat the testing times to come was to invest in ""jobs, jobs and more jobs"". He said: ""We've a proven track record in investing in people and supporting people through the most difficult economic times. ""We are confident that we have got plans, policies and schemes in place to prevent the devastating long-term scars that mass, long-term unemployment can inflict on our country."" But Mr Skates admitted none of the forecasts he had seen had been ""rosy"". ""There is no forecast that suggests we will come out of this incredibly rapidly and are going to instantly bounce back,"" he said. Many people across Wales face the prospect of having to learn a new profession as jobs dwindle. Mr Hagendyk said to train even half the number of people who could end up long-term unemployed would be hugely expensive, possibly costing as much as Â£218m. ""This is investment above and beyond what we have already seen going into schools and colleges, so this is new money,"" he said. ""We have seen the Welsh Government expand training college places and apprenticeships to try to offset some of this challenge. ""But I think at the moment the scale of the response is not sufficient to meet the scale of the challenge."" The Welsh Government said it would need additional funding from Westminster to help with retraining. Additional funding to support skills has been announced by the UK government for England, and Wales will receive a consequential through the Barnett formula. However, there are fears that this funding alone will fall far short of what might be needed.

"The so-called ""lateral flow"" test returns results within 20 minutes A pilot scheme to give care home visitors 20-minute Covid-19 tests will start next week, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has announced. The UK-wide pilot will initially involve 15 care homes in Wales but will be rolled out to further homes, if successful, from 14 December. Mr Gething said the tests would not replace other safety measures. It comes after the Welsh Government announced Â£3m for care homes to install temporary ""pods"" for Christmas visits. This video can not be played Pods are to be installed at care homes across Wales to allow residents to receive visitors over the Christmas period Lateral flow tests give much quicker results than existing tests, and are the same as those being used in thecommunity testing project in Merthyr Tydfil. ""These tests will give home managers extra confidence and reassurance that visits can go ahead without coronavirus also coming into the care home,"" Mr Gething said at the Welsh Government's coronavirus press briefing on Monday. ""These tests do not replace all the other measures, such as infection control, social distancing and hand hygiene, which are so important to preventing the spread of coronavirus, especially in care homes."" Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said the take up of lateral flow testing ""has been too slow in Wales"". ""But we need now to make sure that pilot schemes are rolled out widely,"" he added. Glass pods have been installed in the grounds of two care homes in Sheffield to allow residents to see their loved ones safely face-to-face The announcement followed news of another pilot, which will see an initial 30 pods given to care homes ahead of the festive period. In total, Mr Gething said 100 would be installed for a period of six months. It comes afterit was revealed 53 people were discharged from hospital into Welsh care homesafter a positive Covid test earlier in the pandemic. Mr Gething said the visitor pods would expand capacity within care homes which lack internal visiting space and struggle to accommodate socially-distanced visits from outsiders. Coronavirus: Dutch care home reunites families in a glass pod Covid-safe pods installed at Yorkshire care homes Wakefield care home's visiting booth gets big response The cash will also include Â£1m to help care homes help to plan visits in other ways. ""We all know how difficult recent months have been for people living in care homes and their loved ones, however ensuring the safety of our most vulnerable has always been paramount,"" Mr Gething explained. ""We recognise both the distress and sadness that has been experienced since March, but also the desire from care homes to facilitate visits before and during Christmas as well as throughout the winter. He added that he was confident the pods would help ""meaningful visits"" to take place. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said ensuring the safety of vulnerable people was ""paramount"" Care home manager Meryl Welsby said having a pod had made all the difference at her residence in the Conwy Valley. ""It's been really difficult for us and the residents, because they need to see their relatives,"" she said. ""During lockdown we've scheduled three visits a day by Skype or through the window, but it's still not the same."" The Bryn yr Eglwys home in Pentrefoelas invested its own cash in the Â£10,000 pod before the Welsh Government scheme was announced. Residents go in one side of the specially adapted building, with relatives on the other side, with a screen between them. It means there can be three visiting slots a day at the home, with time in between to clean the pod. ""We've been Covid free throughout, so our processes are effective,"" added Ms Welsby. ""Now we've got the pods, the visitors are overwhelmed."" Homes are 'working really hard' to make safe visits happen, says the care industry Mary Wimbury, the chief executive of the industry body Care Forum Wales, said the move was welcomed but she recognised it would not be a solution for all locations. ""Care homes are being asked to express interest in the pods, and they'll need to know they have space for it - so it's not going to work for everybody,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales' Breakfast programme. ""What everyone wants is to put there residents, as safely as possible, back in touch with loved ones. ""Meeting outside, especially as we get more wintery, is just not suitable for everybody."" She said she was pleased additional money was also being made available for homes where pods may not be suitable. ""I think everyone is working really hard to do what they can to make visiting work,"" she added. In July, theWelsh Parliament's health committee said care homes were ""badly let down""by the Welsh Government at the start of the crisis, and ministers had been too slow to launch a testing regime for both staff and residents.

"US airports experienced their highest passenger numbers since March The US could see ""surge upon surge"" of coronavirus cases as people return home from the Thanksgiving holiday, a top US disease expert has warned. Speaking on Sunday, Dr Anthony Fauci said it was ""not too late"" for those yet to travel to help curb the virus by wearing masks and socially distancing. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. The US has recorded more than 13 million coronavirus cases and more than 266,000 people have died.

In another television appearance, he recommended Thanksgiving travellers to quarantine for a period of time ""if it's possible"". Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, echoed Dr Fauci's concerns, telling CBS News that people who had travelled for the holiday should avoid seeing relatives over the age of 65.

"Telecoms providers must stop installing Huawei equipment in the UK's 5G mobile network from September, the government has said. The announcement came ahead of a law being unveiled this afternoon, which bans the Chinese firm from the network. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said he was pushing for the ""complete removal of high-risk vendors"" from 5G networks. The new deadline falls earlier than expected, although maintaining old equipment will still be allowed. Networks will now have to adjust their schedules for deployment of the reserves of Huawei 5G kit they have built up. Previously, BT's EE division, Vodafone and Three UK would have had until 2027 to install any such equipment acquired before the end of this year - when a purchase ban comes into effect. Huawei told the BBC it would not be commenting on the announcement. Attempts to rid Huawei from the network have been ongoing for more than a year. But the new Telecommunications Security Bill is the first step in enshrining such bans in law, and offers details of exactly how it will work - if it is passed by Parliament. MPs will debate the bill atsecond reading in the Commons at about 15:30GMT,external. UK networks breaking new law face big fines Huawei sells youth brand over tech restrictions Questions over Huawei executive's arrest as legal battle continues It will give government national security powers, allowing them to give instructions to big telecoms companies, such as BT, about how they use so-called ""high-risk"" vendors like Huawei, if at all. It also threatens telecoms firms with hefty fines if they fail to comply with the new, higher security standards. They could total 10% of turnover or more than Â£100,000 per day. Mr Dowden said that the ""new and unprecedented powers"" would allow government to ""identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security"". ""We are also publishing a new strategy to make sure we are never again dependent on a handful of telecoms vendors for the smooth and secure running of our networks,"" he said. The ban on installations will be accompanied by measures to encourage more suppliers to enter the market and replace Huawei, and the development of new technologies that open up the market. There were fears firms might stockpile new kit and install it later, despite a ban on buying it from the end of 2020. Under the new strategy, the government will spend an initial Â£250m which will involve setting up a National Telecoms Lab research facility as well as investing in open radio technology. ""Our plans will spark a wave of innovation in the design of our future mobile networks,"" Mr Dowden added. It follows months of political wrangling, both in the UK and internationally, over Huawei's threat to security and its alleged links to the Chinese state. In July, the government ordered the complete removal of the company's kit from the entire 5G network by 2027, amid pressure from the US. The UK had initially decided that Huawei equipment should be removed from the sensitive part of the ""core"" network, and only make up a maximum of 35% of the non-core systems. The deadline was set to be 2023. Huawei, however, has dismissed concerns from both the US and its allies over its operations. Its vice-president Victor Zhang has previously said that the decision to remove the firm from the UK's 5G network was ""politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks"".

"Women are being ""completely let down"" by the justice system, according to a report examining the way rape cases are investigated and prosecuted. The report by several women's groups identified ""catastrophic systemic failures"" which are ""longstanding"". It is to be given to MPs on Monday, ahead of the government's rape review. Changes it recommends include no longer examining an alleged victim's sexual history in rape trials and urgent research into what survivors want. ""Rape as a public policy issue needs to go right up the political agenda,"" said campaigner Sarah Green. The report's contributors included organisations including Rape Crisis, the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), the End Violence Against Women (EVAW) Coalition, and BAME anti-violence campaign group Imkaan, and sought the views of rape and serious sexual assault victims. It found several recurring barriers to justice, including persistent myths that rape victims were ""asking for it"" or had dressed provocatively. It revealed cases that were dropped following scrutiny of mobile phone messages which suggested the defendant might have had a ""reasonable belief"" that the alleged victim consented to sex, despite medical evidence to the contrary. ""Despite legislation and policies that have imposed legal duties on the police and prosecutors to effectively investigate and prosecute rape, despite clear guidance on disregarding myths and stereotypes, and other measures designed to ensure fair trials - our report reveals catastrophic systemic failures in the criminal justice system that embolden serial rapists and misogynists and abandon traumatised victims,"" said Harriet Wistrich, CWJ director. Rape convictions at record low in England and Wales Why are rape prosecutions falling? Have confidence, come forward, rape victims urged Figures released by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in July showed the number of rape convictions in England and Wales had fallen to a record low. In 2019-20, 1,439 alleged rapists were convicted of rape or another crime - half the number three years ago. The number of completed prosecutions in ""rape-flagged"" cases was the lowest since tracking began in 2009. It led women's groups to suggest rape was being ""de-criminalised"", with perpetrators unlikely to face prosecution. Monday's report also recommends ""stronger leadership"" on sexual offences within the police and Crown Prosecution Service, specialist support for marginalised women and the creation of a ministerial post to focus on serious sexual offending. ""Real change requires criminal justice institutions to be held fully accountable and leadership in those institutions to demonstrate an absolute commitment to ensure anyone working in this area understands rape culture and is determined to tackle it,"" observed Ms Wistrich. The report also demands urgent research into the reporting of rape - who does and who doesn't go to the police and why - and understanding what survivors want from the justice system. It stated that failures in prosecuting rape and sexual assault cases were ""longstanding"" and there was broad consensus across this and previous reports into the issue over those failings and what needed to be done. ""It can feel as though the repeated commissioning of these reviews and inspections is a way for Government and other authorities to indicate concern, while never following through with the action and resources needed to make change,"" the report states. Ms Green, EVAW coalition director, urged the government ""to commit to long-term change"". ""The evidence is clear: women are being completely let down and discriminated against by the justice system,"" she said. ""Rape as a public policy issue needs to go right up the political agenda, with a clear ministerial lead and the intention to completely turn the current situation around.""

"Sir Philip Green and Jane Shepherdson, former director of Topshop, pictured in 2006 Sir Philip Green's failure to invest in his retail empire Arcadia has made its downfall ""inevitable"", a former boss of its best-known brand Topshop has said. Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is facing collapse putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Jane Shepherdson CBE, credited with turning Topshop into a global brand, said she expected an online retailer to buy the brand and close most stores. Arcadia had been seeking extra cash following lost sales amid the pandemic. But Ms Shepherdson, who ran Topshop until 2006, said that its problems went back much further than the coronavirus outbreak. She told the BBC's World at One programme that Sir Philip had ignored the rise of online shopping, and was now lumbered with a large and expensive store estate which was largely shut due to Covid. ""In addition to that I think the fact that he absolutely declined to invest all of the businesses [in Arcadia] means it was pretty much inevitable [it would fail]."" Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was How high could unemployment go? She said the ""most likely scenario"" for Topshop was that an online retailer would buy the brand, add it to their own portfolio and close most of the stores. ""It's incredibly sadâ¦ the worst thing is for all of the store staff, which are mostly women who are going to be unemployed. ""The supply chains are also going to take a massive hit. I imagine that orders will start to be cancelled very, very shortly."" Ms Shepherdson also accused Sir Philip of being a bully when she worked for him, adding that he used ""to shout at people all the time, he was disrespectful, dismissive, rude"". ""The reason I left was I spent five years keeping him at arm's length from what I considered to be my business, Topshop, and I realised at that point that I couldn't keep him at arm's length any longer and I would actually have to work with him if I stayed and I absolutely didn't want to do that."" The BBC has asked Sir Philip for a comment. Arcadia is a sprawling retail business that owns a chunk of the High Street's fashion brands, including Miss Selfridge, Topman, Wallis and Evans. Questions over the future of Sir Philip's retail empire were raised on Friday, after it emerged that talks with potential lenders for a Â£30m loan had failed. Arcadia was seeking extra cash as coronavirus had caused ""a material impact on trading"" across its businesses, it said. It now needs a breathing space from its creditors and, to gain that, is expected to file for administration. Administration gives a business protection from its creditors while it is put back on an even keel, or while parts or all of it are sold off. It needs the court to grant the appointment of specialist insolvency practitioners, who then look at the best way of raising money to repay its debts, keeping the business or parts of the business going if possible. The process can take up to a year. Even before coronavirus, Arcadia's best-known names were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Former City minister and once chairman of Marks and Spencer, Paul Myners, told the BBC: ""Covid has obviously been a significant factor but the truth is this group of brands has been haemorrhaging now for 15 years. It's become an insignificance. ""Sir Philip never really accepted the opportunity or challenge of online trading. He made no investment in that area at all."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List On Sunday, a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack: ""We tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" The whole retail sector is under pressure. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Sir Philip bought Arcadia Group in 2002. His wife, Lady Cristina Green, is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. In a colourful career, Sir Philip has been both lauded as the ""King of the High Street"" and branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". Read more about the businessman's journey here Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund which has 10,000 members. On Sunday, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Stephen Timms, called on the Green family to plug the gap. ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" the Labour MP said, adding he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip used his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme received their full pension. But he said that even if he did not provide a full top up, Arcadia workers should still receive the majority of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. Sir Philip sold BHS for Â£1 in 2015, a year before it went bust with a Â£571m pension deficit Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell wasrecently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. The collapse of Arcadia could affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans at the department store group JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". Some stores could close, but Arcadia's brands are household names, and are likely to survive in some form. Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of its big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it hasbought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. Arcadia's 13,000 workers face an anxious wait. One told the BBC: ""I'm really worried about what is going to happen to us, especially as it is so close to Christmas. ""It's already been a very tough time, I'm in a role where I can work from home, but I'm not relying on anything being there for me - I've started applying for other jobs."" Holders of vouchers and gift cards with the various Arcadia brands also face uncertainty - with the risk that these cards will become worthless. Administrators and any future owners will decide whether they will be accepted. If the brand folds, then cardholders are owed the money, but are a long way down on the priority list of creditors who need to be paid back after assets are sold. The BBC's business correspondent, Dominic O'Connell, says as with many other clothing retailers struggling with the pandemic shutdown, insolvency looks the only option. But, he says, two questions remain: Can the individual businesses find new owners to take them on, and what amount of public pressure will there be on the Greens to make good any shortfall in the Arcadia pension schemes?

"Over the past week, BBC Wales has asked readers to submit their questions about the coronavirus pandemic in Wales. We asked if there was anything you wanted to know and whether the rules are confusing you - and pledged to try and answer. Here's what you wanted to know. People die with coronavirus, not of coronavirus - just as people die with cancer, not of cancer. That is because the actual cause of death is the effect the virus - or cancer - has on the body. For example, Covid-19 can cause a huge degree of inflammation which becomes multi-organ failure and this is the cause of death. Similarly some cancers can, for example, damage blood vessels which causes bleeding in the brain - a stroke - which can be fatal. Therefore the damage to the body which causes death has been caused by coronavirus, but coronavirus is not the direct cause of death - the cause of death in this example would be organ failure. So the deaths are with, not of, coronavirus. In recording deaths with Covid-19, medical professionals will consider: ""Would this person be alive today if they had not caught coronavirus?"" It has been estimated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that 88.9% of deaths in Wales where doctors have mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, that it was the underlying cause of death. So in October, 236 deaths were due to Covid-19. But there were another 49 when Covid-19 was involved and mentioned on the death certificate, and a factor in the death. In Wales, Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 2,629 of deaths registered up to 7 November. It is important to note the figures released daily by Public Health Wales or weekly by the ONS do not include all people who have tested positive in 28 days. Rather, they include people who have had confirmed or suspected coronavirus within the past 28 days which isbelieved to have been a factor in their death. Taking safety measures such as working from home, staying home as much as possible and respecting the rules will put you in the best position to avoid the virus. However, anyone can catch coronavirus and anyone can pass it on. It only takes one interaction with someone who may not even realise they are infected to potentially catch coronavirus. While coronavirus is mostly transmitted when people cough, sneeze or talk, there are also some studies showing it can be transmitted by touching an infected surface - such as on groceries or packages delivered to your home. These studies have mostly been done in lab conditions and some experts have thrown doubt on the actual threat posed by surface transmission in real life. Either way - to best protect yourself from catching coronavirus from surfaces, regularly wash your hands for 20 seconds. If and when a vaccine (or more than one vaccine) is approved for use in the UK and begins to be rolled out, safety measures such as those you've listed will still need to be in place for some time. That's because it will take months to vaccinate everyone who wishes to be vaccinated. As you've correctly implied, there are still questions over whether uptake of the vaccine will be high due to misinformation and myths on social media, and there may be some people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. We have fact checked some of the most widely shared false claims. Even if the uptake is good, we are likely to be well into 2021 before all the relevant groups have been offered the vaccination - which will probably begin with front-line NHS staff and care staff, followed by the elderly and others most vulnerable to the virus. So we'll need to continue taking safety measures for the time being. It is early days, but it's likely the Welsh Government will continue to look at infection rates the way they have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic, and allow these measures to be dropped when scientific advisers believe it is safe to do so. It has been recognised throughout the pandemic that Welsh people have made sacrifices and continue to make sacrifices - and Mark Drakeford has repeated during news briefings that every death is a tragedy. In making decisions over lockdown measures, the Welsh Government looks at several factors including the R number - the average number of people a sick person could pass the virus on to. The aim of lockdowns is to reduce the R number below one, which means case numbers would begin to fall - therefore fewer people are getting ill, leading to fewer hospital admissions so the NHS does not become overwhelmed, and fewer deaths. Lockdown restrictions since March, along with social distancing and other safety measures, have served to shrink the R number. This modelling chart looks at the worse case scenario for deaths by day, if there is a slow response in Wales However, as the country has moved out of lockdowns, the R number has risen again. In September, a ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for this winter was published by Swansea University experts, mentioning 636,000 infections, leading to 18,200 hospital admissions - peaking in January - and potentially 6,300 deaths. Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales If the NHS becomes overwhelmed, this does not just affect Covid patients but it restricts the organisation in how well other services such as cancer referrals and A&E can operate. This shows how the range of the R-number has changed in Wales. The Welsh Government's latest estimate is that it could be as high as 1.4 It is expected to take years before NHS waiting times are back to pre-coronavirus levels in Wales, according to the organisation's boss. The number of people waiting more than 36 weeks for planned hospital treatments is six times higher than at the start of 2020. Waiting list figures,published in November for the first time since March, showed nearly 169,000 people waiting. The number has grown after most non-urgent treatment was postponed to prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave. Since then, the service has been trying to restart non-emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave. The fear, of course, is that people who have missed out on early intervention as a result will have missed an opportunity for early treatment - such as in the case of Simon Green whose scan was delayed and brain tumour subsequently found to be inoperable. This video can not be played Why this cancer patient feels coronavirus has 'cost me a future' As a result of such delays, Prof Tom Crosby of the Wales Cancer Network said as many as 2,000 people could die. The Welsh Government said work was under way to address the issue with health boards. But there are fears had such measures not been taken to reduce pressures on the NHS, the organisation could have been overwhelmed - which would also result in deaths. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? 'I want to know how my dad got coronavirus' How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? ""Not acting would have meant that not only would the health service have been overwhelmed with very poor care of Covid and non-Covid patients, but it also would have been disastrous for our staff,"" Vaughan Gething said. Bacterial infections and viruses are different and, for example, antibiotics only work on bacterial infections and not viruses. However, anti-bacterial hand sanitisers or cleaning products can also be effective on some viruses if the alcohol concentration is high enough. Viruses similar to the structure of coronavirus are sensitive to alcohol and detergents, which can help break down their oily, fatty shells. Hand washing with soap is still the best cleaning practice, according to the NHS. This data is not routinely released, and there could be data protection issues if it were. But local authorities and the Welsh Government have occasionally referenced why lockdown measures have needed to be tightened in certain areas. For example, schools in Cardigan have closed for two weeks after a spike in cases in the area, with Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn blaming ""super-spreader events"" such as ""parties"" and ""pub crawls"". When parts of the south Wales valleys were placed under stricter lockdown measures, transmissions were believed to have been occurring due topeople going into each others' homes and not adhering to social distancing. And measures have been taken in hospitals and care homes when there is evidence of transmission there. So while this data is not routinely made available to the public, when it leads to specific decisions on restrictions, an explanation is usually given. While it takes a few weeks or even longer to fully understand the impact any change in restrictions has made, there are promising early signs the firebreak has helped, the Welsh Government says. The chief medical officer's analysis said the evidence was now ""good enough"" that it did ""succeed"". Mark Drakeford said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was ""stabilising"". ""What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care,"" he added. ""We're seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising. ""What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don't fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again."" Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown. Yes - to some areas. Travel in and out of Wales from England was previously banned unless you had a valid and essential reason, but Welsh Government rules updated on 3 December have changed this. From 18:00 GMT on Friday, travel is only banned between Wales and tier 3 areas of England and tier 3 and 4 areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland. This means you are now able to travel to and from tier 1 and 2 areas - replacing the previous blanket travel ban - although the government strongly advises against travelling to those areas at all. Here's how to find out which tier an area of England is in. Between 23 and 27 December, you can travel anywhere in the UK to form your Christmas bubble. There were calls earlier this year for a spike in excess deaths in January and February in Ceredigion to be investigated. In the first 17 weeks of the year 342 deaths were registered in Ceredigion, according to figures obtained by Newyddion S4C - 22% more than the five-year average. MP Ben Lake wanted to know if Covid-19 was present before it was realised. Cardiff University's Rhian Daniel said this was not ""highly likely"" and was likely due to a similar infection. However, due to antibodies potentially fading to undetectable levels a few months after infection, taking an antibody test now probably wouldn't identify whether that virus you had last winter really was Covid-19 or another virus causing similar symptoms. Scientists and doctors in some European countries haveclaimed to have found evidence of coronavirus circulating earlier than previously thought. And with evidence of coronavirus arriving in the UK onat least 1,300 separate occasions, we may never know exactly when the UK saw its patient zero. Long Covid has now been recognised as a medical condition, and healthcare workers are receiving guidance on it. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. It can utterly destroy people's quality of life, and it is not necessarily people who were severely ill in hospital who are struck by it. Even people with relatively mild infections can be left with lasting and severe health problems. Read more on Long Covid here. Covid-19 simply references the year the virus was first identified in Wuhan - 2019. Official names were announced for the virus responsible for Covid-19 - previously known as ""2019 novel coronavirus"". The virus is calledsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the illness it causes is calledcoronavirus disease (Covid-19). Referencing the word SARShas been avoided by the World Health Organisation,externaldue to its potential for spreading fear, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003.

"This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Boris Johnson has agreed to publish the health, economic and social data behind England's new tier system later, as he seeks to avert a Commons rebellion. MPs will vote on the measures on Tuesday, and numerous Conservative MPs have demanded to see the evidence government is basing its new system on. Writing to a group of around 70 MPs - who are sceptical of the new rules - Mr Johnson called for ""unity and resolve"". Labour is expected to support the PM, but is yet to confirm its stance. If Labour does decide to get behind the new tier system, the government should easily win the vote - even if there is a sizeable revolt among Conservative MPs. The information is expected to include data first published by the Office for Budget Responsibility last week. Covid infections fall by 30% over lockdown - study Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus Covid 'could delay cancer advances by over a year' England's new system - due to replace the national lockdown when it expires on Wednesday - will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. Nearly all of England will be in the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. The PM's letter to Tories from the Covid Recovery Group is his second letter to colleagues over the weekend, as he seeks to reassure them about the measures. In an earlier letterto all MPs and peers, the prime minister said the rules in some areas could be eased in December, MPs could vote again on the measures in January, and the tier system could end on 3 February. But some Conservative MPs have complained their constituencies are entering one of the tougher tiers, despite cases in their areas falling, and asked to see the data behind the measures. The contents of one document could determine the size of Tuesday's Conservative revolt. The government has conceded a key demand of the rebels - to produce an assessment of the economic and social impact of the restrictions. Put very crudely, MPs want to know if the lives these tiers will save will outweigh livelihoods that will be lost. Privately, some other potential rebels are indicating they are prepared to be convinced by the government's arguments. And Mr Johnson's efforts to win over his sceptics seem to be making some headway. The former minister Conor Burns - an old ally of Mr Johnson's - had been critical of how the government intended to impose its restrictions. But he told the Westminster Hour he won't be voting against them, saying: ""We've got the vaccine coming over the horizon. If the government really feels we need to do this then I'm probably prepared to swallow hard and support them."" But some other potential rebels have told the BBC that they are withholding their support unless and until they see the hard data behind the PM's decisions. In his letter to the Covid Recovery Group, Mr Johnson said he'd ""responded positively"" to their ""constructive proposals"". The next 24 hours will see him continue the campaign of persuasion with his own backbenchers. Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said he was ""particularly concerned about some of the non-Covid health implications these restrictions have been having"". And he urged the government to publish details of what extra support would be made available, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of the new tier system before Tuesday's vote. Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to increase the grants given to businesses. He said the hospitality sector in his region is ""facing crisis"". Speaking during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturers in Wales, Mr Johnson said he understood people's ""frustrations"" particularly those in the hospitality sector. He said the best thing for the industry would be to ""keep the virus under control, use mass testing, roll that out in ever greater numbers, plus the vaccine if, as I hope, we can start to distribute them."" In his letter to MPs, the PM also said the government would: Introduce daily testing for those who have had close contact with a Covid case - an alternative to the current requirement for contacts to self isolate for 10 days Carry out more rapid tests to identify asymptomatic carriers and protect the vulnerable Publish the results of surveys on compliance, which reveal why people breach self-isolation Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice acknowledged a large number of Conservative MPs were ""unsettled"" and said the prime minister would be ""working very hard"" to reassure those MPs that he doesn't want to ""maintain the measures for a moment longer than is necessary"". He added he would be surprised if Labour voted against the steps, adding ""it is not the moment for any party to play politics."" Speaking at a virtual town hall with residents from Lancaster and Morecambe, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""need for restrictions"" and that the Labour Party ""has to act in the national interest"". He expressed concerned that the government ""doesn't have the support package right"" and said people in the North West ""are tearing their hair out saying ""we've been in restrictions for months and need better support.'"" Sir Keir and other members of the shadow cabinet are due to meet England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance later, as they decide whether to vote with the government. However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns. The party is urging the government to release the evidence underpinning the new system; commit to involving local authorities; and offer urgent support to pubs. Meanwhile, a major study from Imperial College London has found that coronavirus infections in Englandfell by about a third over lockdown. Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, but cases still remained high across England. Researchers estimated thatthe virus's reproduction (R) ratehad fallen to 0.88, meaning the epidemic is shrinking. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announcednew rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus caseswhich will come into force from 18:00 GMT on Friday. On Sunday, a further 12,155 positive coronavirus test results were recorded across the UK, bringing the total to 1,617,327. A further 215 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded, bringing the total to 58,245. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"US airports experienced their highest passenger numbers since March The US could see ""surge upon surge"" of coronavirus cases as people return home from the Thanksgiving holiday, a top US disease expert has warned. Speaking on Sunday, Dr Anthony Fauci said it was ""not too late"" for those yet to travel to help curb the virus by wearing masks and socially distancing. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. The US has recorded more than 13 million coronavirus cases and more than 266,000 people have died. As of Sunday, the number of Covid-19 cases recorded in November has surpassed four million,double the figure recorded in October,external. US holds subdued Thanksgiving celebrations Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? Last year, an estimated 26 million people passed through US airports in the week surrounding the holiday. Health experts had called for people to spend Thanksgiving at home, but this week US airports marked their busiest period since mid-March. Anywhere from 800,000 to more than one million travellers passed through US airport checkpointson any day during the past week,external, according to Transport Security Administration statistics. ""There is almost certainly going to be an uptick because of what has happened with the travel,"" Dr Fauci told CNN's State of the Union. In another television appearance, he recommended Thanksgiving travellers to quarantine for a period of time ""if it's possible"". Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, echoed Dr Fauci's concerns, telling CBS News that people who had travelled for the holiday should avoid seeing relatives over the age of 65. ""Now we're entering this post-Thanksgiving surge with three, four and 10 times as much disease across the country,"" she said. ""We are deeply worried"".

"During the 1980s KMS trained the Special Task Force, an elite unit of the Sri Lankan police, and also taught the countryâs air force British mercenaries who were involved in the Sri Lankan civil war are being investigated for war crimes by the Metropolitan Police. Private security company Keenie Meenie Services (KMS) trained an elite unit of the Sri Lankan police called the Special Task Force (STF) in the 1980s to fight Tamil separatists. The STF has been implicated in a number of human rights abuses. These have included executions without trial and killings of Tamil civilians. The investigation is believed to be the first time British mercenaries have been investigated by the Met, which is the UK force responsible for investigating accusations of war crimes or human rights abuses. A police spokesperson said the Met had received a referral in March concerning allegations of war crimes committed by British mercenaries and following a ""scoping exercise"", it had launched an investigation. Allegations of war crimes committed by British mercenaries in Sri Lanka are detailed in Phil Millerâs book Much of the evidence concerning KMS's involvement in Sri Lanka has come from declassified UK government documents and freedom of information requests submitted by journalist Phil Miller, whose book, Keenie Meenie: The British Mercenaries Who Got Away With War Crimes, was published in January. He said the investigation was being closely followed by the UK's 200,000 strong Tamil community - many of whom fled to London during the civil war in Sri Lanka. ""A lot of Tamil people became refugees in the 1980s, that's when KMS were there,"" Mr Miller said. ""People remember being attacked by helicopter gunships so I think people are quite shocked to learn that in many of those cases helicopters were flown by British mercenaries."" The Sri Lankan army defeated Tamil Tiger rebels in May 2009 after 26 years of bloody conflict. The war divided Sri Lanka along ethnic lines - pitting the majority Buddhist Sinhalese-dominated government against Tamil rebels who wanted a separate state. The fighting killed an estimated 100,000 people and left about 20,000, mostly Tamils, missing. At the end of the war, the United Nations accused both sides of atrocities, especially during the conflict's final stages. Earlier this year,Sri Lanka's president acknowledged for the first timethat those who had disappeared were dead. KMS was founded by David Walker, a former SAS officer. KMS no longer exists but the 78-year-old is one of the directors of a subsequent company, Saladin Security, which is based in Kensington. Mr Walker has strongly maintained that nobody from KMS was complicit in war crimes in Sri Lanka. In a statement, his representative said: ""The allegations that David Walker or staff of KMS Limited were complicit in war crimes in Sri Lanka in the mid-1980s is categorically denied. ""[Saladin Security] is an entirely separate company from KMS and had no involvement in Sri Lanka. Mr Walker was neither a shareholder or director of KMS. ""The [War Crimes] Unit has not yet asked for assistance from Saladin or Mr Walker but they will be happy to co-operate if asked.""

"This video can not be played Laura Foster explains the new three tier system for England Boris Johnson has agreed to publish the health, economic and social data behind England's new tier system later, as he seeks to avert a Commons rebellion. MPs will vote on the measures on Tuesday, and numerous Conservative MPs have demanded to see the evidence government is basing its new system on. Writing to a group of around 70 MPs - who are sceptical of the new rules - Mr Johnson called for ""unity and resolve"". Labour is expected to support the PM, but is yet to confirm its stance. If Labour does decide to get behind the new tier system, the government should easily win the vote - even if there is a sizeable revolt among Conservative MPs. The information is expected to include data first published by the Office for Budget Responsibility last week. Covid infections fall by 30% over lockdown - study Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus Covid 'could delay cancer advances by over a year' England's new system - due to replace the national lockdown when it expires on Wednesday - will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. Nearly all of England will be in the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. The PM's letter to Tories from the Covid Recovery Group is his second letter to colleagues over the weekend, as he seeks to reassure them about the measures. In an earlier letterto all MPs and peers, the prime minister said the rules in some areas could be eased in December, MPs could vote again on the measures in January, and the tier system could end on 3 February. But some Conservative MPs have complained their constituencies are entering one of the tougher tiers, despite cases in their areas falling, and asked to see the data behind the measures. The contents of one document could determine the size of Tuesday's Conservative revolt. The government has conceded a key demand of the rebels - to produce an assessment of the economic and social impact of the restrictions. Put very crudely, MPs want to know if the lives these tiers will save will outweigh livelihoods that will be lost. Privately, some other potential rebels are indicating they are prepared to be convinced by the government's arguments. And Mr Johnson's efforts to win over his sceptics seem to be making some headway. The former minister Conor Burns - an old ally of Mr Johnson's - had been critical of how the government intended to impose its restrictions. But he told the Westminster Hour he won't be voting against them, saying: ""We've got the vaccine coming over the horizon. If the government really feels we need to do this then I'm probably prepared to swallow hard and support them."" But some other potential rebels have told the BBC that they are withholding their support unless and until they see the hard data behind the PM's decisions. In his letter to the Covid Recovery Group, Mr Johnson said he'd ""responded positively"" to their ""constructive proposals"". The next 24 hours will see him continue the campaign of persuasion with his own backbenchers. Conservative MP Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said he was ""particularly concerned about some of the non-Covid health implications these restrictions have been having"". And he urged the government to publish details of what extra support would be made available, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of the new tier system before Tuesday's vote. Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street has asked Chancellor Rishi Sunak to increase the grants given to businesses. He said the hospitality sector in his region is ""facing crisis"". Speaking during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturers in Wales, Mr Johnson said he understood people's ""frustrations"" particularly those in the hospitality sector. He said the best thing for the industry would be to ""keep the virus under control, use mass testing, roll that out in ever greater numbers, plus the vaccine if, as I hope, we can start to distribute them."" In his letter to MPs, the PM also said the government would: Introduce daily testing for those who have had close contact with a Covid case - an alternative to the current requirement for contacts to self isolate for 10 days Carry out more rapid tests to identify asymptomatic carriers and protect the vulnerable Publish the results of surveys on compliance, which reveal why people breach self-isolation Speaking to the BBC, Environment Secretary George Eustice acknowledged a large number of Conservative MPs were ""unsettled"" and said the prime minister would be ""working very hard"" to reassure those MPs that he doesn't want to ""maintain the measures for a moment longer than is necessary"". He added he would be surprised if Labour voted against the steps, adding ""it is not the moment for any party to play politics."" Speaking at a virtual town hall with residents from Lancaster and Morecambe, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""need for restrictions"" and that the Labour Party ""has to act in the national interest"". He expressed concerned that the government ""doesn't have the support package right"" and said people in the North West ""are tearing their hair out saying ""we've been in restrictions for months and need better support.'"" Sir Keir and other members of the shadow cabinet are due to meet England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance later, as they decide whether to vote with the government. However, one Labour MP, Richard Burgon, has already said he will vote against the tier system, arguing that it will fail to lower the infection rate and make another lockdown more likely. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the system as ""chaotic"" and said his party would not back the measures until the prime minister addressed their concerns. The party is urging the government to release the evidence underpinning the new system; commit to involving local authorities; and offer urgent support to pubs. Meanwhile, a major study from Imperial College London has found that coronavirus infections in Englandfell by about a third over lockdown. Some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, but cases still remained high across England. Researchers estimated thatthe virus's reproduction (R) ratehad fallen to 0.88, meaning the epidemic is shrinking. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford announcednew rules to tackle a rise in coronavirus caseswhich will come into force from 18:00 GMT on Friday. On Sunday, a further 12,155 positive coronavirus test results were recorded across the UK, bringing the total to 1,617,327.

"This video can not be played Diego Maradona's doctor gave a tearful interview after the footballer's death Argentine prosecutors are investigating Diego Maradona's doctor for possible manslaughter following the footballing legend's death four days ago. Police in Buenos Aires have searched the house and private clinic of Leopoldo Luque as they try to establish if there was negligence in Maradona's treatment following surgery. The 60-year-old died of a heart attack at his home where he was recuperating. Dr Luque has not been charged. He denies any wrongdoing. Maradona had a successful operation on a brain blood clot earlier in November and had been due to be treated for alcohol dependency. Maradona dies aged 60 - tributes and reaction 'To be Maradona was incredibly beautiful, but also hard' His daughters have pressed for details about their father's medication. Some 30 police officers raided 39-year-old Dr Luque's house on Sunday morning - with another 20 going into his clinic in the capital Buenos Aires. Officers are looking into records into the treatment of the football legend The raids were ordered by prosecutors trying to build a picture of Maradona's last days at home. They retrieved computers, mobile phones and medical notes, officials say. There are suspicions that the star's convalescence at home might not have met the conditions of his discharge from the clinic, such as a 24-hour team of nurses ""specialised in substance abuse"", the on-call presence of doctors and a stand-by ambulance equipped with a defibrillator. Officials want to know about Dr Luque's involvement in Maradona's recovery arrangements at the late star's house. In an emotional press conference on Sunday, Dr Luque - who has been described as the footballer's personal physician  - cried, saying he had done all he could to save the life of a friend. He said Maradona had been very sad lately. At one point, the doctor shot back at reporters: ""You want to know what I am responsible for? For having loved him, for having taken care of him, for having extended his life, for having improved it to the end."" The doctor said he had done ""everything he could, up to the impossible"". Then addressing some of the concerns authorities are looking into, Dr Luque cast doubt on what his role actually was. ''If you ask me, I'm a neurosurgeon and my job ended. I was done with him,"" he said referring to November's surgery - and insisting Maradona's convalescence at home was not his responsibility. This video can not be played Diego Maradona ""will live in our heart forever"" ""He [Maradona] should have gone to a rehabilitation centre. He didn't want to,"" Dr Luque said, calling the late star ""unmanageable"". He also said he did not know why there was no defibrillator or who was responsible for the fact that there was no ambulance outside Maradona's house. And he added: Diego ""was very sad, he wanted to be alone, and it's not because he didn't love his daughters, his family, or those around him"". Diego Maradona was captain when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous ""Hand of God"" goal against England in the quarter-finals. Obituary - Argentina's flawed football icon An extraordinary life in pictures Maradona played for Barcelona and Napoli during his club career, winning two Serie A titles with the Italian side. He started his career with Argentinos Juniors, also playing for Sevilla, and Boca Juniors and Newell's Old Boys in his homeland. He scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina, representing them in four World Cups. This video can not be played Diego Maradona: Argentina legend Maradona explains his infamous 'Hand of God' goal Maradona led his country to the 1990 final in Italy, where they were beaten by West Germany, before captaining them again in the United States in 1994, but was sent home after failing a drugs test for ephedrine. During the second half of his career, Maradona struggled with cocaine addiction and was banned for 15 months after testing positive for the drug in 1991. He retired from professional football in 1997, on his 37th birthday, during his second stint at Argentine giants Boca Juniors. Having briefly managed two sides in Argentina during his playing career, Maradona was appointed head coach of the national team in 2008 and left after the 2010 World Cup, where his side were beaten by Germany in the quarter-finals. He subsequently managed teams in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico and was in charge of Gimnasia y Esgrima in Argentina's top flight at the time of his death.

"Advances in cancer research could be delayed by nearly 18 months due to the coronavirus pandemic, scientists fear. A survey of more than 200 scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research suggested research could be delayed by six months, due to factors including the first lockdown and capacity limits. Other issues like charity funding, and research being shifted to Covid-19, mean major advances delayed by an average of 17 months, they said. Researchers called for more funding. They said that any long-lasting damage to cancer advances could be avoided if there is more government support or charity donations. There have also been concerns about the effect the pandemic could have had on cancer more widely. The NHS's former cancer director Prof Sir Mike Richards has said Englandcould see its first decrease in survival ratesfor decades. In England, 60% fewer patients with suspected cancer were seen in April, compared to the previous year. Blood test for 50 cancers to be trialled Year-long waits for hospital care worst since 2008 The ICR surveyed 239 of its researchers to gauge the impact of its research. Those who took part in the survey said they had lost an average of 10 weeks of research time due to the first lockdown - this was mostly due to not being able to access laboratories. Researchers who took part in the survey on average spent 53% of their working time in a laboratory before lockdown - this decreased to 5% during lockdown, and is now at 34%. Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said:  ""Our researchers are passionate about making advances to benefit patients, so it has been hugely frustrating that their work has been so disrupted, although also inspiring to see how well they have adapted to the restrictions the pandemic has imposed on our lives."" He said the results were ""sobering"" but added: ""Our survey though does provide solutions to mitigate the impact - in the form of investment in staffing, new technologies and computing power."" ICR labs have stayed open during England's second lockdown, with measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus. The institute's deputy director of clinical trials and statistics, Prof Emma Hall, said ""non-Covid clinical research pretty much shut down within the NHS"" during the first lockdown, which started in March. She said: ""Our work relies on new clinical trials starting up and existing ones continuing to happen - and Covid-19 has made that incredibly challenging. The pandemic has meant that it will take longer to answer the questions asked in our trials, and that will delay new treatments getting to patients."" But she said the pandemic also brought about some positive changes. Prof Hall added: ""We can capture and manage data remotely rather than relying on paper. The Covid-19 trials have also shown how research can benefit from easier access to routine medical data - hopefully this will be translated to other clinical research and mean more streamlined, simpler to run trials. ""I hope we can use this experience to benefit cancer patients in the long term, but that will only be possible with more support or future advances will be delayed.""

"Sir Philip Green and Jane Shepherdson, former director of Topshop, pictured in 2006 Sir Philip Green's failure to invest in his retail empire Arcadia has made its downfall ""inevitable"", a former boss of its best-known brand Topshop has said. Arcadia, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, is facing collapse putting 13,000 jobs at risk. Jane Shepherdson CBE, credited with turning Topshop into a global brand, said she expected an online retailer to buy the brand and close most stores. Arcadia had been seeking extra cash following lost sales amid the pandemic. But Ms Shepherdson, who ran Topshop until 2006, said that its problems went back much further than the coronavirus outbreak. She told the BBC's World at One programme that Sir Philip had ignored the rise of online shopping, and was now lumbered with a large and expensive store estate which was largely shut due to Covid. ""In addition to that I think the fact that he absolutely declined to invest all of the businesses [in Arcadia] means it was pretty much inevitable [it would fail]."" Is my pension ruined if a retail empire crumbles? Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was How high could unemployment go? She said the ""most likely scenario"" for Topshop was that an online retailer would buy the brand, add it to their own portfolio and close most of the stores. ""It's incredibly sadâ¦ the worst thing is for all of the store staff, which are mostly women who are going to be unemployed. ""The supply chains are also going to take a massive hit. I imagine that orders will start to be cancelled very, very shortly."" Ms Shepherdson also accused Sir Philip of being a bully when she worked for him, adding that he used ""to shout at people all the time, he was disrespectful, dismissive, rude"". ""The reason I left was I spent five years keeping him at arm's length from what I considered to be my business, Topshop, and I realised at that point that I couldn't keep him at arm's length any longer and I would actually have to work with him if I stayed and I absolutely didn't want to do that."" The BBC has asked Sir Philip for a comment. Arcadia is a sprawling retail business that owns a chunk of the High Street's fashion brands, including Miss Selfridge, Topman, Wallis and Evans. Questions over the future of Sir Philip's retail empire were raised on Friday, after it emerged that talks with potential lenders for a Â£30m loan had failed. Arcadia was seeking extra cash as coronavirus had caused ""a material impact on trading"" across its businesses, it said. It now needs a breathing space from its creditors and, to gain that, is expected to file for administration. Administration gives a business protection from its creditors while it is put back on an even keel, or while parts or all of it are sold off. It needs the court to grant the appointment of specialist insolvency practitioners, who then look at the best way of raising money to repay its debts, keeping the business or parts of the business going if possible. The process can take up to a year. Even before coronavirus, Arcadia's best-known names were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing. Former City minister and once chairman of Marks and Spencer, Paul Myners, told the BBC: ""Covid has obviously been a significant factor but the truth is this group of brands has been haemorrhaging now for 15 years. It's become an insignificance. ""Sir Philip never really accepted the opportunity or challenge of online trading. He made no investment in that area at all."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List On Sunday, a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack: ""We tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" The whole retail sector is under pressure. On Friday, menswear retailer Moss Bros launched a restructuring of its business after it said trading had been ""severely impacted"" by Covid-19. Earlier this month, fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer. Sir Philip bought Arcadia Group in 2002. His wife, Lady Cristina Green, is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. In a colourful career, Sir Philip has been both lauded as the ""King of the High Street"" and branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". Read more about the businessman's journey here Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund which has 10,000 members. On Sunday, the chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Stephen Timms, called on the Green family to plug the gap. ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" the Labour MP said, adding he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip used his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme received their full pension. But he said that even if he did not provide a full top up, Arcadia workers should still receive the majority of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. Sir Philip sold BHS for Â£1 in 2015, a year before it went bust with a Â£571m pension deficit Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell wasrecently sentenced to six years for tax evasion. The collapse of Arcadia could affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans at the department store group JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". Some stores could close, but Arcadia's brands are household names, and are likely to survive in some form. Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of its big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it hasbought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast. Arcadia's 13,000 workers face an anxious wait. One told the BBC: ""I'm really worried about what is going to happen to us, especially as it is so close to Christmas. ""It's already been a very tough time, I'm in a role where I can work from home, but I'm not relying on anything being there for me - I've started applying for other jobs."" Holders of vouchers and gift cards with the various Arcadia brands also face uncertainty - with the risk that these cards will become worthless. Administrators and any future owners will decide whether they will be accepted. If the brand folds, then cardholders are owed the money, but are a long way down on the priority list of creditors who need to be paid back after assets are sold. The BBC's business correspondent, Dominic O'Connell, says as with many other clothing retailers struggling with the pandemic shutdown, insolvency looks the only option. But, he says, two questions remain: Can the individual businesses find new owners to take them on, and what amount of public pressure will there be on the Greens to make good any shortfall in the Arcadia pension schemes?

"Sir Philip Green's retail empire could collapse within hours, as a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC they do not expect any last-minute rescue deal. The company, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is set to enter administration on Monday. That would put 13,000 jobs at risk. Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has, however, offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia to try to help the group with its cash-flow problems in the short-term. ""Our offer would allow you to retain employment for many thousands of your staff, reopen hundreds of stores when the current lockdown ends, and protect the financial positions of thousands of members in your pension schemes,"" a letter addressed to Arcadia Group executives seen by the BBC says. The letter also says that the Frasers Group would consider giving out the emergency cash on an unsecured basis - meaning Arcadia would not need to put up collateral, such as property, to guarantee it would be paid back. ""We would urge you to carefully consider this offer,"" it says. But the Arcadia Group insider told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack earlier on Sunday: ""If this was about Â£50m we could find that in five minutes."" The source added: ""This is obviously a sad day, we tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia's brands once dominated High Street fashion, but its chains have been hit hard by store closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the strength of online clothing retailers such as Boohoo and Asos. This appears to be the end of the road for Sir Philip's epic retail journey. One that has brought him riches, a knighthood and a government request to use his magic for public sector procurement. It's also brought him infamy, public condemnation and lawsuits settled controversially. He has been branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". But to some he is a skilled businessman and shrewd financier who created thousands of jobs. He can also be generous - providing financial assistance and long-term healthcare support for dozens of his employees. Sir Philip doesn't really do humble but I believe he does consider this administration a genuinely sad day for the employees, the business and his own legacy. In the end he was operating in a world of modern retail that required a completely different skill set to the one he undoubtedly possessed. Sir Philipis chairman of the Arcadia group, while his wife Cristina is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005, two years after buying the business. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. The BBC understands Sir Philip is on his super-yacht Lionheart, which is docked in Monaco's harbour. He has so far declined requests for an interview. A BBC reporter in the principality said there was no sign of Sir Philip on deck, but crew members were busy cleaning the 90m-long vessel. Sir Philip's superyacht is docked in Monaco Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms has called on the Green family to plug the gap. The Labour MP said: ""This is a dreadful time for Arcadia staff to be worrying about their jobs and their pensions."" ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" he said. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Mr Timms said he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator on Monday. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip chose to use his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme receive their full pension. But Mr Ralfe said even if the retail magnate did not do that - or if he writes a cheque that is substantially less than Â£350m - Arcadia workers should still receive most of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. ""The good news is the government has a lifeboat - the Pension Protection Fund - which is designed to make sure that people get compensation if their company goes bust,"" he said. ""The compensation they get isn't the full 100% of the pension promise they were expecting, but it's not far short."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List Mr Ralfe has previously said Sir Philip seemed to have ""learnt his lesson"" from the pension scandal involving BHS a few years ago. Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store to businessman Dominic Chappell in 2015 for Â£1, but a year later it collapsed. Around 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of selling BHS to avoid responsibility for the deficit - to inject Â£363m into the scheme. Commentators say the situation with Arcadia is very different and point to the fact that last year Lady Green agreed to pump Â£100m into Arcadia's two pension schemes over three years. Labour's Stephen Timms said he will write a letter to the Pensions Regulator on Monday, ""to underline the importance of securing the interests of [Arcadia Group's] pension scheme members"". The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund are understood to be staying closely informed of decisions affecting Arcadia Group. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams The imminent collapse of Arcadia could also have implications for Debenhams, scuppering a potential sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for around Â£75m of sales. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. It has already cut some 6,500 jobs since May. Debenhams now has around 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". A final decision is expected within days.

"This video can not be played A helicopter crew found the unusual object while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area A mysterious metal monolith discovered last week in the desert in the US state of Utah has disappeared, officials say. Utah's Bureau of Land Management said it had seen credible reports the object had been removed ""by an unknown party"". Social media images apparently from the site show a pile of rocks and a small piece of metal left behind. The discovery of the 12ft (3.7m) high object sparked a national guessing game as to how it got there, and saw dozens of people pay a visit in recent days. The strange metal object was first spotted on 18 November by a helicopter crew counting big horn sheep from the air, in a remote south-eastern area of Utah. News of its discovery and speculation over its origins quickly went viral on social media, with many observers presuming it was an art installation left by a sculptor. As yet no-one has claimed responsibility for installing the structure. Internet sleuths got there, but the monolith's origins are still a mystery Allow Instagram content?
