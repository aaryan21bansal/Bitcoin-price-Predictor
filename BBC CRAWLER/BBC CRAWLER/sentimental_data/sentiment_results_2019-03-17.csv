"Flight data from the Ethiopian Airlines disaster a week ago suggest ""clear similarities"" with a crash off Indonesia last October, Ethiopia's transport minister has said. Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. Last Sunday the Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told journalists that a preliminary report would be released within 30 days. ""Clear similarities were noted between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610, which would be the subject of further study during the investigation,"" Ms Dagmawit told journalists on Sunday. In both cases flight tracking data showed the aircraft's altitude had fluctuated sharply, as the planes seemed to experience erratic climbs and descents. A mass funeral for the victims of last week's crash took place in the Ethiopian capital Boeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg later reaffirmed that the company was supporting the investigation. In a statement, he added that Boeing was going ahead with a software update that will address the behaviour of the flight control system ""in response to erroneous sensor inputs"". Empty coffins buried after Ethiopia crash Ethiopian Airlines: Who are the victims? Which airlines use the Boeing 737 Max 8? Also on Sunday, ceremonies took place both in Kenya and Ethiopia to honour the victims. Thousands of people gathered in the Holy Trinity cathedral in Addis Ababa where empty coffins were draped in the national flag. None of the bodies has yet been formally identified because of the impact. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 took off from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport on the morning of 10 March, bound for Nairobi in Kenya. Minutes into the flight, the pilot reported difficulties and asked to return. Visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor Flightradar24 said the plane's ""vertical speed was unstable after take-off"". An eyewitness at the scene told the BBC there was an intense fire as the aircraft hit the ground. French air safety investigators examined the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - or black boxes as they are often called - and have handed over their findings to their Ethiopian counterparts. On 29 October Lion Air Flight 610 crashed after taking off from Jakarta airport, killing 189 people. The families of the victims visited the site of the crash to pay tribute Investigators later identified problems with the anti-stall system, which is designed to stop a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle where it could lose its lift. During flight JT610, the system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor. Pilots tried to correct this by pointing the nose higher, until the system pushed it down again. This happened more than 20 times. Following the second crash, airlines around the world grounded their Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.

"The man was seen shouting abuse and brandishing weapons in Viola Avenue, Stanwell Counter terror police are investigating a suspected far-right inspired attack in which a 19-year-old man was stabbed. The victim suffered non-fatal injuries after being struck by a man armed with a baseball bat and knife and shouting racist abuse in Stanwell, Surrey. The man, 50, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and a racially-aggravated public order offence. Home Secretary Sajid Javid called on society to ""reject the terrorists and extremists who seek to divide us"". He added: ""Now's the moment for us all to challenge the hatred, ignorance and violence they peddle and stand up for the kind of country we are and want to be. ""A welcoming, tolerant, proudly diverse country that draws strength and prosperity from that diversity."" He added: ""To any communities who are feeling vulnerable and under threat I say we are with you. Police were seen entering a property in the street ""You benefit our country, you are part of our country, part of us."" The incident occurred on Saturday night. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment; the extent of his injuries has not been confirmed. Prime Minister Theresa May thanked the emergency services and said her thoughts were with the injured man and his family and friends. She added: ""Vile, hateful far-right extremism has no place in our society."" Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said: ""Whilst this investigation is still in its infancy, it has hallmarks of a terror event, inspired by the far right, and therefore it has been declared a terrorism incident."" The man had been seen brandishing weapons and shouting abuse on Viola Road. When police, including armed officers, arrived they found several vehicles damaged. Nemer Salem, who lives on Viola Road, said he heard a man shouting racist abuse out of a window. Mr Salem, who came to London six years ago from Syria, said he had moved to the area two weeks ago. The 24-year-old said: ""He started saying some crazy things about Muslims and just shut the window and went inside. ""I'm a Muslim and I got a little bit worried."" He added: ""He wasn't showing himself, he was opening the window but the curtain was closed. I felt worried and I just speeded up."" Vincent Sutherland, who lives on the road, said he heard shouting at about 20:00 GMT on Saturday. He said: ""He was shouting 'kill a Muslim' and 'white supremacy', and then I went inside and I heard a load of banging. ""I don't think he's capable of what they are taking into consideration,"" he added. ""He's polite, he always says hello to me."" The investigation is being led by Counter Terrorism South East in collaboration with Surrey Police. Local officers have been deployed to provide reassurance and protective security advice to communities, places of worship and businesses. Anyone with information regarding the incident has been urged to contact Surrey Police.

"A McDonald's Monopoly campaign which sees customers given the chance to win prizes including food is a ""danger to public health"", says MP Tom Watson. He said the fast food giant should drop the annual competition, which starts this week, saying it encouraged people to order more,the Observer reported.,external It comes as the government considers banning junk food adverts on TV before 9pm to tackle childhood obesity. McDonald's said ""customer choice"" was at the heart of its business. Record number of severely obese children Will new child health measures make your life easier? Most adults 'living unhealthy lifestyles' Mr Watson - who tackled his type 2 diabetes by adopting a healthier lifestyle and losing seven stone - has asked Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald's UK, to cancel the marketing campaign, according to the newspaper. But McDonald's argued that people can take part by buying some of the healthier foods on their menu - and that they no longer get extra chances to compete by buying larger items. Tom Watson says the competition is ""appalling"" They said in a statement: ""This year's campaign sees customers receive prize labels on carrot bags, salads and our Big Flavour Wraps range, and we have removed the incentive to 'go large'. ""Nutrition information is clearly displayed and we continue to review, refine and reformulate our menu to reduce saturated fat, salt and sugar."" A public consultation is beginning on whether there should be a watershed for TV and online adverts featuring foods high in fat, sugar and salt. Junk food ads during children's TV shows have been banned since 2007. The UK is facing a crisis over childhood obesity, with up to 1,000 more children per year expected to require treatment for severe obesity-related problems by 2022-23, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. In his letter, Labour's deputy leader Mr Watson wrote: ""Almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese. ""A quarter of children in England are overweight or obese by age five, rising to over a third by the end of primary school. Obesity and a sugar-filled diet cause a variety of serious health conditions, including type 2 diabetes which costs the NHS 10% of its budget every year to treat. ""In this context, it is appalling that your company's Monopoly marketing ploy encourages people to eat more unhealthy foods by offering sugar-filled desserts as rewards. ""It is unacceptable that this campaign aims to manipulate families into ordering junk food more frequently and in bigger portions, in the faint hope of winning a holiday, a car, or a cash prize many would otherwise struggle to afford."" McDonald's said it was continuing to review its menu Type 2 diabetes affects one in 16 adults in the UK and causes the level of glucose in the blood to become too high. It is strongly linked to diet and lifestyle. It is the more common form of diabetes, with nine out of 10 people with diabetes in the UK having type 2. Type 1, on the other hand, isan autoimmune condition,externaland is not associated with being overweight or inactive. Mr Watson added: ""It is clear that McDonald's Monopoly is a danger to public health. Businesses have a moral responsibility to their customers, and as a society we have a responsibility to safeguard the health of our children."" The campaign, based on the board game of the same name, sees customers either collect stickers in the hope of winning big prizes or being given instant prizes such as free food.

"Protesters clashed with riot police outside the Serbian presidential building on Sunday Serbian police have used tear gas to clear thousands of protesters trying to blockade the residence of President Aleksandar Vucic in Belgrade. The protesters - who are demanding greater media freedom and free elections - shouted ""Resign!"" But Mr Vucic refused to bow to the pressure, saying: ""I am not afraid."" The opposition has been staging largely peaceful rallies for weeks. But tensions escalated on Saturday when crowds stormed the state TV station. Serbia's daily 'anti-dictator' protests The town where neighbours won't share a coffee Country profile: Serbia Mr Vucic is a reformed extreme nationalist who now wishes to lead Serbia into the European Union. Riot police fired tear gas at the crowds that had gathered outside the presidential residence in the capital. One man holds up a sign reading: ""I'm dying, dying to bring you down"" Huge crowds gathered outside the RTS building on Saturday as some protesters managed to briefly occupy the station Many in the crowd blew whistles and shouted ""He is finished!"" That was the slogan the slogan of the movement that ousted Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000. Milosevic was president of Serbia and later Yugoslavia during the latter's violent break-up in the 1990s. His government placed severe curbs on independent media. In 2001, he was transferred to The Hague to face trial on war crimes charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. He was found dead in his cell in 2006, before his trial could be completed. Addressing the cheering crowds on Sunday, opposition activist Borko Stefanovic said: ""We shall continue the blockade of the presidency and we will not leave until our demands are met or unless we get firm guarantees that our demands will be met."" The protest was organised as President Vucic was giving a televised address from inside his residence on Saturday's violence. ""Serbia is a democratic country, a country of law and order and Serbia will know how to respond,"" the president said, branding the protesters ""fascists, hooligans and thieves"". Aleksandar Vucic has been Serbia's president since 2017 ""They think they have the right, 1,000 of them, to determine the fate of the country,"" Mr Vucic added, probably underestimating the number of protesters involved. After the president's address, crowds of people marched from the residence to the city's main police station, demanding that the people who were arrested at the Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) building on Saturday night be released. Once they arrived, they were again locked in a stand-off with riot police outside the front door of the station. In November last year, Mr Stefanovic - leader of the Serbian Left - was beaten up and left unconscious by a group of young men in dark clothing. Images of his bloodied face and clothes sparked waves of protests in Belgrade. Opposition leaders blamed President Vucic for the attacks, and accused him of bringing back an autocratic style of rule reminiscent of the Milosevic era. Critics also accused the president of reviving nationalism and hate speech in the country. Bosko Obradovic, leader of the far-right Dveri party, is one of the most prominent figures in the protest movement Now, one of the most prominent figures in the opposition protest movement is Bosko Obradovic, the leader of the extreme right-wing party Dveri. He was among those who occupied the public broadcaster RTS's building on Saturday and, according to Balkan Insight, was physically dragged out of the building by police officers.

"The star continued to play live up until his death Surf guitar pioneer Dick Dale, whose song Misirlou played over the opening credits to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, has died aged 81. Dale was known for his blindingly fast strumming style, which inspired acts like The Beach Boys and Jimi Hendrix. He said the sound reminded him of the rumble and crash of the waves, and the noises of marine animals as he surfed in California. Dale's bassist Sam Bolle confirmed the star had died on Saturday night. The cause of death is not yet known, but the guitarist had a long history of ill health, including renal failure, diabetes and cancer. Dale's agent called his death ""a sad day for rock 'n' roll"".

Dale was born Richard Anthony Monsour in Boston, Massachusetts in 1937 to a father who had emigrated from Lebanon and a mother who was Polish Belarusian. His instrumental music was influenced by his heritage - using Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies as well as ""exotic"" scales that weren't common to rock music. As a young boy, he tried to learn the trumpet and the ukulele, thinking he might follow in the footsteps of country singer Hank Williams. But he then bought a guitar for $8 from a friend. When he was 17, his family moved to southern California, when his father found work in the aerospace industry and Dale became a keen surfer. The popularity of surf music declined after the ""British invasion"" of The Beatles and the Rolling Stones That was where he developed his percussive style of playing, initially on a right-handed guitar, despite being left-handed - essentially meaning he was playing back-to-front and upside down. His percussive approach to plucking the strings meant he often wore guitar picks down to a stub in the course of a single song - but the sound was an instinctive reaction to his love of the sea. ""When I got that feeling from surfing,"" he told the writer Barney Hoskyns, ""the white water coming over my head was the high notes going dikidikidiki, and then the dungundungun on the bottom was the waves, and I started double-picking faster and faster, like a locomotive, to feel the power of the waves."" His intense live shows regularly drew crowds of thousands to the Rendezvous Ballroom on California's Balboa Peninsula; and in September 1961, Dale released Let's Go Trippin' on the Del-Tone label, which his father founded and financed. Widely considered to be the first surf-rock song committed to tape, it was a huge local hit, and led to Dale's first album, Surfer's Choice. Allow YouTube content?

The album also included his version of Misirlou - a Greek folk song - which Dale got to perform on the Ed Sullivan Show. More than three decades later, Tarantino made the song famous again when he used it at the very start of Pulp Fiction. The Black Eyed Peas later sampled it on their 2006 hit Pump It, which reached number three on the UK charts. Dale went on to sign to Capitol Records and surf rock became a major fad, inspiring acts including The Beach Boys, The Trashmen, Jan and Dean and The Surfaris. The star's pyrotechnic guitar technique also influenced the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, The B-52s and Stevie Ray Vaughan. But he retired from music in 1966 after being diagnosed with rectal cancer. After beating the disease, he pursued dozens of other interests from caring for endangered animals to obtaining a pilot's licence. After picking up a pollution-related infection while surfing in 1979, he also became an environmental campaigner.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable at party conference The Liberal Democrats are on a mission to go from ""protest back to power"", the party's departing leader, Sir Vince Cable, has said. In a speech in York, Sir Vince called for the party to continue arguing for the benefits of staying in the EU. He also accused Prime Minister Theresa May of prioritising Conservative Party unity over maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. Sir Vince, 75, will step down in May after leading the Lib Dems since 2017. What next for the Lib Dems? Cable to quit as Lib Dem leader in May Speaking on Sunday at the party's spring conference, Sir Vince said ""we are Remain"", adding: ""Whatever happens in the next few weeks of parliamentary twists and turns, we must argue - since no-one else can be relied upon to do so - that none of the several mutually exclusive versions of Brexit on offer - soft or hard - are as good as the deal we currently have."" Next week, Mrs May is expected to bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons for a third time after it was twice voted down by large margins. Mrs May's efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics to back the deal have focused on attempts to revise the backstop, the measures in the Brexit deal aimed at preventing the return of a hard border in Ireland. ""The intensity of the campaign to remove it speaks volumes about the underlying motives of those who demanded Brexit and now demand a 'clear Brexit',"" Sir Vince said. ""They simply deny our history, which is entwined with that of Ireland."" Jo Swinson, deputy leader since 2017, is one of the leading contenders to be the next leader Sir Vince also targeted Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley personally for criticism, following a series of gaffes. Ms Bradley previously said that deaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland during the Troubles were ""not crimes"" - comments sheended up apologising for. She also admitted toinitially not understanding that nationalists did not vote for unionist parties during elections. ""It really is quite shocking that this government is so lacking in talent that it employs a secretary of state for Northern Ireland who says she doesn't understand sectarian voting patterns and then compounds this public declaration of ignorance with a blatantly and naively one-sided view of the killings in the Troubles,"" Sir Vince said. ""Ms Bradley has revealed an ugly truth: that peace in Ireland matters less than peace in the Conservative Party."" Sir Vince will step down in May Sir Vince, who clashed repeatedly with Mrs May over immigration policy while they sat around the Cabinet table during the coalition years, used his speech to return to the issue, saying it highlights a divide in British politics. ""Our mission to move from survival to success, from protest back to power, takes place in a world where liberal values are under siege and in retreat. ""Nothing quite defines liberalism like its opposite, illustrated by Theresa May's policies on immigration."" The Lib Dems have 11 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. Sir Vince, a former business secretary under the Coalition government, will step down after the English local elections in May. Leading candidates to replace him include the current deputy leader, Jo Swinson, relative newcomer Layla Moran and former environment secretary Ed Davey. What next for the Lib Dems?

"Protesters clashed with riot police outside the Serbian presidential building on Sunday Serbian police have used tear gas to clear thousands of protesters trying to blockade the residence of President Aleksandar Vucic in Belgrade. The protesters - who are demanding greater media freedom and free elections - shouted ""Resign!"" But Mr Vucic refused to bow to the pressure, saying: ""I am not afraid."" The opposition has been staging largely peaceful rallies for weeks. But tensions escalated on Saturday when crowds stormed the state TV station. Serbia's daily 'anti-dictator' protests The town where neighbours won't share a coffee Country profile: Serbia Mr Vucic is a reformed extreme nationalist who now wishes to lead Serbia into the European Union. Riot police fired tear gas at the crowds that had gathered outside the presidential residence in the capital. One man holds up a sign reading: ""I'm dying, dying to bring you down"" Huge crowds gathered outside the RTS building on Saturday as some protesters managed to briefly occupy the station Many in the crowd blew whistles and shouted ""He is finished!"" That was the slogan the slogan of the movement that ousted Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000. Milosevic was president of Serbia and later Yugoslavia during the latter's violent break-up in the 1990s. His government placed severe curbs on independent media. In 2001, he was transferred to The Hague to face trial on war crimes charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. He was found dead in his cell in 2006, before his trial could be completed. Addressing the cheering crowds on Sunday, opposition activist Borko Stefanovic said: ""We shall continue the blockade of the presidency and we will not leave until our demands are met or unless we get firm guarantees that our demands will be met."" The protest was organised as President Vucic was giving a televised address from inside his residence on Saturday's violence. ""Serbia is a democratic country, a country of law and order and Serbia will know how to respond,"" the president said, branding the protesters ""fascists, hooligans and thieves"". Aleksandar Vucic has been Serbia's president since 2017 ""They think they have the right, 1,000 of them, to determine the fate of the country,"" Mr Vucic added, probably underestimating the number of protesters involved. After the president's address, crowds of people marched from the residence to the city's main police station, demanding that the people who were arrested at the Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) building on Saturday night be released. Once they arrived, they were again locked in a stand-off with riot police outside the front door of the station. In November last year, Mr Stefanovic - leader of the Serbian Left - was beaten up and left unconscious by a group of young men in dark clothing. Images of his bloodied face and clothes sparked waves of protests in Belgrade. Opposition leaders blamed President Vucic for the attacks, and accused him of bringing back an autocratic style of rule reminiscent of the Milosevic era. Critics also accused the president of reviving nationalism and hate speech in the country. Bosko Obradovic, leader of the far-right Dveri party, is one of the most prominent figures in the protest movement Now, one of the most prominent figures in the opposition protest movement is Bosko Obradovic, the leader of the extreme right-wing party Dveri. He was among those who occupied the public broadcaster RTS's building on Saturday and, according to Balkan Insight, was physically dragged out of the building by police officers. ""We aren't asking for much,"" Mr Obradovic demanded at the station. ""An immediate broadcast with participation of a representative of the organisers of the protests, not of politicians.""

"Ross Thomson spoke to the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme A Scottish Conservative MP has said if Theresa May's Brexit deal comes back to parliament that he will not necessarily support it - even if the DUP do. Ross Thomson, MP for Aberdeen South,told Sunday Politics Scotlandthat he will make up his own mind on the deal. He said he had a lot of the same concerns as the Democratic Unionists. He said the PM's withdrawal agreement is ""not the greatest"" but he could ""suck up"" some issues if concerns on the backstop could be addressed. Brexit: A really simple guide What's happened with Brexit this week? Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? Mr Thomson is one of a key group of Conservative MPs who have consistently opposed Theresa May's deal, voting against it twice. It is likely the prime minister will have to win over both the DUP and backbench critics such as Mr Thomson to get her deal through the House of Commons. Mr Thomson is one of only three Scottish Conservative MPs who rejected the deal in the first vote on it in the House of Commons. One of the others, John Lamont switched sides in the second vote last week and voted in favour. The third, Moray MP Douglas Ross, missed the second vote because he was attending the birth of his son. Mr Thomson told Sunday Politics Scotland that the UK should be allowed to ""legally and unilaterally"" leave the EU, adding that he ""genuinely wants"" to be able to vote for a Brexit deal with the EU. However, he would not risk the UK's ""integrity"" by voting for the deal as it currently stands. ""I'm not a member of the DUP... I will make my own mind up but we do have the same concerns,"" he said. Mr Thomson added: ""I simply won't vote for something because the DUP back it but if those similar concerns are addressed round about the place of Northern Ireland, the issues round about the backstop, and I feel that enough protection is there to ensure that we leave the EU as one United Kingdom and do not treat another part of it differently, then of course I will be happy to suck up a lot of the other stuff I don't like within the withdrawal agreement to see it through."" Earlier, Chancellor Philip Hammond, told the BBC's Andrew Marr thatthe deal might not go forward for a third Commons vote without more support from the DUP and other MPs. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to MPs across the Commons inviting them for talks to find a cross-party compromise. He also told Sky that while he ""has to see the wording of it"", Labour MPs would be told to vote in favour of an amendment calling for another referendum next week. And he said he may propose another vote of no confidence in the government if the PM's deal was voted down again.

"The funding of mental health care for Scotland's prisoners must be increased after the number of self-harm incidents ""skyrocketed"", an MSP has said. Figures show there were 762 incidents in 2018, compared with 532 in the previous year - a jump of 43%. These include burns, cuts, attempted suicide, ligature, overdoses and swallowing items. The Scottish government said it was increasing the support for prisoners with mental health needs. The highest number of incidents was at HMP & YOI Grampian in the north east which recorded 175 cases in 2018 of which 138 were categorised as ""cuts"". Of the 762 total incidents recorded across Scotland, 517 were for cuts, 72 were categorised under ""swallows item"", 41 for ""overdose"" and 31 as ""attempted suicide"". The highest number of incidents was at HMP & YOI Grampian in the north east The figures were published following a Freedom of Information request made by the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The party's justice spokesman, Liam McArthur MSP, said: ""Incident numbers have been on an upward trajectory for years but last year they skyrocketed. ""The scale of self-harm in Scotland's prisons is devastating. This must prompt serious new investment in prison mental health care. ""Prison staff are working incredibly hard but they don't have the resources or staff they need."" Review ordered after deaths at Polmont Mental health remains concern at prison Serious staff concerns at prison The unique way the Dutch treat mentally ill prisoners He added: ""It has been two years since the Scottish government accepted Scottish Liberal Democrat proposals to expand the mental health workforce in prisons. ""However, so far there are just two new staff across Scotland's 15 prisons. Ministers still can't tell us how many extra staff there will be in the end. ""Staff, prisoners and the communities they return to have every right to demand better. We need more mental health professionals deployed in our prisons now. This will help save lives."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We recognise that people entering the criminal justice system often have complex needs. ""This is why in recent years SPS (Scottish Prisons Service) have improved reporting procedures and awareness of the risks of self-harm among prison staff, ensuring that cases are properly recorded and appropriate care and support are provided. ""SPS are working closely with NHS staff, responsible for mental healthcare provision in Scotland's prisons. In addition, HMIPS is currently carrying out a review of mental health services at HMP YOI Polmont and a review of forensic services, which will include provision in the prison estate, was announced last week. ""The learning and recommendations from these reviews will inform our approach in the future."" The spokesman added: ""Through our 10 year mental health strategy, we are delivering an increase in support for the mental health needs of people detained in prison. ""The strategy aims to increase the overall mental health workforce by 800 additional staff, with prisons also benefiting from this enhanced workforce. ""This is supported by investment rising to Â£35m by 2021-22. The mental health staffing model in each prison is determined by each NHS board and any changes will be monitored jointly with the SPS.""

"This video can not be played Has Mr Biden publicly announced his presidential bid? Joe Biden appeared to announce his candidacy for the 2020 US election, before immediately correcting himself. The former vice-president made the slip while addressing 1,000 Democrats at a dinner in his home state of Delaware. He said his record was the most progressive ""of anyone running for the United-"" before correcting himself and saying, ""anybody whowouldrun"". The audience stood up and chanted ""run Joe run"", while Mr Biden crossed himself and said, ""I didn't mean it!"" Addressing party brokers and leaders in the city of Dover, Mr Biden, 76, said that it was time to restore the country's ""backbone"", but that they needed political consensus to move beyond what he called today's ""mean"", ""petty"" and ""vicious"" political landscape. ""I'm told I get criticised by the new left,"" he said, referring to a group of popular new left-wing Democrats that includes congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. ""I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the United- "" He then corrected himself, saying: ""Anybody whowouldrun."" As the diners rose to their feet and chanted ""run Joe run"", he laughed and insisted, ""I didn't mean it!"" ""Of anybody who would run,"" he continued. ""Because folks, we have to bring this country back together again."" Mr Biden, who was Barack Obama's second-in-command from 2009 to 2017, added that the 2020 election will be the most important vote in a century. Which Democrats are running in 2020? What are the Democrats' big ideas? Speculation that Mr Biden would announce his candidacy has reached feverish levels. If he were to run, he would be entering an increasingly crowded race - with 15 other Democrats having already declared their bids.

"Marks and Spencer is planning a big shift towards food at its stores, the retailer has said. It said it wanted to target the weekly family shop by having more stores that offer its full range of food. At the moment, only around 12 of its stores offer all 6,500 of its food products. The plan is to convert more space in existing stores to food, with new stores better designed and located for customers who want to do food shopping. In a letter to suppliers, M&S said it was not getting its line of food products ""in front of enough customers"" - leaving shoppers assuming that they do not have a full range. ""This must change, and it will. The full range will go online with Ocado and we are starting a store renewal programme that will get more products in front of more customers with bigger, better M&S Food Halls in new and existing sites,"" the letter said. The M&S new strategy wasfirst reported by the Mail on Sunday.,external M&S to start home delivery next year M&S announces 100 stores to close The move ties in with a recent deal with Ocado, under which Ocado will offer the full M&S product line for home delivery. When the deal was announced, critics said that M&S shoppers did not spend enough on each shop to justify an online delivery. At the moment, M&S shoppers spend an average of Â£13 on each shop, while Ocado averages just over Â£100 per shop. However, M&S thinks that if shoppers can access the full range of goods they are likely to buy more. Larger shops will help to make customers aware of those products. M&S already has a chain of convenience stores branded Simply Food. But they are too small to stock the company's full line of food products. A store would need to devote around 12,000 sq ft to holding the full line of M&S food products. Simply Food stores are typically around 7,000 sq ft. Last May, the retailer announced that it would close 100 stores. Under that plan the retailer said it wanted fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations. In total there are 1,043 M&S stores. Of those 729 are Simply Food outlets, the other 314 are stores selling clothes and food.

"Protesters clashed with riot police outside the Serbian presidential building on Sunday Serbian police have used tear gas to clear thousands of protesters trying to blockade the residence of President Aleksandar Vucic in Belgrade. The protesters - who are demanding greater media freedom and free elections - shouted ""Resign!"" But Mr Vucic refused to bow to the pressure, saying: ""I am not afraid."" The opposition has been staging largely peaceful rallies for weeks. But tensions escalated on Saturday when crowds stormed the state TV station. Serbia's daily 'anti-dictator' protests The town where neighbours won't share a coffee Country profile: Serbia Mr Vucic is a reformed extreme nationalist who now wishes to lead Serbia into the European Union. Riot police fired tear gas at the crowds that had gathered outside the presidential residence in the capital. One man holds up a sign reading: ""I'm dying, dying to bring you down"" Huge crowds gathered outside the RTS building on Saturday as some protesters managed to briefly occupy the station Many in the crowd blew whistles and shouted ""He is finished!"" That was the slogan the slogan of the movement that ousted Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000. Milosevic was president of Serbia and later Yugoslavia during the latter's violent break-up in the 1990s. His government placed severe curbs on independent media. In 2001, he was transferred to The Hague to face trial on war crimes charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. He was found dead in his cell in 2006, before his trial could be completed. Addressing the cheering crowds on Sunday, opposition activist Borko Stefanovic said: ""We shall continue the blockade of the presidency and we will not leave until our demands are met or unless we get firm guarantees that our demands will be met."" The protest was organised as President Vucic was giving a televised address from inside his residence on Saturday's violence. ""Serbia is a democratic country, a country of law and order and Serbia will know how to respond,"" the president said, branding the protesters ""fascists, hooligans and thieves"". Aleksandar Vucic has been Serbia's president since 2017 ""They think they have the right, 1,000 of them, to determine the fate of the country,"" Mr Vucic added, probably underestimating the number of protesters involved. After the president's address, crowds of people marched from the residence to the city's main police station, demanding that the people who were arrested at the Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) building on Saturday night be released. Once they arrived, they were again locked in a stand-off with riot police outside the front door of the station. In November last year, Mr Stefanovic - leader of the Serbian Left - was beaten up and left unconscious by a group of young men in dark clothing. Images of his bloodied face and clothes sparked waves of protests in Belgrade. Opposition leaders blamed President Vucic for the attacks, and accused him of bringing back an autocratic style of rule reminiscent of the Milosevic era. Critics also accused the president of reviving nationalism and hate speech in the country. Bosko Obradovic, leader of the far-right Dveri party, is one of the most prominent figures in the protest movement Now, one of the most prominent figures in the opposition protest movement is Bosko Obradovic, the leader of the extreme right-wing party Dveri. He was among those who occupied the public broadcaster RTS's building on Saturday and, according to Balkan Insight, was physically dragged out of the building by police officers. ""We aren't asking for much,"" Mr Obradovic demanded at the station. ""An immediate broadcast with participation of a representative of the organisers of the protests, not of politicians.""

"Nathaniel Armstrong died at the scene before paramedics arrived A man stabbed to death in a fight in south-west London has been named locally as 29-year-old Nathaniel Armstrong. Mr Armstrong was stabbed at the junction of Gowan Avenue and Munster Road, in Fulham, in the early hours of Saturday and died at the scene. He was the cousin of Good Morning Britain's Alex Beresford, the weatherman's agent confirmed. Mr Beresford said the family was ""so shocked with the news"". ""Nathaniel was a bright young man with his whole life ahead of him and this tragedy is yet one more example of a needless life lost to knife crime"", he said. A friend of Mr Armstrong, Tyrell Paisley added: ""He was a very kind person and the best way to describe him would be a gentle giant. ""He definitely wasn't the type to get into trouble."" No arrests have been made, police said Mr Armstrong was killed 11 days after Mr Beresford made an on-air speech about knife crime. He said he grew up in communities affected by knife crime and said prison was not a deterrent to attackers. ""Some of these boys, they don't fear prison. If you don't change the environment it won't change anything and that's the key thing,"" he said. People have taken to social media to pay tribute to Mr Armstrong. Allow Facebook content?

"Nathaniel Armstrong died at the scene before paramedics arrived A man stabbed to death in a fight in south-west London has been named locally as 29-year-old Nathaniel Armstrong. Mr Armstrong was stabbed at the junction of Gowan Avenue and Munster Road, in Fulham, in the early hours of Saturday and died at the scene. He was the cousin of Good Morning Britain's Alex Beresford, the weatherman's agent confirmed. Mr Beresford said the family was ""so shocked with the news"". ""Nathaniel was a bright young man with his whole life ahead of him and this tragedy is yet one more example of a needless life lost to knife crime"", he said. A friend of Mr Armstrong, Tyrell Paisley added: ""He was a very kind person and the best way to describe him would be a gentle giant. ""He definitely wasn't the type to get into trouble."" No arrests have been made, police said Mr Armstrong was killed 11 days after Mr Beresford made an on-air speech about knife crime. He said he grew up in communities affected by knife crime and said prison was not a deterrent to attackers. ""Some of these boys, they don't fear prison. If you don't change the environment it won't change anything and that's the key thing,"" he said. People have taken to social media to pay tribute to Mr Armstrong. Allow Facebook content?

"This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I'm not going to be bossed around by a very small number of people"" Tory MP Nick Boles, who quit his local party on Saturday over his stance on Brexit, says his priority lies with his constituents and he will not be ""bossed around by a small number of people"". He told the Andrew Marr Show he thought about standing as an independent MP. But he said he had decided to remain as he was not ""ready to give up on the Conservative Party yet"". Mr Boles, MP for Grantham and Stamford, has been an outspoken critic of leaving the EU with no deal. The MP - who is in favour of a closer Norway-style relationship with Europe - said he was ""proud"" of his role in the cross-party campaign to force the prime minister to request an extension to Article 50 beyond 29 March, and to block a no-deal Brexit. But Councillor Martin Hill, vice president of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association, told members they had been ""betrayed by their parliamentary representative"", calling on him to take the ""honourable course"" and quit as an MP. A simple guide to Brexit What happened this week? And what happens now? Mr Boles said a ""certain amount of pressure was applied"" by the local party after he was asked to tell them if he intended to stand as their representative at the next general election. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""I represent 100,000 people in Parliament. I have roughly 500 members in my local association and roughly 60 people on my executive. ""I'm afraid I'm going to claim the right to interpret what is in the best interest of the 100,000 people I represent and I'm not going to be bossed around by a very small number of people with very ideological views."" Despite leaving the local association, whose members he wrote to this weekend, Mr Boles said he remains loyal to the party. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button He said: ""I have voted for Theresa May's deal every time it has been offered and I will vote for it again on Tuesday. ""The only thing and, in truth , the real area where I fell out with some members of my association, was in my efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit - and obviously I was very much involved in this plan that reached its fruition last week to stop a no-deal Brexit."" He said he had been told he could continue as a Conservative MP, with his membership being transferred from his local party to the national party. He is to meet the chief whip on Monday. His announcement came after a busy week in Westminster, whenMPs voted to seek a delayto the UK's departure from the EU. The third ""meaningful vote"" on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is expected to take place next week. If it is agreed, she has promised to seek a shorter extension to the departure date. But if it does not gain support, she has warned a longer extension may be needed - and the UK might have to take part in European elections.

"Yes supporters at a No event attended by Labour leader Ed Miliband in Glasgow days before the referendum A secret opinion poll just days before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum caused ""panic"" among No campaigners, a new documentary claims. It said the internal poll carried out for the UK government put the Yes campaign four percentage points ahead. Also in the documentary, veteran BBC broadcaster Allan Little criticises the attitudes of some of his London-based colleagues towards independence. BBC boss Ken MacQuarrie said the corporation did its job professionally. The third part of the documentary seriesYes/No: Inside the Indyref, to be shown on the BBC Scotland channel on Tuesday, looks at the last days of the 2014 campaign. The No campaign eventually won the referendum by 55% to 45%. The Better Together campaign had been ahead throughout the whole campaign Better Together, which was fighting for Scotland to remain part of the UK, had started the two-and-half year campaign as much as 20 points ahead in opinion polls. But as the 18 September polling day drew closer, the result was too close to call. Douglas Alexander, who was a Labour MP and senior Better Together figure, tells the programme ""something was shifting"". Andrew Dunlop said the government was doing its own poll tracking According to Andrew Dunlop, special adviser to Prime Minster David Cameron, the government was so concerned it conducted its own daily tracking poll. On Friday 5 September, less than two weeks before polling day, its secret results showed the lead for the Yes campaign was four points. It came the same day as a YouGov poll was received by the Sunday Times showing Yes were leading the polls for the first time by 51%-49%. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told supporters to hold their nerve There was ""overwhelming panic"" from everyone involved with Better Together, according to Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Despite Ms Davidson advising everyone to ""hold your effing nerve"", plans were made at the highest levels to completely change the approach of the campaign. George Osborne, who was chancellor at the time, went on Andrew Marr's Sunday morning TV programme to announce a plan of action to give more powers to Scotland over tax, spending and welfare. Former BBC political editor Nick Robinson had a high-profile dispute with Alex Salmond The documentary also talks to Nick Robinson, who was the BBC's political editor at the time. He had a high-profile dispute with Alex Salmond, who was Scotland's first minister and leader of the SNP at the time, over his reporting of a plan by the Royal Bank of Scotland to move its headquarters to England in the event of a Yes vote. The pair engaged in a lengthy exchange during a press conference and Robinson claimed in his news story that Mr Salmond ""didn't answer"" the question. Robinson told the Yes/No programme: ""In the end it was a subjective view as to whether he did or didn't properly answer the question. ""It wasn't a clever script line. In truth, given the chance, I would have rewritten it."" Allan Little has been a BBC journalist for more than 30 years BBC broadcaster Allan Little, who grew up in south-west Scotland and had worked for the corporation for more than 30 years at the time of the referendum, told the programme he was surprised how little some people in London knew about what had brought Scotland to that moment. Little, who was the BBC's Referendum Correspondent, said: ""I know how hard my colleagues in London work at trying to get it right. ""It's in the DNA when you are a BBC journalist. ""I'm not cynical about that but I was quite surprised by some of my colleagues failing to understand their own assumption that the Yes side was wrong."" He added that some colleagues thought ""that our responsibility was to produce a series of pieces to demonstrate how foolish it would be to vote Yes"". Ken MacQuarrie, who was the director of BBC Scotland, told the programme BBC journalists ""left behind"" their own opinions when reporting. He said: ""People were doing a professional job as far as was possible in every situation that they came across."" Yes/No: Inside the Indyref is on BBC Scotland at 22:00 on Tuesday and all three episodes will be available on the BBC iplayer.

"This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable at party conference The Liberal Democrats are on a mission to go from ""protest back to power"", the party's departing leader, Sir Vince Cable, has said. In a speech in York, Sir Vince called for the party to continue arguing for the benefits of staying in the EU. He also accused Prime Minister Theresa May of prioritising Conservative Party unity over maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. Sir Vince, 75, will step down in May after leading the Lib Dems since 2017. What next for the Lib Dems? Cable to quit as Lib Dem leader in May Speaking on Sunday at the party's spring conference, Sir Vince said ""we are Remain"", adding: ""Whatever happens in the next few weeks of parliamentary twists and turns, we must argue - since no-one else can be relied upon to do so - that none of the several mutually exclusive versions of Brexit on offer - soft or hard - are as good as the deal we currently have."" Next week, Mrs May is expected to bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons for a third time after it was twice voted down by large margins. Mrs May's efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics to back the deal have focused on attempts to revise the backstop, the measures in the Brexit deal aimed at preventing the return of a hard border in Ireland. ""The intensity of the campaign to remove it speaks volumes about the underlying motives of those who demanded Brexit and now demand a 'clear Brexit',"" Sir Vince said. ""They simply deny our history, which is entwined with that of Ireland."" Jo Swinson, deputy leader since 2017, is one of the leading contenders to be the next leader Sir Vince also targeted Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley personally for criticism, following a series of gaffes. Ms Bradley previously said that deaths caused by the security forces in Northern Ireland during the Troubles were ""not crimes"" - comments sheended up apologising for. She also admitted toinitially not understanding that nationalists did not vote for unionist parties during elections. ""It really is quite shocking that this government is so lacking in talent that it employs a secretary of state for Northern Ireland who says she doesn't understand sectarian voting patterns and then compounds this public declaration of ignorance with a blatantly and naively one-sided view of the killings in the Troubles,"" Sir Vince said. ""Ms Bradley has revealed an ugly truth: that peace in Ireland matters less than peace in the Conservative Party."" Sir Vince will step down in May Sir Vince, who clashed repeatedly with Mrs May over immigration policy while they sat around the Cabinet table during the coalition years, used his speech to return to the issue, saying it highlights a divide in British politics. ""Our mission to move from survival to success, from protest back to power, takes place in a world where liberal values are under siege and in retreat. ""Nothing quite defines liberalism like its opposite, illustrated by Theresa May's policies on immigration."" The Lib Dems have 11 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. Sir Vince, a former business secretary under the Coalition government, will step down after the English local elections in May.

" Fabian is world renowned for destroying ransomware - the viruses sent out by criminal gangs to extort money. Because of this, he lives a reclusive existence, always having to be one step ahead of the cyber criminals. He has moved to an unknown location since this interview was carried out. Words by cyber-security reporter Joe TidyIllustrations by Aart-Jan Venema For the photographer from Yorkshire, UK, it was nothing short of a disaster. Late one night he was putting the finishing touches to his latest set of wedding photographs due for delivery to his excited newly-wed clients. Then everything on his computer screen changed. Not just the folder of pictures, but his entire body of work, emails and invoices were gone. For the school head teacher in Texas, US, it didn’t hit home how serious it was until she remembered what her computer contained. The detailed, long-term financial plan for her already stretched high school. It had taken months of work and huge investment to plan for the future and, with the click of mouse, the hackers now had control. For the senior manager of a large corporation in Hong Kong, it was instant cold sweat. He had heard about this type of computer virus and how dangerous it could be. But he never thought that he would be tricked into clicking on a wrong link. Now, as he read the ransom note, he panicked. This could cost him his job. Ransomware is a particularly nasty type of computer virus. Instead of stealing data or money from victims, the virus takes control of computers and scrambles every single document, picture, video and email. Then the ransom demand is issued. Sometimes it’s written inside a note left on a desktop, sometimes it just pops up on a screen without warning.

Ransomware is a particularly nasty type of computer virus. Instead of stealing data or money from victims, the virus takes control of computers and scrambles every single document, picture, video and email. Then the ransom demand is issued. Sometimes it’s written inside a note left on a desktop, sometimes it just pops up on a screen without warning. They always come with a price tag. Pay the hackers a few hundred pounds - or sometimes thousands - and they’ll restore your files. All of the victims mentioned above were hit with some form of ransomware. But the Hong Kong businessman didn’t lose his job and the photographer and head teacher were able to recover their work. None had to pay any money, and once they’d got their lives back in order, all sent emails of thanks to the same person. He’s a man who has devoted himself, at huge personal cost, to helping victims of ransomware around the world. A man who guards his privacy dearly to protect himself, because for every message of gratitude he receives, almost as many messages of abuse come at him from the cyber criminals who hate him. In fact, they hate him so much that they leave him angry threats buried deep inside the code of their own viruses. To the untrained eye, the code of a computer virus is just a jumbled mess of letters, numbers and symbols. But to Fabian Wosar, each line is a clear instruction. He knows and understands every digit and dot in the same way a pianist would read a page of musical notes. About a year ago, as his eyes darted around the screen looking for a clue to help him crack the latest ransomware, he was stopped in his tracks. Standing out amongst the code, in glaring green letters, were expletives referring to Fabian. By name. “I was shocked but I also felt a real sense of pride,” says Fabian.  “Almost like, a little bit cocky. I’m not going to lie, yeah, it was nice. It’s clear that the coder is really pissed. “They’ve taken the time and effort to write a message knowing that I’ll probably see it and I’m clearly getting under their skin. It’s a pretty good motivator to know that my work is upsetting some really nasty cyber-criminal gangs.” Fabian shows me other messages. It takes me a while to spot them as I scroll through endless strings of code. When I find one it stands out like a beacon in the sea of otherwise unreadable characters. Nearly all are obscene, offensive and threatening. There are frequent references to Fabian’s mother, and descriptions of sexual acts are common. Many are goading and taunting Fabian. One virus was even named “Fabiansomware” in an attempt to fool the victim into blaming Fabian. There are some, though, that are more pleading in their tone, such as this one he found a few months ago. “They tried to make me feel guilty with this one. But obviously I still cracked their virus and released a decrypter,” he says. “Surprise, surprise it didn’t stop them and they released another version.” Fabian keeps every message he finds. They form a large collection on his computer and are just another motivator that keeps him dedicated, even obsessed, with his work. From the minute you step inside Fabian’s home you can see how that dedication manifests itself in his life. His unassuming terraced house on the outskirts of London has no decorative furnishings at all. No pictures or paintings adorn the walls. No lamps or plants. The shelves are empty except for a collection of Nintendo games and some computer coding manuals. He owns one board-game called Hacker: The Cyber Security Logic Game, which he admits he’s very good at - although he’s only ever played it alone. In short, his home isn’t very homely but this cheery, energetic young German doesn’t seem to mind. He even admits to spending “98%” of his time at home as he works from his office upstairs. “I’m one of those people who if I don’t really have a reason to go outside, I won’t,” he says. “I don’t really like to leave the house unless I have to. I do nearly all my shopping online and get everything delivered. I don’t really like too many things around as I spend nearly all of my time working.” Strangely, Fabian has chosen the smallest room in his house to set up his office. This is where, with the curtains closed, he toils away for most of his waking life gaining grateful fans and hateful, dangerous enemies around the world. He works remotely for a cyber security company, often sitting for hours at a time working with colleagues in different countries. When he’s “in the zone”, the outside world becomes even less important and his entire existence focuses on the code on his screen. He once woke up with keyboard imprints all over his face after falling asleep during a 35-hour session. All of this to create anti-ransomware programs that he and his company usually give away free. Victims simply download the tools he makes for each virus, follow the instructions and get their files back. You can see how he has built up such a vengeful group of angry cyber criminals. “We are never completely sure who we are dealing with, but my guess is that I have upset or angered around 100 different cyber gangs over the past few years,” says Fabian. “Writing code is like writing a novel. You can tell from the style. You can tell that you’re dealing with the same gangs quite often. It’s also pretty easy to follow the money. By looking at the Bitcoin wallets that the gangs ask victims to pay into, you can see who is responsible for each variation of ransomware and how much money they’re making.” He says that one group he “annoyed a lot” had made about $250,000 (£191,000) in three months - until he found their virus and stopped it. Ransomware is one of the most profitable ways for cyber criminals to make money. Stealing data is fine but you still need to find a buyer. In these attacks the victim is the buyer. Individuals rarely have backups of precious family photos, so are likely to pay the few hundred pounds to save those memories. Businesses often pay without alerting the authorities or upsetting shareholders. In some cases, local authorities pay after weighing up the cost of replacing their systems at taxpayers’ expense. In March, officials in Jackson County, Georgia, US, reportedly paid $400,000 (£301,000) to cyber criminals to get rid of a ransomware infection and regain access to their IT systems. It was reported that they had estimated it would cost millions to replace the computer network. The most successful cyber-crime gangs are run like mafia organisations with specific structures and divisions of labour. There are the virus coders, the money launderers, the protection heavies and the bosses who decide on targets and sometimes funnel the money into other, potentially more serious, criminal enterprises. Catching these gangs is extremely challenging. One of the most prolific recent ransomware gangs, responsible for two major ransomware families - CTB-Locker and Cerber - made an estimated $27m and eluded police for years. It took a global police operation involving the FBI, the UK’s National Crime Agency, and Romanian and Dutch investigators to bring them down. In December 2017, five arrests were made in Romania. According to research from Emsisoft, the cyber security company Fabian works for, a computer is attacked every two seconds. Their network has managed to prevent 2584105 infections in the past 60 days - and that’s just one anti-virus firm of dozens around the world. Some of the most destructive cyber-attacks in recent years have been carried out with ransomware. In May 2017, hundreds of British hospitals were plunged into chaos as a ransomware virus called WannaCry spread like wildfire through the NHS computer network. An estimated 70,000 devices – including computers, MRI scanners, blood-storage refrigerators and theatre equipment - were taken offline by the virus, which encrypted machines and demanded a payment in Bitcoin to save the files. Doctors and nurses were forced to resort to pen and paper and thousands of appointments and operations were cancelled or postponed. Worldwide, the ransomware claimed an estimated 300,000 computers in 150 countries, with systems in Russia, Ukraine, Taiwan and India worst affected. It didn’t take long for experts to blame hackers in North Korea for the attack, which is estimated to have caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage. Another piece of ransomware called Not Petya is responsible for what is often described as the most devastating cyber attack of all time. This one is estimated to have caused $10bn (£7.6bn) in damages with around $300m of that coming from one company. It was in June 2017 when the infection began. It originated in an otherwise benign piece of accountancy software popular with Ukrainian companies and spread throughout the country encrypting computers at energy companies, transport networks, airports and banks. Quickly, the virus scrambled files on computers in Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the UK. NotPetya was particularly cruel in that although it looked and acted like ransomware, it was effectively a “wiper” - even if victims did pay the ransom (and many did), the files could never actually be recovered. The company worst hit was Maersk, the largest logistics and container ship firm in the world. The entire business nearly ground to a halt and in the 10-day scramble to rebuild thousands of networked computers the price of commodities like bananas began to soar as shop shelves went bare. It’s believed this attack was politically motivated against Ukraine but no-one really knows who was to blame. “It’s pretty much an arms race,” says Fabian. ""They release a new ransomware virus, I find a flaw in its code and build the decryption tool to reverse it so people can get their files back.” “Then the criminals release a new version which they hope I can’t break. Sometimes they figure out what they did wrong and fix it, but a lot of the time they can’t see the flaw in their code. “In one case this back and forth with one cyber-crime gang went on for like six or seven months. It escalates with them getting more and more angry with me.” When he’s immersed in the race against these anonymous criminals, Fabian admits it is hard to keep on top of even the most basic functions like eating and drinking, and looking after himself. Amongst the mess of coding books and paperwork on his desk I spot two pill boxes. The containers with labels for each day of the week point to health issues, which he admits are a direct result of his lifestyle. “I’m heavily overweight and I have trouble with my blood pressure so I take some meds for that. I also struggle with hyperthyroidism,” he says. “It’s definitely down to my work and how I live. I’m actually thinking of getting a puppy to force me to leave the house for walks. And the companionship would be nice too.” It was another message specifically about his weight that led him to flee Germany and end up in the UK. About a year ago, he came across a hidden message which, unlike most, was terrifyingly personal: This one he couldn’t ignore. Not because it hurt his feelings but because it showed that the cyber criminals knew something about him. Up to this point he had kept everything except his name a closely-guarded secret. Not even his boss or co-workers knew where he lived in his hometown in east Germany, and now it seemed the net could be closing in with the criminals. “It definitely got to me. Not because of the overweight thing - because I clearly am overweight - but because I realised people were kind of stalking me online,” he says. Fabian describes it as a creepy time. He scoured his social media accounts and web forums for any pictures or references to his appearance. He found that years ago, a throwaway tweet had mentioned the Keto diet. “That was when I removed my birthdate everywhere and things like that to not give too many clues,” he says. “I remember thinking I had to get out of Germany, where you can easily have your location found with a few pieces of information. “It was very scary. I don’t think they would have killed me but these guys are highly dangerous. I know how much money they make and it would be literally nothing for them to drop 10 or 20,000 for like some Russian dude to turn up to my house and beat the living hell out of me. “I moved to the UK as soon as I could. You can hide here, there are no registers or anything and I can be anonymous.” Fabian still hasn’t told his co-workers exactly where he is in the UK. He only agreed to have a visit from me because he is just about to leave the area and won’t tell me where he’s going.Fabian accepts that moving around and restricting his life and circle of friends is just a part of the sacrifice for his hobby-turned-profession. He first discovered his passion for computers at the age of seven when he played on his dad’s work computer. Coming from a poor family in the former East Germany it was up to him to pursue his dream. He spent three years saving up the money for his first computer by collecting recyclable bottles and cans and selling them back to the council. At the age of 10 he had enough money to buy the machine and he began experimenting. This really took off when he got his first computer virus. “The virus was called TEQUILA-B. It messed my system up in all kinds of ways and I got really, really fascinated by it. I went to a library and they actually had a couple of books about computer viruses. I got into it and wrote my own antivirus program.” By 14, he was known throughout the municipality as the go-to-guy for computer problems and managed to save enough to help his family get a better house in a better neighbourhood. By 18, with no formal education or training, he joined cyber security firm Emsisoft where he has built his profile and is known in the industry as one of - if not the - best ransomware expert. With his skillset and notoriety, Fabian could be one of the biggest names and personalities in the cyber world but he chooses a more modest life. He earns a very good salary but looking around his home and at his life it’s hard to see how he spends it. “I don’t really spend my money, no. I like to play tabletop games online but that doesn’t cost much,” he says. “A lot of my money I send to my sister who has a little girl. I like to make sure she has everything she needs.” He gets offered thank yous and rewards all the time but doesn’t like to accept. One gift he was happy to accept, though, was a cartoon picture of what a grateful illustrator imagined he might look like. It shows a portly man wearing a polar bear hat. Bizarrely, she has managed to capture his essence (and love of polar bears) without looking much like him. He uses it as his online avatar, happy knowing that it came from another person he’s helped, but safe in the knowledge that his secret identity is secure. As I leave him, I feel privileged to have been invited to his home - one of very few people to be trusted with his location, albeit temporarily. I wish him good luck with his house move and the hunt for a puppy companion to share his strange life with. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.003114616
"A McDonald's Monopoly campaign which sees customers given the chance to win prizes including food is a ""danger to public health"", says MP Tom Watson. He said the fast food giant should drop the annual competition, which starts this week, saying it encouraged people to order more,the Observer reported.,external It comes as the government considers banning junk food adverts on TV before 9pm to tackle childhood obesity. McDonald's said ""customer choice"" was at the heart of its business. Record number of severely obese children Will new child health measures make your life easier? Most adults 'living unhealthy lifestyles' Mr Watson - who tackled his type 2 diabetes by adopting a healthier lifestyle and losing seven stone - has asked Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald's UK, to cancel the marketing campaign, according to the newspaper. But McDonald's argued that people can take part by buying some of the healthier foods on their menu - and that they no longer get extra chances to compete by buying larger items. Tom Watson says the competition is ""appalling"" They said in a statement: ""This year's campaign sees customers receive prize labels on carrot bags, salads and our Big Flavour Wraps range, and we have removed the incentive to 'go large'. ""Nutrition information is clearly displayed and we continue to review, refine and reformulate our menu to reduce saturated fat, salt and sugar."" A public consultation is beginning on whether there should be a watershed for TV and online adverts featuring foods high in fat, sugar and salt. Junk food ads during children's TV shows have been banned since 2007. The UK is facing a crisis over childhood obesity, with up to 1,000 more children per year expected to require treatment for severe obesity-related problems by 2022-23, the Department of Health and Social Care has said. In his letter, Labour's deputy leader Mr Watson wrote: ""Almost two-thirds of adults in England are overweight or obese. ""A quarter of children in England are overweight or obese by age five, rising to over a third by the end of primary school. Obesity and a sugar-filled diet cause a variety of serious health conditions, including type 2 diabetes which costs the NHS 10% of its budget every year to treat. ""In this context, it is appalling that your company's Monopoly marketing ploy encourages people to eat more unhealthy foods by offering sugar-filled desserts as rewards. ""It is unacceptable that this campaign aims to manipulate families into ordering junk food more frequently and in bigger portions, in the faint hope of winning a holiday, a car, or a cash prize many would otherwise struggle to afford."" McDonald's said it was continuing to review its menu Type 2 diabetes affects one in 16 adults in the UK and causes the level of glucose in the blood to become too high. It is strongly linked to diet and lifestyle. It is the more common form of diabetes, with nine out of 10 people with diabetes in the UK having type 2. Type 1, on the other hand, isan autoimmune condition,externaland is not associated with being overweight or inactive. Mr Watson added: ""It is clear that McDonald's Monopoly is a danger to public health. Businesses have a moral responsibility to their customers, and as a society we have a responsibility to safeguard the health of our children."" The campaign, based on the board game of the same name, sees customers either collect stickers in the hope of winning big prizes or being given instant prizes such as free food.

"Fifty-one people were killed and dozens more wounded in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on 15 March 2019. A lone gunman pleaded guilty to the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre and was convicted. Below are the names and, where available, pictures of those who died. Many had moved to New Zealand to study or to work, and to build a better life for themselves and their families. Some were refugees, who thought they had found safety. The 70-year-old father of four from Somalia was killed at the Al Noor mosque. His son Said arrived at the mosque as the attack was underway, saw the gunman in the street and drove off.

Abdul Fattah Qasem Ibrahim Qasem was the former secretary of the Muslim Association of Canterbury was a respected elder in the Muslim community and helped with interpretation for refugees and migrants from the Middle East.

He was of Palestinian origin but also had Jordanian nationality. His death was confirmed by the Egyptian migration ministry. ""My dad was a good kind man,"" his son Omar told the BBC. ""Him and mum had great jobs and were well off in Egypt but they immigrated to NZ in 1996 for me. For my education, so that I could have a better chance to study what I want. We have been here 23 years."" ""He had many friends and family who loved him,â he added. âHe was a pure hearted soul who never treated anyone badly."" The retired engineer was killed while praying, his wife told the New Zealand Herald. ""We should be strong, especially in this case. I lose my husband but I'm not angry. I'm sad because I don't see him again, I don't talk to him again,"" Nuha Asad said. ""I'm happy in the same time because it happened while he prayed. I take comfort because he was a good man."" The Palestinian doctor's family believe he was killed in the attack at the mosque where he prayed every Friday. Mr Hamid and his wife Hahan moved to New Zealand 23 years ago, and had two sons.

"This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I'm not going to be bossed around by a very small number of people"" Tory MP Nick Boles, who quit his local party on Saturday over his stance on Brexit, says his priority lies with his constituents and he will not be ""bossed around by a small number of people"". He told the Andrew Marr Show he thought about standing as an independent MP. But he said he had decided to remain as he was not ""ready to give up on the Conservative Party yet"". Mr Boles, MP for Grantham and Stamford, has been an outspoken critic of leaving the EU with no deal. The MP - who is in favour of a closer Norway-style relationship with Europe - said he was ""proud"" of his role in the cross-party campaign to force the prime minister to request an extension to Article 50 beyond 29 March, and to block a no-deal Brexit. But Councillor Martin Hill, vice president of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association, told members they had been ""betrayed by their parliamentary representative"", calling on him to take the ""honourable course"" and quit as an MP. A simple guide to Brexit What happened this week? And what happens now? Mr Boles said a ""certain amount of pressure was applied"" by the local party after he was asked to tell them if he intended to stand as their representative at the next general election. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""I represent 100,000 people in Parliament. I have roughly 500 members in my local association and roughly 60 people on my executive. ""I'm afraid I'm going to claim the right to interpret what is in the best interest of the 100,000 people I represent and I'm not going to be bossed around by a very small number of people with very ideological views."" Despite leaving the local association, whose members he wrote to this weekend, Mr Boles said he remains loyal to the party. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button He said: ""I have voted for Theresa May's deal every time it has been offered and I will vote for it again on Tuesday. ""The only thing and, in truth , the real area where I fell out with some members of my association, was in my efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit - and obviously I was very much involved in this plan that reached its fruition last week to stop a no-deal Brexit."" He said he had been told he could continue as a Conservative MP, with his membership being transferred from his local party to the national party. He is to meet the chief whip on Monday. His announcement came after a busy week in Westminster, whenMPs voted to seek a delayto the UK's departure from the EU. The third ""meaningful vote"" on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is expected to take place next week. If it is agreed, she has promised to seek a shorter extension to the departure date. But if it does not gain support, she has warned a longer extension may be needed - and the UK might have to take part in European elections.

"The funding of mental health care for Scotland's prisoners must be increased after the number of self-harm incidents ""skyrocketed"", an MSP has said. Figures show there were 762 incidents in 2018, compared with 532 in the previous year - a jump of 43%. These include burns, cuts, attempted suicide, ligature, overdoses and swallowing items. The Scottish government said it was increasing the support for prisoners with mental health needs. The highest number of incidents was at HMP & YOI Grampian in the north east which recorded 175 cases in 2018 of which 138 were categorised as ""cuts"". Of the 762 total incidents recorded across Scotland, 517 were for cuts, 72 were categorised under ""swallows item"", 41 for ""overdose"" and 31 as ""attempted suicide"". The highest number of incidents was at HMP & YOI Grampian in the north east The figures were published following a Freedom of Information request made by the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The party's justice spokesman, Liam McArthur MSP, said: ""Incident numbers have been on an upward trajectory for years but last year they skyrocketed. ""The scale of self-harm in Scotland's prisons is devastating. This must prompt serious new investment in prison mental health care. ""Prison staff are working incredibly hard but they don't have the resources or staff they need.""

""However, so far there are just two new staff across Scotland's 15 prisons. Ministers still can't tell us how many extra staff there will be in the end. ""Staff, prisoners and the communities they return to have every right to demand better. We need more mental health professionals deployed in our prisons now. This will help save lives."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We recognise that people entering the criminal justice system often have complex needs. ""This is why in recent years SPS (Scottish Prisons Service) have improved reporting procedures and awareness of the risks of self-harm among prison staff, ensuring that cases are properly recorded and appropriate care and support are provided. ""SPS are working closely with NHS staff, responsible for mental healthcare provision in Scotland's prisons. In addition, HMIPS is currently carrying out a review of mental health services at HMP YOI Polmont and a review of forensic services, which will include provision in the prison estate, was announced last week. ""The learning and recommendations from these reviews will inform our approach in the future."" The spokesman added: ""Through our 10 year mental health strategy, we are delivering an increase in support for the mental health needs of people detained in prison. ""The strategy aims to increase the overall mental health workforce by 800 additional staff, with prisons also benefiting from this enhanced workforce.

"Theresa May has asked MPs to make an ""honourable compromise"" as she seeks to persuade them to back her Brexit deal at the third time of asking. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe prime minister said failure to support the deal would mean ""we will not leave the EU for many months, if ever"". Mrs May is expected to bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons next week for a third vote. It comes after MPs this weekrejected her dealandvoted to delay Brexit. Former Cabinet minister Esther McVey,who resigned over the Brexit agreement, told Sky's Sophie Ridge programme that she would ""hold my nose"" and vote for the deal after rejecting it twice herself, as it was now a choice between ""this deal or no Brexit"". And a letter signed by 15 Tory MPs from Leave-backing constituencies, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, also urged colleagues to back the deal. But International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned the vote could be pulled, telling Sophie Ridge it was ""difficult to justify having a vote if we knew we were going to lose it"". The EU will decide the terms and conditions of any extension. Legally, the UK is still due to leave the EU on 29 March. Brexit: A really simple guide What's happened with Brexit this week? Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to MPs across the Commons inviting them for talks to find a cross-party compromise. He also told Sky that while he ""has to see the wording of it"", Labour MPs would be told to vote in favour of an amendment calling for another referendum next week, and he said he may propose another vote of no confidence in the government if the PM's deal is voted down again. Mrs May says if Parliament votes for her withdrawal deal before an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, the UK will seek a short delay to Brexit to pass the necessary legislation. ""That is not an ideal outcome - we could and should have been leaving the EU on 29 March,"" she said. ""But it is something the British people would accept if it led swiftly to delivering Brexit. The alternative if Parliament cannot agree the deal by that time is much worse."" If a deal is not agreed before Thursday, EU leaders are contemplating a much longer delay. Mrs May said it would be a ""potent symbol of Parliament's collective political failure"" if a delay to Brexit meant the UK was forced to take part in May's European elections - almost three years after voting to leave the EU. This video can not be played Political Correspondent Jonathan Blake explains what's next for Brexit On Tuesday,MPs overwhelmingly rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for a second time- by 149 votes. In her article, Mrs May said she had more to do to convince dozens of Tory MPs to back the deal - as well as getting Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to drop their opposition. She wrote: ""I am convinced that the time to define ourselves by how we voted in 2016 must now end. ""We can only put those old labels aside if we stand together as democrats and patriots, pragmatically making the honourable compromises necessary to heal division and move forward."" The DUP, which has twice voted against the agreement, said there were ""still issues to be discussed"" and it remained in talks with the government. The 10 votes provided by the DUP, which props up the Conservative government, are thought to be key to the prime minister securing her deal. In the letter from Conservative MPs asking others to back the deal, the group claimed there were people ""who will stop at nothing to prevent Britain leaving the EU"", adding they would vote for the deal to ensure Brexit went ahead. ""We urge colleagues who, like us, wish to deliver Brexit, to vote for the deal and ensure we leave the EU as soon as possible,"" they said. ""We need to leave now, take the risk of 'no Brexit' off the table, and then continue to fight for the best future relationship as an independent nation.""

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond: ""We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it"" Theresa May's Brexit deal will not return to the Commons this week unless it has support from the DUP and Tory MPs, the chancellor says. The PM's plan is expected to be voted on for a third time in the coming days. But Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr that it would only be put to MPs if ""enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it"". He did not rule out a financial settlement for Northern Ireland if the DUP backed the deal. The party, which has 10 MPs in the Commons, negotiated Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland as part of a confidence and supply agreement with the Tories - giving the government a working majority. Mr Hammond said they did not have the numbers ""yet"" to secure Mrs May's deal, adding: ""It is a work in progress"". But he warned that, even with the DUP's support, a ""short extension"" would be needed to pass legislation in Parliament, adding that it was now ""physically impossible"" for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Mrs May risked ""destroying all confidence in our political system"" if her government was planning to give the DUP ""another bung"".

Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Earlier last week MPs rejected Theresa May's deal again - this time by 149 votes - and then backed plans to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. They also voted in favour of an extension to the process - either until 30 June if Mrs May's deal is supported before 20 March, or a longer one that could include taking part in European elections if MPs reject her plan for a third time. But legally the UK is still due to leave the EU on 29 March. All 27 EU member states would have to agree to an extension, and the countries' leaders are expected to discuss it at a summit on Thursday. Mr Hammond told Andrew Marr that it was now ""physically impossible"" for the UK to leave on 29 March. ""If the prime minister's deal is able to muster a majority this week and get through, then we will need a short extension,"" he said. ""But if we are unable to do that - if we are unable to bring a majority together to support what in my view is a very good deal for Britain - then we will have to look at a longer extension and we are in uncharted territory."" Asked if the deal would be voted on again this week, the chancellor said: ""The answer to that is no - not definitely. ""We will only bring the deal back if we are confident that enough of our colleagues and the DUP are prepared to support it so we can get it through Parliament.

"This video can not be played The New Zealand church-goers rallying to help mosque attack victims Stories of heroism have emerged from Friday's attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 50 people died and dozens were wounded. A worshipper says he confronted the gunman and threw a credit card reader at him. Two police officers, one of them armed with only a handgun, chased and arrested Brenton Tarrant, 28. The suspect had explosives in his car and was planning more attacks that day, said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. She has called the killings ""an act of terror"". Later on Monday, her cabinet is to discuss changing the country's gun laws. Who are the victims? How attacks unfolded More about the suspect Investigators have been examining the bodies, which are due be returned to relatives for burial by Wednesday. Tributes have been paid for the victims while some 34 people remain in hospital, including a four-year-old girl who is in a critical condition. Abdul Aziz says he chased the gunman with a credit card machine Afghan-born Abdul Aziz, 48, said he was inside the Linwood mosque, the second target of the attacker, when he heard shouts that someone had opened fire. When he realised the mosque was being attacked, he picked up a credit card machine and ran towards the attacker. He threw the device at the gunman when he returned to his car to pick up another weapon, and ducked between cars as the gunman opened fire on him. Mr Aziz, who was in the mosque with four of his children, picked up a gun that the suspect had dropped and pulled the trigger, but it was empty. He followed the attacker back inside the mosque, where he eventually confronted him again. ""When he saw me with the shotgun, he dropped the gun and ran away toward his car. I chased him,"" he told Reuters news agency. ""He sat in his car and... I threw [the gun] through his window like an arrow. He just swore at me and took off."" This video can not be played Victim's husband Farid Uddin: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" Linwood's acting imam Latef Alabi told the Associated Pressthe death toll would have been far higher,externalat the mosque if Mr Aziz, who said he had not feared the gunman, had not acted. Two rural community police officers who were nearby chased the attacker, blocked his car and captured him. The moment was filmed by a witness, who posted the footage on social media. ""[The officers] put New Zealand first,"" Ms Ardern said on Saturday, adding that they would be recognised for their bravery. By Jay Savage in Christchurch Nasir Uddin gazes through the trees in the park towards the exterior wall and golden roof of the Al Noor mosque across the road. With a police perimeter still in place, it's as near as he can get. He looks at the building with tear-filled eyes. ""Now we are very sad,"" he says shakily as he stands in Christchurch's Hagley Park. A migrant from Bangladesh, Mr Uddin, 37, moved to this picturesque city on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island more than five years ago. An Al Noor regular, he would have been at the mosque on Friday if he hadn't had to work. After hearing of the attacks, he began frantically calling people, but no-one answered. He knows at least two of his friends are dead, and is waiting for news on others. ""This thing that we feel is too painful."" Read more from Jay The gunman first attacked the Al Noor mosque, about 5km (three miles) away, as people had gathered for Friday prayers. The self-described white supremacist live-streamed it on Facebook. The video showed 50-year-old Naeem Rashid, originally from the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, apparently trying to tackle the gunman before being shot. He was taken to hospital but later died. This video can not be played Victim's brother: ""No words to describe the pain"" ""There were a few witnesses who said he saved a few lives by trying to stop that guy,"" his brother Khurshid Alam told the BBC. ""It's our pride now, but still the loss. It's like cutting your limb off."" Mr Rashid's 21-year-old son Talha - who had just got a new job and was said to be hoping to get married soon - was also killed. The family had been living in New Zealand since 2010. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said Mr Rashid would be honoured posthumously. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Farid Uddin said his wife had helped several women and children escape from the building as the attack unfolded. ""We feel proud of what she did. She died in a good cause. She did exactly what she loved and what I loved,"" he told the BBC. ""I lost my wife but I don't hate the killer. As a person I love him,"" he added. ""I forgive him... I pray for him."" Social media's role in attack New Zealand's gun laws Police arrived at the mosque - where at least 41 people were killed - six minutes after an emergency call, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said, and the gunman was in custody within 36 minutes. On Tuesday, Parliament will pay a tribute to the victims. Other confirmed victims include: Kuwait-born Atta Elayyan, 33, who was the goalkeeper for New Zealand's futsal team Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria Sayyad Milne, a 14-year-old who wanted to be a footballer when he grew up Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday in a white prison shirt and handcuffs, smiling for the cameras. He has been charged with one count of murder, with more charges expected to follow. He is the only person charged with carrying out the shootings and is believed to have acted alone, according to Commissioner Bush.

"This video can not be played Nick Boles: ""I'm not going to be bossed around by a very small number of people"" Tory MP Nick Boles, who quit his local party on Saturday over his stance on Brexit, says his priority lies with his constituents and he will not be ""bossed around by a small number of people"". He told the Andrew Marr Show he thought about standing as an independent MP. But he said he had decided to remain as he was not ""ready to give up on the Conservative Party yet"". Mr Boles, MP for Grantham and Stamford, has been an outspoken critic of leaving the EU with no deal. The MP - who is in favour of a closer Norway-style relationship with Europe - said he was ""proud"" of his role in the cross-party campaign to force the prime minister to request an extension to Article 50 beyond 29 March, and to block a no-deal Brexit. But Councillor Martin Hill, vice president of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association, told members they had been ""betrayed by their parliamentary representative"", calling on him to take the ""honourable course"" and quit as an MP. A simple guide to Brexit What happened this week? And what happens now? Mr Boles said a ""certain amount of pressure was applied"" by the local party after he was asked to tell them if he intended to stand as their representative at the next general election. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""I represent 100,000 people in Parliament. I have roughly 500 members in my local association and roughly 60 people on my executive. ""I'm afraid I'm going to claim the right to interpret what is in the best interest of the 100,000 people I represent and I'm not going to be bossed around by a very small number of people with very ideological views."" Despite leaving the local association, whose members he wrote to this weekend, Mr Boles said he remains loyal to the party. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button He said: ""I have voted for Theresa May's deal every time it has been offered and I will vote for it again on Tuesday. ""The only thing and, in truth , the real area where I fell out with some members of my association, was in my efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit - and obviously I was very much involved in this plan that reached its fruition last week to stop a no-deal Brexit."" He said he had been told he could continue as a Conservative MP, with his membership being transferred from his local party to the national party. He is to meet the chief whip on Monday. His announcement came after a busy week in Westminster, whenMPs voted to seek a delayto the UK's departure from the EU. The third ""meaningful vote"" on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal is expected to take place next week. If it is agreed, she has promised to seek a shorter extension to the departure date. But if it does not gain support, she has warned a longer extension may be needed - and the UK might have to take part in European elections.

"The gold pendant would have belonged to a ""high status woman"", like the famous Winfarthing Pendant An Anglo-Saxon gold pendant, found near a site where a similar item worth Â£145,000 was dug up, probably belonged to a woman of ""high social status"". The Winfarthing Pendant was found in 2014 near Diss in Norfolk. The latest pendant, with a central cross motif, was found in 2017 and it has been declared treasure. Julie Shoemark, Norfolk's finds liaison officer, said it made a ""valuable contribution to our understanding of Saxon society"". Anglo-Saxon villages featured wooden housing, similar to this recreation at West Stow in Suffolk In 2014, a student found Anglo-Saxon jewellery, including a pendant, at Winfarthing,later valued by the government's Portable Antiquities Scheme at Â£145,000. The more recently discovered pendant, which features gold bead work and measures 17mm (0.67in) by 13mm (0.5in), is believed to date from the late-6th Century to the mid-7th. Ms Shoemark, from Norfolk County Council's archaeology department, said: ""Like the Winfarthing assemblage, this piece most likely belonged to a high-status lady. ""It dates to an important turning point in Saxon history during the first flowering of Christianity [in England] and is of similar date to the jewellery assemblage from the now famous and nearby Winfarthing burial. ""Male graves of this period appear to be entirely lacking in elaborate jewellery. ""This latest pendant makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of Saxon society, religion and the position of women during a period of immense social and cultural change."" It was declared treasure at an inquest held by the Norfolk Coroner's Office. This means ownership now lies with the Crown. It will now be valued by the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

"If she wins in the second round, Caputova will become the first female president of Slovakia Lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner Zuzana Caputova has easily won the first round of Slovakia's presidential election. She has just over 40% with Maros Sefcovic of the ruling Smer-SD party her nearest rival on less than 19%. Ms Caputova came to prominence during mass protests sparked by the murder of a journalist who had been investigating political corruption. As no candidate won more than 50%, a second-round run-off will be held. Turnout was just under 50%. If Ms Caputova, 45, wins the second round in a fortnight's time, she will become Slovakia's first female president. ""I see the message from voters as a strong call for change,"" she said early on Sunday. A member of the small Progressive Slovakia party, which has no seats in parliament, she is a newcomer to politics, whereas her conservative 52-year-old opponent is vice-president of the European Commission. Ms Caputova first rose to prominence when she led a battle lasting 14 years against an illegal landfill. More recently, Slovakia has seen large anti-government rallies following the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancÃ©e in February last year. The protests prompted Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign. The murder of Jan Kuciak and his fiancÃ©e Martina Kusnirova convulsed Slovak society A new suspect in the killings was charged earlier this week with ordering the murders. Four others were charged by investigators last year. Ms Caputova was backed in her campaign by outgoing President Andrej Kiska, who did not seek a second term in office. The Slovak presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but the president has limited powers of veto over laws passed by parliament.

"This video can not be played Protesters wave Catalan flags in Madrid Tens of thousands of supporters of Catalan independence have rallied in Spain's capital Madrid in protest at an ongoing trial of 12 separatist leaders. Many waved Catalan flags and had placards reading ""Self-determination is not a crime"". Protest organisers said 120,000 people marched in Madrid. Spanish police put the number at just 18,000. The separatist leaders of Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid face rebellion and sedition charges. If convicted, some could face up to 25 years in prison. Catalan 'rebellion' trial puts Spain's courts to the test Catalan crisis in 300 words Catalonia region profile The rally was organised by more than 60 civil society groups from all over Spain. Portraits of the Catalan leaders currently being on trial were displayed on banners Catalonia's regional government president Quim Torra (right) and his predecessor Artur Mas (left) were at the rally Hundreds of buses were laid on to bring demonstrators to Madrid from Catalonia and other regions. The protesters then marched from the Atocha train station to the Plaza de Cibeles. There have been no reports of any violence. The semi-autonomous north-eastern region of Catalonia held an independence referendum on 1 October 2017, and declared its independence from Spain weeks later. Spanish authorities declared the Catalan vote illegal, and the national government imposed direct rule. Spain's 1978 constitution speaks of ""the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation"".

"This video can not be played The quickest low blow ever? Masvidal shocks Till Liverpool's Darren Till suffered a shock loss to Jorge Masvidal in the main event at UFC London in front of a sold-out crowd at the O2 Arena. The American veteran produced a devastating knockout in the second round to inflict only the second defeat of Till's UFC career. Till, fighting for the first time since his title loss to Tyron Woodley in September, was heavily tipped to bounce back at the first time of asking and give himself another shot at the welterweight crown. But, on a night that saw former championMichael Bisping inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame,Till was dropped by a brutal left hand that will no doubt push him further down the pecking order for a fight against newly-crowned champion Kamaru Usman. Masvidal said afterwards he has his own sights set on the title, but in another surprising twist he cut short his post-fight interview backstage to attack Birmingham fighter Leon Edwards - winner of the co-main event against Gunnar Nelson. Returning to winning ways at the first attempt was always top of Till's agenda against the dangerous Masvidal, after suffering the first loss of his UFC career to Woodley in Dallas. Till raised the roof on his last appearance in the UK in his home city of Liverpool, and was again buoyed by English support in the capital as he guided the crowd through a rendition of Sweet Caroline on his arrival in the octagon. But the home favourite's relaxed demeanour only made the knockout more of a surprise. Masvidal likes to play on the fact he loves ""fighting in people's backyards"" and insisted beforehand he would have to finish the bout inside the distance rather than let it go to the judges. And he kept to his word to end his own run of successive defeats, as well as play up to his own tagline. ""I got dropped in the first and that made me wake up,"" said Masvidal after the fight. ""I wanted to get him back immediately. ""I love the scrap - Darren is so tough. Before I dropped him I hit him with some bombs and the dude just smiled at me like, like I do to other people. ""The kid is headed far - he is going places for sure. ""I want to fight for the belt now. Darren only has one loss and that is to the champion. I've got a huge body of work in this division and this corporation. It's my time and I need that belt."" Till did not give any interviews after the fight, instead going to hospital for checks. Darren Till's knockdown silenced the crowd of 16,602 The bout started in frantic fashion as Masvidal came leaping towards Till and caught the English fighter with a low kick, for which he apologised, but it seemed to rattle Till. However the Liverpudlian responded with some showmanship of his own, shrugging off a couple of attempted strikes from his opponent before the knockout blow landed. Till has spoken about the pain of his second-round loss to Woodley, but the welterweight division has moved on swiftly in the past six months and Till's position is now unclear. Woodley has since lost the title to Usman and, with Woodley potentially set to face fellow American and former interim champion Colby Covington next, as the division's number three Till hoped to step up his campaign to face the Nigerian newly-crowned champion. But now he may have to look elsewhere for his next fight on the promotion, with Edwards having a legitimate claim to face his fellow countryman after beating Iceland's Nelson in the co-main event, while UFC newcomer Ben Askren will also be waiting in the wings after attending the event as guest fighter and engaging in a Twitter spat with Till in the build-up. Leon Edwards was impressive in his victory over Gunnar Nelson Birmingham fighter Edwards made no secret in the build-up to UFC London that he felt he should be fighting Till in the headline bout, but instead the number 10 welterweight was handed a co-main event fight against Nelson. And he kept to his end of the bargain, taking a split-decision victory to extend his winning streak to seven fights - a run that stretches back to a loss to now-champion Usman in December 2015. Edwards' improved grappling skills saw him match submission specialist Nelson, a team-mate of Irish star Conor McGregor, during the first round but support for his opponent - including the now-trademark Icelandic thunderclap - was deafening. It was the Englishman who again ended round two on the attack as he pounced on a stumble from Nelson to throw a flurry of dangerous strikes on the ground which proved enough to clinch him the bout. ""I feel good, I'm on a seven-fight winning streak now in one of the hardest divisions in the sport,"" said Edwards. ""The winner of the main event, that should be my fight."" Like most people inside the O2, Edwards expected that to be Till, rather than Masvidal. Masvidal and Edwards then came to blows as the American walked away from a post-fight interview, with the American throwing several punches towards the Englishman as Edwards was hauled away by his team. The incident was swiftly dealt with by the UFC's security team. Nathaniel Wood unfurled an England flag after his victory, scaling the octagon Nathaniel Wood did not disappoint on his first UFC appearance in the UK as the bantamweight extended his unbeaten start to life on the promotion to three successive wins with a second-round submission against Mexican Jose Quinonez. The 25-year-old Londoner had been eyeing a spot on this card since his UFC debut last June and the former Cage Warriors champion became a fans' favourite from the moment he stepped into the octagon at the O2 Arena. 'The Prospect', whose last trip to the venue was to watch his now mentor and trainer Brad 'One Punch' Pickett in action five years ago, was the more aggressive throughout and brought the entire crowd to its feet when he forced Quinonez to tap out with a rear-naked choke hold. ""This really means so much to me,"" said Wood. ""It really is a dream come true."" Meanwhile, a ""gutted""Danny Robertsfelt his welterweight contest with London-basedClaudio Silvashould have been given longer after the referee stopped it for a verbal tap out in the third round. ""Yes, I might have made noise and grunted - I was hurt - but I was ready to take it all the way,"" said the English fighter. Meanwhile, AmericanDominick Reyestook his light-heavyweight bout against Switzerland'sVolkan Oezdemiron a split decision, before calling out UFC champion Jon Jones. This video can not be played Bizarre exchange between Marshman and Phillips The first fight on the main card was dubbed the 'Battle of Wales', but there was more than national pride at stake with the loser of the middleweight bout knowing their place in the UFC may also be under threat. The respect betweenJack MarshmanandJohn Phillipswas obvious - Phillips stopping to let his countryman to his feet in the first round before sharing a high-five - but when the result went in Marshman's favour by way of split decision it was greeted by boos from some inside the arena. Phillips was left to shrug his shoulders in the direction of his corner, and ponder his future on the promotion. There was no such reaction earlier when Molly McCann earned the first win of her UFC career. 'Meatball' said she ""couldn't see"" by the time her fight with Brazilian Priscilla Cachoeira was over, but despite the Liverpudlian's eye being completely swollen shut she took a unanimous decision after a brutal three rounds. Mike Grundybegan his career in the UFC with a bang as he stopped fellow Englishman Nad Narimani in the second round.

"Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand The Christchurch mosque attacks were live-streamed on the internet by a man posting online under the name Brenton Tarrant. He said he was Australian. Distressing footage shows him firing indiscriminately at men, women and children at close range inside the Al Noor mosque on Friday. The individual had previously posted a rambling and expletive-filled document, espousing violent right-wing ideology. Reaction to the attacks A day later, the 28 year old appeared in court in Christchurch, charged with murder. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect had ""travelled around the world with sporadic periods of time spent in New Zealand"" and that he was currently living in Dunedin, south of Christchurch. ""I would not describe him as a long-term resident,"" she said ""The offender was in possession of a gun licence. I'm advised that this was acquired in November of 2017."" She said New Zealand intelligence services had been stepping up investigations into far-right extremists, but added: ""The individual charged with murder had not come to the attention of the intelligence community nor the police for extremism."" Brenton Tarrant appeared in court in Christchurch in a white prison uniform. He was remanded in custody, with no bail application made. State-appointed lawyer Richard Peters says the defendant fired him and wanted to represent himself. ""The way he presented was rational and someone who was not suffering any mental disability,"" Mr Peters said. ""He seemed to understand what was going on."" The man in the footage equipped himself with what appears to be a head-mounted camera to live-stream the attack in central Christchurch. The streams were broadcast online, including briefly on Facebook, showing the violence in graphic detail. A song which played in the suspect's car is known as a marching anthem for Serbian nationalist paramilitary units known as Chetniks during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. It praises Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was convicted of genocide and war crimes. Weaponry shown in the footage circulating of the attack The names of men convicted of killing Muslims and migrants are written on the suspect's weaponry. One item has the words ""For Rotherham"" written on it, a reference to a child abuse scandal in the UK, while other wording references historical battles between European countries and the Ottoman Empire. Australian media reported that Brenton Tarrant was originally from Grafton, a town 600km (370 miles) north of Sydney, and had previously worked at a fitness facility. ""He never showed any extremist views or any crazy behaviour,""his former boss, Tracey Gray, told Seven News,external. The 16,500-word document he posted is entitled The Great Replacement - a phrase that originated in France and has become a rallying cry for European anti-immigration extremists. In it, the man says he began planning an attack after visiting Europe in 2017 and being angered by events there. This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern: 'This can only be described as a terrorist attack' Specifically, he referencesa lorry attack carried out by an Islamic State sympathiser in Sweden, France's decision to elect the moderate Emmanuel Macron as president, and ethnic diversity in France. Despite insisting that he is not motivated by fame, he acknowledges that he intends to survive the attack, and hopes it will spread fear. He chose the Al Noor mosque as his target three months ago, the document says. The central tenet of the conspiracy is that ""European peoples"" are dying out and being ""replaced"" by immigrants with a different, inferior and dangerous culture, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani. This is basically a code for hatred or fear of Muslims - part of the theory is that states and corporations are encouraging ""white genocide"" by pushing up immigration rates to keep global capitalism going, says our correspondent. Brenton Tarrant has travelled frequently, venturing to North Korea, Europe, Turkey and Pakistan. Bulgarian prosecutor general Sotir Tsatsarov said he visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia in 2016, stopping at historic battle sites in the area. He returned to Eastern Europe in November 2018 where he saw more historic sites in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. Mr Tsatsarov said Bulgaria is now investigating whether he had ties with people in the country. Brenton Tarrant travelled extensively, but grew up in the Australian town of Grafton Turkish officials have confirmed he visited Turkey several times, and reportedly said an investigation was under way into his ""movements and contacts within the country"". A hotel owner in the far-north of Pakistan told the BBC that Brenton Tarrant had spent two nights in the area in October 2018. Syed Israr Hussain, who runs the Osho Thang hotel, said Tarrant expressed no visible hostility to Muslims or Islam. He said he was travelling alone and ""walked around the local area"" taking pictures like any other tourist. The area is popular with trekkers. A now deleted post on Mr Hussain's social media account from last October is attributed to Brenton Tarrant and reads: ""Pakistan is an incredible place filled with the most earnest kind hearted and hospitable people in the world."" Mr Hussain said Brenton Tarrant left those comments ""for the world to see"". He added he was ""shocked"" by the attack in Christchurch. There are also reports that Tarrant visited Afghanistan and China's Xinjiang region. Four people were arrested in the aftermath of the attack - three men and a woman, who was subsequently released without charge. Police say they do not believe they were connected to the attack. Of those, two remain in custody: a man who apparently went to help carrying a rifle, who has been charged with a firearms offence an 18-year-old, who appeared in court on Monday, charged with distributing the live-stream Prime Minister Ardern said none of those in custody had been on active security watch lists in New Zealand or Australia. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses have reported running for their lives to escape a shooter. ""I have asked our agencies this morning to work swiftly on assessing whether there was any activity on social media or otherwise, that should have triggered a response,"" the prime minister said.

"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds speaks to the media outside the Cabinet Office on Friday The Democratic Unionist Party has said there are ""still issues to be discussed"" with the government as Theresa May continues to try to win support for her Brexit deal. Mrs May is expected to bring her withdrawal agreement back to the Commons next week for a third vote. It comes after MPs this weekrejected her dealandvoted to delay Brexit. The DUP, which has twice voted against the agreement, said it remained in discussions with the government. It has been reported by the Spectator magazine that there isa ""better than 50:50 chance"",externalthe party will support the deal next week. MPs vote to seek delay to Brexit Will EU leaders agree to extending Brexit? McVey hints she will back PM's Brexit deal A DUP spokesman denied reports that extra money for Northern Ireland had been part of the talks, despite the involvement of Chancellor Philip Hammond in discussions on Friday. The party has previously voted against the deal over concerns around the Northern Ireland backstop - an insurance policy to maintain an open border in Ireland. The 10 votes provided by the DUP, which props up the government, are thought to be key to the prime minister securing her deal. A DUP party spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the government to ensure Northern Ireland is not separated out from the rest of the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. Contrary to some reports, we are not discussing cash. ""There are still issues to be addressed in our discussions."" If the deal fails to gain support, having already been defeated in the Commons by large margins twice, Mrs May has warned a longer extension may be needed, and the UK may have to take part in European elections. Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics suggested a delay of up to two years could be required if MPs continue to reject Mrs May's withdrawal agreement. ""Number one priority would be the deal that is reached is passed,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If it is not the case, what we need is clear vision from the UK government how much time UK needs to come up with new proposals, new ideas how we proceed. ""In that case it's not a couple of months, I believe then we are talking about maybe one or two years."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Former Cabinet minister Esther McVey,who resigned over the Brexit agreement, suggested fellow Brexiteers could back Mrs May's ""rubbish"" deal next week to make sure the UK leaves the EU. She told BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking With Nick Robinson podcast: ""The element now is that people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal."" Meanwhile, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said ""quite a number"" of MPs would be prepared to support a compromise deal, with the guarantee the deal goes back to the people for a final say on Brexit. Speaking before an event in Gravesend, Kent, Mr McDonnell said politicians would move ""heaven and earth"" to prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. But any final say should not be on the deal Mrs May has agreed, ""because it's not credible"", he said. Earlier,Tory MP Nick Boles resigned from his local Conservative associationafter clashing with the group over Brexit. Mr Boles, who has spoken out against leaving the EU with no deal, said a ""division had opened up"" between him and the local association. Local activists had wanted to deselect him as their candidate in the next general election because of his stance on Brexit. Chief Whip Julian Smith said Mr Boles was a ""valued member of the Conservative parliamentary party, which I hope will continue to benefit from his ideas and drive"". Separately, pro-Brexit marchers, led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage,have begun a two-week journey from Sunderland to London. About 100 people assembled to start the march. They were joined by counter-protesters, including those from anti-Brexit campaign Led by Donkeys. Mr Farage aims to walk 100 miles of the 270-mile March to Leave, which is due to arrive in the capital on 29 March.

Late one night he was putting the finishing touches to his latest set of wedding photographs due for delivery to his excited newly-wed clients. Then everything on his computer screen changed. Not just the folder of pictures, but his entire body of work, emails and invoices were gone. For the school headteacher in Texas, US, it didn’t hit home how serious it was until she remembered what her computer contained. The detailed, long-term financial plan for her already stretched high school. It had taken months of work and huge investment to plan for the future and, with the click of mouse, the hackers now had control. For the senior manager of a large corporation in Hong Kong, it was instant cold sweat. He had heard about this type of computer virus and how dangerous it could be. But he never thought that he would be tricked into clicking on a wrong link. Now, as he read the ransom note, he panicked. This could cost him his job. Ransomware is a particularly nasty type of computer virus. Instead of stealing data or money from victims, the virus takes control of computers and scrambles every single document, picture, video and email. Then the ransom demand is issued. Sometimes it’s written inside a note left on a desktop, sometimes it just pops up on a screen without warning. They always come with a price tag. Pay the hackers a few hundred pounds - or sometimes thousands - and they’ll restore your files. All of the victims mentioned above were hit with some form of ransomware. But the Hong Kong businessman didn’t lose his job and the photographer and head teacher were able to recover their work. None had to pay any money, and once they’d got their lives back in order, all sent emails of thanks to the same person. He’s a man who has devoted himself, at huge personal cost, to helping victims of ransomware around the world. A man who guards his privacy dearly to protect himself, because for every message of gratitude he receives, almost as many messages of abuse come at him from the cyber criminals who hate him. In fact, they hate him so much that they leave him angry threats buried deep inside the code of their own viruses. To the untrained eye, the code of a computer virus is just a jumbled mess of letters, numbers and symbols. But to Fabian Wosar, each line is a clear instruction. He knows and understands every digit and dot in the same way a pianist would read a page of musical notes. About a year ago, as his eyes darted around the screen looking for a clue to help him crack the latest ransomware, he was stopped in his tracks. Standing out amongst the code, in glaring green letters, were expletives referring to Fabian. By name. “I was shocked but I also felt a real sense of pride,” says Fabian.  “Almost like, a little bit cocky. I’m not going to lie, yeah, it was nice. It’s clear that the coder is really pissed. “They’ve taken the time and effort to write a message knowing that I’ll probably see it and I’m clearly getting under their skin. It’s a pretty good motivator to know that my work is upsetting some really nasty cyber-criminal gangs.” Fabian shows me other messages. It takes me a while to spot them as I scroll through endless strings of code. When I find one it stands out like a beacon in the sea of otherwise unreadable characters. Nearly all are obscene, offensive and threatening. There are frequent references to Fabian’s mother, and descriptions of sexual acts are common. Many are goading and taunting Fabian. One virus was even named “Fabiansomware” in an attempt to fool the victim into blaming Fabian. There are some, though, that are more pleading in their tone, such as this one he found a few months ago. “They tried to make me feel guilty with this one. But obviously I still cracked their virus and released a decrypter,” he says. “Surprise, surprise it didn’t stop them and they released another version.” Fabian keeps every message he finds. They form a large collection on his computer and are just another motivator that keeps him dedicated, even obsessed, with his work. From the minute you step inside Fabian’s home you can see how that dedication manifests itself in his life. His unassuming terraced house on the outskirts of London has no decorative furnishings at all. No pictures or paintings adorn the walls. No lamps or plants. The shelves are empty except for a collection of Nintendo games and some computer coding manuals. He owns one board-game called Hacker: The Cyber Security Logic Game, which he admits he’s very good at - although he’s only ever played it alone. In short, his home isn’t very homely but this cheery, energetic young German doesn’t seem to mind. He even admits to spending “98%” of his time at home as he works from his office upstairs. “I’m one of those people who if I don’t really have a reason to go outside, I won’t,” he says. “I don’t really like to leave the house unless I have to. I do nearly all my shopping online and get everything delivered. I don’t really like too many things around as I spend nearly all of my time working.” Strangely, Fabian has chosen the smallest room in his house to set up his office. This is where, with the curtains closed, he toils away for most of his waking life gaining grateful fans and hateful, dangerous enemies around the world. He works remotely for a cyber security company, often sitting for hours at a time working with colleagues in different countries. When he’s “in the zone”, the outside world becomes even less important and his entire existence focuses on the code on his screen. He once woke up with keyboard imprints all over his face after falling asleep during a 35-hour session. All of this to create anti-ransomware programs that he and his company usually give away free. Victims simply download the tools he makes for each virus, follow the instructions and get their files back. You can see how he has built up such a vengeful group of angry cyber criminals. “We are never completely sure who we are dealing with, but my guess is that I have upset or angered around 100 different cyber gangs over the past few years,” says Fabian. “Writing code is like writing a novel. You can tell from the style. You can tell that you’re dealing with the same gangs quite often. It’s also pretty easy to follow the money. By looking at the Bitcoin wallets that the gangs ask victims to pay into, you can see who is responsible for each variation of ransomware and how much money they’re making.” He says that one group he “annoyed a lot” had made about $250,000 (£191,000) in three months - until he found their virus and stopped it. Ransomware is one of the most profitable ways for cyber criminals to make money. Stealing data is fine but you still need to find a buyer. In these attacks the victim is the buyer. Individuals rarely have backups of precious family photos, so are likely to pay the few hundred pounds to save those memories. Businesses often pay without alerting the authorities or upsetting shareholders. In some cases, local authorities pay after weighing up the cost of replacing their systems at taxpayers’ expense. In March, officials in Jackson County, Georgia, US, reportedly paid $400,000 (£301,000) to cyber criminals to get rid of a ransomware infection and regain access to their IT systems. It was reported that they had estimated it would cost millions to replace the computer network. The most successful cyber-crime gangs are run like mafia organisations with specific structures and divisions of labour. There are the virus coders, the money launderers, the protection heavies and the bosses who decide on targets and sometimes funnel the money into other, potentially more serious, criminal enterprises. Catching these gangs is extremely challenging. One of the most prolific recent ransomware gangs, responsible for two major ransomware families - CTB-Locker and Cerber - made an estimated $27m and eluded police for years. It took a global police operation involving the FBI, the UK’s National Crime Agency, and Romanian and Dutch investigators to bring them down. In December 2017, five arrests were made in Romania. According to research from Emsisoft, the cyber security company Fabian works for, a computer is attacked every two seconds. Their network has managed to prevent 2584105 infections in the past 60 days - and that’s just one anti-virus firm of dozens around the world. Some of the most destructive cyber-attacks in recent years have been carried out with ransomware. In May 2017, hundreds of British hospitals were plunged into chaos as a ransomware virus called WannaCry spread like wildfire through the NHS computer network. An estimated 70,000 devices – including computers, MRI scanners, blood-storage refrigerators and theatre equipment - were taken offline by the virus, which encrypted machines and demanded a payment in Bitcoin to save the files. Doctors and nurses were forced to resort to pen and paper and thousands of appointments and operations were cancelled or postponed. Worldwide, the ransomware claimed an estimated 300,000 computers in 150 countries, with systems in Russia, Ukraine, Taiwan and India worst affected. It didn’t take long for experts to blame hackers in North Korea for the attack, which is estimated to have caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage. Another piece of ransomware called Not Petya is responsible for what is often described as the most devastating cyber attack of all time. This one is estimated to have caused $10bn (£7.6bn) in damages with around $300m of that coming from one company. It was in June 2017 when the infection began. It originated in an otherwise benign piece of accountancy software popular with Ukrainian companies and spread throughout the country encrypting computers at energy companies, transport networks, airports and banks. Quickly, the virus scrambled files on computers in Germany, France, Italy, Poland and the UK. NotPetya was particularly cruel in that although it looked and acted like ransomware, it was effectively a “wiper” - even if victims did pay the ransom (and many did), the files could never actually be recovered. The company worst hit was Maersk, the largest logistics and container ship firm in the world. The entire business nearly ground to a halt and in the 10-day scramble to rebuild thousands of networked computers the price of commodities like bananas began to soar as shop shelves went bare. It’s believed this attack was politically motivated against Ukraine but no-one really knows who was to blame. “It’s pretty much an arms race,” says Fabian. ""They release a new ransomware virus, I find a flaw in its code and build the decryption tool to reverse it so people can get their files back.” “Then the criminals release a new version which they hope I can’t break. Sometimes they figure out what they did wrong and fix it, but a lot of the time they can’t see the flaw in their code. “In one case this back and forth with one cyber-crime gang went on for like six or seven months. It escalates with them getting more and more angry with me.” When he’s immersed in the race against these anonymous criminals, Fabian admits it is hard to keep on top of even the most basic functions like eating and drinking, and looking after himself. Amongst the mess of coding books and paperwork on his desk I spot two pill boxes. The containers with labels for each day of the week point to health issues, which he admits are a direct result of his lifestyle. “I’m heavily overweight and I have trouble with my blood pressure so I take some meds for that. I also struggle with hyperthyroidism,” he says. “It’s definitely down to my work and how I live. I’m actually thinking of getting a puppy to force me to leave the house for walks. And the companionship would be nice too.” It was another message specifically about his weight that led him to flee Germany and end up in the UK. About a year ago, he came across a hidden message which, unlike most, was terrifyingly personal: This one he couldn’t ignore. Not because it hurt his feelings but because it showed that the cyber criminals knew something about him. Up to this point he had kept everything except his name a closely-guarded secret. Not even his boss or co-workers knew where he lived in his hometown in east Germany, and now it seemed the net could be closing in with the criminals. “It definitely got to me. Not because of the overweight thing - because I clearly am overweight - but because I realised people were kind of stalking me online,” he says. Fabian describes it as a creepy time. He scoured his social media accounts and web forums for any pictures or references to his appearance. He found that years ago, a throwaway tweet had mentioned the Keto diet. “That was when I removed my birthdate everywhere and things like that to not give too many clues,” he says. “I remember thinking I had to get out of Germany, where you can easily have your location found with a few pieces of information. “It was very scary. I don’t think they would have killed me but these guys are highly dangerous. I know how much money they make and it would be literally nothing for them to drop 10 or 20,000 for like some Russian dude to turn up to my house and beat the living hell out of me. “I moved to the UK as soon as I could. You can hide here, there are no registers or anything and I can be anonymous.” Fabian still hasn’t told his co-workers exactly where he is in the UK. He only agreed to have a visit from me because he is just about to leave the area and won’t tell me where he’s going.Fabian accepts that moving around and restricting his life and circle of friends is just a part of the sacrifice for his hobby-turned-profession. He first discovered his passion for computers at the age of seven when he played on his dad’s work computer. Coming from a poor family in the former East Germany it was up to him to pursue his dream. He spent three years saving up the money for his first computer by collecting recyclable bottles and cans and selling them back to the council. At the age of 10 he had enough money to buy the machine and he began experimenting. This really took off when he got his first computer virus. “The virus was called TEQUILA-B. It messed my system up in all kinds of ways and I got really, really fascinated by it. I went to a library and they actually had a couple of books about computer viruses. I got into it and wrote my own antivirus program.” By 14, he was known throughout the municipality as the go-to-guy for computer problems and managed to save enough to help his family get a better house in a better neighbourhood. By 18, with no formal education or training, he joined cyber security firm Emsisoft where he has built his profile and is known in the industry as one of - if not the - best ransomware expert. With his skillset and notoriety, Fabian could be one of the biggest names and personalities in the cyber world but he chooses a more modest life. He earns a very good salary but looking around his home and at his life it’s hard to see how he spends it. “I don’t really spend my money, no. I like to play tabletop games online but that doesn’t cost much,” he says. “A lot of my money I send to my sister who has a little girl. I like to make sure she has everything she needs.” He gets offered thank yous and rewards all the time but doesn’t like to accept. One gift he was happy to accept, though, was a cartoon picture of what a grateful illustrator imagined he might look like. It shows a portly man wearing a polar bear hat. Bizarrely, she has managed to capture his essence (and love of polar bears) without looking much like him. He uses it as his online avatar, happy knowing that it came from another person he’s helped, but safe in the knowledge that his secret identity is secure. As I leave him, I feel privileged to have been invited to his home - one of very few people to be trusted with his location, albeit temporarily. I wish him good luck with his house move and the hunt for a puppy companion to share his strange life with. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.027528979
