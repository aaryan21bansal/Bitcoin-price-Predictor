"The PM has said she is trying to get further assurances from the European Union so she can win the Commons vote on her Brexit deal next week. Theresa May said that after delaying the vote last month, there was ""some further movement from the EU"" at December's European Council. But Labour accused ministers of trying to ""run down the clock"" to ""blackmail"" the UK into backing a ""botched deal"". Labour sources say they will back moves by MPs to frustrate a no-deal exit. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Nick Watt: Is EU about to rescue May? More than 200 MPs have signed a letter to Mrs May, urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit - which is one where the UK leaves the EU but without any agreed arrangements covering things like how trade or travel will work in the future. Labour sourcestold the Guardian,externalthat the party would back a cross-party amendment, to be debated on Tuesday, which would stop the government from taking economic measures arising from a no-deal, including raising taxes, unless Parliament had ""explicitly"" agreed to leave without a deal. It comes asa major exercise involving more than 100 lorrieshas been carried out in Kent to test out how to manage traffic queues near the Channel ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister has been hosting critics of her deal, including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and former leader Iain Duncan Smith, at a reception in Downing Street - the first of a series of events for Tory MPs this week. Her deal - which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has already been agreed with EU leaders. But it needs to pass a vote by MPs before it is accepted. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? Mrs May,who earlier on Monday was at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool to launch a 10-year plan for the NHS, said that after delaying the vote on her Brexit deal last month, there had been ""some further movement from the EU"" and she continued to speak to European leaders. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn to Theresa May: ""No more hiding, and no more running away"" ""In the coming days what we'll set out is not just about the EU but also about what we can do domestically, so we will be setting out measures which will be specific to Northern Ireland; we will be setting out proposals for a greater role for Parliament as we move into the next stage of negotiations,"" she said. ""And we're continuing to work on further assurances, on further undertakings from the European Union in relation to the concern that's been expressed by Parliamentarians."" But the EU Commission said there would be no renegotiation. A spokesman said ""everything on the table has been approved and... the priority now is to await events"" in the UK. Responding to an urgent question from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who asked for an update on progress made in achieving legal changes to the withdrawal agreement, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the Commons debate would begin on Wednesday. He said Mrs May had been in contact with ""a number of her EU counterparts"" over Christmas and said ministers ""will be clear on Wednesday"" what developments have been made. ""Securing the additional reassurance that Parliament needs remains our priority,"" he told MPs. ""It's a good deal, it's the only deal, and I believe it is the right deal in offering certainty for this country."" This video can not be played Margot James tells the BBC the UK ""might have to extend Article 50â, but would not give a timescale. But Mr Corbyn called Mrs May's deal a ""Frankenstein monster of a deal"". ""The government is trying to run down the clock in an attempt to blackmail this House and the country into supporting a botched deal,"" he said. ""We're now told, if we don't support it, the government is prepared to push our whole economy off a cliff edge."" Government sources have told the BBC the vote on the deal - which will come at the end of five days of debate - is set for Tuesday, 15 January, assuming MPs agree to sit this Friday. This video can not be played Emily Thornberry on no-deal letter: âIt is supported by the Treasury front bench, our front bench, so I suspect we will be signing it.â The prime minister's deal is facing opposition from many of her own MPs, as well as Labour and other opposition parties including the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats. The DUP - which Mrs May's Conservative Party relies on for a majority in Parliament - has said it will not back the deal. But Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng dismissed suggestions that the government had accepted it would lose next week's vote and was planning on returning to Brussels. ""The plan is to win the vote,"" Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that a week was ""a very long time in politics"" and he was ""very hopeful"" the deal would be voted through. A really simple guide to Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Fellow minister Margot James also urged MPs to back the deal but warned, if they could not reach agreement, Brexit might have to be delayed to allow for more negotiations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. ""We have very little time left,"" she told the BBC's Politics Live. ""We might have to extend Article 50. But I think it's very unlikely Parliament will actually stare down the barrel of that particular gun."" By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg One source joked to me that I could just re-open my notebook from the last day before the Christmas break and carry on as if the past fortnight hadn't happened. The prime minister is still pushing for extra promises from the EU about making the controversial Irish backstop temporary and a bigger role for Parliament and potentially for the Northern Ireland Assembly (which, remember, hasn't sat for a very long time now). But there is precious little sign of anything that might be described as hefty enough to convince scores of MPs to change their minds and swing in behind her deal. It is likely that something will emerge, a form of words, a stronger commitment to the hoped for start date for the long-term trade deal perhaps. But the EU is in no mood for something big that could reopen the withdrawal agreement.

"Anti-government protests have raged in France for seven weeks French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has announced plans to punish people who hold unsanctioned protests after seven weeks of anti-government unrest. His government wants to draft new legislation that will ban troublemakers from protests and clamp down on the wearing of masks at demonstrations. He said 80,000 members of the security forces would be deployed for the next expected wave of protests. Protesters smashed down the gates to a government office this weekend. In other chaotic scenes in Paris, demonstrators fought riot police, and cars and motorbikes were burnt. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Les gilet jaunes: The full story Protests against fuel tax erupted on 17 November when people across France donned high-visibility vests, giving them their nickname the ""gilets jaunes"" (""yellow vests""), and went out to disrupt traffic. Similar actions have followed every weekend and while the number of demonstrators has dropped, cities across France continue to see rioting and disruption. At least six people have died and at least 1,400 have been injured as a result of the unrest. Speaking on French TV channel TF1, Prime Minister Philippe said the government would support a ""new law punishing those who do not respect the requirement to declare [protests], those who take part in unauthorised demonstrations and those who arrive at demonstrations wearing face masks"". Prime Minister Philippe compared rioters to football hooligans Known troublemakers would be banned from taking part in demonstrations, in the same way known football hooligans have been banned from stadiums. The onus would be on ""the troublemakers, and not taxpayers, to pay for the damage caused"" to businesses and property during the protests. France country profile What began as anger over green tax on vehicle fuel has grown into more general discontent with the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron, who protesters accuse of favouring the urban elite. ""Those who question our institutions will not have the last word,"" Mr Philippe said on Monday. In a sign that the government was taking a harder line, police arrestedone of the protest leaders, truck driver Eric Drouet, last week for organising an unauthorised demonstration in Paris. Senator Bruno Retailleau welcomed the news of the prime minister's plans,external, writing on Twitter that ""hooded"" troublemakers who participated in protests ""must be severely punished"". HoweverLaurent Wauquiez, leader of the Republican party, tweeted that the move was not enough,externalbecause it would not take ""immediate effect"". He said his party had previously proposed a state of emergency, adding: ""Why not listen to us, at the risk of seeing the situation worsen Saturday after Saturday?"" Meanwhileleft-wing leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon said the planned measures would mean that ""demonstrators can no longer demonstrate"",external. In a Twitter post, he described Mr Philippe as the ""king of the Shadoks"", a reference to bird-like cartoon characters featured in a popular French TV series and known for their ruthlessness. On Saturday, rioters started fires on the prestigious Boulevard Saint Germain in Paris... ...whilea boxer chased and punched a riot policemanduring a running battle on a bridge... ...and the ministry of the government spokesman was rammed with a forklift truck... Other cities like Rouen and Caen also saw rioting and in all some 50,000 people took to the streets across the country (compared with the 280,000 who turned out in November). Investigations are under way after video also emerged of a police commander hitting people during a protest in the southern city of Toulon. Allow Twitter content?

"Yann Moix is well-known in France, where he also presents and directs A French writer is being criticised after saying he would be ""incapable"" of loving a woman aged 50 or above... despite being 50 himself. Yann Moix told Marie Claire magazine he found women of that age ""too old"". ""I prefer younger women's bodies, that's all. End of. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all,"" he said. The comments have sparked an angry backlash on social media. Marina FoÃ¯s, a French comedian, joked in a tweet that because she is about to turn 49 she only has ""one year and 14 days"" left to sleep with the author. One twitter user mocked him, saying women over 50 were likely ""breathing a sigh of relief"" at his comments. Another jokily asked: ""Can women under 50 be invisible to you as well please?"" Elsewhere, some women over 50 posted images showing off their body confidence in protest. Man told he can't change his age for Tinder Standing up to French street harassment Journalist Colombe Schneck posted a photograph of her bottom with the caption: ""Voila, the buttocks of a woman aged 52â¦what an imbecile you are, you don't know what you're missing..."" She said Instagram later removed her post. Others shared images of Hollywood celebrities close to the age of 50, such as Halle Berry and Jennifer Aniston, to disprove his comments. Anne Roumanoff, another French comic, criticised him on Europe 1 radio,external- pointing out romance was not ""just about the firmness of the buttocks"" but a connection between two people. ""I hope that one day he knows this happiness,"" she added. Moix is a presenter, director and an award-winning writer who is known for courting controversy with his comments. His Marie Claire interview also drew criticism for statements he made regarding his preference for dating Asian women - which he specified as ""Koreans, Chinese and Japanese"" in particular. ""It's perhaps sad and reductive for the women I go out with but the Asian type is sufficiently rich, large and infinite for me not to be ashamed,"" he told the magazine. Responding to the outrage,he told RTL radio, he was not ""responsible"" for his taste in women,external. ""I like who I like and I don't have to answer to the court of taste,"" he said, before joking he probably was not the best catch either. ""50-year-old women do not see me either!"" he told the station. ""They have something else to do than to get around a neurotic who writes and reads all day long. It's not easy to be with me.""

"The St John's school pupils had returned from skiing in the French resort of Alpe d'Huez A stowaway has been found in the luggage hold of a school coach returning from a ski trip to France. The man was discovered when pupils at St John's school in Marlborough, Wiltshire, returned from Alpe d'Huez at about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. He ""emerged from the luggage compartment"" when the driver unlocked it, the school said. However, one of the parents waiting to pick up pupils was a special constable and they arrested the man. A spokesman for the Home Office said Wiltshire Police had contacted Immigration Enforcement on Saturday after ""one man, who presented himself as Sudanese, was arrested for immigration offences"". The coach had been supplied by a British company and staff and students had passed through French and UK border control on foot before the vehicle boarded the ferry, a spokesperson for St John's said. ""One of the parents waiting to collect their children is a special constable and immediately arrested this person. ""The party leader called the police; two units arrived within minutes and took the person into custody. ""The situation remained calm and the individual was entirely compliant.

In Bavaria, a skier died when a tree collapsed near Bad TÃ¶lz. An avalanche killed a young woman in Bavaria's Teisenberg mountains. Two climbers died in the Italian Alps. A mountain rescue team found their bodies in the area of 2,800m (9,186ft) Mt Cristalliera, in the Alps north of Turin. Rescuers are searching for several missing people elsewhere in the Alps. The second-highest avalanche warning level is now in force across the Austrian Tyrol and in much of the Bavarian Alps. Skiers have been warned to avoid any off-piste skiing, and many mountain roads have been closed because of the avalanche risk.

"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, pictured at Bangkok airport, says she ""wants to be free"" away from Saudi Arabia An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family at the weekend has left Bangkok airport ""under the care"" of the UN refugee agency, the head of Thailand's immigration police says. Thai immigration officials had tried to return Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, to Kuwait, where her family is. But she refused to board a flight on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she feared her family would kill her as she had renounced Islam. ""My brothers and family and the Saudi embassy will be waiting for me in Kuwait,"" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told Reuters. ""My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things."" Her relatives have not commented on her claims. Arrested for disobeying your father Rights groups including Human Rights Watch have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun, who had travelled to Thailand for a connecting flight to Australia, where she hoped to seek asylum. The Thai authorities said her status would be assessed by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). The Australian government said it would closely monitor the case, calling Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's allegations ""deeply concerning"". On Monday evening local time, Thailand's chief of immigration police Surachate Hakparn confirmed that Ms Mohammed al-Qunun was ""allowed to stay"", and that she ""left the airport with the UNHCR"". He earlier said the country would ""take care of her as best we can"", adding: ""She is now under the sovereignty of Thailand; no-one and no embassy can force her to go anywhere. ""Thailand is a land of smiles. We will not send anyone to die."" Thailand's chief of immigration police Surachate Hakparn said Thailand would not deport the young woman to her possible death Mr Surachate said he would meet Saudi diplomats on Tuesday to clarify Thailand's decision. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun tweeted that her father had arrived, ""which worried and scared me a lot"", but said she felt safe ""under UNHCR protection with the agreement of Thailand authorities"".

Thailand is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and provides no legal protection to asylum seekers although there are more than 100,000 refugees in the country. An injunction filed by Thai lawyers in Bangkok criminal court to stop the deportation was dismissed earlier on Monday. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says that when she arrived in Bangkok on Saturday, her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat who met her coming off the flight. Thailand initially said she was being deported because she did not meet the requirements for a Thai visa. However, Ms Mohammed al-Qunun insisted she had a visa for Australia, and that she never wanted to stay in Thailand. Saudi Arabia said the Thai authorities had stopped the young woman for ""violating the law"". On Monday, police chief Mr Surachate said the Thais had been tipped off by Saudi officials, adding: ""The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they feared for her safety.""

She also gave a friend, Noura, access to her Twitter account, saying it was in case anything should happen to her.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared her family would kill her if she was sent back to Saudi Arabia. Freedom of religion is not legally protected in the kingdom, and people who convert to another religion from Islam risk being charged with apostasy - or abandoning their religious beliefs. The crime is legally punishable by death - although courts have not carried out a death sentence in recent years. The BBC World Service spoke to Noura, the friend who is tweeting from Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's account. She said the pair knew each other from an online group for Saudi feminists, and that she herself had ""escaped"" Saudi Arabia because she is ""an ex-Muslim"". Noura says Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is a student at a Saudi university, and that she believes her father works for the Saudi government. ""Her family kept her alone in the house for - I think for more than six months - because she cut her hair,"" she told the BBC.

"The NHS in England has publisheda 10-year plansetting out what it will be prioritising in the future. It comes after ministers announced the budget will be increased by Â£20bn a year by 2023. The 136-page plan will see money shifted from hospitals to mental health and the community. But what does it mean for patients? New NHS plan 'to save 500,000 lives' Will NHS long-term plan deliver the goods? The ambition:The idea is to create more effective treatments by tailoring them to the individual. One of the ways this can be done is by carrying out tests to identify mutations in genes and then using the most appropriate medicine. The NHS has already started doing this. The use of the breast cancer drug Herceptin for women with specific mutations in their cancer is an early example. Other forms of personalised medicine are being introduced all the time. Just last year, NHS England agreed to pay for a new cancer therapy - CAR-T - for leukaemia. It works by re-programming the patient's own immune system to target their cancer. As medicine develops, the idea is to have more of these sorts of treatments. The plan promises in the future all children with cancer and others with rare genetic conditions will have their whole genome mapped to use targeted treatments. The problem:Many of these treatments are still in their infancy. It is unclear just how effective they will be in the future. The ambition:Patients are being promised ""same-day emergency care"". Instead of being kept in overnight new services, known as ambulatory care and frailty units, are being set up alongside A&E units to assess patients and treat them. They are providing particularly useful for older patients and mean they do not need to be admitted on to wards where their chances of a long stay increase. This is because any stay in hospital can lead to increased frailty for older people, which in turn means they need care to be arranged when they are discharged. If that is not available they have to stay in hospital and, as a result, a vicious circle develops. NHS England want to see the number of ""same-day"" visits increase from a fifth to a third of admissions. The problem:A&E units are under the cosh - and these new services can find themselves swamped by patients as staff try to move them quickly through the system. There has been suggestions the four-hour target to be seen and treated in A&E could be relaxed to ease the pressure. The ambition:Currently only half of people diagnosed with cancer have the disease identified early - at stages one or two. The ambition has been set to increase that to three-quarters. In doing so, the government says 55,000 lives could be saved in the next 10 years if this is achieved. One of the key developments to achieve earlier diagnosis is the creation of rapid diagnostic centres where patients can get a range of different tests and consultations with cancer specialists done on the same day. One of the problems with cancer is that symptoms can present themselves in a number of different ways and it can be hard to pinpoint exactly what cancer a patient has. It can lead to constant referrals back and forth between GPs and hospitals. These diagnostic centres - being trialled in 10 places - could help solve that and ensure quicker diagnosis. The problem:Like all areas of the NHS, cancer services are struggling to recruit staff. There are particularly acute problems with chemotherapy nurses and cancer doctors. Meanwhile, the key waiting time target to get treatment within 62 days of referral has been missed for months. The ambition:A clear message from the plan is that the public have a responsibility for their own health. Evidence from the most recent Health Survey for England shows nearly nine in 10 people have an unhealthy lifestyle habit, such as excess drinking, poor diet or smoking. Half have at least two. The extra money being put into non-hospital services will mean a bigger focus on prevention, NHS England says. That could mean a greater focus on healthy lifestyle programmes for people with conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. The plan champions the National Diabetes Prevention Programme which offers support to people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes to improve their diet and physical activity habits. The problem:Councils already have a huge role in encouraging healthy lifestyles. The government gives them more than Â£3bn a year to run programmes such as smoking cessation and weight management. But it is continuing to cut these budgets - next year councils will get 4% less than they are this year once inflation is taken into account. The ambition:The plan talks about the importance of preventing admissions to hospital and ensuring patients can be discharged quickly when they are taken in. To help ensure this happens, the plan talks about greater collaboration between hospitals and their community counterparts. That means hospital doctors running clinics in the community and joint teams of NHS and social care staff working together to provide care for people when they are ready to be discharged from hospital. The NHS and councils have already begun to pool budgets to encourage joint working. The problem:While the health service has been given extra money, the social care system - overseen by councils - is still in the dark. A green paper on funding reform was promised in 2017, but it has still not been published. Councils and the companies that run care homes and home help say services have been put at risk in the meantime because of inadequate funding. The ambition:Just as digital technologies have revolutionised everything from the way we shop to how we watch television, the plan envisages an overhaul in the way we interact with the health service. It wants to see online GP booking and the management of prescriptions become routine. Video consultations with hospital consultants are also being seen as a crucial way of reducing unnecessary hospital appointments. Meanwhile, NHS England says remote monitoring of things such as blood pressure from the confines of a patient's home offers good potential. The problem:The NHS is still stuck in the dark ages when it comes to technologies. One need look no further than the widespread use of faxes and pagers to see that. Plenty of attempts have been made to change this, but with little success so far. The ambition:Mental health services are a crucial focus. Some Â£2.3bn of the Â£20bn is being set aside for improving care. This will ensure there are dedicated services for young people so they are not pushed into adult services as soon as they turn 18. The plan also promises better crisis care. This includes in the community, from the NHS 111 phone service  and in A&E - all hospitals should have a psychiatric liaison team in the future to ensure patients get the right support. Meanwhile, the NHS therapy service for people with milder mental health problems - the IAPT programme - is to be expanded to ensure more people receive psychological help. The problem:Mental health services have long been the ""Cinderella"" service in the NHS. There is simply an awful lot of ground to make up. Just tackling the problems in child mental health services alone could swallow up the entire extra money, some say. Who gets social care and who pays for it?

"Jerry and Carole Tack: ""Hubby and me fell out big time... I didn't speak to him for about a week"" When Jerry Tack received an email saying the TV licence needed paying, he didn't think twice about it. Nothing seemed suspicious about the website he clicked on, so he entered his bank details - and began a chain of events that would lose him Â£9,900. Jerry, from Hampshire, was amongthousands contacted in what police called a ""particularly nasty"" fraud. But the banks say they cannot reimburse customers who have mistakenly authorised payments to fraudsters. A TV Licensing spokeswoman said: ""TV Licensing will never email customers, unprompted, to ask for bank details, personal information or tell you that you may be entitled to a refund."" Carole Tack, Jerry's wife, said that two days after filling in the fraudulent TV licence form online, he received a call purporting to be from his building society, Nationwide. In reality, it was a scammer who had harvested the 65-year-old's details from the fake form. The caller asked him about two fabricated transactions, and when he said he had not made them, they advised him to move his money into a ""safe account"". Jerry then received a text message with a code from the building society, most likely triggered by the scammers requesting it under a system designed for people who have forgotten their log-in details. Believing it had been sent by the person he was speaking to, he overlooked warnings not to share the code and gave it to the caller as confirmation. That inadvertently allowed the scammers to access his account. Thousands complain about TV licence scam Elderly 'under siege' from scammers They emptied two savings accounts of Â£4,000 each and persuaded Jerry to use a card reader to approve the transfer of the funds, as well as Â£1,900 from his current account, telling him it would protect the money from fraudsters. Half an hour later he had second thoughts and contacted Nationwide, to be told that he had been the victim of an ""authorised push payment"" (APP) scam. ""We were left penniless until the end of November,"" said Carole, 61. The loss of their savings put ""an awful lot of strain on our relationship"". ""Hubby and me fell out big time over it. I didn't speak to him for about a week,"" she said. ""Christmas for us was a complete wash-out. I didn't even put any decorations up - we didn't feel like it."" But while she acknowledged her husband had made a mistake, she felt financial institutions could do more to support victims of frauds such as this. Laura Hodson, 27, received a similar email saying payment details for her TV licence needed to be updated. ""The site looked very realistic and I think because it was due for renewal I didn't think it was unusual. The fines are so big that to do nothing panicked me more,"" she said. Laura Hodson and her partner Scott: Smiling now but they lost Â£2,500 to fraudsters More than 24 hours later she received a ""gut-wrenching"" call from her bank, RBS, to say that more than Â£2,500 had been taken. The payments were traced to a Barclays account and after about a month of wrangling Laura was told that only Â£2.21 could be recovered. ""We came across as a nuisance and that the scam was our entire fault,"" Laura said. Laura, a nurse from Dumfries, lost the money two days after payday at the end of October, leaving her and her partner Scott struggling to make ends meet and relying on the financial support of family. ""That was all taken away by a single email,"" she said. Banks say that the funds in these cases are frequently transferred to accounts owned by students being used by the scammers as ""money mules"". The cash is often impossible to recover because it is transferred between several accounts operated by mules in quick succession to avoid detection, before being withdrawn. UK Finance, a banking industry group, said it was introducing a new voluntary code for members setting out ""clear requirements for consumer protection and the principles for reimbursement"". I was a teenage 'money mule' But Nationwide said that Jerry Tack's funds could not be reimbursed because he had authorised the payments and ignored warnings not to share security information. A spokesman said: ""We're very sorry that our member has been a victim of this cruel scam. ""Unfortunately, despite warnings generated by our systems, the member gave away details to the fraudster and originated all of the transactions into the third-party account."" RBS has been contacted for comment. Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime, said all reports of scams such as the TV licence one are sent to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, which assesses if there is enough information for an investigation. Reports can also lead to telephone lines and websites used by fraudsters being shut down, or bank accounts being closed, the centre said. A spokeswoman said: ""This disruption activity prevents people being defrauded in the future and therefore making a report can help stop others from becoming victims themselves.""

"This video can not be played Mr Spacey remained silent during his court appearance Actor Kevin Spacey has appeared in court to face a charge of indecent assault and battery stemming from an allegation of groping in 2016. A not-guilty plea was entered on the two-time Oscar winner's behalf by his lawyers during the hearing in the US state of Massachusetts. He is accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old male after plying him with alcohol at a bar in Nantucket in 2016. Assault claims against him have also surfaced in London and Los Angeles. Mr Spacey, 59, was mobbed by media as he arrived at the packed courtroom on the normally sleepy resort island of Nantucket on Monday after arriving by private jet. The actor nodded when Judge Thomas Barrett told him he was not allowed to contact the alleged victim. A lawyer for Spacey - whose legal name is Kevin S Fowler - had earlier asked the judge to allow the hearing to happen without the defendant present, but that request was refused. He was released without having to pay bail after a 10-minute hearing. Kevin Spacey charged with sexual assault How the Kevin Spacey story unfolded What has #MeToo actually changed? The judge scheduled the next court date for 4 March. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison. The alleged incident occurred at The Club Car restaurant in Nantucket. Prosecutors announced on 24 December that Mr Spacey would be charged with indecent assault and battery stemming from an incident at the Club Car restaurant in Nantucket. The alleged victim is the son of former Boston local television news presenter Heather Unruh, who spoke publicly about the case last year. She accused Mr Spacey of buying her then 18-year-old son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 - and then groping him. This video can not be played Heather Unruh speaks last year about the allegation The man, who is also suing Mr Spacey in civil court, will not be present during the criminal trial. According to prosecutors, the teenager told police that the actor had groped him as they stood together at a piano. He told police that he had video of the incident, and had sent a clip via the Snapchat app to his girlfriend. Mr Spacey's legal team say the video does not prove his guilt. During Monday's hearing, his lawyer Alan Jackson successfully argued the alleged victim must not delete material from his phone. Reporters and onlookers thronged the courthouse as Spacey arrived Nick Bryant, BBC News, Nantucket This was a journey Kevin Spacey didn't want to make, and having touched down on this jet set island in a private plane, he waited on the tarmac until the final moment before making the short drive to his first appearance in court. His legal team argued he shouldn't have to appear in person, because of the negative publicity that's already surrounded this case.  But the actor who's spent so much of his working life in front of the cameras, found it impossible today to avoid them. He entered by a side entrance, outfoxing some of the camera operators and photographers who had staked out positions over the weekend, but by no means all of them. A camera was also allowed into the courtroom to provide a live stream of the proceedings and to record the charge levelled against him - a charge he denies. During this short hearing, the actor briefly shared a joke with his lawyer but did not address the court. Dressed in a grey suit with polka-dot tie and patterned shirt, he spent most of the time peering benignly ahead at the judge, displaying no outward emotion. The small courtroom was packed with journalists and local onlookers - including some who had taken the ferry from the mainland to watch the proceedings. Many seemed rather disappointed that all they got to see was deliberations between the legal teams and the judge rather than hearing from the more central figure. But this now is a legal process, rather than courtroom theatre. The actor's career offers dried up after he was accused by actor Anthony Rapp in 2017 of making a sexual advance on him in 1986 when Mr Rapp was 14 years old. Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the event, but publicly apologised before issuing an ""absolute"" denial of all other allegations. In September last year,the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office saidMr Spacey would not be prosecuted over an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. It said it fell outside of California's statute of limitations. Mr Spacey posted a cryptic video in the style of his House of Cards character in December UK police are also investigating several allegations that centre around Mr Spacey's time serving as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The controversy has led to the actor being axed from a number of roles, including Netflix series House of Cards and the 2017 film All the Money in the World, which was re-shot without him. On Christmas Eve, Mr Spacey posted a video contesting the allegations against him. In the clip titled ""Let Me Be Frank"", Mr Spacey appeared as his character Frank Underwood from House of Cards, and said: ""I'm certainly not going to pay the price for the thing I didn't do.""

"This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry MP Anna Soubry has criticised police for not intervening after she was verbally abused outside Parliament. The Conservative ex-minister was accused ""of being a Nazi"", while being interviewed on the BBC News channel. She called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. The police said they were assessing if any crimes had been committed while Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was worried about a ""pattern"" of women MPs and journalists being targeted. Raising the issue in the House of Commons, Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She accused far-right groups of re-playing Monday's clip and others like it on social media sites to ""raise revenue for their trolling activities"". Ms Soubry, the pro-European MP for Broxtowe who supports another Brexit referendum, was subjected to verbal abuse while being interviewed by the BBC's Simon McCoy. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Protesters standing just a few yards from the entrance to Parliament accused her of being a liar and then chanted: ""Anna Soubry is a Nazi."" She was later shouted at and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. Reacting during the live interview, she told McCoy she ""objected to being called a Nazi"", adding that such language was ""astonishing  - and this is what has happened to our country"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" She said she would not be silenced nor intimidated but it was wrong that MPs and others doing their job in such a public space should ""have to accept this as part of the democratic process"". After the incident, she told BBC News the police needed to ""do their job"" and would contact them about the matter. The Metropolitan Police said they were investigating reports of a public order offence but no arrests had been made. The MP has already been in touch with the parliamentary authorities responsible for security. A number of MPs raised the matter with Mr Bercow at the end of a statement on the government's Brexit policy. Labour's Stephen Doughty called for ""proper action"" to be taken by the Metropolitan Police against those responsible for what he said were ""potentially unlawful actions"". And Conservative MP Nick Boles urged Mr Bercow to ensure everything possible was done to not only protect the right to freedom of speech but the right of MPs to move freely in and around Parliament in ""total safety"". Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. While the Met had responsibility for security outside the parliamentary estate, he said, he was keeping a ""close eye"" on the issue amid concerns that women, in particular, were being targeted. ""I share 100% the concerns expressed and it's necessary to state very publicly the difference between peaceful protest on one hand and the aggressive, intimidatory and threatening protest on the other."" Ms Creagh said there was a ""strong streak of misogyny"" in the wave of Brexit-related abuse directed against MPs. ""We in this place remember our friend Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right neo-Nazi,"" she said. ""We remember that people have gone to prison for plotting to murder another Labour MP and many people have been jailed for the abuse of other colleagues."" No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". A Downing Street spokesman said there were laws dealing with public order offences and cases of harassment and threatening behaviour.

"LG's screen folds out when in use and then retracts LG has revealed a consumer version of its roll-up TV set at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. The Signature OLED TV R is built on a concept unveiled last year, in which the screen retracts into a base when not in use so it is less obtrusive. LG plans to sell the device in the US before the end of 2019, but has yet to reveal the month or price. Experts say the technology is unlikely to become a mass-market proposition for many years to come. ""It's a 4K set rather than 8K, so you could argue there's a compromise there - but otherwise this is a very high-end design that is going to be very costly,"" commented Jack Wetherill from the consultancy Futuresource. The premium TV features a soundbar built into its base so it can be used to play music when the display is hidden The South Korean firm also showed off another TV that will compete with the fold-out model for flagship status: a 88in (224cm) model that was described as being the biggest OLED set to date. Much of the presentation about it centred on its use of machine learning to finesse its picture quality. More from CES 2019: Samsung's new shape-shifting TVs revealed The backseat VR that moves with the car CES 2019: Preparing for take-off That represented a tacit acknowledgement that there is little native 8K content available as yet, so users will be reliant on upgraded 4K and high definition imagery. LG says its new 8K television will be the biggest OLED TV on the market In addition, the firm said that its wider range of new smart TVs would includeaccess to Amazon Alexa as well as Google's Assistant,external, which was added last year. Relatively few devices have worked with both the two rival virtual assistants to date. Speaker-maker Sonos has notably taken longer than expected to deliver on its promise of combining the two into a single device. In LG's case, the two platforms will be accessed via its own ThinQ software rather than directly. Its press conference showed a user commanding them via a TV remote control, suggesting that a different button press determined which of the two assistants was invoked. Samsung's new TVs will also offer access to both Amazon and Google's platforms too, although it will prioritise its own smart assistant Bixby. ""I see it as an acceptance that there's a very large group of users already using Google and Amazon's AIs,"" remarked Paul Gagnon from the consultancy IHS Markit. Alexa Skills and Google Assistant Actions can both be accessed via LG's ThinQ software ""It would be pretty hard for a company to stand in the way of that progress and not cut out potential buyers."" LG also said its TVs would be among the first to natively support Apple's AirPlay technology, allowing them to stream footage and audio from iPhones and iPads as well as be controlled by Siri. LG dedicated much of the rest of its press conference to explaining how its household appliances could be made to anticipate their owners' wishes by allowing the company to monitor people's wider behaviour. One example involved its ThinQ software offering to deploy a robot vacuum because it had detected its owner picking up another cleaning device. Another involved the dishwasher ordering itself new detergent because it had run out. LG says its appliances will be able to anticipate owners' needs, if they opt in to having their habits analysed In general, things ran much more smoothly than last year when the firm's US marketing chief David VanderWaal tried to demo a robot called Cloi, which repeatedly ignored his commands. However, right at the end of the latest event the firm failed to mute his microphone, so that the last words heard were Mr VanderWaal saying: ""That's a wrap - one glitch on the video.""

"Gary Shapiro runs the Consumer Technology Association, which organises the CES trade show The ongoing US government shutdown is an embarrassment to the countryâs technology industry, a leading figure has said. Several government officials had to pull out of attending the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), a trade event which begins this week, because of the current political stalemate. ""I don't imagine a lot of people who are making these decisions in Washington are even aware of the ramifications,â said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which produces the show. Mr Shapiro said he hoped stock market turbulence would put pressure on the US and China to reach an agreement on trade tariffs soon. However, he added: ""I'm not totally convinced that President Trump wants an agreement with the Chinese.â More from CES 2019: CES 2019: Preparing for take-off First look at 2019's hottest new tech The White House has not yet responded to a request for comment. The CTA advocates for more than 2,000 technology firms, and counts Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Sony and many others among its membership. CES is the largest trade show of its kind in the world. Scheduled to attend were a number of high ranking government figures, including Ajit Pai, the head of the US telecoms regulator. At least 10 officials had to withdraw, citing the government shutdown which has been in place since 22 December.

Last week, Apple said the struggling Chinese economy meant it had earned significantly less than predicted in the final three months of 2018. The news sent Appleâs stock plummeting - so too other tech firms deemed to be vulnerable. Apple's China warning 'deflects deeper problems' for firm Mr Shapiro said part of the problem may be changing attitudes towards American products. âThere's a lot of social media in China which is not embracing the United States, its companies and its products,â he said. Despite the tensions, Mr Shapiro said there was no discernible difference between the number of Chinese companies deciding to exhibit at CES. The country represents around 40% of the firms at the show.

"This video can not be played WATCH: A hi-tech sun cream sprayer that won't leave you with sticky hands will be at CES The CES trade show is powering up again in Vegas. Most of the biggest names in tech and stacks of start-ups you've never heard of will compete for attention over the next week. Some products may launch new categories,external- past events presented a first look at  video cassette recorders (VCRs), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs and Android tablets. But many more will flop or never even make it to market. More than 4,500 exhibitors are attending CES and more will take part in fringe events or host private demos in hotel suites We've scoured the internet for hints about what will be on show... One of the biggest developments at the last few CES expos has been Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant's rival efforts to extend their reach in the home and beyond. Last year things peaked with an Alexa-activated toilet flush, but over the past 12 months  manufacturers have developed voice-controlled ""skills"" or ""actions"" for more products, and in some cases embedded one of the virtual assistants outright. The Auri Lamp has Alexa built in, so you can use it to begin a meditation routine or to make fart sounds For 2019, we're being promised tags that will let smart speakers tell you where your pet or TV remote is hiding, as well as Alexa/Google Assistant-controlled pianos, heart rate monitors, lawnmowers, motorcycle helmets and meditation lamps. That's not to say others aren't trying to muscle in. Samsung is rumoured to be revealing a fresh Galaxy Home speaker powered by its smart assistant Bixby, and German start-up Autolabs will demo Chris - a virtual helper designed for use in cars. The makers of Chris say it will only run apps that are safe to use while driving Several firms will also urge developers to get behind ""open source"" alternatives, in which neither of the two tech giants act as gatekeeper to the apps on offer. For example, Volareo will show progress on a crowdfunded smart speaker that lets you buy Bitcoin and stream any video to your TV. Volareo is being pitched as a smart speaker for ""independent thinkers"" Others will be pitching ways to drive the category forward. So, for example, Elliptic Labs will demo a radar-like system that lets smart speakers detect their owners' approach. It suggests the tech could be used to trigger daily reminders or to make the speakers adjust their volume according to how close the person is. Taking things one step further, Smart IoT Labs has Miranda - a kind of smart assistant for smart assistants that issues commands on your behalf to Alexa or Google based on your past behaviour, which sounds a bit bonkers. Mui's creator says it follows ""distraction-free"" design principles by only lighting up when in use And for consumers still wary about talking to their tech, Mui Lab has a ""calmer"" alternative. At first sight its product looks like a plank of wood, but when touched it lights up to provide a way to control Google's Assistant with swipes and presses rather than barked commands. Nespresso has a lot to answer for. The success of its pod-based coffee machines has inspired several start-ups to take the capsule-based concept and extend it to other kitchen gadgets. Yomee takes six hours to turn milk and a fruit flavour pod into yoghurt Lecker Labs has Yomee - to which you add milk and the pod of your choosing to create yoghurt. Mitte has a machine that passes water through a choice of cartridges to add rock minerals to it and avoid the need to buy bottles of the stuff. Mitte's mineral cartridges alter the water's pH value and taste in different ways And even LG is getting in on the act with HomeBrew, a product that makes beer from single-use capsules containing malt, yeast, and hop oil. It's presumably targeted at drinkers who think ""craft brewing"" extends to a button push. Meanwhile, Capsulier is back at CES with a production version of its DIY coffee and tea pods-maker, after recently starting shipments to its Kickstarter backers. Capsulier says its Nespresso-compatible pods cost a fraction of what shop-bought equivalents cost to make Switching tack, other intriguing foodie developments include gadgets that claim to help you improve your diet by analysing your breath. Lumen says it will have a working prototype of its ""hack your metabolism"" device, which determines the proportion of carbs and fats being burnt for energy from the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air you exhale. Lumen recommends what to eat and when based on its analysis of your breath It then makes food recommendations based on the result. By contrast, FoodMarble's Aire measures the hydrogen in your breath and combines this with a log of what you have eaten, to warn you of foods you should avoid and possible substitutions. Aire is designed to discover which foods are being passed to the large intestine without being fully digested There's always fancy new fridges at the show, but it's doubtful they have yet advanced to the point they can tell you when you need to eat each item by - the holy grail of kitchen tech. But Ovie has an interim solution. Ovie tags show you what foods are about to go off to encourage you to consume them before it's too late It will show off SmartTags that you're supposed to attach to each foodstuff and identify to Alexa as you do so. Their colour then changes as the food goes off, while an app suggests recipes to make from near-expired items. This video can not be played WATCH: LG showed off a concept rollable TV at CES 2018 TVs have been at the heart of CESever since it started 52 years ago. This year, the hot rumour is thatLG will reveal a commercial version,externalof a roll-up concept it previously demoed, meaning families can have a giant screen without sacrificing one of their walls. Samsung may also have a rival setif a patent, sneaked out on Christmas Day,,externalis anything to go by. Its design appears to open up horizontally rather than vertically. Samsung's patent describes how a flexible screen could be rolled up to pull in either of its two sides Failing that, it's likely to have more to say on its modular MicroLED tech, in which lots of small panels are clipped together to form a screen. Last year it showed off a 146in (371cm) 4K display, but it needs to create smaller versions for the innovation to be practical in the living room. Expect lots of talk about 8K too, with sets featuring four times as many pixels as today's 4K standard. Japan's recent switch-on ofthe world's first ""super high-definition"" channelmeans there's now an audience for the feature, even if content elsewhere is in short supply. Although stores already stock 8K models, existing units lack HDMI 2.1 ports. The new cable standard is required to provide enough bandwidth to send a 60 frames-per-second 8K signal over a single connection, as well as having other benefits. LG has already confirmed it will debut the technology,externaland other brands are likely to do likewise. 8K TVs allow you to get up close and still not be able to make out their individual pixels The other development to watch out for is TVs featuring far-field microphones - the tech found in smart speakers that lets them be commanded from across a room. This could free owners from having to use a remote control. Toshiba announced in August that most of its 2019 TVs for Europe would listen out for voice commands Toshiba has already announced one such model for Europe featuring Alexa. A wider roll-out could give Amazon and Google's smart assistants another gateway into people's homes. Robot-makers at CES typically promise much, but their inventions often struggle to justify their existence. Worse -if you remember Cloi last year- they can have a tendency to misbehave. But the lead developer of one of the category's rare success stories - Softbank's Pepper - is at CES this year with a droid that he believes has the capacity to ""touch hearts"". Lovot robots have sensors across their bodies so they can detect where the owners are touching them Kaname Hayashi will be demoing Lovot, a chick-like bot with large expressive eyes, flapping arms, wheels, and a wardrobe of clothes to cover its soft shell. A camera protrudes from its head, allowing it to map rooms and act as a child monitor or home surveillance device. But Mr Hayashi has said the purpose of Lovot is not to be helpful or entertaining, but rather to engender joy, love and other positive emotions that might help owners reach their true potential. He's not the only one suggesting the time has come to welcome companion bots into our homes. Kiki and Liku are at earlier stages of development than Lovot There's Kiki, a ""pet robot"" designed by two former Google engineers, whose personality evolves according to how its owners treat it. And Liku, a humanoid bot that promises to express ""desires and emotions"" driven by what's going on in its surroundings. Others, however, remain focused on addressing more practical problems. Several robots are designed for a specific use Coral will show off what it says is the first robot vacuum to feature a detachable handheld unit. Occo has a new version of its photo-taking model that interacts with guests at events before getting them to pose for automated snaps. And Cowarobot follows up an earlier self-driving suitcase with ShopPal - a unit designed for use in stores to follow customers about, drawing their attention to promotions and offering to recharge their mobile devices. Youcan Robot's BW Space is one of several drones being promoted to underwater video-makers The US's opioid crisis, in which hundreds of people are dying every week after becoming addicted to pain medication, has driven several medical tech firms into action. Several new products are based on neuromodulation therapy, which involves stimulating the spinal cord or peripheral nerves to try to interrupt pain signals before they reach the brain. The technique has been around since the 1980s, but traditionally required surgery for an implant. Lenus Freedom claims its device can help mitigate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal Some start-ups, however, are attempting to offer non-surgical solutions. They include Lenus Freedom,which says its electrical nerve field stimulator,externalcan be fitted by a physician in five minutes. Meanwhile, PainCareLabs has aprototype called DuoTherm,externalthat it says alters nerve activity linked to back pain by applying heat and vibration pressure rather than electric pulses. But experts have doubts. ""The challenge is far greater than these start-ups portray,"" Prof Sam Eldabe of the British Pain Society told the BBC. ""[One issue] is that tolerance develops to spinal cord stimulation in around 20% of subjects, and we know the same occurs for peripheral nerve stimulation."" PainCareLabs says its device offers a drug-free treatment to back pain For those who still need to take pills or regular injections, there's a barrage of new ""smart"" medication boxes in which to keep them. Pillo appears to be the most elaborate example. The dispenser features an animated smart companion that uses facial recognition to ensure the right person gets the right dose at the right time. Pillo can answer questions about nutrition and run video calls It's worth being a bit sceptical about some of the supposed breakthroughs, though. Lexilight's website, for example, claims the rapidly-flashing lamp it will display can help dyslexic people ""read as fast as everyone else"". It's based on a theory that the condition is caused by an unusual arrangement of light-receptor cells in the eyes of those with the disorder. But the scientists who proposed the idea saidmore tests were needed when they announced their theory last year,external, and several expertsin the field were dismissive of it,external. Is a 10-second clean with the Y-Brush really as effective as two minutes with an electric toothbrush? Likewise, bold claims are being made of some of the beauty tech that will go on show. Y-Brush, for instance, says its nylon-bristled mouthpiece can give teeth a ""perfect"" clean in 10 seconds. The GilletteLabs Heated Razor features four heat sensors and a bar that goes up to 50C (122F) And Gillette claims a new razor with a battery-powered heating bar will increase glide and reduce tug to deliver the ""comfort of a hot towel shave"". This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with the first bendy phone At one point it looked like the big story of CES 2019 would be flexible phones. China's Royole still intends to show off its smartphone-tablet hybrid the FlexPai, having demoed a pre-production unit in October. But famed leaker Evan Blass has backtracked from claims that LG will unveil a version of its own. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC understands Huawei is also biding its time. And that means Samsung - which has already given the world abrief glimpse of its foldable Galaxy X- is likely to wait until February's Mobile World Congress to properly show off the device. Instead, your best bet of seeing a big-name brand with new folding tech may be Intel and its Copper Harbor dual-screened Windows PC. Intel's Copper Harbor prototype can be used in a variety of modes The chip-maker showed off a prototype in Singapore three months ago, but has yet to make a big fuss about the concept. Its two touchscreen panels can work together as a single big display, or let one act as a keyboard or scribble pad. For those looking to give their existing laptop more screen real estate, Mobile Pixels may have the solution. Having two screens on view should help workers boost productivity but will eat into battery life Its Duo accessory attaches a second display to the back of the main screen that can either be slid out to extend the view or be faced outwards to show off what the user is up to. Two start-ups from different sides of the world appear to have simultaneously invented another unusual peripheral. France's Nemeio and Australia's Sonder Design have created keyboards with small e-ink displays beneath each key. In addition to icons, the keyboards can also display non-Latin letters, which could make them a practical choice for typing in Chinese or Arabic Users can switch from a Qwerty letter-layout to other designs, and also replace the characters with icons of their choosing to suit specialist applications or games. December's shutdown of Gatwick Airport is likely to be referenced by US Secretary of Transport Elaine Chao,who is giving a keynote speech,externalthat will address the promise and risks of consumer drones. But on the show floor, the biggest player in the business - DJI - has a positive story of its own to sell with a new model designed for the emergency services. DJI's latest drone uses tech made by thermal camera-maker Flir It can stream split-screen video feeds of a scene in both heat vision and the normal visible spectrum, which could be useful in search-and-rescue missions. Astral AR is proposing something even more ambitious: an aircraft to stop school shootings. Astral AR is testing its software on an Intel-made drone before deciding whether to switch to a custom design It claims drones could be used to obstruct an attacker and block their gunfire. An armour covering would supposedly make the machine difficult to destroy. At present the team is testing its ability to track a shooter's gaze and pose by using a commercial drone, but in time it hopes to deploy a smaller custom-designed solution. Sunflower Labs will propose what's perhaps a more realistic drone-based security system. It's pairing an aircraft called the Bee with motion-detecting lamps to offer a hi-tech way to deter intruders from homes and other properties. Sunflower Labs believes burglars would find drones harder to evade than standard security camera systems Drones will also be taking to the deep, with several firms showing off models designed for use in the sea. The idea is to provide a way to livestream scuba dives as well as to carry out inspections of boat hulls, underwater piping and other submerged objects. Youcan Robot's BW Space is one of several drones being promoted to underwater video-makers Expect to hear lots of talk about self-drive technologies, futuristic infotainment systems and 5G-based vehicle-to-vehicle data-swapping. But with Detroit's giant Auto Show overlapping with CES's final day, many car-makers are keeping back their big news. Mercedes intends to show off its one of its concept cars as well as the more practical 2020 CLA-Class saloon Even so, Mercedes appears ready to unveil a second-generation version of its CLA-Class fastback saloon at the Vegas event, and Nissan is rumoured to debut the e-Plus version of its Leaf electric car, offering extended battery life. Potentially more revolutionary, there will be at least two ""flying cars"" at the show. Despite resembling a helicopter, Pal-V Liberty is a gyroplane and does not take off vertically The Pal-V Liberty is a petrol-powered three-wheeler with fold-out rotary blades on its roof and a propeller at its rear, whose makers say it is self-stabilising in the air. It's based on a 20-year-old concept, but its maker claims it will be ready to deliver the first working units in 2020. NFT is at an earlier stage of development. The firm - which is headquartered near Google - promises an electric vehicle that will take off and land vertically but fly like a plane. It intends to reveal what it will look like at the expo. France's Pragma Industries says its hydrogen fuel cell bike is the first of its kind Other exotic vehicles at the show with a lot to prove include Pragma Industries' Alpha bicycle, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. It says the vehicle will have double the range of li-ion battery-based equivalents and none of the hassle of waiting hours for a recharge. Emerge will be showing off a scooter with a touchscreen steering wheel, which it says will discourage drivers from using their smartphones. JackRabbit's bicycle can go 13 miles (21km) on a single charge And JackRabbit has a modern-day take on the Penny Farthing bicycle - with one wheel bigger than the other and an electric motor. It looks a bit awkward to ride but is supposedly nimble in use. And there's still so much more. For example, several start-ups are attempting to ride the hype-wave associated with blockchain and crypto-currencies. They include a coin-mining TV and a sports score business that rewards accurate predictions with  crypto-currency as a means to work around online gambling laws. But the stand-out example may be Pigzbe - a handheld digital wallet targeted at six-year-olds that is supposed to replace pocket money. Pigzbe is designed to teach children about the wisdom of investing in crypto-currencies Supposedly one of the benefits over just using an online bank account is that it doesn't involve decimals, with which some youngsters struggle. But since it runs on a new digital currency, Wollo, you may end up having to explainwhy their savings have shrunk in value.,external Scribit uses a new type of erasable ink to draw on walls and glass, but also works with third-party pens There's a multitude of other new gizmos and apps on show - and here's a final selection that caught our eye. Scribit is a wall-drawing gadget that turns images sourced from the web into line art. When users tire of them, it uses a heating element to make the ink vanish. LiBest's product contains a battery that wraps around the wrist LiBest has put a flexible battery in a wristband that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch on the go and give it more than a day's battery life.

"Police will be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones, the government has announced. The area around airports where drones are banned from flying will also be extended, and from 30 November operators of drones between 250g and 20kg will need to be registered. Labour said action on drones should have been taken years ago. Last month flights from Gatwick were suspended for more than 36 hours afterdrones were reported over the airfield. The plans follow aconsultation,externalinto the use of drones which began in July. The government said it would also expand technology to detect and repel drones from sites like airports and prisons, to prevent any repeat of events like those at Gatwick airport in December. How can a drone cause so much chaos? What punishment could a drone operator face? New legislation will give police additional powers to land drones and require users to produce the appropriate documentation. They will also be able to search premises and seize drones - including the electronic data stored within the device - where a serious offence has been committed and a warrant is secured. For minor drone offences, police will be able to issue fixed-penalty notices, with fines of up to Â£100 for offences such as failing to comply with an officer when instructed to land a drone or not showing the registration required to operate a drone. Registered drone users will also need to take an online competency test. By Theo Leggett, business correspondent Sometimes it's important to be seen to be doing something. That may well be the case with the government's plans to combat drone misuse. It had been planning action for some time - and had already held a major consultation on its proposals. Then came the dramas at Gatwick before Christmas. So would the new measures have made any difference in that situation? Probably not. Flying a drone close to an airport was already illegal, under legislation passed last year. The problem there was actually finding those responsible. But drone misuse is now a hot topic, so announcing these measures now, and widening the exclusion zone around airports, may help draw off some of the political flak. Meanwhile the Home Office will ""begin to test and evaluate the safe use of a range of counter-drone technology in the UK"". That may well be the wisest way forward. But critics are likely to ask why such testing wasn't already under way. After all, the threat was a known one, and it seems the Army at least had access to that kind of technology. Speaking in the Commons, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the disruption caused at Gatwick was ""deliberate, irresponsible and calculated, as well as illegal"" and any restriction zone around the airport would not have prevented an incident of this type. He said the problems at Gatwick were solved by ""smart and innovative use of new technology"", but declined to reveal what this was for ""security reasons"". He added that the Ministry of Defence remained ""on standby"" to deal with any further problems caused by drones at airports. Last year the government made it illegal to fly a drone above 400ft (120m) orwithin 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. The exclusion zone will now be extended to the current Air Traffic Zone around airports, which is approximately a 5km (3.1 miles) radius, with additional extensions from runway ends. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of up to five years. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the extension of exclusion zones around airports was likely to be welcomed by the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), which has lobbied for tougher rules. The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years. In 2013 there were zero incidents, compared with more than 100 last year. There has also been anincrease in the use of drones to smuggle drugs, mobile phones and other contraband into prisons. Labour's shadow transport minister Andy McDonald said while the measures were welcome, they should have been introduced sooner. ""Labour has repeatedly warned Department for Transport ministers over the last several years that they needed to take action on drones yet nowhere near enough has been done,"" he said. He added that the failure to bring forward detailed plans on drones had ""disastrous consequences"" and it was ""astonishing"" the government had no procedures in place to deal with events like those at Gatwick airport.

"On the face of it, it seems like very, very little has changed about the prime minister's conundrum. One source joked to me that I could just re-open my notebook from the last day before the Christmas break and carry on as if the past fortnight hadn't happened. The prime minister is still pushing for extra promises from the EU about making the controversial Irish backstop temporary and a bigger role for Parliament and potentially for the Northern Ireland Assembly (which, remember, hasn't sat for a very long time now). But there is precious little sign of anything that might be described as hefty enough to convince scores of MPs to change their minds and swing in behind her deal. It is likely that something will emerge, a form of words, a stronger commitment to the hoped for start date for the long-term trade deal perhaps. But the EU is in no mood for something big that could reopen the withdrawal agreement. And MPs are very far away from changing their minds. Theresa May's opponents have not come back to work ready to make nice and back the deal after all. And it's a simple equation. More MPs are poised to vote against Mrs May's deal next week than the number committed to backing it. And there is no sign of any further compromise from the EU that's significant enough to shift them - yet. But something has changed since the last time the prime minister called the vote, before dramatically calling it off, and it's nothing to do with the assurances she may or may not get from Brussels. In the wake of that change of heart, dozens of backbenchers tried to push her out of office with a no-confidence vote. She survived it but more than 100 of her own side voted against her - a kick to her authority then but might it help her now? Remember, under the rules of a Tory leadership contest, a confidence vote can't be held for another year if the leader manages to stay on. That's why one cabinet minister told me this means ""everything has changed"" - if the vote is lost next week, Tory MPs at least can't force another challenge, so in theory she is safe from her own party. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Brexit: A really simple guide Last time round, if the prime minister had ploughed ahead with the vote, she faced the very real prospect of a heavy defeat that would have triggered a leadership contest she could have lost. The argument goes, therefore, that now she has the insurance policy of being safe from that kind of challenge, Parliament could be asked to ""vote, vote and then vote again"", and eventually a version of her deal will pass. That theory makes other assumptions, of course - that the prime minister could survive a vote of confidence if the Labour Party was to force one if she loses the vote next week, and, more to the point, that the deal would look any more tempting on repeated attempts to ram it through. But while we have been here before, not so long ago, the circumstances are not exactly the same.

"Theresa May is cautiously hopeful that her telephone diplomacy with EU leaders over the Christmas break could pay off over the next week. After calls with Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister believes there is a growing mood in the EU to help the UK avoid a no-deal Brexit scenario. Nothing is guaranteed, but there is an expectation in Whitehall that if the EU decides to help out, it would make helpful noises on the Northern Ireland backstop on the eve of the parliamentary vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal. The vote is due to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday next week. The offer, if it comes, would be in writing. ""The point is to have something with genuine meaning,"" one Whitehall source says. As things stand, the prime minister is heading for a serious parliamentary defeat because she is confronted by two apparently immovable objects. They are: no appetite in the EU to make substantive changes to the Brexit deal, and opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party to parts of the deal regarding Northern Ireland. But Whitehall is picking up signs of movement in the EU which would, in an ideal world for No 10, persuade the DUP to support the prime minister. Downing St believes the DUP's influence goes way beyond its ten MPs. Officials regard the Unionists as ""dominos"" - get them on board and Brexiteer Tories will start to return to the fold, potentially winning over Labour MPs minded to support the prime minister if she is within shouting distance of victory. The mood is slightly better in Downing St because the prime minister has been left with the clear impression from EU leaders that they are determined to avoid no-deal. One Whitehall source said: ""There is a genuine sense they want to avoid no-deal. How they will help us is the big unanswered question."" The hope is that next Monday or Tuesday - depending on the date of the parliamentary vote - the EU would issue a firm signal that the Northern Ireland backstop would not last indefinitely. Under the backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Northern Ireland would be closely bound into the EU if the UK and the EU fail to agree a comprehensive new relationship by the end of the transition in December 2020. The backstop is described as a temporary arrangement, but the EU is insisting it would last unless and until a replacement trade deal is agreed. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Brexit 'in danger' unless MPs back deal - PM Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Over the holiday period the prime minister's chief EU negotiator Olly Robbins revived his idea of the UK and the EU setting a firm start date for the UK's future trade relationship with the EU, with December 2021 the strong preference. The UK believes the EU would find this idea easier to agree to than a firm end date to the backstop. If the EU were to make a move then two possible scenarios could play out on the eve of the parliamentary vote: In the event of a strong commitment from the EU, the government could table an amendment to its own parliamentary motion. No 10 would hope that a firm assurance that the backstop would be temporary would be enough to win the vote In the event of a less strong commitment from the EU, a scenario set out over the weekend by the former No 10 director of legislative affairs Nikki da Costa could play out. A backbench amendment could be tabled incorporating the EU offer and mandating the prime minister to seek further legally binding commitments from the EU If any such amendment were passed it could overcome the main difficulty the prime minister experienced at last month's EU summit. Many EU leaders said there was no point in making concessions when they would inevitably be rejected by Parliament. If MPs indicated they were happy with the EU offer but need firmer legal assurances, that could provide the basis for an emergency EU summit to approve the offer. That would be a big step for the EU but there is no other way to provide a commitment with legal force. In the end, the differences between the UK and the EU may prove to be irreconcilable. The EU wants to avoid a no-deal but it is adamant that the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened as long as Theresa May stands by her red lines, most notably on rejecting free movement of people. Brussels will also not agree to any wording that undermines the agreement. The DUP is also highly suspicious of the government and the EU. Their strong opposition hardened when the government's legal advice said that in some circumstances Northern Ireland would have to treat Great Britain as a 'third country' - EU parlance for a foreign country. Until the DUP have assurances that that scenario cannot happen - or at least would have a guarantee that it would only be temporary - it is all but impossible to see them coming on board.

"This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise An exercise to test plans for border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as ""too little too late"" by hauliers. A convoy of 89 lorries took part in two test runs from the disused Manston Airport, near Ramsgate in Kent, on a 20-mile route to the Port of Dover. The Department for Transport said they went well and traffic ran smoothly. But the Road Haulage Association said the process should have begun months earlier. Its chief executive Richard Burnett said the trial ""cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks that would be held at Manston Airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""It's too little too late, this process should have started nine months ago,"" he added. ""At this late stage it looks like window dressing."" Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, also questioned the usefulness of the test. ""We've got to remember 10,000 lorries visit the Channel ports every single day so a test with less than 100 is not even a drop in the ocean,"" he said. ""Sending lorries around Kent on a wild goose chase all the way to Manston in the extreme north-east corner and then sending them to the Port of Dover by a small A road is not the right answer."" But Toby Howe, from Kent County Council, said: ""What we're learning from this is not based on 1,000 lorries or whatever. ""What we want to know is how quickly they can actually get out of the airport behind us and how quickly they will get to the various points on the stage. ""So whether it's 10 lorries, 20 lorries, 100 lorries, that will give us enough information and will give the Department for Transport enough information to then learn from that."" The lorries began the 20-mile journey at 08:00 GMT Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial, known as Operation Brock, to test the airport site's suitability as a mass HGV holding bay. The drivers congregated in a large group at the former airfield before being directed by officials from the Department for Transport (DfT), Kent County Council and police officers along the A256 towards Dover. The first practice run began in rush-hour shortly after 08:00 GMT, with four convoys leaving at intervals between 08:13 and 08:39. The first of the convoys arrived in Dover at 08:52 where they were directed to do a loop around the Eastern Docks roundabout, travel along Jubilee Way and drive straight back to the airport. A second test run got under way at 11:00. One lorry driver said he felt the exercise had been ""a waste of time"" Lorry drivers who spoke to the BBC on arrival back at Manston after the first test said there had been ""no problems whatsoever"". However, one driver said he thought it had been ""a waste of time"". ""Someone had to do it didn't they, really? But at the end of the day what will be, will be,"" he said. Ramsgate 'not ready' for Brexit ferries 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Another driver, Ben Pearce, said the test ""seems to be going quite well"". He added: ""It will give them a fair idea how the traffic will behave if they do use the space as a holding bay."" Each driver taking part in the exercise was paid Â£550, the DfT said. The lorries left the disused airport in smaller batches Operation Brock was intended to maintain traffic flow on the M20and prevent the kind of disruption experienced in 2015when parts of the motorway were closed to cars for several days. The trial was organised alongside the Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association. Some people on social media also question the usefulness of the trial.

"Alex Hepburn denies two charges of rape A county cricket player raped a sleeping woman after setting up a sexual conquest ""game"" with friends on WhatsApp, a court heard. Worcestershire all-rounder Alex Hepburn allegedly attacked the woman after she had consensual sex with his team-mate Joe Clarke after a night out. Worcester Crown Court heard she had woken up to find Australian-born Mr Hepburn performing a sex act on her. The 23-year-old, of Portland Street, Worcester, denies two counts of rape. Mr Hepburn claims the alleged victim was awake and initial kissing led to consensual sexual contact. Opening the prosecution's case, Miranda Moore QC said the alleged victim realised she was not with Mr Clarke, who had left the room to be sick, when she touched Mr Hepburn's hair and he spoke in an Australian accent. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands She told jurors a member of the public dialled 999 after finding the woman, who cannot be identified, ""distressed and crying"" in the street in April 2017. Presenting WhatsApp messages found on Mr Hepburn's mobile, Ms Moore alleged that a ""stat chat"" group he took part in was set up to record details of women members had slept with. The rules said the ""winner"" would be able to gloat and enjoy a night out paid for by other members. Ms Moore said: ""He saw that girl asleep in the bed and decided to take advantage. ""That is what this case is about, this defendant's attitude to women."" A police interview with the complainant was also shown, where she told a police officer she had assumed she was having sex with Mr Clarke, before ""panic set in"" when she saw Mr Hepburn.

"LG's screen folds out when in use and then retracts LG has revealed a consumer version of its roll-up TV set at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. The Signature OLED TV R is built on a concept unveiled last year, in which the screen retracts into a base when not in use so it is less obtrusive. LG plans to sell the device in the US before the end of 2019, but has yet to reveal the month or price. Experts say the technology is unlikely to become a mass-market proposition for many years to come. ""It's a 4K set rather than 8K, so you could argue there's a compromise there - but otherwise this is a very high-end design that is going to be very costly,"" commented Jack Wetherill from the consultancy Futuresource. The premium TV features a soundbar built into its base so it can be used to play music when the display is hidden The South Korean firm also showed off another TV that will compete with the fold-out model for flagship status: a 88in (224cm) model that was described as being the biggest OLED set to date. Much of the presentation about it centred on its use of machine learning to finesse its picture quality. More from CES 2019: Samsung's new shape-shifting TVs revealed The backseat VR that moves with the car CES 2019: Preparing for take-off That represented a tacit acknowledgement that there is little native 8K content available as yet, so users will be reliant on upgraded 4K and high definition imagery. LG says its new 8K television will be the biggest OLED TV on the market In addition, the firm said that its wider range of new smart TVs would includeaccess to Amazon Alexa as well as Google's Assistant,external, which was added last year. Relatively few devices have worked with both the two rival virtual assistants to date. Speaker-maker Sonos has notably taken longer than expected to deliver on its promise of combining the two into a single device. In LG's case, the two platforms will be accessed via its own ThinQ software rather than directly. Its press conference showed a user commanding them via a TV remote control, suggesting that a different button press determined which of the two assistants was invoked. Samsung's new TVs will also offer access to both Amazon and Google's platforms too, although it will prioritise its own smart assistant Bixby. ""I see it as an acceptance that there's a very large group of users already using Google and Amazon's AIs,"" remarked Paul Gagnon from the consultancy IHS Markit. Alexa Skills and Google Assistant Actions can both be accessed via LG's ThinQ software ""It would be pretty hard for a company to stand in the way of that progress and not cut out potential buyers."" LG also said its TVs would be among the first to natively support Apple's AirPlay technology, allowing them to stream footage and audio from iPhones and iPads as well as be controlled by Siri. LG dedicated much of the rest of its press conference to explaining how its household appliances could be made to anticipate their owners' wishes by allowing the company to monitor people's wider behaviour. One example involved its ThinQ software offering to deploy a robot vacuum because it had detected its owner picking up another cleaning device. Another involved the dishwasher ordering itself new detergent because it had run out. LG says its appliances will be able to anticipate owners' needs, if they opt in to having their habits analysed In general, things ran much more smoothly than last year when the firm's US marketing chief David VanderWaal tried to demo a robot called Cloi, which repeatedly ignored his commands. However, right at the end of the latest event the firm failed to mute his microphone, so that the last words heard were Mr VanderWaal saying: ""That's a wrap - one glitch on the video."" One of the firm's displays failed to work as intended during the TV section of the press conference. Read and watch all our CES coverage atbbc.com/ces2019 Samsung's new shape-shifting TVs revealed.

"This video can not be played WATCH: A hi-tech sun cream sprayer that won't leave you with sticky hands will be at CES The CES trade show is powering up again in Vegas. Most of the biggest names in tech and stacks of start-ups you've never heard of will compete for attention over the next week. Some products may launch new categories,external- past events presented a first look at  video cassette recorders (VCRs), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs and Android tablets. But many more will flop or never even make it to market. More than 4,500 exhibitors are attending CES and more will take part in fringe events or host private demos in hotel suites We've scoured the internet for hints about what will be on show... One of the biggest developments at the last few CES expos has been Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant's rival efforts to extend their reach in the home and beyond. Last year things peaked with an Alexa-activated toilet flush, but over the past 12 months  manufacturers have developed voice-controlled ""skills"" or ""actions"" for more products, and in some cases embedded one of the virtual assistants outright. The Auri Lamp has Alexa built in, so you can use it to begin a meditation routine or to make fart sounds For 2019, we're being promised tags that will let smart speakers tell you where your pet or TV remote is hiding, as well as Alexa/Google Assistant-controlled pianos, heart rate monitors, lawnmowers, motorcycle helmets and meditation lamps. That's not to say others aren't trying to muscle in. Samsung is rumoured to be revealing a fresh Galaxy Home speaker powered by its smart assistant Bixby, and German start-up Autolabs will demo Chris - a virtual helper designed for use in cars. The makers of Chris say it will only run apps that are safe to use while driving Several firms will also urge developers to get behind ""open source"" alternatives, in which neither of the two tech giants act as gatekeeper to the apps on offer. For example, Volareo will show progress on a crowdfunded smart speaker that lets you buy Bitcoin and stream any video to your TV. Volareo is being pitched as a smart speaker for ""independent thinkers"" Others will be pitching ways to drive the category forward. So, for example, Elliptic Labs will demo a radar-like system that lets smart speakers detect their owners' approach. It suggests the tech could be used to trigger daily reminders or to make the speakers adjust their volume according to how close the person is. Taking things one step further, Smart IoT Labs has Miranda - a kind of smart assistant for smart assistants that issues commands on your behalf to Alexa or Google based on your past behaviour, which sounds a bit bonkers. Mui's creator says it follows ""distraction-free"" design principles by only lighting up when in use And for consumers still wary about talking to their tech, Mui Lab has a ""calmer"" alternative. At first sight its product looks like a plank of wood, but when touched it lights up to provide a way to control Google's Assistant with swipes and presses rather than barked commands. Nespresso has a lot to answer for. The success of its pod-based coffee machines has inspired several start-ups to take the capsule-based concept and extend it to other kitchen gadgets. Yomee takes six hours to turn milk and a fruit flavour pod into yoghurt Lecker Labs has Yomee - to which you add milk and the pod of your choosing to create yoghurt. Mitte has a machine that passes water through a choice of cartridges to add rock minerals to it and avoid the need to buy bottles of the stuff. Mitte's mineral cartridges alter the water's pH value and taste in different ways And even LG is getting in on the act with HomeBrew, a product that makes beer from single-use capsules containing malt, yeast, and hop oil. It's presumably targeted at drinkers who think ""craft brewing"" extends to a button push. Meanwhile, Capsulier is back at CES with a production version of its DIY coffee and tea pods-maker, after recently starting shipments to its Kickstarter backers. Capsulier says its Nespresso-compatible pods cost a fraction of what shop-bought equivalents cost to make Switching tack, other intriguing foodie developments include gadgets that claim to help you improve your diet by analysing your breath. Lumen says it will have a working prototype of its ""hack your metabolism"" device, which determines the proportion of carbs and fats being burnt for energy from the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air you exhale. Lumen recommends what to eat and when based on its analysis of your breath It then makes food recommendations based on the result. By contrast, FoodMarble's Aire measures the hydrogen in your breath and combines this with a log of what you have eaten, to warn you of foods you should avoid and possible substitutions. Aire is designed to discover which foods are being passed to the large intestine without being fully digested There's always fancy new fridges at the show, but it's doubtful they have yet advanced to the point they can tell you when you need to eat each item by - the holy grail of kitchen tech. But Ovie has an interim solution. Ovie tags show you what foods are about to go off to encourage you to consume them before it's too late It will show off SmartTags that you're supposed to attach to each foodstuff and identify to Alexa as you do so. Their colour then changes as the food goes off, while an app suggests recipes to make from near-expired items. This video can not be played WATCH: LG showed off a concept rollable TV at CES 2018 TVs have been at the heart of CESever since it started 52 years ago. This year, the hot rumour is thatLG will reveal a commercial version,externalof a roll-up concept it previously demoed, meaning families can have a giant screen without sacrificing one of their walls. Samsung may also have a rival setif a patent, sneaked out on Christmas Day,,externalis anything to go by. Its design appears to open up horizontally rather than vertically. Samsung's patent describes how a flexible screen could be rolled up to pull in either of its two sides Failing that, it's likely to have more to say on its modular MicroLED tech, in which lots of small panels are clipped together to form a screen. Last year it showed off a 146in (371cm) 4K display, but it needs to create smaller versions for the innovation to be practical in the living room. Expect lots of talk about 8K too, with sets featuring four times as many pixels as today's 4K standard. Japan's recent switch-on ofthe world's first ""super high-definition"" channelmeans there's now an audience for the feature, even if content elsewhere is in short supply. Although stores already stock 8K models, existing units lack HDMI 2.1 ports. The new cable standard is required to provide enough bandwidth to send a 60 frames-per-second 8K signal over a single connection, as well as having other benefits. LG has already confirmed it will debut the technology,externaland other brands are likely to do likewise. 8K TVs allow you to get up close and still not be able to make out their individual pixels The other development to watch out for is TVs featuring far-field microphones - the tech found in smart speakers that lets them be commanded from across a room. This could free owners from having to use a remote control. Toshiba announced in August that most of its 2019 TVs for Europe would listen out for voice commands Toshiba has already announced one such model for Europe featuring Alexa. A wider roll-out could give Amazon and Google's smart assistants another gateway into people's homes. Robot-makers at CES typically promise much, but their inventions often struggle to justify their existence. Worse -if you remember Cloi last year- they can have a tendency to misbehave. But the lead developer of one of the category's rare success stories - Softbank's Pepper - is at CES this year with a droid that he believes has the capacity to ""touch hearts"". Lovot robots have sensors across their bodies so they can detect where the owners are touching them Kaname Hayashi will be demoing Lovot, a chick-like bot with large expressive eyes, flapping arms, wheels, and a wardrobe of clothes to cover its soft shell. A camera protrudes from its head, allowing it to map rooms and act as a child monitor or home surveillance device. But Mr Hayashi has said the purpose of Lovot is not to be helpful or entertaining, but rather to engender joy, love and other positive emotions that might help owners reach their true potential. He's not the only one suggesting the time has come to welcome companion bots into our homes. Kiki and Liku are at earlier stages of development than Lovot There's Kiki, a ""pet robot"" designed by two former Google engineers, whose personality evolves according to how its owners treat it. And Liku, a humanoid bot that promises to express ""desires and emotions"" driven by what's going on in its surroundings. Others, however, remain focused on addressing more practical problems. Several robots are designed for a specific use Coral will show off what it says is the first robot vacuum to feature a detachable handheld unit. Occo has a new version of its photo-taking model that interacts with guests at events before getting them to pose for automated snaps. And Cowarobot follows up an earlier self-driving suitcase with ShopPal - a unit designed for use in stores to follow customers about, drawing their attention to promotions and offering to recharge their mobile devices. Youcan Robot's BW Space is one of several drones being promoted to underwater video-makers The US's opioid crisis, in which hundreds of people are dying every week after becoming addicted to pain medication, has driven several medical tech firms into action. Several new products are based on neuromodulation therapy, which involves stimulating the spinal cord or peripheral nerves to try to interrupt pain signals before they reach the brain. The technique has been around since the 1980s, but traditionally required surgery for an implant. Lenus Freedom claims its device can help mitigate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal Some start-ups, however, are attempting to offer non-surgical solutions. They include Lenus Freedom,which says its electrical nerve field stimulator,externalcan be fitted by a physician in five minutes. Meanwhile, PainCareLabs has aprototype called DuoTherm,externalthat it says alters nerve activity linked to back pain by applying heat and vibration pressure rather than electric pulses. But experts have doubts. ""The challenge is far greater than these start-ups portray,"" Prof Sam Eldabe of the British Pain Society told the BBC. ""[One issue] is that tolerance develops to spinal cord stimulation in around 20% of subjects, and we know the same occurs for peripheral nerve stimulation."" PainCareLabs says its device offers a drug-free treatment to back pain For those who still need to take pills or regular injections, there's a barrage of new ""smart"" medication boxes in which to keep them. Pillo appears to be the most elaborate example. The dispenser features an animated smart companion that uses facial recognition to ensure the right person gets the right dose at the right time. Pillo can answer questions about nutrition and run video calls It's worth being a bit sceptical about some of the supposed breakthroughs, though. Lexilight's website, for example, claims the rapidly-flashing lamp it will display can help dyslexic people ""read as fast as everyone else"". It's based on a theory that the condition is caused by an unusual arrangement of light-receptor cells in the eyes of those with the disorder. But the scientists who proposed the idea saidmore tests were needed when they announced their theory last year,external, and several expertsin the field were dismissive of it,external. Is a 10-second clean with the Y-Brush really as effective as two minutes with an electric toothbrush? Likewise, bold claims are being made of some of the beauty tech that will go on show. Y-Brush, for instance, says its nylon-bristled mouthpiece can give teeth a ""perfect"" clean in 10 seconds. The GilletteLabs Heated Razor features four heat sensors and a bar that goes up to 50C (122F) And Gillette claims a new razor with a battery-powered heating bar will increase glide and reduce tug to deliver the ""comfort of a hot towel shave"". This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with the first bendy phone At one point it looked like the big story of CES 2019 would be flexible phones. China's Royole still intends to show off its smartphone-tablet hybrid the FlexPai, having demoed a pre-production unit in October. But famed leaker Evan Blass has backtracked from claims that LG will unveil a version of its own. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The BBC understands Huawei is also biding its time. And that means Samsung - which has already given the world abrief glimpse of its foldable Galaxy X- is likely to wait until February's Mobile World Congress to properly show off the device. Instead, your best bet of seeing a big-name brand with new folding tech may be Intel and its Copper Harbor dual-screened Windows PC. Intel's Copper Harbor prototype can be used in a variety of modes The chip-maker showed off a prototype in Singapore three months ago, but has yet to make a big fuss about the concept. Its two touchscreen panels can work together as a single big display, or let one act as a keyboard or scribble pad. For those looking to give their existing laptop more screen real estate, Mobile Pixels may have the solution. Having two screens on view should help workers boost productivity but will eat into battery life Its Duo accessory attaches a second display to the back of the main screen that can either be slid out to extend the view or be faced outwards to show off what the user is up to. Two start-ups from different sides of the world appear to have simultaneously invented another unusual peripheral. France's Nemeio and Australia's Sonder Design have created keyboards with small e-ink displays beneath each key. In addition to icons, the keyboards can also display non-Latin letters, which could make them a practical choice for typing in Chinese or Arabic Users can switch from a Qwerty letter-layout to other designs, and also replace the characters with icons of their choosing to suit specialist applications or games. December's shutdown of Gatwick Airport is likely to be referenced by US Secretary of Transport Elaine Chao,who is giving a keynote speech,externalthat will address the promise and risks of consumer drones. But on the show floor, the biggest player in the business - DJI - has a positive story of its own to sell with a new model designed for the emergency services. DJI's latest drone uses tech made by thermal camera-maker Flir It can stream split-screen video feeds of a scene in both heat vision and the normal visible spectrum, which could be useful in search-and-rescue missions. Astral AR is proposing something even more ambitious: an aircraft to stop school shootings. Astral AR is testing its software on an Intel-made drone before deciding whether to switch to a custom design It claims drones could be used to obstruct an attacker and block their gunfire. An armour covering would supposedly make the machine difficult to destroy. At present the team is testing its ability to track a shooter's gaze and pose by using a commercial drone, but in time it hopes to deploy a smaller custom-designed solution. Sunflower Labs will propose what's perhaps a more realistic drone-based security system. It's pairing an aircraft called the Bee with motion-detecting lamps to offer a hi-tech way to deter intruders from homes and other properties. Sunflower Labs believes burglars would find drones harder to evade than standard security camera systems Drones will also be taking to the deep, with several firms showing off models designed for use in the sea. The idea is to provide a way to livestream scuba dives as well as to carry out inspections of boat hulls, underwater piping and other submerged objects. Youcan Robot's BW Space is one of several drones being promoted to underwater video-makers Expect to hear lots of talk about self-drive technologies, futuristic infotainment systems and 5G-based vehicle-to-vehicle data-swapping. But with Detroit's giant Auto Show overlapping with CES's final day, many car-makers are keeping back their big news. Mercedes intends to show off its one of its concept cars as well as the more practical 2020 CLA-Class saloon Even so, Mercedes appears ready to unveil a second-generation version of its CLA-Class fastback saloon at the Vegas event, and Nissan is rumoured to debut the e-Plus version of its Leaf electric car, offering extended battery life. Potentially more revolutionary, there will be at least two ""flying cars"" at the show. Despite resembling a helicopter, Pal-V Liberty is a gyroplane and does not take off vertically The Pal-V Liberty is a petrol-powered three-wheeler with fold-out rotary blades on its roof and a propeller at its rear, whose makers say it is self-stabilising in the air. It's based on a 20-year-old concept, but its maker claims it will be ready to deliver the first working units in 2020. NFT is at an earlier stage of development. The firm - which is headquartered near Google - promises an electric vehicle that will take off and land vertically but fly like a plane. It intends to reveal what it will look like at the expo. France's Pragma Industries says its hydrogen fuel cell bike is the first of its kind Other exotic vehicles at the show with a lot to prove include Pragma Industries' Alpha bicycle, which is powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. It says the vehicle will have double the range of li-ion battery-based equivalents and none of the hassle of waiting hours for a recharge. Emerge will be showing off a scooter with a touchscreen steering wheel, which it says will discourage drivers from using their smartphones. JackRabbit's bicycle can go 13 miles (21km) on a single charge And JackRabbit has a modern-day take on the Penny Farthing bicycle - with one wheel bigger than the other and an electric motor. It looks a bit awkward to ride but is supposedly nimble in use. And there's still so much more. For example, several start-ups are attempting to ride the hype-wave associated with blockchain and crypto-currencies. They include a coin-mining TV and a sports score business that rewards accurate predictions with  crypto-currency as a means to work around online gambling laws. But the stand-out example may be Pigzbe - a handheld digital wallet targeted at six-year-olds that is supposed to replace pocket money. Pigzbe is designed to teach children about the wisdom of investing in crypto-currencies Supposedly one of the benefits over just using an online bank account is that it doesn't involve decimals, with which some youngsters struggle. But since it runs on a new digital currency, Wollo, you may end up having to explainwhy their savings have shrunk in value.,external Scribit uses a new type of erasable ink to draw on walls and glass, but also works with third-party pens There's a multitude of other new gizmos and apps on show - and here's a final selection that caught our eye. Scribit is a wall-drawing gadget that turns images sourced from the web into line art. When users tire of them, it uses a heating element to make the ink vanish. LiBest's product contains a battery that wraps around the wrist LiBest has put a flexible battery in a wristband that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch on the go and give it more than a day's battery life. CoCoon is a smart beehive that automatically tackles a mite that harms the insects, and can summon help if other problems arise.

"This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry MP Anna Soubry has criticised police for not intervening after she was verbally abused outside Parliament. The Conservative ex-minister was accused ""of being a Nazi"", while being interviewed on the BBC News channel. She called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. The police said they were assessing if any crimes had been committed while Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was worried about a ""pattern"" of women MPs and journalists being targeted. Raising the issue in the House of Commons, Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She accused far-right groups of re-playing Monday's clip and others like it on social media sites to ""raise revenue for their trolling activities"". Ms Soubry, the pro-European MP for Broxtowe who supports another Brexit referendum, was subjected to verbal abuse while being interviewed by the BBC's Simon McCoy. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Protesters standing just a few yards from the entrance to Parliament accused her of being a liar and then chanted: ""Anna Soubry is a Nazi."" She was later shouted at and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. Reacting during the live interview, she told McCoy she ""objected to being called a Nazi"", adding that such language was ""astonishing  - and this is what has happened to our country"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" She said she would not be silenced nor intimidated but it was wrong that MPs and others doing their job in such a public space should ""have to accept this as part of the democratic process"". After the incident, she told BBC News the police needed to ""do their job"" and would contact them about the matter. The Metropolitan Police said they were investigating reports of a public order offence but no arrests had been made. The MP has already been in touch with the parliamentary authorities responsible for security. A number of MPs raised the matter with Mr Bercow at the end of a statement on the government's Brexit policy. Labour's Stephen Doughty called for ""proper action"" to be taken by the Metropolitan Police against those responsible for what he said were ""potentially unlawful actions"". And Conservative MP Nick Boles urged Mr Bercow to ensure everything possible was done to not only protect the right to freedom of speech but the right of MPs to move freely in and around Parliament in ""total safety"". Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. While the Met had responsibility for security outside the parliamentary estate, he said, he was keeping a ""close eye"" on the issue amid concerns that women, in particular, were being targeted. ""I share 100% the concerns expressed and it's necessary to state very publicly the difference between peaceful protest on one hand and the aggressive, intimidatory and threatening protest on the other."" Ms Creagh said there was a ""strong streak of misogyny"" in the wave of Brexit-related abuse directed against MPs. ""We in this place remember our friend Jo Cox, who was murdered by a far-right neo-Nazi,"" she said. ""We remember that people have gone to prison for plotting to murder another Labour MP and many people have been jailed for the abuse of other colleagues."" No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". A Downing Street spokesman said there were laws dealing with public order offences and cases of harassment and threatening behaviour.

"This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise An exercise to test plans for border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as ""too little too late"" by hauliers. A convoy of 89 lorries took part in two test runs from the disused Manston Airport, near Ramsgate in Kent, on a 20-mile route to the Port of Dover. The Department for Transport said they went well and traffic ran smoothly. But the Road Haulage Association said the process should have begun months earlier. Its chief executive Richard Burnett said the trial ""cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks that would be held at Manston Airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""It's too little too late, this process should have started nine months ago,"" he added. ""At this late stage it looks like window dressing."" Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, also questioned the usefulness of the test. ""We've got to remember 10,000 lorries visit the Channel ports every single day so a test with less than 100 is not even a drop in the ocean,"" he said. ""Sending lorries around Kent on a wild goose chase all the way to Manston in the extreme north-east corner and then sending them to the Port of Dover by a small A road is not the right answer."" But Toby Howe, from Kent County Council, said: ""What we're learning from this is not based on 1,000 lorries or whatever. ""What we want to know is how quickly they can actually get out of the airport behind us and how quickly they will get to the various points on the stage. ""So whether it's 10 lorries, 20 lorries, 100 lorries, that will give us enough information and will give the Department for Transport enough information to then learn from that."" The lorries began the 20-mile journey at 08:00 GMT Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial, known as Operation Brock, to test the airport site's suitability as a mass HGV holding bay. The drivers congregated in a large group at the former airfield before being directed by officials from the Department for Transport (DfT), Kent County Council and police officers along the A256 towards Dover. The first practice run began in rush-hour shortly after 08:00 GMT, with four convoys leaving at intervals between 08:13 and 08:39. The first of the convoys arrived in Dover at 08:52 where they were directed to do a loop around the Eastern Docks roundabout, travel along Jubilee Way and drive straight back to the airport. A second test run got under way at 11:00. One lorry driver said he felt the exercise had been ""a waste of time"" Lorry drivers who spoke to the BBC on arrival back at Manston after the first test said there had been ""no problems whatsoever"". However, one driver said he thought it had been ""a waste of time"". ""Someone had to do it didn't they, really? But at the end of the day what will be, will be,"" he said. Ramsgate 'not ready' for Brexit ferries 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Another driver, Ben Pearce, said the test ""seems to be going quite well"". He added: ""It will give them a fair idea how the traffic will behave if they do use the space as a holding bay."" Each driver taking part in the exercise was paid Â£550, the DfT said. The lorries left the disused airport in smaller batches Operation Brock was intended to maintain traffic flow on the M20and prevent the kind of disruption experienced in 2015when parts of the motorway were closed to cars for several days. The trial was organised alongside the Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association. Some people on social media also question the usefulness of the trial.

"Comedian Richard Ayoade stars in HSBC's TV ad campaign HSBC has been criticised for an advertising campaign that claims the UK ""is not an island"". Thousands of people have reacted on social media, with some claiming the adverts are anti-Brexit. However, HSBC told the BBC the campaign was ""not about Brexit"". The agency behind the campaign, JWT, said the work was in response to the current ""atmosphere"" and to remind people that we are all global citizens ""whatever the political climate"". One social media user questioned whether the HSBC risked ""alienating a large number of potential customers"" with the campaign. Allow Twitter content?

An HSBC UK spokesperson said: ""With the 'We are not an island' poster we are reinforcing our strong belief that the things that make us quintessentially British are the things that make us inescapably international."" The advertising industry magazine Campaign haspublished images of the design,externalof regional variations of the design. Versions have appeared in Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London. They feature references to the Otley Run in Leeds, and the formation of Oasis in Manchester. The campaign, which has the tagline ""together we thrive"", includes a TV advert featuring British comedian Richard Ayoade. It comes as HSBC is implementing changes to the way it operates in the UK. In August, the bank revealed it had shifted ownership of its Polish and Irish subsidiaries from London to France, ahead of Britain's exit from the EU. It plans to do the same for seven additional European units. HSBC and other long-established lenders are facing heightened competition for customers from new rivals. Digital banks such as Monzo offer a primarily app-based service, with appeal to a younger generation of account holders. In a bid to remain competitive, HSBC has been offering an upfront payment for switching to its current account.

"Charlotte Brown and Shepherd shared two bottles of wine at dinner before the speedboat crash The family of a woman who died in a speedboat crash on the River Thames have been speaking about their anger that her killer is still on the run. In July,Jack Shepherd was jailed for six yearsfor the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown in 2015. However, the trial was held in his absence and he remains at large. Ms Brown's father Graham Brown has toldThe Telegraph,externalhe suspects that police ""haven't got a clue"" where his daughter's killer is. ""They've posted him missing on Interpol and that's about it,"" he said. On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the case raised ""significant public concerns"" and called on Shepherd to hand himself in. Graham Brown previously told the BBC he was ""not convinced the authorities are doing everything possible"" Ms Brown's family have also spoken about their anguish that Shepherd has been given permission to appeal against the conviction, in spite of his disappearance. Her sister Katie told the BBC the family were ""pretty shocked that it's been allowed to happen"". ""He's still on the run, he hasn't served a day of his sentence and he's been allowed to still be in communication with his lawyers. ""He's been able to appeal using legal aid as well,"" she said. This video can not be played Roz Wickens and Katie Brown said they were ""devastated"" Jack Shepherd had not faced justice Shepherd and Ms Brown, who was from Clacton, Essex, met through the dating website OkCupid. On their first date in December 2015, they dined in London's Shard skyscraper before the web designer took the 24-year-old out on his speedboat. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error In mobile phone footage filmed during the date, Ms Brown could be heard shouting that they were going ""so fast"" as Shepherd drove at more than double the 12-knot speed limit. The speeding boat, which Shepherd told police he had bought ""to pull women"", then hit a submerged log and tipped over, flinging them both into the water. The web designer was found clinging to the hull but Ms Brown was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive and died in hospital. In July, a jury found Shepherd guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. He told his lawyers in mid-May he would not be attending his trial at the Old Bailey but the Crown Prosecution Service only found out a week before it began. During the trial, his defence team said they did not know where he was, although his solicitor had maintained telephone contact with Shepherd. Jack Shepherd attending a hearing at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court in 2017 Following his conviction, police said theybelieved Shepherd might have fled abroadbut they have said they have ""no tangible trace"" of him. The last confirmed sighting of him was in March 2018 in Devon, police said. ""There have been a number of rumours that he is being harboured abroad by friends but we have no evidence this is the case,"" Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said on Monday. The 31-year-old - who police say has a valid passport - has not been using his known bank accounts or mobile phone, although Mr Norman said he ""may well be using the accounts of friends or associates to evade arrest and extradition"". ""We would appeal to Mr Shepherd's friends and associates who may be assisting him through a misplaced sense of loyalty to do the right thing and share any information they have with the police,"" he said. Tuckers Solicitors, which is representing Shepherd, said it was ""not aware of his whereabouts"". In a statement, the law firm said it had been ""instructed to represent Mr Shepherd"" and would do so ""without prejudice and to the best of our ability"". After the crash Shepherd told police he bought the speedboat ""to pull women"" Last month, the Court of Appeal confirmed thata judge had given him permission to appeal against the conviction, although permission to appeal against his six-year jail sentence was refused. Tuckers said the appeal would be ""based on what the defence believe were legal errors made during the trial"" and Shepherd's continued absence ""has no effect on the principle of an appeal, which is purely based on matters of law"". ""Previous case law confirms that an absent defendant still has the right to appeal against legal errors at a trial that took place in his absence,"" the firm said. He was eligible for legal aid for his criminal trial and this is automatically extended to advice about his appeal - regardless of whether he is in custody or on the run. Tuckers have said the fee for representing the 31-year-old amounts to ""less than Â£30,000"". This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim The prime minister's official spokesman said Theresa May's ""strongest sympathies are with the family of Charlotte Brown, and Jack Shepherd should give himself up right away to face justice"". He said she was aware of the ""significant public concerns around this case"" which was ""why the Ministry of Justice is looking into the issues that it raises"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid recently sent a letter to the Brown family in which he told them ""no-one is above the law"", and that he had ""instructed Home Office officials to seek assurances from police"". A meeting has also been arranged between Mr Javid and Ms Brown's familyon 22 January to discuss the case. James Brokenshire, MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup where some of the family live, has also pledged his support for the Browns. Mr Brokenshire said he wanted to ""ensure that all steps and measures are being taken... to bring Shepherd back to the UK so that he faces the justice he rightly deserves"". If Shepherd is apprehended in the UK, he will be taken into custody to start serving his six-year sentence. Nevertheless, the appeal against his conviction will still go ahead.

"Left-right: Olivia Colman, Ben Whishaw and Richard Madden British stars Olivia Colman, Christian Bale, Richard Madden and Ben Whishaw were among the winners at this year's prestigious Golden Globe Awards. Colman was honoured for the film The Favourite, and Bale won for playing ex-US Vice-President Dick Cheney in Vice. Madden and Whishaw won TV awards for their roles in BBC dramas Bodyguard and A Very English Scandal respectively. Bohemian Rhapsody, about Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, won two big awards, including one for its star Rami Malek. Queen film is big Golden Globes winner The winners and nominees in full The big moments from the Golden Globes The Golden Globes is the first major ceremony of the Hollywood awards season, and can often help a movie or a movie star in the race for the Oscars. Colman was named best actress in a musical/comedy for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite and she gave an endearingly excited acceptance speech that ended with her holding up her trophy and sending a message to her family: ""Ed and the kids - look! Yay!"" Christian Bale won best actor in a motion picture (comedy or musical) for Vice Christian Bale provided one of the night's most political moments when he thanked ""Satan"" for inspiration for his role in Vice. Bale played Dick Cheney, who was vice-president from 2001 to 2009 and is blamed by the film for many of the world's ills. Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes rewards TV as well as film. Picking up his prize for best TV drama actor, Madden said: ""I didn't see this coming at all."" The Scottish star played Sergeant David Budd in BBC One's Bodyguard.

"The St John's school pupils had returned from skiing in the French resort of Alpe d'Huez A stowaway has been found in the luggage hold of a school coach returning from a ski trip to France. The man was discovered when pupils at St John's school in Marlborough, Wiltshire, returned from Alpe d'Huez at about 11:30 GMT on Saturday. He ""emerged from the luggage compartment"" when the driver unlocked it, the school said. However, one of the parents waiting to pick up pupils was a special constable and they arrested the man. A spokesman for the Home Office said Wiltshire Police had contacted Immigration Enforcement on Saturday after ""one man, who presented himself as Sudanese, was arrested for immigration offences"". The coach had been supplied by a British company and staff and students had passed through French and UK border control on foot before the vehicle boarded the ferry, a spokesperson for St John's said. ""One of the parents waiting to collect their children is a special constable and immediately arrested this person. ""The party leader called the police; two units arrived within minutes and took the person into custody. ""The situation remained calm and the individual was entirely compliant.

"People in Koszalin held a vigil on Sunday for the five girls who died Thirteen escape rooms have been closed in Poland after a fire in one of the venues killed five teenage girls. An owner of the facility has been charged with creating a fire hazard that led to the blaze on Friday. The girls died after the fire broke out while they were playing in a room at a venue in the northern city of Koszalin. In the game popular around the world, players are locked in a room and given a set amount of time to solve a series of riddles to get out. The craze of paying to escape from a locked room Budapest escape games: Behind the scenes The venue owner, who was arrested on Sunday, has been charged with ""creating the danger of a fire in the escape room and with unintentionally causing the death of people in a fire"", a spokesman for the Koszalin district prosecutor is quoted as saying by the Polish PAP news agency. The man also neglected to ensure that the room had escape routes, he said. The accused man has denied any negligence or wrongdoing, his lawyers say. A 25-year-old man was also seriously injured in the blaze which started at around 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Friday. Leaking gas cylinders are believed to have caused the blaze in the small room which measured 7.3 sq m (78 sq ft). The girls, all aged 15, were visiting the attraction in Koszalin to celebrate a birthday. This video can not be played Zoltan Kovacs takes you behind the scenes at a Trap escape game Participants are generally locked in a room and must solve a series of puzzles in order to get out. The industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Escape games are thought to have begun in Japan about a decade ago, andone in Hungary, which opened in 2011, is believed to have been the first in Europe. Budapest is one of the world's hubs for the genre, and it is estimated there are around 1,000 in Poland. In the UK, the number of escape rooms soared from just seven in 2013 to more than 1,000 as of last year. The authorities have ordered that all escape rooms around the country now be checked to ensure they meet safety standards. Firefighters inspected nearly 200 facilities across Poland over the weekend. They said more than 100 were found to be unsafe and 13 were immediately shut down. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki vowed on Sunday to close escape rooms that failed to meet safety standards. He also announced a review of more than 1,000 escape rooms or related facilities in Poland to determine whether new regulations were needed. Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski said on Sunday Poland would impose harsh fines and sanctions on business owners whose premises did not comply with health and safety standards. He also urged parents to report potential safety violations at venues. Leaking gas cylinders used to heat the building started a fire in the adjacent waiting room, a prosecutor said. Flames and toxic smoke spread quickly, and firefighters - responding to an emergency call - used specialised equipment to break in, but it was already too late. The teenagers are believed to have died of asphyxiation. Their funerals are due to be held on Thursday. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the fire was an ""appalling tragedy"".

"Katie Price appeared at Bromley Magistrates' Court charged with being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle Reality TV star Katie Price has denied being almost twice the legal alcohol limit while in charge of a vehicle. The 40-year-old was arrested by police who found a damaged Range Rover at the roadside on Shooters Hill Road, Greenwich, at about 02:00 GMT on 10 October last year. Ms Price, of Horsham, Sussex, was in the vehicle and had 69 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, Bromley Magistrates' Court heard. The legal limit is 35 micrograms. The court heard a man in a nearby block of flats concluded an ""accident of some sort"" had occurred involving his parked black car, which had pink paint on when he later inspected it. CCTV footage appeared to show the Range Rover was in the vicinity of his vehicle, District Judge Nigel Dean told the court. Judge Dean said Ms Price will rely on the defence that ""there was no likelihood of driving while the level of alcohol exceeded the proscribed limit"". At the hearing, Ms Price spoke only to deny the charge and give her name, address and date of birth. Ms Price was bailed to attend Bexley Magistrates' Court on 25 February, when her trial will start.

"Charlotte Brown and Shepherd shared two bottles of wine at dinner before the speedboat crash The family of a woman who died in a speedboat crash on the River Thames have been speaking about their anger that her killer is still on the run. In July,Jack Shepherd was jailed for six yearsfor the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown in 2015. However, the trial was held in his absence and he remains at large. Ms Brown's father Graham Brown has toldThe Telegraph,externalhe suspects that police ""haven't got a clue"" where his daughter's killer is. ""They've posted him missing on Interpol and that's about it,"" he said. On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the case raised ""significant public concerns"" and called on Shepherd to hand himself in. Graham Brown previously told the BBC he was ""not convinced the authorities are doing everything possible"" Ms Brown's family have also spoken about their anguish that Shepherd has been given permission to appeal against the conviction, in spite of his disappearance. Her sister Katie told the BBC the family were ""pretty shocked that it's been allowed to happen"". ""He's still on the run, he hasn't served a day of his sentence and he's been allowed to still be in communication with his lawyers. ""He's been able to appeal using legal aid as well,"" she said. This video can not be played Roz Wickens and Katie Brown said they were ""devastated"" Jack Shepherd had not faced justice Shepherd and Ms Brown, who was from Clacton, Essex, met through the dating website OkCupid. On their first date in December 2015, they dined in London's Shard skyscraper before the web designer took the 24-year-old out on his speedboat. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error In mobile phone footage filmed during the date, Ms Brown could be heard shouting that they were going ""so fast"" as Shepherd drove at more than double the 12-knot speed limit. The speeding boat, which Shepherd told police he had bought ""to pull women"", then hit a submerged log and tipped over, flinging them both into the water. The web designer was found clinging to the hull but Ms Brown was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive and died in hospital. In July, a jury found Shepherd guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence. He told his lawyers in mid-May he would not be attending his trial at the Old Bailey but the Crown Prosecution Service only found out a week before it began. During the trial, his defence team said they did not know where he was, although his solicitor had maintained telephone contact with Shepherd. Jack Shepherd attending a hearing at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court in 2017 Following his conviction, police said theybelieved Shepherd might have fled abroadbut they have said they have ""no tangible trace"" of him. The last confirmed sighting of him was in March 2018 in Devon, police said. ""There have been a number of rumours that he is being harboured abroad by friends but we have no evidence this is the case,"" Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said on Monday. The 31-year-old - who police say has a valid passport - has not been using his known bank accounts or mobile phone, although Mr Norman said he ""may well be using the accounts of friends or associates to evade arrest and extradition"". ""We would appeal to Mr Shepherd's friends and associates who may be assisting him through a misplaced sense of loyalty to do the right thing and share any information they have with the police,"" he said. Tuckers Solicitors, which is representing Shepherd, said it was ""not aware of his whereabouts"". In a statement, the law firm said it had been ""instructed to represent Mr Shepherd"" and would do so ""without prejudice and to the best of our ability"". After the crash Shepherd told police he bought the speedboat ""to pull women"" Last month, the Court of Appeal confirmed thata judge had given him permission to appeal against the conviction, although permission to appeal against his six-year jail sentence was refused. Tuckers said the appeal would be ""based on what the defence believe were legal errors made during the trial"" and Shepherd's continued absence ""has no effect on the principle of an appeal, which is purely based on matters of law"". ""Previous case law confirms that an absent defendant still has the right to appeal against legal errors at a trial that took place in his absence,"" the firm said. He was eligible for legal aid for his criminal trial and this is automatically extended to advice about his appeal - regardless of whether he is in custody or on the run. Tuckers have said the fee for representing the 31-year-old amounts to ""less than Â£30,000"". This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim The prime minister's official spokesman said Theresa May's ""strongest sympathies are with the family of Charlotte Brown, and Jack Shepherd should give himself up right away to face justice"". He said she was aware of the ""significant public concerns around this case"" which was ""why the Ministry of Justice is looking into the issues that it raises"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid recently sent a letter to the Brown family in which he told them ""no-one is above the law"", and that he had ""instructed Home Office officials to seek assurances from police"". A meeting has also been arranged between Mr Javid and Ms Brown's familyon 22 January to discuss the case. James Brokenshire, MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup where some of the family live, has also pledged his support for the Browns. Mr Brokenshire said he wanted to ""ensure that all steps and measures are being taken... to bring Shepherd back to the UK so that he faces the justice he rightly deserves"". If Shepherd is apprehended in the UK, he will be taken into custody to start serving his six-year sentence. Nevertheless, the appeal against his conviction will still go ahead.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May launched the plan in Liverpool NHS bosses in England say a new 10-year plan could save up to 500,000 lives by focusing on prevention and early detection. GPs, mental health and community care will get the biggest funding increases to shift the focus away from hospitals. Prime Minister Theresa May hailed the launch of the plan as a ""truly historic moment"". But unions are concerned that staffing shortages could undermine the ambitions - one in 11 posts are currently vacant. And some senior doctors warned hospitals were facing a ""near-on impossible task."" Society of Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven said he was ""staggered"" by the plans given the problems facing hospitals. Many trusts are missing all three key waiting time targets for A&E, cancer care and routine operations, and are struggling to balance the books. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens indicated there may be changes to the current target - that at least 95% of patients attending Accident and Emergency departments should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours - to take into greater account clinical need. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem with that is it doesn't distinguish between turning up at A&E with a sprained finger versus turning up with a heart attack. ""The top doctors in the NHS are looking at what are the most appropriate clinical standards to improve outcomes in emergency care. They will make their recommendations and then, on the back of that, we will meet them."" Hugh Pym: Will NHS plan deliver the goods? May's NHS plan 'lacks funding and staffing' Meet the NHS duo keeping the elderly safe at home Six things to look out for in health in 2019  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The plan, unveiled by Simon Stevens and Mrs May, committed to giving a third of the extra Â£20bn the NHS will get by 2023 on GPs, community care and mental health. Currently they account for less than a quarter of spending, while hospitals take up around half of the Â£114bn frontline budget. Mr Stevens called it a ""practical, costed and phased route map"" for the decade ahead. Mental health is due to get Â£2.3bn extra of the Â£20bn, while GP and community care is to get Â£4.5bn. NHS England said that will help pay for: Mental health support in schools and 24-hour access to mental health crisis care via the NHS 111 service Extra support in the community so patients can be discharged quickly from hospital and reduce the number of outpatient appointments by a third Digital access to health services, including online GP booking and remote monitoring of conditions such as high blood pressure More social prescribing to give GPs a range of options to tackle social problems like loneliness through connecting people to activities such as choirs and arts groups Healthy living programmes for patients struggling with ill-health New testing centres for cancer patients to ensure earlier diagnosis DNA testing for children with cancer and those with rare genetic disorders to help select the best treatment NHS England believes that combined the new vision could save 500,000 lives through preventing diseases, such as strokes, heart problems and cancer, and spotting them earlier to improve the chances of survival. As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England. But the other UK nations are drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The prime minister asked for the plan to be drawn up when she unveiled extra funding for the health service in the summer to mark its 70th birthday. The budget will grow by Â£20bn a year by 2023 - the equivalent of annual rises of just under 3.5%. She said a long-term plan for the next decade was needed to ensure the money was wisely spent. Mrs May said it was a ""historic"" moment for the NHS and would help pay for ""world class"" treatments. But shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the plan lacked both the staffing and funding to succeed and accused the government of ""mismanagement"" of the health service. ""The NHS needs a credible fully-funded plan for the future, not a wish list to help Theresa May get through the coming months."" The ambitions are being welcomed. Prof Carrie MacEwen, of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: ""It's good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS."" But unions have warned the workforce shortages could undermine the programme. Unison head of health Sara Gorton said: ""Without the staff, there is no NHS. ""Ministers must say more about how they plan to address the staffing shortages."" Mr Stevens told the BBC that the NHS planned to train between 25% and 50% more nurses and had five new medical schools ready to train doctors. He said: ""We've got to do a better job of looking after the staff that we have. I think people are under huge stress and pressure. We've got to change the way the health service works."" There is also unease that other parts of the wider health system have been cut - the Â£20bn promise only applies to NHS England's budget for frontline health care. It does not cover other areas such as training and public health. The money made available to councils to pay for initiatives such as smoking cessation and healthy weight programmes is being cut by more than 4% next year once inflation is taken into account. What is more, the government has yet to publish its green paper on social care despite promising to in 2017. Councils and care homes have warned care homes and home help services for the elderly and adults with disabilities are at risk because of insufficient funding. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, said the focus on out-of-hospital care should help relieve the pressures on hospitals. But he added: ""If we are serious about helping people to stay well and live independently for as long as possible it is vital that we also see appropriate investment and support for social care and public health."" When it comes to this plan, there are probably two key things to bear in mind about Brexit - funding and staffing. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. When the prime minister announced the Â£20bn extra in the summer she said it was partly being paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". But others have dismissed that suggestion. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Alongside that debate, fears have been raised that Brexit could worsen staffing shortages. About 5% of the NHS workforce is from Europe. The government has promised those currently working here will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay in the UK and there will be a new skilled migrants system, similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff, such as health care assistants and porters, will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least Â£30,000 a year.

A MAN NEEDS HIS NUGGS"" - went on to get more than 3.5 million retweets with numerous celebrities joining in, and other brands jumping on board to offer him things like free flights to get to a Wendy's. Though he didn't reach the target, Wendy's gave him a year of free nuggets anyway. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"People in Koszalin held a vigil on Sunday for the five girls who died Thirteen escape rooms have been closed in Poland after a fire in one of the venues killed five teenage girls. An owner of the facility has been charged with creating a fire hazard that led to the blaze on Friday. The girls died after the fire broke out while they were playing in a room at a venue in the northern city of Koszalin. In the game popular around the world, players are locked in a room and given a set amount of time to solve a series of riddles to get out. The craze of paying to escape from a locked room Budapest escape games: Behind the scenes The venue owner, who was arrested on Sunday, has been charged with ""creating the danger of a fire in the escape room and with unintentionally causing the death of people in a fire"", a spokesman for the Koszalin district prosecutor is quoted as saying by the Polish PAP news agency. The man also neglected to ensure that the room had escape routes, he said. The accused man has denied any negligence or wrongdoing, his lawyers say. A 25-year-old man was also seriously injured in the blaze which started at around 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Friday. Leaking gas cylinders are believed to have caused the blaze in the small room which measured 7.3 sq m (78 sq ft). The girls, all aged 15, were visiting the attraction in Koszalin to celebrate a birthday. This video can not be played Zoltan Kovacs takes you behind the scenes at a Trap escape game Participants are generally locked in a room and must solve a series of puzzles in order to get out. The industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Escape games are thought to have begun in Japan about a decade ago, andone in Hungary, which opened in 2011, is believed to have been the first in Europe. Budapest is one of the world's hubs for the genre, and it is estimated there are around 1,000 in Poland. In the UK, the number of escape rooms soared from just seven in 2013 to more than 1,000 as of last year. The authorities have ordered that all escape rooms around the country now be checked to ensure they meet safety standards. Firefighters inspected nearly 200 facilities across Poland over the weekend. They said more than 100 were found to be unsafe and 13 were immediately shut down. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki vowed on Sunday to close escape rooms that failed to meet safety standards. He also announced a review of more than 1,000 escape rooms or related facilities in Poland to determine whether new regulations were needed. Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski said on Sunday Poland would impose harsh fines and sanctions on business owners whose premises did not comply with health and safety standards. He also urged parents to report potential safety violations at venues. Leaking gas cylinders used to heat the building started a fire in the adjacent waiting room, a prosecutor said. Flames and toxic smoke spread quickly, and firefighters - responding to an emergency call - used specialised equipment to break in, but it was already too late. The teenagers are believed to have died of asphyxiation. Their funerals are due to be held on Thursday. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the fire was an ""appalling tragedy"".

"Theresa May is cautiously hopeful that her telephone diplomacy with EU leaders over the Christmas break could pay off over the next week. After calls with Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister believes there is a growing mood in the EU to help the UK avoid a no-deal Brexit scenario. Nothing is guaranteed, but there is an expectation in Whitehall that if the EU decides to help out, it would make helpful noises on the Northern Ireland backstop on the eve of the parliamentary vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal. The vote is due to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday next week. The offer, if it comes, would be in writing. ""The point is to have something with genuine meaning,"" one Whitehall source says. As things stand, the prime minister is heading for a serious parliamentary defeat because she is confronted by two apparently immovable objects. They are: no appetite in the EU to make substantive changes to the Brexit deal, and opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party to parts of the deal regarding Northern Ireland. But Whitehall is picking up signs of movement in the EU which would, in an ideal world for No 10, persuade the DUP to support the prime minister. Downing St believes the DUP's influence goes way beyond its ten MPs. Officials regard the Unionists as ""dominos"" - get them on board and Brexiteer Tories will start to return to the fold, potentially winning over Labour MPs minded to support the prime minister if she is within shouting distance of victory. The mood is slightly better in Downing St because the prime minister has been left with the clear impression from EU leaders that they are determined to avoid no-deal. One Whitehall source said: ""There is a genuine sense they want to avoid no-deal. How they will help us is the big unanswered question."" The hope is that next Monday or Tuesday - depending on the date of the parliamentary vote - the EU would issue a firm signal that the Northern Ireland backstop would not last indefinitely. Under the backstop, which is designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Northern Ireland would be closely bound into the EU if the UK and the EU fail to agree a comprehensive new relationship by the end of the transition in December 2020. The backstop is described as a temporary arrangement, but the EU is insisting it would last unless and until a replacement trade deal is agreed. PM 'working to get more EU assurances' Brexit 'in danger' unless MPs back deal - PM Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Over the holiday period the prime minister's chief EU negotiator Olly Robbins revived his idea of the UK and the EU setting a firm start date for the UK's future trade relationship with the EU, with December 2021 the strong preference. The UK believes the EU would find this idea easier to agree to than a firm end date to the backstop. If the EU were to make a move then two possible scenarios could play out on the eve of the parliamentary vote: In the event of a strong commitment from the EU, the government could table an amendment to its own parliamentary motion. No 10 would hope that a firm assurance that the backstop would be temporary would be enough to win the vote In the event of a less strong commitment from the EU, a scenario set out over the weekend by the former No 10 director of legislative affairs Nikki da Costa could play out. A backbench amendment could be tabled incorporating the EU offer and mandating the prime minister to seek further legally binding commitments from the EU If any such amendment were passed it could overcome the main difficulty the prime minister experienced at last month's EU summit. Many EU leaders said there was no point in making concessions when they would inevitably be rejected by Parliament. If MPs indicated they were happy with the EU offer but need firmer legal assurances, that could provide the basis for an emergency EU summit to approve the offer. That would be a big step for the EU but there is no other way to provide a commitment with legal force. In the end, the differences between the UK and the EU may prove to be irreconcilable. The EU wants to avoid a no-deal but it is adamant that the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened as long as Theresa May stands by her red lines, most notably on rejecting free movement of people. Brussels will also not agree to any wording that undermines the agreement. The DUP is also highly suspicious of the government and the EU. Their strong opposition hardened when the government's legal advice said that in some circumstances Northern Ireland would have to treat Great Britain as a 'third country' - EU parlance for a foreign country. Until the DUP have assurances that that scenario cannot happen - or at least would have a guarantee that it would only be temporary - it is all but impossible to see them coming on board.

"There is a growing feeling it may take more than one go to get the deal through Parliament When Theresa May pulled the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit last month, the day before MPs were about to pass their verdict on her deal, Downing Street hoped two things would happen. First, that the EU would offer some form of legal guarantee that the Northern Irish backstop - the arrangements for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland - would be temporary. This, in turn, would bring the DUP on board - and unlock further support from previously hostile Conservative backbenchers. Second, that some sceptical MPs, once away from the febrile atmosphere at Westminster, would quietly reflect over Christmas that the deal wasn't as bad as all that, as it at least guarantees that the UK will leave the EU at the end of March. So perhaps any rebellion would diminish, if not evaporate. But neither hope has - yet - been realised, with the vote now less than two weeks away. So as things stand, the prime minister is once again facing defeat. But her difficulties could run even deeper than assumed. It was undoubtedly disappointing for Downing Street that the DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds declared that the Withdrawal Agreement ""flies in the face"" of the government's commitments on Northern Ireland following his meetings with Theresa May and the Conservative chief whip Julian Smith this week. 'No way' DUP will back Brexit deal Varadkar and Merkel 'stand by' Brexit deal No-deal Brexit 'biggest threat' to unis The government quite simply couldn't tell him that that the EU, at this stage, was willing to go any further than offering ""reassurances"" and ""clarifications"" on the temporary nature of the backstop, rather than legal guarantees. But even if the EU does move significantly in the next ten days, the prime minister could still be facing defeat. What the DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday was significant. He said he was ""alarmed"" that the Northern Irish backstop could become the ""settled arrangement"" on Brexit. Let's unpick this for a moment - because it goes to the core of Theresa May's difficulties. The DUP want to make sure the backstop is temporary and that the UK, including Northern Ireland, can exit from it without EU approval. The European Commission has said the deal can't be re-negotiated but the talking continues If the EU can guarantee this, it's possible the DUP's MPs may grit their teeth and back - or abstain on - the deal, as would some long-standing Leave campaigners on the Conservative benches. But, as I understand it, up to 40 Conservative MPs still wouldn't back the deal because they, like Sammy Wilson, are worried about what the ""settled arrangement"" on Brexit might look like. They believe that the way the government will avoid a hard border in Ireland - and avoid triggering the backstop - is by agreeing a permanent trade deal that actually looks a lot like the backstop in any case. That is, the whole of the UK, not just Northern Ireland, would mirror some EU regulations on goods and stay close to the EU's customs arrangements. This would, they fear, then constrain the UK's ability to do future trade deals with the rest of the world. This suspicion is fuelled by the following words in the political declaration document - the blueprint for the post-Brexit relationship with the EU: ""The economic partnership should ensureâ¦.ambitious customs arrangements that.. build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement."" Downing Street officials have pointed out - until they are almost blue in the face - that the political declaration also specifically mentions an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK. But this doesn't appear to have neutralised some backbench concerns. The prime minister will launch a ""charm offensive"" with Conservative MPs next week to try to allay any suspicions - though whether they will be charmed or offended is still an open question. Such is the lack of trust amongst a small but potentially crucial contingent of her MPs, I am told that in order for them to vote for her deal, she would need to convince them that she wouldn't handle the future trade negotiations after Brexit. Despite Chief Whip Julian Smith's efforts, many Tory MPs remained opposed to the deal And/or give them a firm date for her departure from office. Downing Street - and more widely, the government's - tactic is to raise the possibility of No Brexit unless long-standing Leave campaigners hold their noses and vote for her deal. This process has already begun. But expect it to be ramped up next week. The PM's allies will argue that unless the deal is settled soon, then opponents of Brexit and supporters of a new referendum will try to amend forthcoming non-Brexit legislation to make it contingent on a public vote taking place. And MPs who don't want a referendum but do want Theresa May's deal fundamentally renegotiated will be told that would mean extending Article 50 and therefore, in No 10's eyes, breaking faith with leave-supporting voters. So far these arguments don't seem to have worked. Some of her MPs will doubtlessly be poring over a YouGov survey published today. This was commissioned by London's Queen Mary University and Sussex University as part of a wider project into party members' attitudes and views. It suggested more than half of Conservative members - 53% - believe Mrs May's deal doesn't respect the result of the referendum. And 59% of them oppose her deal, while 38% support it. No 10 would argue that there is private polling which suggests her deal is more popular with the wider public. The You Gov survey itself suggests that 46% of likely Conservative voters (as opposed to members) back the deal, with a smaller number - 38% -opposing. There is another potential fly in the ointment for the prime minister - although here, adversity could be turned to advantage. It is assumed that the Lords will insert an amendment in to legislation on trade which would require the prime minister to negotiate a customs union with the EU. Please upgrade your browser The government, in the normal run of things, would then vote this change down when the legislation returns to the Commons. But with Labour formally backing a customs union - and some Conservative MPs who backed Remain in the referendum also very warm to the idea - government sources are concerned that the Commons might not overturn it. So the argument that is likely to be made by government whips to the Brexiteer opponents of Theresa May's deal is this: Unless they grab the prime minister's deal before the trade legislation comes to the Commons, they might be landed with a customs union. And this wouldn't just constrain, but prevent, future independent trade deals. It may look chaotic but one government insider says the key is making steady progress But the most likely option for at least reducing the size of any defeat on the deal is further movement from Brussels. The prime minister is talking the EU Commission President Jean Claude Juncker later and I am told she will be talking to other EU 27 leaders over the next ten days. There is a feeling in Whitehall that it may take more than one attempt to get the deal through parliament. One government insider likened the prime minister's situation to a game of American football. Things can look chaotic at any given moment but as long as you don't give the ball away to your opponents you can move incrementally towards your goal. But she has already had to make one backward pass - delaying the vote on her deal - and may need some trick play to get her deal over the line. As MPs return to parliament next week, the prospect of a prime ministerial victory appears some way off.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" Theresa May has warned the UK faces ""uncharted territory"" if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal as she vowed to redouble her efforts to win MPs round. Next week's vote would ""definitely"" go ahead, she told the BBC, as she promised new safeguards for Northern Ireland and to look at giving MPs more say in shaping future EU negotiations. The UK's March exit was ""in danger"" if MPs did not back the deal, she said. But one Tory Brexiteer said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". And one senior Labour figure said she believed a general election may be inevitable ""within months"" if there was deadlock in Parliament and Mrs May could not get her deal through. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. A deal on the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations has been agreed between the prime minister and the EU - but it needs to pass a vote by MPs in Parliament before it is accepted. MPs are expected to be asked to vote on it on either the 14 or 15 of January. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? The crunch vote was due to take place in December but was postponed at the last minute as Mrs May faced almost certain defeat amid opposition from many of her MPs, as well as Labour and other parties. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the vote would ""definitely"" go ahead in the second week of January, she replied ""yes, we are going to hold the vote"". She said she truly believed hers was a ""good deal"" for the country and that it was up to its opponents to spell out the alternatives to it. This video can not be played Theresa May on Brexit vote timing and her political future Asked what had changed since last month, she said the EU had agreed to some ""changes"" and she was continuing to talk to European leaders as she tried to give MPs the ""confidence"" to support the deal. She promised to give more detail in three areas in the coming days: Specific measures for Northern Ireland A greater role for Parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future UK-EU relations Further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish border backstop She said there were a ""number of ways"" of giving MPs more input in the next phase of the Brexit process, including allowing them a real say in shaping the ""mandate for the negotiations for the future relationship"". Mrs May suggested that if her deal was rejected it would embolden both supporters of a no-deal exit and those who want to remain in the EU via another referendum. Please upgrade your browser ""If the deal is not voted on, then we are going to be in uncharted territory,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone can say what will happen in terms of the reaction we see in Parliament. ""What you have is a Labour leadership... which is opposing any deal to create the greatest chaos possible, people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit and people who want to see their perfect Brexit... the danger there is we end up with no Brexit at all."" Asked whether she was prepared to stand down as PM and let someone else take over talks over the future relations if Tory MPs demanded it, Mrs May - who survived a vote of no confidence last month - said the party had made it clear they wanted her to ""deliver on Brexit and that is what I am working on doing"". However, the DUP, which props up the government, said the fundamental problems with Mrs May's deal had not changed. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic."" The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal, ""If there has been a change it is a hardening of attitudes among MPs to a no deal,"" he told Sophy Ridge, adding that there was increasing evidence that a no deal outcome was ""absolutely OK"". And a succession of other Tory Brexiteers have taken to social media to say ""nothing has changed"" during the Christmas recess and they remain opposed to the deal. Allow Twitter content?

But opponents of a no-deal exit have given notice they are determined to effectively rule the prospect out. A cross-party group of Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem MPs are proposing amending the government's Finance Bill, to be debated on Tuesday, so that ministers would only be able to make tax changes in the event of a no-deal exit if Parliament had explicitly authorised them. Labour MP Yvette Cooper said if the government ""would not rule out no deal, Parliament must act"". As part of the government's preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the company Seaborne Freight had been given a contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal.

By political correspondent Nick Eardley A new year is about to start at Westminster, but the political battleground feels very familiar. The PM's message hasn't changed. She still thinks her deal is only one that delivers and rejecting it would lead to uncharted territory. That's a warning to both sides; those who want another referendum could end up with no deal; those who want no deal could end up with no Brexit at all. Her critics, though, don't appear to have had any New Year changes of heart either. The DUP and many Tories are still unhappy and as things stand won't back her. Theresa May is promising to try and win more reassurances from Brussels. But for now it remains hard to see what she could secure that would win enough support for her to win the meaningful vote. This video can not be played Jon Ashworth: ""We're not enabling Brexit. This country had a referendum"" A poll of more than 25,000 Britons published on Sunday suggests Labour would be punished by voters if the party either ends up backing the government's deal or does not actively oppose it. The YouGov poll, carried out for the People's Vote campaign which is demanding another referendum, suggests 75% of Labour supporters would prefer a final say on Brexit. But the Labour leadership rejected claims that they were ""enabling"" Brexit by refusing, at this stage, to explicitly call for another referendum. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the People's Vote campaign should focus on ""changing people's minds"" about whether to stay in the EU rather ""smacking Labour around the head"". She told the BBC that Labour's focus was getting into power in a general election she now expected to take place ""within months"" ""If you are a government that does not have the support of Parliament and does not have the support of the people, you cannot drive us over a cliff and think you are going to get away with it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""Our democracy is about whether you have the permission of the public and... whether you can justify what you are doing to our country."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said another referendum was the ""least worst option"", but he added that ""it was going to be very messy whatever happens"".

"This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise An exercise to test plans for border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as ""too little too late"" by hauliers. A convoy of 89 lorries took part in two test runs from the disused Manston Airport, near Ramsgate in Kent, on a 20-mile route to the Port of Dover. The Department for Transport said they went well and traffic ran smoothly. But the Road Haulage Association said the process should have begun months earlier. Its chief executive Richard Burnett said the trial ""cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks that would be held at Manston Airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""It's too little too late, this process should have started nine months ago,"" he added. ""At this late stage it looks like window dressing."" Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, also questioned the usefulness of the test. ""We've got to remember 10,000 lorries visit the Channel ports every single day so a test with less than 100 is not even a drop in the ocean,"" he said. ""Sending lorries around Kent on a wild goose chase all the way to Manston in the extreme north-east corner and then sending them to the Port of Dover by a small A road is not the right answer."" But Toby Howe, from Kent County Council, said: ""What we're learning from this is not based on 1,000 lorries or whatever. ""What we want to know is how quickly they can actually get out of the airport behind us and how quickly they will get to the various points on the stage. ""So whether it's 10 lorries, 20 lorries, 100 lorries, that will give us enough information and will give the Department for Transport enough information to then learn from that."" The lorries began the 20-mile journey at 08:00 GMT Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial, known as Operation Brock, to test the airport site's suitability as a mass HGV holding bay. The drivers congregated in a large group at the former airfield before being directed by officials from the Department for Transport (DfT), Kent County Council and police officers along the A256 towards Dover. The first practice run began in rush-hour shortly after 08:00 GMT, with four convoys leaving at intervals between 08:13 and 08:39. The first of the convoys arrived in Dover at 08:52 where they were directed to do a loop around the Eastern Docks roundabout, travel along Jubilee Way and drive straight back to the airport. A second test run got under way at 11:00. One lorry driver said he felt the exercise had been ""a waste of time"" Lorry drivers who spoke to the BBC on arrival back at Manston after the first test said there had been ""no problems whatsoever"". However, one driver said he thought it had been ""a waste of time"". ""Someone had to do it didn't they, really? But at the end of the day what will be, will be,"" he said. Ramsgate 'not ready' for Brexit ferries 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Another driver, Ben Pearce, said the test ""seems to be going quite well"". He added: ""It will give them a fair idea how the traffic will behave if they do use the space as a holding bay."" Each driver taking part in the exercise was paid Â£550, the DfT said. The lorries left the disused airport in smaller batches Operation Brock was intended to maintain traffic flow on the M20and prevent the kind of disruption experienced in 2015when parts of the motorway were closed to cars for several days. The trial was organised alongside the Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association. Some people on social media also question the usefulness of the trial.

"More consultations will take place at GP surgeries We have been waiting a long time for the 10-year plan for the NHS in England. Will it have a real impact? The answer has to be yes if the NHS is to have a sustainable future. Much of the thinking is driven by the need to treat more patients in their local communities or at home. Put simply, given that people are living longer and, as they do so, developing more chronic health problems, hospitals will be overrun unless there is more care on offer elsewhere. The burden on the health service caused by obesity looms large. That is why an increasing share of NHS resources in England will be directed to GP and community health services. Local schemes which have successfully joined up health and social care provision will be rolled out across England. NHS long-term plan: Focus on prevention 'could save 500,000 lives' NHS 10-year plan: Labour attacks Theresa May over proposals Six key questions Brexit poses for the NHS NHS Tracker: How do your local services perform? Prevention of ill health and quicker disease diagnosis are also central to the drive to keep people out of hospitals where appropriate. In another sense this plan is different from its predecessor. In 2014, the chief executive of NHS England Simon Stevens set out his aims in a document named the Five Year Forward View. It was a pithy statement of the problems with a strategic vision - but it did not set out detailed plans or commitments. By contrast, the latest plan is littered with specific pledges. Among the most eye-catching are: Increased early detection of cancer through better testing and giving every child diagnosed with cancer a comprehensive DNA test to determine the best way to target treatment. Making mental health help available to 345,000 more children and young people through community services and schools in England. Hospital out-patient appointments - which are often difficult to attend, and regularly missed - to be reduced in favour of phone or screen-based consultations for patients at home, and consultants going out to GP surgeries, rather than expecting patients to come to them. Ministers seem to have realised that grand strategy does not cut much ice with patients who simply want to know how treatment of their conditions will improve. Instead, the new plan majors on what Whitehall sources call ""retail offers"". Many of the pledges, though, are over the next decade and it is not clear yet how progress will be checked. NHS leaders have called for new legislation to allow some of their proposed changes to go ahead. This marks a symbolic break with the controversial health reforms of 2012 drawn up by the then-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley. The Lansley reforms gave more powers to local commissioning groups allowing more tendering with outside organisations for contracts. It's understood NHS England wants legislation to allow local health and care groups to work more closely together. It argues that force of law would significantly accelerate progress on service integration, on administrative efficiency, and on public accountability. But will the government find the legislative time to get changes through Parliament? Big unanswered questions remain. Does the NHS have the workforce to cope with rising demand and see through service changes?  Ministers and NHS leaders point to plans for training of more nurses and extra medical school places.  But the current 100,000 NHS vacancies in England underline the scale of the challenge. Is the new funding allocated by the government going to be sufficient to deliver all the new commitments, as well as keep up with patient demand?  The 3.4% real terms annual increases in funding for the next five years are no more than the long term average for the NHS, albeit more than under the coalition and Conservative governments. Significant efficiency savings will need to be made to free up resources to invest in the transformation of services. Then there is the thorny issue of targets. Simon Stevens has made clear he wants to amend the main A&E target of 95% of patients being admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. He and some medical leaders want to see different benchmarks for major and minor injuries. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is a fan of harnessing the power of technology Some doctors feel that would be a mistake and it may prove politically difficult with accusations that the goalposts are being shifted. The final tricky decision will rest with ministers. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will gain extra funding  through the usual formula but the devolved administrations will decide how it is spent. Around the UK there are the same challenges - an ageing population with sicker patients and finite resources. Wales drew up its long plan last year. Now NHS England has done the same.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" Theresa May has warned the UK faces ""uncharted territory"" if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal as she vowed to redouble her efforts to win MPs round. Next week's vote would ""definitely"" go ahead, she told the BBC, as she promised new safeguards for Northern Ireland and to look at giving MPs more say in shaping future EU negotiations. The UK's March exit was ""in danger"" if MPs did not back the deal, she said. But one Tory Brexiteer said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". And one senior Labour figure said she believed a general election may be inevitable ""within months"" if there was deadlock in Parliament and Mrs May could not get her deal through. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. A deal on the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations has been agreed between the prime minister and the EU - but it needs to pass a vote by MPs in Parliament before it is accepted. MPs are expected to be asked to vote on it on either the 14 or 15 of January. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? The crunch vote was due to take place in December but was postponed at the last minute as Mrs May faced almost certain defeat amid opposition from many of her MPs, as well as Labour and other parties. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr if the vote would ""definitely"" go ahead in the second week of January, she replied ""yes, we are going to hold the vote"". She said she truly believed hers was a ""good deal"" for the country and that it was up to its opponents to spell out the alternatives to it. This video can not be played Theresa May on Brexit vote timing and her political future Asked what had changed since last month, she said the EU had agreed to some ""changes"" and she was continuing to talk to European leaders as she tried to give MPs the ""confidence"" to support the deal. She promised to give more detail in three areas in the coming days: Specific measures for Northern Ireland A greater role for Parliament in negotiations on the next stage of future UK-EU relations Further assurances from the EU to address concerns over the Irish border backstop She said there were a ""number of ways"" of giving MPs more input in the next phase of the Brexit process, including allowing them a real say in shaping the ""mandate for the negotiations for the future relationship"". Mrs May suggested that if her deal was rejected it would embolden both supporters of a no-deal exit and those who want to remain in the EU via another referendum. Please upgrade your browser ""If the deal is not voted on, then we are going to be in uncharted territory,"" she said. ""I don't think anyone can say what will happen in terms of the reaction we see in Parliament. ""What you have is a Labour leadership... which is opposing any deal to create the greatest chaos possible, people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit and people who want to see their perfect Brexit... the danger there is we end up with no Brexit at all."" Asked whether she was prepared to stand down as PM and let someone else take over talks over the future relations if Tory MPs demanded it, Mrs May - who survived a vote of no confidence last month - said the party had made it clear they wanted her to ""deliver on Brexit and that is what I am working on doing"". However, the DUP, which props up the government, said the fundamental problems with Mrs May's deal had not changed. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""The backstop remains the poison which makes any vote for the withdrawal agreement so toxic."" The backstop is a position of last resort, to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal, ""If there has been a change it is a hardening of attitudes among MPs to a no deal,"" he told Sophy Ridge, adding that there was increasing evidence that a no deal outcome was ""absolutely OK"". And a succession of other Tory Brexiteers have taken to social media to say ""nothing has changed"" during the Christmas recess and they remain opposed to the deal. Allow Twitter content?

But opponents of a no-deal exit have given notice they are determined to effectively rule the prospect out. A cross-party group of Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem MPs are proposing amending the government's Finance Bill, to be debated on Tuesday, so that ministers would only be able to make tax changes in the event of a no-deal exit if Parliament had explicitly authorised them. Labour MP Yvette Cooper said if the government ""would not rule out no deal, Parliament must act"". As part of the government's preparations for a no-deal Brexit, the company Seaborne Freight had been given a contract to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. However the councillor for the harbour area has saidthe Port of Ramsgate ""cannot be ready"" for extra ferry services should a no-deal Brexit happen. Allow Twitter content?

By political correspondent Nick Eardley A new year is about to start at Westminster, but the political battleground feels very familiar. The PM's message hasn't changed. She still thinks her deal is only one that delivers and rejecting it would lead to uncharted territory. That's a warning to both sides; those who want another referendum could end up with no deal; those who want no deal could end up with no Brexit at all. Her critics, though, don't appear to have had any New Year changes of heart either. The DUP and many Tories are still unhappy and as things stand won't back her. Theresa May is promising to try and win more reassurances from Brussels. But for now it remains hard to see what she could secure that would win enough support for her to win the meaningful vote. This video can not be played Jon Ashworth: ""We're not enabling Brexit. This country had a referendum"" A poll of more than 25,000 Britons published on Sunday suggests Labour would be punished by voters if the party either ends up backing the government's deal or does not actively oppose it. The YouGov poll, carried out for the People's Vote campaign which is demanding another referendum, suggests 75% of Labour supporters would prefer a final say on Brexit. But the Labour leadership rejected claims that they were ""enabling"" Brexit by refusing, at this stage, to explicitly call for another referendum. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said the People's Vote campaign should focus on ""changing people's minds"" about whether to stay in the EU rather ""smacking Labour around the head"". She told the BBC that Labour's focus was getting into power in a general election she now expected to take place ""within months"" ""If you are a government that does not have the support of Parliament and does not have the support of the people, you cannot drive us over a cliff and think you are going to get away with it,"" she told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""Our democracy is about whether you have the permission of the public and... whether you can justify what you are doing to our country."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said another referendum was the ""least worst option"", but he added that ""it was going to be very messy whatever happens"".

"Improvements to mental health support and maternity care are included in the plans to be announced by the PM The government's 10-year plan for the NHS lacks both the staffing and funding to succeed, Labour has said. The PM has promised the publication of the plan on Monday will lead to ""world class"" care for patients in England. Pledges on maternity care, mental health, elderly support and earlier detection and prevention of diseases will be included in the plan. But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mrs May was just trying to ""clear up a mess that she has made"". Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Ashworth said: ""The funding isn't sufficient and the staffing isn't there."" He added the NHS ""doesn't need 10 more years of the Tories, it needs a Labour government"". However, Mrs May said that,coupled with the extra money announced last summer, the plan secured the future of the NHS. The budget is due to rise by Â£20bn a year above inflation by 2023, though a detailed explanation of where that money will come from has not yet been provided. Smokers in hospital to be helped to quit Six things to look out for in health in 2019 The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time Health Secretary Matt Hancock, meanwhile, admitted the health service was short staffed but said work was being done to solve the problem. He told BBC News there were ""still lots of people"" trying to become nurses in the UK and that there was a ""record number of GPs in training"".  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. A day before publication of the 10-year plan, the prime minister said the proposals marked ""a historic step"" to secure the future of the NHS, adding there was a focus on ""ensuring that every pound is spent in a way that will most benefit patients"". ""This will help relieve pressure on the NHS while providing the basis to transform care with world-class treatments,"" she said. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show why the NHS was failing to hit key waiting time targets, Mrs May blamed an increased in demand on health services. The 10-year plan, she added, was ""crucial"" for ensuring the ""sustainability"" of the NHS. Speaking to the BBC in June, Mrs May suggested funding for the plan would come from a combination of taxes and the so-called ""Brexit dividend"". However, during the summer, Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England but Mrs May said the other UK nations will be drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The full details are not being unveiled until Monday when it will be released by NHS England. But Mrs May has outlined some of the key focuses. These include: Better mental health care, including round-the-clock advice from NHS 111 by 2023 and tailored services for young adults.  Currently once someone in care turns 18 they are thrust into the adult system, often when they are not ready Providing the best maternity care in the world by improving safety and providing greater mental health support for new parents. One in five new mothers struggles with mental health in the first year of her baby's life Greater control and choice in old age by expanding the use of personal budgets to allow people to decide what care they want, and greater support in the community so people do not end up in hospital Better prevention and detection of disease - cancer is expected to be a key focus with an ambition to increase the number of early detections from one in two cancers to three in four, which in turn will improve survival Increases in the NHS workforce - currently one in 11 posts is vacant Bringing the NHS into the digital age, including online GP booking, prescriptions management and health records The plan was promised during the summer when the government unveiled its funding settlement for the NHS. That set out the budget for the next five years and means by 2023 funding for the NHS will be Â£20bn a year more than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. That is the equivalent of annual ""real terms"" rises of close to 3.5% - about twice what the NHS has got since 2010. NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been in charge of drawing up the plan At the time, the prime minister said she wanted to ensure the money was used wisely and so asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to draw up a long-term plan for the next decade. It was expected to be published in the autumn, but was delayed because of the government's troubles getting its Brexit plans agreed. The last time such a long-term vision was set out was in 2000 under Tony Blair. Understandably people want to see the full details before coming to firm conclusions. But the priority areas are being welcomed. Andy Bell, of the Centre for Mental Health, said the initiatives on mental health were much needed. He said: ""For too many young people, mental health support is offered too late, with too many restrictions and then they are forced to start again when they reach 18."" Mental health care is one of the priority areas Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses shared the ambitions being set out. But she added the government needed to ""urgently address"" the staffing shortages if it was going to succeed. And Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation think-tank, predicted fulfilling the pledges would be ""extremely tough"" because of the scale of staffing shortages, rising pressures and cuts to other parts of the wider health and care system. The Â£20bn promise just relates to the front-line NHS budget and so does not cover other elements such as social care and public health - at the end of last year it was announced the budget for these services, which includes smoking cessation and weight management, was being cut by over 4% in real terms next year. Ms Dixon said: ""Trade-offs are inevitable and these must be spelled out clearly so the public know what they can expect from the NHS."" There has been a fair bit of tension behind the scenes. The Treasury is understood to have wanted to tie the NHS down in terms of what it will achieve. One of the central bones of contention is thought to be how the NHS can tackle deficits and waiting times. Hospitals are struggling to balance their books and have seen a deterioration in the time patients wait in A&E, for cancer and for routine operations. None of these three key waiting time targets are currently being met. The NHS is missing its key waiting time targets It looks like a trajectory for improvement will be published at a later date with NHS bosses known to have been wary about promising things they felt they could not deliver. Another missing piece is the green paper on social care. This was first promised in 2017, but has been delayed on a number of occasions. Brexit has certainly been a factor, but again there has been disagreements in private, this time over how radical the plan should be given the problems facing the sector, which covers care homes and home help. The government has promised the green paper will be published as soon as possible.

"Smokers and problem drinkers who are admitted to hospital in England will be given help to quit or cut down, to reduce demands on the health service. The measures are part of along-term planto be announced over the next few days by NHS England. It said addiction to alcohol and tobacco were two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death. And the right support could save lives and help people stay fitter for longer. Health charity Ash said it was delighted by the plans and Public Health England called the move ""smart"", saying it would save thousands of lives and help the NHS survive into the future. Alcohol-related harm costs the NHS in England around Â£3.5bn each year - admissions to hospitals have increased by 17% in the past decade to just over 2% of the total number. But the use of specialist Alcohol Care Teams has seen a significant reduction in A&E attendances, ambulance callouts and readmissions. The teams offer specialist help to patients on how to give up drinking and support to stay off it, which includes written advice, as well as counselling. That scheme is already running in Bolton, Salford, Nottingham, Liverpool, London and Portsmouth. Pregnant women who smoke will be given help to quit It will now be expanded to 50 hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions across the country. And every smoker admitted to hospital - around half a million people a year - will be offered specialised support to quit. This includes pregnant women and their partners. Recent figures show that 10% of women in England are still smoking when their baby is born, which can double the risk of stillbirth and increase the risk of miscarriage. Areas of particular need, such as Blackpool where one in five pregnant women smokes, will be given priority over the next five years, NHS England says. Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive, said: ""Drinking to excess can destroy families, with the NHS too often left to pick up the pieces. ""Alcohol and tobacco addiction remain two of the biggest causes of ill health and early death, and the right support can save lives."" He said the long-term plan delivered a ""sea change in care for a range of major conditions"" like cancer, mental ill health and heart disease. And he said it gave patients ""the support they need to take greater control of their own health and stay fitter longer"". The Royal College of Physicians said many patients only come to the attention of the NHS during their first stay in hospital. ""Every contact a health professional has with a patient is an opportunity to help the patient give up smoking - having a system in place to treat tobacco dependency with allocated funding will help make it happen. ""The focus on the management of alcohol-related disease is also very welcome. ""We mustn't forget prevention though and further measures to reduce harmful drinking are much needed."" Smokers' campaign group Forest criticised the NHS initiative as being ""tantamount to bullying"". Its director, Simon Clark, said: ""It's stressful enough being in hospital without the additional pressure of being hounded to stop smoking. ""Pressuring smokers to quit, especially if they're in hospital for a non smoking-related reason, is an invasion of privacy."" What will the NHS 10-year plan look like?

"The PM has said she is trying to get further assurances from the European Union so she can win the Commons vote on her Brexit deal next week. Theresa May said that after delaying the vote last month, there was ""some further movement from the EU"" at December's European Council. But Labour accused ministers of trying to ""run down the clock"" to ""blackmail"" the UK into backing a ""botched deal"". Labour sources say they will back moves by MPs to frustrate a no-deal exit. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Nick Watt: Is EU about to rescue May? More than 200 MPs have signed a letter to Mrs May, urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit - which is one where the UK leaves the EU but without any agreed arrangements covering things like how trade or travel will work in the future. Labour sourcestold the Guardian,externalthat the party would back a cross-party amendment, to be debated on Tuesday, which would stop the government from taking economic measures arising from a no-deal, including raising taxes, unless Parliament had ""explicitly"" agreed to leave without a deal. It comes asa major exercise involving more than 100 lorrieshas been carried out in Kent to test out how to manage traffic queues near the Channel ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister has been hosting critics of her deal, including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and former leader Iain Duncan Smith, at a reception in Downing Street - the first of a series of events for Tory MPs this week. Her deal - which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has already been agreed with EU leaders. But it needs to pass a vote by MPs before it is accepted. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? Mrs May,who earlier on Monday was at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool to launch a 10-year plan for the NHS, said that after delaying the vote on her Brexit deal last month, there had been ""some further movement from the EU"" and she continued to speak to European leaders. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn to Theresa May: ""No more hiding, and no more running away"" ""In the coming days what we'll set out is not just about the EU but also about what we can do domestically, so we will be setting out measures which will be specific to Northern Ireland; we will be setting out proposals for a greater role for Parliament as we move into the next stage of negotiations,"" she said. ""And we're continuing to work on further assurances, on further undertakings from the European Union in relation to the concern that's been expressed by Parliamentarians."" But the EU Commission said there would be no renegotiation. A spokesman said ""everything on the table has been approved and... the priority now is to await events"" in the UK. Responding to an urgent question from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who asked for an update on progress made in achieving legal changes to the withdrawal agreement, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said the Commons debate would begin on Wednesday. He said Mrs May had been in contact with ""a number of her EU counterparts"" over Christmas and said ministers ""will be clear on Wednesday"" what developments have been made. ""Securing the additional reassurance that Parliament needs remains our priority,"" he told MPs. ""It's a good deal, it's the only deal, and I believe it is the right deal in offering certainty for this country."" This video can not be played Margot James tells the BBC the UK ""might have to extend Article 50â, but would not give a timescale. But Mr Corbyn called Mrs May's deal a ""Frankenstein monster of a deal"". ""The government is trying to run down the clock in an attempt to blackmail this House and the country into supporting a botched deal,"" he said. ""We're now told, if we don't support it, the government is prepared to push our whole economy off a cliff edge."" Government sources have told the BBC the vote on the deal - which will come at the end of five days of debate - is set for Tuesday, 15 January, assuming MPs agree to sit this Friday. This video can not be played Emily Thornberry on no-deal letter: âIt is supported by the Treasury front bench, our front bench, so I suspect we will be signing it.â The prime minister's deal is facing opposition from many of her own MPs, as well as Labour and other opposition parties including the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats. The DUP - which Mrs May's Conservative Party relies on for a majority in Parliament - has said it will not back the deal. But Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng dismissed suggestions that the government had accepted it would lose next week's vote and was planning on returning to Brussels. ""The plan is to win the vote,"" Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that a week was ""a very long time in politics"" and he was ""very hopeful"" the deal would be voted through. A really simple guide to Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Fellow minister Margot James also urged MPs to back the deal but warned, if they could not reach agreement, Brexit might have to be delayed to allow for more negotiations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. ""We have very little time left,"" she told the BBC's Politics Live. ""We might have to extend Article 50. But I think it's very unlikely Parliament will actually stare down the barrel of that particular gun."" By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg One source joked to me that I could just re-open my notebook from the last day before the Christmas break and carry on as if the past fortnight hadn't happened. The prime minister is still pushing for extra promises from the EU about making the controversial Irish backstop temporary and a bigger role for Parliament and potentially for the Northern Ireland Assembly (which, remember, hasn't sat for a very long time now). But there is precious little sign of anything that might be described as hefty enough to convince scores of MPs to change their minds and swing in behind her deal. It is likely that something will emerge, a form of words, a stronger commitment to the hoped for start date for the long-term trade deal perhaps. But the EU is in no mood for something big that could reopen the withdrawal agreement.

"MPs will vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, 15 January, government sources have confirmed. The Commons vote was called off last month by the PM, who was facing defeat, but sources have told the BBC the vote will not be delayed again. It is also understood the government will set out further reassurances on the controversial backstop. Meanwhile, more than 200 MPs have signed a letter to Theresa May, urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. It comes asa major exercise involving more than 100 lorriesis being carried out in Kent to test out how to manage traffic queues near the Channel ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ThePM's deal- which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has already been agreed with EU leaders. But it needs to pass a vote by MPs before it is accepted. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 whether the deal is passed by MPs or not. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Mrs May's deal is facing opposition from many of her own MPs, as well as Labour and other opposition parties including the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats. The DUP - which Mrs May's Conservative Party relies on for a majority in Parliament -has saidit will not back the deal. But Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng dismissed suggestions that the government had accepted it would lose next week's vote and was planning on returning to Brussels. ""The plan is to win the vote on Tuesday, or whenever it comes,"" Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said a week was ""a very long time in politics"" and he was ""very hopeful"" the deal would be voted through. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said reassurances on the Irish backstop were likely to include proposals to minimise any regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Plans to give Stormont a role in deciding whether the backstop should come into force were also likely. There could be further possible safeguards for Parliament, with MPs perhaps being given a vote before the UK enters the backstop and the right to notify Brussels of the UK's intention to quit the backstop within a specified time period, our correspondent added. Government sources also said they hope to set out further reassurances from the EU that the backstop is only temporary. Meanwhile,writing in Daily Telegraph,,externalex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the option of leaving the EU with no deal is ""closest to what people actually voted for"" in the 2016 EU referendum. And Tory MP Damian Green - also an ex-cabinet minister - said the onus was on the MPs to say what deal they would support. Tory Dame Caroline Spelman, who organised the MPs' letter with Labour MP Jack Dromey, said ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal would cause job losses. Dame Caroline - a Remain supporter who was environment secretary for two years when David Cameron was prime minister - told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme that 209 MPs had signed the letter. Asked if the prime minister ""gets it"", Dame Caroline said: ""Yes, I definitely think she gets it. She wouldn't have invited us to come in and see her if she didn't."" Dame Caroline said the signatories to her letter included Brexit and Remain supporters - but the letter did not bind them to supporting the PM's withdrawal deal. This video can not be played Dame Caroline Spelman says 209 MPs have signed a letter urging the prime minister to rule out a 'no deal' Brexit Instead, Dame Caroline said, it creates a ""platform"" which would ""stabilise the economy and give reassurance to manufacturing"". ""We are united on one thing - we want to protect jobs and livelihoods by making sure we don't crash out without a deal,"" she said. The MPs have been invited to meet the prime minister on Tuesday. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for, and some are actively calling for Britain to leave with no deal. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would automatically fall back on World Trade Organization rules - which would apply automatically to trade between the UK and EU. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Writing inthe Telegraph,externalon Monday, Brexiteer Mr Johnson said of all the options suggested, the no-deal option is ""gaining in popularity"" and dismissed the warnings against it which he said were ""downright apocalyptic"". Boris Johnson said Leave voters ""didn't vote for anything like Theresa May's withdrawal agreement"" Mr Johnson said he wants Mrs May to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement, ""to give real legal protection to the UK"". ""Failing that, we should approach the challenge of leaving on WTO terms in a way that is realistic and sensible,"" he said. On Sunday, Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal - which would be ""absolutely OK"". He said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". But speaking on Sunday,Mrs May warnedthat if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal, the country faces ""uncharted territory"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" The UK's exit in March was ""in danger"" if MPs did not vote for it, she added. As well as the invite to all signatories of the letter to Downing Street, Mrs May has also invited all Tory MPs to drinks receptions on Monday and Wednesday.

"The Gabonese president has been out of the country for two months The political situation in Gabon is ""under control"" following an attempted military coup, a spokesman for the government has said. All five of the rebels who tried to take charge have now been arrested by the authorities. The junior officers claimed they seized power ""to restore democracy"" in oil-rich Gabon, where the ailing leader's family has ruled for 50 years. Tanks and armoured vehicles could be seen in the capital Libreville. One of the rebels was on the run for a brief period, before being found hiding under a bed,reports Radio France Internationale.,external ""The situation is calm. The gendarmes who are often stationed there have taken control of the entire area around the radio and TV headquarters, so everything is back to normal"", said Guy-Bertrand Mapangou. a government spokesman. Latest updates From playboy prince to Gabon's president Gabon country profile Mr Mapangou said that the army generals, civil society and opposition leaders mentioned in the rebels' statement as potential supporters would be investigated. Current leader Ali Bongo succeeded his father Omar Bongo as president in 2009. He narrowly won re-election in 2016 in a poll marred by violence and accusations of fraud. The five soldiers took control of the national radio station at 04:30 local time (03:30 GMT) to read a short statement announcing a ""National Restoration Council"". In a video circulating on social media, three young soldiers can be seen in a radio studio wearing military fatigues and holding guns. How can you tell a coup is happening? Lt Kelly Ondo Obiang, who said he represented a group called the Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon, specifically appealed to young people to ""take charge of their destiny"". Soldiers announced they had seized power on state television The insurgents called on soldiers to take control of the transport system, ammunition reserves and airports ""in the interests of the nation"". The BBC's Firmain Eric Mbadinga said the coup attempt came as a huge surprise. The army has always been seen as loyal to the Bongo family, he said, because it is dominated by the presidential guard, who mostly come from Mr Bongo's home region. Most of the capital remains calm, an eyewitness told the Reuters news agency. The French government and the African Union condemned the attempted coup. Compared to many other African states, the former French colony has seen much less political turmoil, and has had just three presidents since 1960 Former ruler Omar Bongo dominated Gabonese politics for almost four decades, crushing dissent It is a major oil producer but one third of its people live in poverty It has a population of 1.8 million people, with an average life expectancy of 62 years. The youth unemployment rate is around 35% The country's national symbol is the black panther The president's term in office has been overshadowed by a long-running French investigation into allegations of embezzlement involving the Bongo family's assets. Mr Bongo, who has been out of the country for two months, reportedly suffered a stroke in October and received treatment in Morocco. He sought to put an end to the rumours about his health with a televised new year message in which he said he was feeling fine. Soldiers said they had been disappointed by the message, calling it ""a pitiful sight"" and a ""relentless attempt to cling onto power."" Mr Bongo has been criticised over his prominent role in the Freemasons- an organisation whose Gabonese chapter he led as lodge master. But his supporters point to his role in attempting to diversify Gabon's oil-dependent economy, in the face of declining oil reserves. President Trump has deployed soldiers to Gabon to protect US citizens amid fears of violent protests in the nearby Democratic Republic of Congo following its presidential election.

"Katie Price appeared at Bromley Magistrates' Court charged with being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle Reality TV star Katie Price has denied being almost twice the legal alcohol limit while in charge of a vehicle. The 40-year-old was arrested by police who found a damaged Range Rover at the roadside on Shooters Hill Road, Greenwich, at about 02:00 GMT on 10 October last year. Ms Price, of Horsham, Sussex, was in the vehicle and had 69 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, Bromley Magistrates' Court heard. The legal limit is 35 micrograms. The court heard a man in a nearby block of flats concluded an ""accident of some sort"" had occurred involving his parked black car, which had pink paint on when he later inspected it. CCTV footage appeared to show the Range Rover was in the vicinity of his vehicle, District Judge Nigel Dean told the court. Judge Dean said Ms Price will rely on the defence that ""there was no likelihood of driving while the level of alcohol exceeded the proscribed limit"". At the hearing, Ms Price spoke only to deny the charge and give her name, address and date of birth. Ms Price was bailed to attend Bexley Magistrates' Court on 25 February, when her trial will start.

"Three men were found by Border Force in Lydd, three miles from Dungeness Eight migrants have been found following a search when an empty dinghy was found on a Kent beach. Seven men have been detained by Border Force and one has been taken to hospital for treatment. A ninth man, detained in the area, has been arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal entry into the UK. The BBC understands one group of migrants was discovered by Border Force on a road near the beach in Dungeness, while three were detained in Lydd. The Home Office said: ""The incident is currently being investigated by officers from Immigration Enforcement's criminal and financial investigation team."" HM Coastguard led an initial search of the area when the empty boat was discovered on the shore in Dungeness at around 08:00 GMT. It contained six life jackets, personal possessions and a milk carton cut to be used to bail out water. The empty boat contained six life jackets The coastguard said it carried out the search due to ""concern there could be maritime casualties"" but none had been found. The search was ""stood down"" and handed over to Border Force, a spokeswoman said. South East Coast Ambulance Service said it was called to Dungeness Road at 12:20 GMT after ""reports a number of people needed medical assessment having come off a boat"". ""One person was taken to hospital for further treatment,"" a spokesman said. At least 247 people are known to have reached the UK in small boats since November,including 12 who landed on the beach at Greatstone last week. The men were detained by the side of the road in Lydd Home SecretarySajid Javid declared a ""major incident""over the rising number of migrants trying to cross the Channel to reach the UK.

"Household debt in the UK has hit a fresh high, totalling Â£428bn, according to an analysis by the TUC. Excluding mortgages, average debt per household rose sharply in 2018 to a new peak of Â£15,385, up Â£886 in a year, the research says. The TUC says government austerity and years of wage stagnation are to blame. But the TUC's figures include student loans, while Bank of England figures, excluding student loans, give a debt total of half the TUC's estimate. The Bank of England says growth in consumer credit has been gradually slowing since the end of 2016. The TUC arrived at its figure for unsecured debt by adding up the total amount owed in bank overdrafts, personal loans, store cards, payday loans and outstanding credit card debts, as well as student loans. Unsecured debt as a share of household income had now reached 30.4%, the highest it had ever been, the TUC said. It added that millions of households were now reliant on borrowing to get by, with working families on average worse off than before the financial crisis. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Household debt is at crisis level. Years of austerity and wage stagnation has pushed millions of families deep into the red. She said the government was ""skating on thin ice by relying on household debt to drive growth"", adding: ""Our economy is not working for workers. They need stronger rights and bargaining powers."" The TUC also called for an increase in minimum wage levels to Â£10 an hour ""as quickly as possible"". The National Living Wage for workers aged 25 and over is currently Â£7.83 an hour and is due to rise to Â£8.21 in April. How much debt do UK households have?

"Bluebottles (Physalia utriculus) have painful stings Vast numbers of bluebottle sea creatures have been pushed ashore in Queensland, Australia, stinging thousands of people and forcing the closure of swim spots. Surf Life Saving Queensland said over 2,600 people received treatment at the weekend. Bluebottle stings are painful but typically not life-threatening. Unusually strong winds pushed colonies of the creatures towards beaches. About 13,000 stings were recorded in the past week. That's three times more than in the corresponding period last year. Most incidents took place in Queensland's heavily populated Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast regions. Bluebottle (Physalia utriculus) colonies appear like blue-tinged sacs which measure up to 15cm (6 inches) long. People can be stung in the water or on sand. The bluebottle is also referred to as the Indo-Pacific Portuguese man o' war and is a related, but distinct species to those found around the Atlantic. They are not ""true"" jellyfish, but belong to a group of organisms known as siphonophores. The stings are typically mild and can be treated with ice or hot water, however some people had required treatment by paramedics at the weekend, Surf Life Saving Queensland (SLSQ) said. The number of those cases was not recorded. The activity forced the closure of busy beaches. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bluebottles are often seen on Australia's east coast during summer. But a SLSQ spokesman described the latest influx as an ""epidemic"", while some local media outlets labelled it an ""invasion"". Dr Lisa-Ann Gershwin, an expert from Australian Marine Stinger Advisory Services, agreed it was unusual to see gatherings in such numbers. She said ""a really weird run"" of strong winds and heat spells had brought bluebottles and other species closer to shore. Jellyfish 'mega swarm' in UK Blubber jellyfish wash up 'like wallpaper' in Australia How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay But she added that given those unusual weather conditions, the number of bluebottles should be considered ""not abnormal"". The species is most commonly found in deeper seas, but can be moved easily because it has a ""sail"" crest on its back. ""A bluebottle has that sail that sticks up - so the wind grabs the sail and drives them ashore,"" Dr Gershwin told the BBC.

"MPs will vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, 15 January, government sources have confirmed. The Commons vote was called off last month by the PM, who was facing defeat, but sources have told the BBC the vote will not be delayed again. It is also understood the government will set out further reassurances on the controversial backstop. Meanwhile, more than 200 MPs have signed a letter to Theresa May, urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. It comes asa major exercise involving more than 100 lorriesis being carried out in Kent to test out how to manage traffic queues near the Channel ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ThePM's deal- which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has already been agreed with EU leaders. But it needs to pass a vote by MPs before it is accepted. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 whether the deal is passed by MPs or not. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Mrs May's deal is facing opposition from many of her own MPs, as well as Labour and other opposition parties including the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats. The DUP - which Mrs May's Conservative Party relies on for a majority in Parliament -has saidit will not back the deal. But Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng dismissed suggestions that the government had accepted it would lose next week's vote and was planning on returning to Brussels. ""The plan is to win the vote on Tuesday, or whenever it comes,"" Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said a week was ""a very long time in politics"" and he was ""very hopeful"" the deal would be voted through. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said reassurances on the Irish backstop were likely to include proposals to minimise any regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Plans to give Stormont a role in deciding whether the backstop should come into force were also likely. There could be further possible safeguards for Parliament, with MPs perhaps being given a vote before the UK enters the backstop and the right to notify Brussels of the UK's intention to quit the backstop within a specified time period, our correspondent added. Government sources also said they hope to set out further reassurances from the EU that the backstop is only temporary. Meanwhile,writing in Daily Telegraph,,externalex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the option of leaving the EU with no deal is ""closest to what people actually voted for"" in the 2016 EU referendum. And Tory MP Damian Green - also an ex-cabinet minister - said the onus was on the MPs to say what deal they would support. Tory Dame Caroline Spelman, who organised the MPs' letter with Labour MP Jack Dromey, said ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal would cause job losses. Dame Caroline - a Remain supporter who was environment secretary for two years when David Cameron was prime minister - told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme that 209 MPs had signed the letter. Asked if the prime minister ""gets it"", Dame Caroline said: ""Yes, I definitely think she gets it. She wouldn't have invited us to come in and see her if she didn't."" Dame Caroline said the signatories to her letter included Brexit and Remain supporters - but the letter did not bind them to supporting the PM's withdrawal deal. This video can not be played Dame Caroline Spelman says 209 MPs have signed a letter urging the prime minister to rule out a 'no deal' Brexit Instead, Dame Caroline said, it creates a ""platform"" which would ""stabilise the economy and give reassurance to manufacturing"". ""We are united on one thing - we want to protect jobs and livelihoods by making sure we don't crash out without a deal,"" she said. The MPs have been invited to meet the prime minister on Tuesday. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for, and some are actively calling for Britain to leave with no deal. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would automatically fall back on World Trade Organization rules - which would apply automatically to trade between the UK and EU. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Writing inthe Telegraph,externalon Monday, Brexiteer Mr Johnson said of all the options suggested, the no-deal option is ""gaining in popularity"" and dismissed the warnings against it which he said were ""downright apocalyptic"". Boris Johnson said Leave voters ""didn't vote for anything like Theresa May's withdrawal agreement"" Mr Johnson said he wants Mrs May to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement, ""to give real legal protection to the UK"". ""Failing that, we should approach the challenge of leaving on WTO terms in a way that is realistic and sensible,"" he said. On Sunday, Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal - which would be ""absolutely OK"". He said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". But speaking on Sunday,Mrs May warnedthat if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal, the country faces ""uncharted territory"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" The UK's exit in March was ""in danger"" if MPs did not vote for it, she added. As well as the invite to all signatories of the letter to Downing Street, Mrs May has also invited all Tory MPs to drinks receptions on Monday and Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise An exercise to test plans for border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit has been described as ""too little too late"" by hauliers. A convoy of 89 lorries took part in two test runs from the disused Manston Airport, near Ramsgate in Kent, on a 20-mile route to the Port of Dover. The Department for Transport said they went well and traffic ran smoothly. But the Road Haulage Association said the process should have begun months earlier. Its chief executive Richard Burnett said the trial ""cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks that would be held at Manston Airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""It's too little too late, this process should have started nine months ago,"" he added. ""At this late stage it looks like window dressing."" Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, also questioned the usefulness of the test. ""We've got to remember 10,000 lorries visit the Channel ports every single day so a test with less than 100 is not even a drop in the ocean,"" he said. ""Sending lorries around Kent on a wild goose chase all the way to Manston in the extreme north-east corner and then sending them to the Port of Dover by a small A road is not the right answer."" But Toby Howe, from Kent County Council, said: ""What we're learning from this is not based on 1,000 lorries or whatever. ""What we want to know is how quickly they can actually get out of the airport behind us and how quickly they will get to the various points on the stage. ""So whether it's 10 lorries, 20 lorries, 100 lorries, that will give us enough information and will give the Department for Transport enough information to then learn from that."" The lorries began the 20-mile journey at 08:00 GMT Up to 150 lorries had originally been expected to take part in the trial, known as Operation Brock, to test the airport site's suitability as a mass HGV holding bay. The drivers congregated in a large group at the former airfield before being directed by officials from the Department for Transport (DfT), Kent County Council and police officers along the A256 towards Dover. The first practice run began in rush-hour shortly after 08:00 GMT, with four convoys leaving at intervals between 08:13 and 08:39. The first of the convoys arrived in Dover at 08:52 where they were directed to do a loop around the Eastern Docks roundabout, travel along Jubilee Way and drive straight back to the airport. A second test run got under way at 11:00. One lorry driver said he felt the exercise had been ""a waste of time"" Lorry drivers who spoke to the BBC on arrival back at Manston after the first test said there had been ""no problems whatsoever"". However, one driver said he thought it had been ""a waste of time"". ""Someone had to do it didn't they, really? But at the end of the day what will be, will be,"" he said. Ramsgate 'not ready' for Brexit ferries 'Bodies uncollected' under no-deal Brexit Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Another driver, Ben Pearce, said the test ""seems to be going quite well"". He added: ""It will give them a fair idea how the traffic will behave if they do use the space as a holding bay."" Each driver taking part in the exercise was paid Â£550, the DfT said. The lorries left the disused airport in smaller batches Operation Brock was intended to maintain traffic flow on the M20and prevent the kind of disruption experienced in 2015when parts of the motorway were closed to cars for several days. The trial was organised alongside the Road Haulage Association (RHA) and the Freight Transport Association. Some people on social media also question the usefulness of the trial.

"The Gabonese president has been out of the country for two months The political situation in Gabon is ""under control"" following an attempted military coup, a spokesman for the government has said. All five of the rebels who tried to take charge have now been arrested by the authorities. The junior officers claimed they seized power ""to restore democracy"" in oil-rich Gabon, where the ailing leader's family has ruled for 50 years. Tanks and armoured vehicles could be seen in the capital Libreville. One of the rebels was on the run for a brief period, before being found hiding under a bed,reports Radio France Internationale.,external ""The situation is calm. The gendarmes who are often stationed there have taken control of the entire area around the radio and TV headquarters, so everything is back to normal"", said Guy-Bertrand Mapangou. a government spokesman. Latest updates From playboy prince to Gabon's president Gabon country profile Mr Mapangou said that the army generals, civil society and opposition leaders mentioned in the rebels' statement as potential supporters would be investigated. Current leader Ali Bongo succeeded his father Omar Bongo as president in 2009. He narrowly won re-election in 2016 in a poll marred by violence and accusations of fraud. The five soldiers took control of the national radio station at 04:30 local time (03:30 GMT) to read a short statement announcing a ""National Restoration Council"". In a video circulating on social media, three young soldiers can be seen in a radio studio wearing military fatigues and holding guns. How can you tell a coup is happening? Lt Kelly Ondo Obiang, who said he represented a group called the Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon, specifically appealed to young people to ""take charge of their destiny"". Soldiers announced they had seized power on state television The insurgents called on soldiers to take control of the transport system, ammunition reserves and airports ""in the interests of the nation"". The BBC's Firmain Eric Mbadinga said the coup attempt came as a huge surprise. The army has always been seen as loyal to the Bongo family, he said, because it is dominated by the presidential guard, who mostly come from Mr Bongo's home region. Most of the capital remains calm, an eyewitness told the Reuters news agency. The French government and the African Union condemned the attempted coup. Compared to many other African states, the former French colony has seen much less political turmoil, and has had just three presidents since 1960 Former ruler Omar Bongo dominated Gabonese politics for almost four decades, crushing dissent It is a major oil producer but one third of its people live in poverty It has a population of 1.8 million people, with an average life expectancy of 62 years. The youth unemployment rate is around 35% The country's national symbol is the black panther The president's term in office has been overshadowed by a long-running French investigation into allegations of embezzlement involving the Bongo family's assets. Mr Bongo, who has been out of the country for two months, reportedly suffered a stroke in October and received treatment in Morocco. He sought to put an end to the rumours about his health with a televised new year message in which he said he was feeling fine. Soldiers said they had been disappointed by the message, calling it ""a pitiful sight"" and a ""relentless attempt to cling onto power."" Mr Bongo has been criticised over his prominent role in the Freemasons- an organisation whose Gabonese chapter he led as lodge master. But his supporters point to his role in attempting to diversify Gabon's oil-dependent economy, in the face of declining oil reserves. President Trump has deployed soldiers to Gabon to protect US citizens amid fears of violent protests in the nearby Democratic Republic of Congo following its presidential election.

"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, pictured at Bangkok airport, says she ""wants to be free"" away from Saudi Arabia An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family at the weekend has left Bangkok airport ""under the care"" of the UN refugee agency, the head of Thailand's immigration police says. Thai immigration officials had tried to return Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, to Kuwait, where her family is. But she refused to board a flight on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she feared her family would kill her as she had renounced Islam. ""My brothers and family and the Saudi embassy will be waiting for me in Kuwait,"" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told Reuters. ""My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things."" Her relatives have not commented on her claims. Arrested for disobeying your father Rights groups including Human Rights Watch have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun, who had travelled to Thailand for a connecting flight to Australia, where she hoped to seek asylum. The Thai authorities said her status would be assessed by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). The Australian government said it would closely monitor the case, calling Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's allegations ""deeply concerning"". On Monday evening local time, Thailand's chief of immigration police Surachate Hakparn confirmed that Ms Mohammed al-Qunun was ""allowed to stay"", and that she ""left the airport with the UNHCR"". He earlier said the country would ""take care of her as best we can"", adding: ""She is now under the sovereignty of Thailand; no-one and no embassy can force her to go anywhere. ""Thailand is a land of smiles. We will not send anyone to die."" Thailand's chief of immigration police Surachate Hakparn said Thailand would not deport the young woman to her possible death Mr Surachate said he would meet Saudi diplomats on Tuesday to clarify Thailand's decision. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun tweeted that her father had arrived, ""which worried and scared me a lot"", but said she felt safe ""under UNHCR protection with the agreement of Thailand authorities"".

Thailand is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and provides no legal protection to asylum seekers although there are more than 100,000 refugees in the country. An injunction filed by Thai lawyers in Bangkok criminal court to stop the deportation was dismissed earlier on Monday. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says that when she arrived in Bangkok on Saturday, her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat who met her coming off the flight. Thailand initially said she was being deported because she did not meet the requirements for a Thai visa. However, Ms Mohammed al-Qunun insisted she had a visa for Australia, and that she never wanted to stay in Thailand. Saudi Arabia said the Thai authorities had stopped the young woman for ""violating the law"". On Monday, police chief Mr Surachate said the Thais had been tipped off by Saudi officials, adding: ""The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they feared for her safety."" Saudi women to get divorce confirmation by text message Saudi women on what life's really like Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, told the BBC: ""It seems that the Thai government is manufacturing a story that she tried to apply for a visa and it was denied... in fact, she had an onward ticket to go to Australia, she didn't want to enter Thailand in the first place."" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun drew attention to her plight through social media posts over the weekend. She also gave a friend, Noura, access to her Twitter account, saying it was in case anything should happen to her. ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want,"" she said. ""My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things,"" Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun said Women in Saudi Arabia are subject to male guardianship laws, which mean they need a male relative's permission to work, travel, marry, open a bank account, or even leave prison.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had decided to share her name and details because she had ""nothing to lose"" now. She has asked for asylum from governments around the world.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared her family would kill her if she was sent back to Saudi Arabia. Freedom of religion is not legally protected in the kingdom, and people who convert to another religion from Islam risk being charged with apostasy - or abandoning their religious beliefs. The crime is legally punishable by death - although courts have not carried out a death sentence in recent years. The BBC World Service spoke to Noura, the friend who is tweeting from Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's account. She said the pair knew each other from an online group for Saudi feminists, and that she herself had ""escaped"" Saudi Arabia because she is ""an ex-Muslim"". Noura says Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is a student at a Saudi university, and that she believes her father works for the Saudi government. ""Her family kept her alone in the house for - I think for more than six months - because she cut her hair,"" she told the BBC. Noura said she was speaking to Ms Mohammed al-Qunun ""every 20 minutes"", adding: ""She is terrified."" This video can not be played Five things Saudi women still can't do Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family. She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her. Her fate on arriving back in Saudi Arabia remains unknown.

"This video can not be played Mike Hawes, chief executive, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders UK car sales last year saw the biggest annual fall since the financial crisis,according to the industry trade body,external. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 2.36 million new cars were registered in 2018 down 6.8% on the previous year, the biggest drop since an 11% fall in 2008. Diesel sales sank by 30% on worries over possible tougher restrictions. However, the move away from diesel cars contributed to a 3% rise in the average emissions of CO2 by new cars last year. Diesel cars typically produce less CO2 than petrol vehicles. A customer switch towards bigger cars, in particular SUVs, also contributed to greater average CO2 emissions. While diesel cars produce less CO2 than petrol cars, they produce higher levels of nitrogen oxides or NOx, which are associated with breathing difficulties. The SMMT blamed last year's fall in cars sales - the second consecutive year that the market has declined - on uncertainty over Brexit and a shortage in supply of some vehicles due to a new emissions testing scheme. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes described those challenges as ""something of perfect storm"" for the industry. Are diesel cars a health hazard? What's going wrong at Jaguar Land Rover? Economy slows as car sales fall ""What we have been seeing over the last couple of years is a decline in business and consumer confidence, especially the confidence to buy big ticket items like a new car,"" he said. With sales of almost 96,000 the Ford Fiesta was the best selling car in the UK last year, the SMMT said. The Volkswagen Golf was next, with sales of almost 65,000. The boss of the SMMT says the industry has been facing a ""perfect storm"" - but the real typhoon may lie ahead. So far the decline in car sales has been largely due to a fairly catastrophic fall in demand for diesels. Put simply, the public perception is that diesel engines are dirty - leading headline-hungry politicians to talk up the prospect of bans and other restrictions. And who will buy a car if they think they won't be allowed to use it? The industry insists modern diesels are cleaner than their predecessors - but persuading policymakers to support a diesel sales drive currently looks like an uphill struggle. However, the real storm could erupt on 29 March. The SMMT says a no deal Brexit would be a ""disaster"" for the industry - because manufacturers need parts to be where they are needed, exactly when they are needed. New border controls and formalities would make those operations ""virtually impossible"". Despite the dramatic decline in sales of diesel cars, Mr Hawes thinks those types of cars have a future. ""For many consumers diesel is still the right choice. It offers better fuel economy and generally about 20% improvement on CO2 emissions. ""There are no specific bans on diesel and the newer diesels are actually exempt from any of the additional restrictions that are being put in place,"" he told the BBC. Analyst Ian Gilmartin, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said the figures were no surprise, as it had been known for months that sales were falling. ""It's not time to panic and worth remembering that in absolute terms, sales are still way ahead of the nadir we hit at the start of the decade. Manufacturers and retailers are making positive steps to try to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape, in particular through the development of new alternatively fuelled models. ""But they can't do it all on their own - they need support from the government to encourage more new vehicle purchases and allow the industry to thrive this year,"" he said.

"Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, pictured at Bangkok airport, says she ""wants to be free"" away from Saudi Arabia An 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family at the weekend has left Bangkok airport ""under the care"" of the UN refugee agency, the head of Thailand's immigration police says. Thai immigration officials had tried to return Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, to Kuwait, where her family is. But she refused to board a flight on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she feared her family would kill her as she had renounced Islam. ""My brothers and family and the Saudi embassy will be waiting for me in Kuwait,"" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told Reuters. ""My life is in danger. My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things."" Her relatives have not commented on her claims. Arrested for disobeying your father Rights groups including Human Rights Watch have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun, who had travelled to Thailand for a connecting flight to Australia, where she hoped to seek asylum. The Thai authorities said her status would be assessed by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). The Australian government said it would closely monitor the case, calling Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's allegations ""deeply concerning"". On Monday evening local time, Thailand's chief of immigration police Surachate Hakparn confirmed that Ms Mohammed al-Qunun was ""allowed to stay"", and that she ""left the airport with the UNHCR"". He earlier said the country would ""take care of her as best we can"", adding: ""She is now under the sovereignty of Thailand; no-one and no embassy can force her to go anywhere. ""Thailand is a land of smiles. We will not send anyone to die."" Thailand's chief of immigration police Surachate Hakparn said Thailand would not deport the young woman to her possible death Mr Surachate said he would meet Saudi diplomats on Tuesday to clarify Thailand's decision. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun tweeted that her father had arrived, ""which worried and scared me a lot"", but said she felt safe ""under UNHCR protection with the agreement of Thailand authorities"".

Thailand is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and provides no legal protection to asylum seekers although there are more than 100,000 refugees in the country. An injunction filed by Thai lawyers in Bangkok criminal court to stop the deportation was dismissed earlier on Monday. Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says that when she arrived in Bangkok on Saturday, her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat who met her coming off the flight. Thailand initially said she was being deported because she did not meet the requirements for a Thai visa. However, Ms Mohammed al-Qunun insisted she had a visa for Australia, and that she never wanted to stay in Thailand. Saudi Arabia said the Thai authorities had stopped the young woman for ""violating the law"". On Monday, police chief Mr Surachate said the Thais had been tipped off by Saudi officials, adding: ""The Saudi Arabia embassy contacted the immigration police... and said that the girl had run away from her parents and they feared for her safety."" Saudi women to get divorce confirmation by text message Saudi women on what life's really like Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, told the BBC: ""It seems that the Thai government is manufacturing a story that she tried to apply for a visa and it was denied... in fact, she had an onward ticket to go to Australia, she didn't want to enter Thailand in the first place."" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun drew attention to her plight through social media posts over the weekend. She also gave a friend, Noura, access to her Twitter account, saying it was in case anything should happen to her. ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want,"" she said. ""My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things,"" Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun said Women in Saudi Arabia are subject to male guardianship laws, which mean they need a male relative's permission to work, travel, marry, open a bank account, or even leave prison.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun wrote on Twitter that she had decided to share her name and details because she had ""nothing to lose"" now. She has asked for asylum from governments around the world.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun told the BBC that she had renounced Islam, and feared her family would kill her if she was sent back to Saudi Arabia. Freedom of religion is not legally protected in the kingdom, and people who convert to another religion from Islam risk being charged with apostasy - or abandoning their religious beliefs. The crime is legally punishable by death - although courts have not carried out a death sentence in recent years. The BBC World Service spoke to Noura, the friend who is tweeting from Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's account. She said the pair knew each other from an online group for Saudi feminists, and that she herself had ""escaped"" Saudi Arabia because she is ""an ex-Muslim"". Noura says Ms Mohammed al-Qunun is a student at a Saudi university, and that she believes her father works for the Saudi government. ""Her family kept her alone in the house for - I think for more than six months - because she cut her hair,"" she told the BBC. Noura said she was speaking to Ms Mohammed al-Qunun ""every 20 minutes"", adding: ""She is terrified."" This video can not be played Five things Saudi women still can't do Ms Mohammed al-Qunun's case echoes that of another Saudi woman who was in transit to Australia in April 2017. Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, was en route from Kuwait via the Philippines but was taken back to Saudi Arabia from Manila airport by her family. She used a Canadian tourist's phone to send a message, a video of which was posted to Twitter, saying her family would kill her. Her fate on arriving back in Saudi Arabia remains unknown.

"Pope Francis made his appeal on the Christian Epiphany feast day Pope Francis has appealed to European leaders to show ""concrete solidarity"" and allow 49 migrants aboard two ships in the Mediterranean to land. Issuing a ""heartfelt appeal"" in a public address in the Vatican, the Pope said the migrants needed ""a safe port"". Both Italy and Malta have refused to allow the two ships to land. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said it could set a ""precedent"", while Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio called on Malta to ""do its part"". Migrant rescue mission 'fight not over' ""I make a heartfelt appeal to European leaders to show concrete solidarity for these people,"" the Pope told about 60,000 people in the Vatican's St Peter's Square in an Epiphany feast day address. The Dutch-registered vessel Sea-Watch 3, operated by a German humanitarian group, picked up 32 of the migrants off Libya on 22 December while Sea-Eye - a second ship run by a different German charity - rescued another 17 people on 29 December. Malta has allowed the two ships to take on supplies in its waters but not to dock Malta has allowed the two ships to enter its waters for supplies and to shelter from bad weather, but refused to let them dock. ""This is an issue that might set a precedent and we should be vigilant about it,"" Prime Minster Muscat said before the Pope's appeal, accusing critics of acting as ""the Christmas saint"" while refusing to take in the migrants themselves. Mediterranean migrant crossings 'deadlier than ever' Sharp fall in illegal migration to EU The man behind Italy's migrant drop Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Di Maio meanwhile said Italy had been taking in migrants for years and the time had come for Malta to take in some ships. The country's new populist government has cracked down on immigration, passinga decree to make it easier to deport migrants and strip them of Italian citizenshipin September. There are several children and teenagers on board the ships Italy has refused private humanitarian ships to dock in the past, includingthe Doctors Without Borders vessel Aquarius. The country's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, of the right-wing League party, has demanded more help from other EU countries to tackle the issue. Charities and UN agencies have called on European leaders to take in the vessels as they wait in the Mediterranean. The UN's refugee agency has tweeted that it is concerned for the safety of those who try dangerous sea crossings when there are ""limited"" legal routes for them to take. Allow Twitter content?

"NBA star Enes Kanter should be looking forward to coming to play basketball in London next week. Instead, he says he'll be staying in the USA - for fear of assassination in the UK. The 26-year-old New York Knicks centre explained to Radio 1 Newsbeat why he's cancelled his appearance at the O2 arena on 17 January. ""The Turkish government is obsessed with me,"" he said over the phone from his New York base. ""I speak out against [President] Erdogan, and so I don't feel safe. ""It's sad as I love Harry Potter, and wanted to come see all of London so badly, but I can't take the risk."" Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president As things stand, Kanter's Knicks team will go ahead and play their regular season game against the Washington Wizards without him. Their game in London is part of an NBA strategy to bring the sport to the world - but ironically it can't bring one of the world's best players. Kanter is an outspoken critic of the President of his native Turkey, Recep Tayyp Erdogan. The sportsman has referred to the politician as ""the Hitler of our century"". Turkey's President Erdogan has been accused of creeping authoritarianism ""I'm not saying that Erdogan's going to do an operation [against me] in London but it's more there are lots of crazy supporters of his. ""You can say that I'm paranoid but I don't want to take the risk. ""My team's security said to me 'If you go, you can't leave your room or do any activities for the time you're in London'. ""I'm getting more death threats, hundreds in the last few days. But I won't stop being outspoken I want the whole world to know what's going on in Turkey. ""It's bigger than basketball, it's bigger than the NBA."" Kanter is caught up in a Turkish political conflict which has spread beyond his home country's borders. President Erdogan has accused Fethullah GÃ¼len, a US-based Turkish cleric, of masterminding a failed 2016 military coup against him. Mr GÃ¼len denies the charge. Kanter, who was educated at one of Mr GÃ¼len's network of schools in Turkey, has taken the cleric's side. An anti-government protester in Turkey holds a picture of President Erdogan and exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen The basketball player regularly visits Mr GÃ¼len at the cleric's home in Pennsylvania. Kanter's moves have come at personal cost. In 2017, the sportsman's fatherMehmet was arrested in Turkeyand charged with membership of a terrorist group. Kanter suspects this was in order to put pressure on him. ""It's very sad,"" he said. ""I haven't talked to my parents for a long time. I tried bringing them here but the Turkish government wouldn't let them."" In 2017, theTurkish government cancelled Kanter's passport,forcing him to cut short a planned trip to Romania and return to the US, where he is a permanent resident and due to get citizenship in two years. Mike Bass, a spokesman for the NBA, told the BBC: ""The NBA has played hundreds of games outside of the US and this is a very unique and unprecedented situation."" The New York Knicks say Kanter's decision not to travel to London is based on visa issues, not security. Enes Kanter says he won't stop being outspoken about his political views, despite the risks But Kanter is emphatic. ""It's not a visa issue. They [the Knicks] are not going to come out and say 'Enes Kanter may get killed' - they just want to say visa issues so there is no negative energy on my team mates. ""I genuinely am worried about my safety and so are my [security] team. It'd be helpful I guess if the Knicks came out and said it."" The Knicks haven't respond to Kanter's denials that this isn't related to documentation. The UK's Home Office says that it won't comment on individual cases. But Kanter urges the authorities in the UK to make a clear promise to protect him. ""If I hear any reassurance from the British government, maybe I'll talk to my team again.""

Colman was named best actress in a musical/comedy for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite and she gave an endearingly excited acceptance speech that ended with her holding up her trophy and sending a message to her family: ""Ed and the kids - look! Yay!"" Christian Bale won best actor in a motion picture (comedy or musical) for Vice Christian Bale provided one of the night's most political moments when he thanked ""Satan"" for inspiration for his role in Vice. Bale played Dick Cheney, who was vice-president from 2001 to 2009 and is blamed by the film for many of the world's ills. Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes rewards TV as well as film. Picking up his prize for best TV drama actor, Madden said: ""I didn't see this coming at all."" The Scottish star played Sergeant David Budd in BBC One's Bodyguard. The final episode was watched by more than 17 million people in the UK - making it the UK's most watched episode of a TV drama since current records began in 2002.

Whishaw, meanwhile, dedicated his best actor in a TV limited series trophy to Norman Scott, the man he portrayed in A Very English Scandal. Scott was targeted in a failed murder plot allegedly hatched by Liberal politician Jeremy Thorpe, played in the drama by Hugh Grant. This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Whishaw said Scott ""took on the establishment with a courage and defiance that I find completely inspiring"", adding: ""He's a true queer hero, an icon, and Norman, this is for you.""

"Police were urgently searching for 17-month-old Maria Tudorica A 17-month-old girl taken during a car theft has been found safe and well. Maria Tudorica was taken in Nine Acres Close, Newham, east London, at 16:37 GMT on Sunday. Scotland Yard tweeted just before 20:00 that she had been found less than a mile away in the Ruskin Avenue area. Maria was in the front passenger seat of a black Audi A5 when her father met an unknown man with a view to selling the car - but the thief jumped in and drove away. The empty vehicle was later found abandoned in nearby Hatherway Crescent. A huge police search was launched for Maria, who was born in Romania but lives in the local area with her family. The Met said Maria was found in the street wearing an additional item of clothing which they believe was given to her by the car thief or by a member of the public. Allow Twitter content?

He thank so much the police for their service."" Mr Stelica said he had asked his brother Claudia Stelica, 35, to show the car to the ""buyer"" as a favour because he was out of London. ""I put the car on sale today and one guy called me on my phone,"" he said. ""He didn't seem suspicious on the phone, he was talking very nicely. I said to him 'if you don't want to wait for me, no problem'."" Mr Stelica said his brother placed Maria inside the car as he demonstrated the engine, but the thief jumped in and drove off. ""He jumped up in the driver's side and - boom - straight away he went with the car,"" he added. The man who took the car is described as Asian, of slim build and dressed in black clothing. The Met has appealed for information and witnesses, particularly about whether a member of the public gave Maria the extra item of clothing.

"MPs will vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, 15 January, government sources have confirmed. The Commons vote was called off last month by the PM, who was facing defeat, but sources have told the BBC the vote will not be delayed again. It is also understood the government will set out further reassurances on the controversial backstop. Meanwhile, more than 200 MPs have signed a letter to Theresa May, urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. It comes asa major exercise involving more than 100 lorriesis being carried out in Kent to test out how to manage traffic queues near the Channel ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ThePM's deal- which covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations with the EU - has already been agreed with EU leaders. But it needs to pass a vote by MPs before it is accepted. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 whether the deal is passed by MPs or not. Can Theresa May unblock her Brexit deal? Brexit vote: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Mrs May's deal is facing opposition from many of her own MPs, as well as Labour and other opposition parties including the Remain-supporting Liberal Democrats. The DUP - which Mrs May's Conservative Party relies on for a majority in Parliament -has saidit will not back the deal. But Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng dismissed suggestions that the government had accepted it would lose next week's vote and was planning on returning to Brussels. ""The plan is to win the vote on Tuesday, or whenever it comes,"" Mr Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said a week was ""a very long time in politics"" and he was ""very hopeful"" the deal would be voted through. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said reassurances on the Irish backstop were likely to include proposals to minimise any regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Plans to give Stormont a role in deciding whether the backstop should come into force were also likely. There could be further possible safeguards for Parliament, with MPs perhaps being given a vote before the UK enters the backstop and the right to notify Brussels of the UK's intention to quit the backstop within a specified time period, our correspondent added. Government sources also said they hope to set out further reassurances from the EU that the backstop is only temporary. Meanwhile,writing in Daily Telegraph,,externalex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson said the option of leaving the EU with no deal is ""closest to what people actually voted for"" in the 2016 EU referendum. And Tory MP Damian Green - also an ex-cabinet minister - said the onus was on the MPs to say what deal they would support. Tory Dame Caroline Spelman, who organised the MPs' letter with Labour MP Jack Dromey, said ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal would cause job losses. Dame Caroline - a Remain supporter who was environment secretary for two years when David Cameron was prime minister - told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme that 209 MPs had signed the letter. Asked if the prime minister ""gets it"", Dame Caroline said: ""Yes, I definitely think she gets it. She wouldn't have invited us to come in and see her if she didn't."" Dame Caroline said the signatories to her letter included Brexit and Remain supporters - but the letter did not bind them to supporting the PM's withdrawal deal. This video can not be played Dame Caroline Spelman says 209 MPs have signed a letter urging the prime minister to rule out a 'no deal' Brexit Instead, Dame Caroline said, it creates a ""platform"" which would ""stabilise the economy and give reassurance to manufacturing"". ""We are united on one thing - we want to protect jobs and livelihoods by making sure we don't crash out without a deal,"" she said. The MPs have been invited to meet the prime minister on Tuesday. Many Conservative MPs continue to believe the deal does not represent the Brexit the country voted for, and some are actively calling for Britain to leave with no deal. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would automatically fall back on World Trade Organization rules - which would apply automatically to trade between the UK and EU. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Writing inthe Telegraph,externalon Monday, Brexiteer Mr Johnson said of all the options suggested, the no-deal option is ""gaining in popularity"" and dismissed the warnings against it which he said were ""downright apocalyptic"". Boris Johnson said Leave voters ""didn't vote for anything like Theresa May's withdrawal agreement"" Mr Johnson said he wants Mrs May to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement, ""to give real legal protection to the UK"". ""Failing that, we should approach the challenge of leaving on WTO terms in a way that is realistic and sensible,"" he said. On Sunday, Tory MP Peter Bone told Sky News the best way to ""get on"" with Brexit was to leave without a deal - which would be ""absolutely OK"". He said support for leaving without a deal was ""hardening"". But speaking on Sunday,Mrs May warnedthat if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal, the country faces ""uncharted territory"". This video can not be played Theresa May: ""The danger... is we actually end up with no Brexit at all"" The UK's exit in March was ""in danger"" if MPs did not vote for it, she added. As well as the invite to all signatories of the letter to Downing Street, Mrs May has also invited all Tory MPs to drinks receptions on Monday and Wednesday.

"Underwater hockey is played along the bottom of a pool ""I think I'm going to skip the gym today,"" is something often heard around this time of year. Dedicating yourself to a gruelling workout regime in January can be tough even to the most determined gym-goer. But distracting yourself from the fact you're exercising is one method of burning the Christmas calories. Here are a selection of weird and wonderful ways to get fit in the New Year. This video can not be played Grounded aerial is a sports class where participants hang from bungee cables as they exercise âIt releases the inner child.â That's how Grounded Aerial instructor Angharad James describes the class in Whitland, Carmarthenshire, where attendees hang from bungee cables as they jump around the room. While attached to the ceiling, exercisers perform a series of high-energy moves. Ms James explained that the workout, which comes from Philadelphia, incorporates resistance training and dance, and has changed people's entire body shapes. During the class, they do push-ups in a handstand, to which Ms James said: ""Well, I mean who can do that?"" This video can not be played Swimmers take part in underwater hockey for a change from swimming laps It was the sport which rose to prominence in the 1950s to keep divers fit. But underwater hockey is a sport still played competitively today, attracting members from all over Wales. âI think a lot of people who are fed up of swimming laps enjoy a bit of different team sport - and itâs a really good team sport,â explained Newport Underwater Hockeyâs Jenny Murphy. Can children floss their way to fitness? Dance classes 'should be on prescription' Players wear their snorkels alongside a water polo hat to protect their ears, and flippers to help pick up speed. Instead of using the traditional hockey ball, a heavy lead puck is flicked along the bottom of the pool, using a smaller stick. Swimmers compete along the pool floor, coming up for air, but never lifting their heads out of the pool - instead blowing water from their snorkels and taking a deep breath.

She adds: âYou get to do fun stuff - you feel like a kid again.â Aerial silks instructor Tammi Brown is one of the founders at Up Side Down Circus in Cardiff and teaches âanything else that needs to go upâ. The former juggler explained that the sport involves the whole body, and said the circus classes are a fun environment. âI think with circus in general itâs more fun and itâs a non-competitive environment which I think is really important,â she said.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May launched the plan in Liverpool NHS bosses in England say a new 10-year plan could save up to 500,000 lives by focusing on prevention and early detection. GPs, mental health and community care will get the biggest funding increases to shift the focus away from hospitals. Prime Minister Theresa May hailed the launch of the plan as a ""truly historic moment"". But unions are concerned that staffing shortages could undermine the ambitions - one in 11 posts are currently vacant. And some senior doctors warned hospitals were facing a ""near-on impossible task."" Society of Acute Medicine president Dr Nick Scriven said he was ""staggered"" by the plans given the problems facing hospitals. Many trusts are missing all three key waiting time targets for A&E, cancer care and routine operations, and are struggling to balance the books. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens indicated there may be changes to the current target - that at least 95% of patients attending Accident and Emergency departments should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours - to take into greater account clinical need. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem with that is it doesn't distinguish between turning up at A&E with a sprained finger versus turning up with a heart attack. ""The top doctors in the NHS are looking at what are the most appropriate clinical standards to improve outcomes in emergency care. They will make their recommendations and then, on the back of that, we will meet them."" Hugh Pym: Will NHS plan deliver the goods? May's NHS plan 'lacks funding and staffing' Meet the NHS duo keeping the elderly safe at home Six things to look out for in health in 2019  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The plan, unveiled by Simon Stevens and Mrs May, committed to giving a third of the extra Â£20bn the NHS will get by 2023 on GPs, community care and mental health. Currently they account for less than a quarter of spending, while hospitals take up around half of the Â£114bn frontline budget. Mr Stevens called it a ""practical, costed and phased route map"" for the decade ahead. Mental health is due to get Â£2.3bn extra of the Â£20bn, while GP and community care is to get Â£4.5bn. NHS England said that will help pay for: Mental health support in schools and 24-hour access to mental health crisis care via the NHS 111 service Extra support in the community so patients can be discharged quickly from hospital and reduce the number of outpatient appointments by a third Digital access to health services, including online GP booking and remote monitoring of conditions such as high blood pressure More social prescribing to give GPs a range of options to tackle social problems like loneliness through connecting people to activities such as choirs and arts groups Healthy living programmes for patients struggling with ill-health New testing centres for cancer patients to ensure earlier diagnosis DNA testing for children with cancer and those with rare genetic disorders to help select the best treatment NHS England believes that combined the new vision could save 500,000 lives through preventing diseases, such as strokes, heart problems and cancer, and spotting them earlier to improve the chances of survival. As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England. But the other UK nations are drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The prime minister asked for the plan to be drawn up when she unveiled extra funding for the health service in the summer to mark its 70th birthday. The budget will grow by Â£20bn a year by 2023 - the equivalent of annual rises of just under 3.5%. She said a long-term plan for the next decade was needed to ensure the money was wisely spent. Mrs May said it was a ""historic"" moment for the NHS and would help pay for ""world class"" treatments. But shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said the plan lacked both the staffing and funding to succeed and accused the government of ""mismanagement"" of the health service. ""The NHS needs a credible fully-funded plan for the future, not a wish list to help Theresa May get through the coming months."" The ambitions are being welcomed. Prof Carrie MacEwen, of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: ""It's good to have a plan which sets a clear direction for the NHS."" But unions have warned the workforce shortages could undermine the programme. Unison head of health Sara Gorton said: ""Without the staff, there is no NHS. ""Ministers must say more about how they plan to address the staffing shortages."" Mr Stevens told the BBC that the NHS planned to train between 25% and 50% more nurses and had five new medical schools ready to train doctors. He said: ""We've got to do a better job of looking after the staff that we have. I think people are under huge stress and pressure. We've got to change the way the health service works."" There is also unease that other parts of the wider health system have been cut - the Â£20bn promise only applies to NHS England's budget for frontline health care. It does not cover other areas such as training and public health. The money made available to councils to pay for initiatives such as smoking cessation and healthy weight programmes is being cut by more than 4% next year once inflation is taken into account. What is more, the government has yet to publish its green paper on social care despite promising to in 2017. Councils and care homes have warned care homes and home help services for the elderly and adults with disabilities are at risk because of insufficient funding. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, said the focus on out-of-hospital care should help relieve the pressures on hospitals. But he added: ""If we are serious about helping people to stay well and live independently for as long as possible it is vital that we also see appropriate investment and support for social care and public health."" When it comes to this plan, there are probably two key things to bear in mind about Brexit - funding and staffing. During the referendum campaign, Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS. When the prime minister announced the Â£20bn extra in the summer she said it was partly being paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"". But others have dismissed that suggestion. The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed. Alongside that debate, fears have been raised that Brexit could worsen staffing shortages. About 5% of the NHS workforce is from Europe. The government has promised those currently working here will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay in the UK and there will be a new skilled migrants system, similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff, such as health care assistants and porters, will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least Â£30,000 a year.

"The UK can ""turn a corner"" and start to ""put its differences aside"" if Parliament backs the proposed Brexit deal, Theresa May has said. In her new year message, the prime minister said 2019 would mark a new chapter for the country outside the EU. Should MPs approve the exit terms later this month, she said the UK could ""move forward together"" and concentrate on other issues like housing and health. Labour has said the Brexit process is a ""complete mess"" due to Tory divisions. The UK is scheduled to leave the union on 29 March, but it is unclear what will happen if MPs reject the withdrawal agreement and the framework for future relations. Corbyn warns of 'complete Brexit mess' Sturgeon: EU migrants welcome in Scotland US ambassador issues trade deal warning MPs are due to vote in the Commons in mid-January on the proposals reached with the EU. Downing Street has said there is ""still work to do"" - as the PM seeks to persuade sceptical Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the agreement does not represent the Brexit the country voted for in 2016. The prime minister is continuing to seek further assurances from European leaders about aspects of the agreement, notably the controversial Irish border ""backstop"", designed to prevent physical customs checks on the island of Ireland.

No 10 said the prime minister had been in contact with European counterparts during the Christmas break and that would continue in the coming week. In her message, Mrs May said MPs had an ""important decision to make"". ""In 2019 the UK will start a new chapter. The Brexit deal I have negotiated delivers on the vote of the British people. If Parliament backs a deal, Britain can turn a corner. ""The referendum in 2016 was divisive. But we all want the best for our country and 2019 can be the year we put our differences aside and move forward together, into a strong new relationship with our European neighbours and out into the world as a globally trading nation."" An orderly Brexit, she argued, would enable the UK to ""focus its energy"" on other challenges, such as addressing housing shortages, improving technical education and ensuring the Â£20bn in extra spending planned for the NHS during the next five years ensures the health service continues to be ""there for us when we need it"". With employment at a record high and debt falling, the PM said the UK's economic foundations were strong but she acknowledged more needed to be done to ensure ""everyone in every community can feel the benefit"". Labour has warned uncertainty over Brexit has plunged the country into a state of crisis and the agreement on the table would not satisfy either Leave or Remain voters. The opposition is seeking to force a general election by calling a vote of no confidence in the government if the deal is rejected by MPs. However, Jeremy Corbyn has insisted that the decision to leave the EU cannot be reversed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his new year message, Mr Corbyn said Mrs May could not be allowed to ""drive through a bad deal"" and Labour, if it was in power, would seek to reopen negotiations with Brussels to pursue a better outcome. Only his party, he claimed, was capable of uniting the UK, with policies to tackle inequality and job insecurity.

"Improvements to mental health support and maternity care are included in the plans to be announced by the PM The government's 10-year plan for the NHS lacks both the staffing and funding to succeed, Labour has said. The PM has promised the publication of the plan on Monday will lead to ""world class"" care for patients in England. Pledges on maternity care, mental health, elderly support and earlier detection and prevention of diseases will be included in the plan. But shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Mrs May was just trying to ""clear up a mess that she has made"". Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Ashworth said: ""The funding isn't sufficient and the staffing isn't there."" He added the NHS ""doesn't need 10 more years of the Tories, it needs a Labour government"". However, Mrs May said that,coupled with the extra money announced last summer, the plan secured the future of the NHS. The budget is due to rise by Â£20bn a year above inflation by 2023, though a detailed explanation of where that money will come from has not yet been provided. Smokers in hospital to be helped to quit Six things to look out for in health in 2019 The hospitals that fail to treat patients on time Health Secretary Matt Hancock, meanwhile, admitted the health service was short staffed but said work was being done to solve the problem. He told BBC News there were ""still lots of people"" trying to become nurses in the UK and that there was a ""record number of GPs in training"".  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. A day before publication of the 10-year plan, the prime minister said the proposals marked ""a historic step"" to secure the future of the NHS, adding there was a focus on ""ensuring that every pound is spent in a way that will most benefit patients"". ""This will help relieve pressure on the NHS while providing the basis to transform care with world-class treatments,"" she said. When asked on the Andrew Marr Show why the NHS was failing to hit key waiting time targets, Mrs May blamed an increased in demand on health services. The 10-year plan, she added, was ""crucial"" for ensuring the ""sustainability"" of the NHS. Speaking to the BBC in June, Mrs May suggested funding for the plan would come from a combination of taxes and the so-called ""Brexit dividend"". However, during the summer, Commons Health and Social Care Committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston described the idea of a Brexit dividend as ""tosh"". As healthcare policy is politically devolved, the plan only applies to the NHS in England but Mrs May said the other UK nations will be drawing up their own plans. Under the government's funding system they are getting an extra Â£4bn between them by 2023. The full details are not being unveiled until Monday when it will be released by NHS England. But Mrs May has outlined some of the key focuses. These include: Better mental health care, including round-the-clock advice from NHS 111 by 2023 and tailored services for young adults.  Currently once someone in care turns 18 they are thrust into the adult system, often when they are not ready Providing the best maternity care in the world by improving safety and providing greater mental health support for new parents. One in five new mothers struggles with mental health in the first year of her baby's life Greater control and choice in old age by expanding the use of personal budgets to allow people to decide what care they want, and greater support in the community so people do not end up in hospital Better prevention and detection of disease - cancer is expected to be a key focus with an ambition to increase the number of early detections from one in two cancers to three in four, which in turn will improve survival Increases in the NHS workforce - currently one in 11 posts is vacant Bringing the NHS into the digital age, including online GP booking, prescriptions management and health records The plan was promised during the summer when the government unveiled its funding settlement for the NHS. That set out the budget for the next five years and means by 2023 funding for the NHS will be Â£20bn a year more than it is now, once inflation is taken into account. That is the equivalent of annual ""real terms"" rises of close to 3.5% - about twice what the NHS has got since 2010. NHS England boss Simon Stevens has been in charge of drawing up the plan At the time, the prime minister said she wanted to ensure the money was used wisely and so asked NHS England boss Simon Stevens to draw up a long-term plan for the next decade. It was expected to be published in the autumn, but was delayed because of the government's troubles getting its Brexit plans agreed. The last time such a long-term vision was set out was in 2000 under Tony Blair. Understandably people want to see the full details before coming to firm conclusions. But the priority areas are being welcomed. Andy Bell, of the Centre for Mental Health, said the initiatives on mental health were much needed. He said: ""For too many young people, mental health support is offered too late, with too many restrictions and then they are forced to start again when they reach 18."" Mental health care is one of the priority areas Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses shared the ambitions being set out. But she added the government needed to ""urgently address"" the staffing shortages if it was going to succeed. And Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Health Foundation think-tank, predicted fulfilling the pledges would be ""extremely tough"" because of the scale of staffing shortages, rising pressures and cuts to other parts of the wider health and care system. The Â£20bn promise just relates to the front-line NHS budget and so does not cover other elements such as social care and public health - at the end of last year it was announced the budget for these services, which includes smoking cessation and weight management, was being cut by over 4% in real terms next year. Ms Dixon said: ""Trade-offs are inevitable and these must be spelled out clearly so the public know what they can expect from the NHS."" There has been a fair bit of tension behind the scenes. The Treasury is understood to have wanted to tie the NHS down in terms of what it will achieve. One of the central bones of contention is thought to be how the NHS can tackle deficits and waiting times. Hospitals are struggling to balance their books and have seen a deterioration in the time patients wait in A&E, for cancer and for routine operations. None of these three key waiting time targets are currently being met. The NHS is missing its key waiting time targets It looks like a trajectory for improvement will be published at a later date with NHS bosses known to have been wary about promising things they felt they could not deliver. Another missing piece is the green paper on social care. This was first promised in 2017, but has been delayed on a number of occasions. Brexit has certainly been a factor, but again there has been disagreements in private, this time over how radical the plan should be given the problems facing the sector, which covers care homes and home help. The government has promised the green paper will be published as soon as possible.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.
