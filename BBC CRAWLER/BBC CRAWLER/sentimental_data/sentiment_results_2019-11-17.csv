"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I don't want us to become an isolated society"" The Conservatives have set out plans for an ""equal"" immigration system after Brexit as Jeremy Corbyn said he still expected a ""great deal"" of movement of people from the EU to the UK. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined plans to change the rules on benefits which EU nationals can claim in time if they live and work in the UK. But he said there would be no arbitrary target for total immigration levels. The Labour leader said immigration was vital for growth and public services. In a BBC interview, Mr Corbyn defended the principle of free movement, which lets EU citizens travel, live, study and work in any member country but which is currently set to end at the start of 2021. Migration from the EU had ""enriched"" the country, he said, and this had to be a part of the close economic relationship he wanted to build with the continent going forward. So where do main parties stand on immigration? Do migrants put pressure on NHS? Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Pressed on whether this would involve retaining freedom of movement of people, he said immigration would form part of Labour's Brexit renegotiation if it won the election, but added ""there will be a great deal of movement"". The Lib Dems said the Conservatives' plans were based on the false assumption that overseas workers were trying to ""do us over"". And business groups said migrant labour was needed at ""all skills levels"" if the UK was to upgrade its infrastructure and housing. ""When we hear talk about brightest and best, I think that is a worry,"" Carolyn Fairbairn, the director of the CBI employer's group told Sky News. ""If you do want to build 200,000 houses a year, you don't just need the architects and the designers, you need the carpenters, you need the electricians, you need the labourers."" The Conservatives have said from the start of 2021, when the post-Brexit transition period ends, immigration rules will apply to EU nationals and non-Europeans in the same way, with no preferential treatment for any group. Earlier this week, Prime MinisterBoris Johnson also saidthat if he won the election, he would try to reduce the number of so-called ""unskilled"" migrants coming into the UK. The issue of immigration has slipped down the list of voter concerns since the Brexit referendum, now at its lowest point for almost two decades. However, with public services stretched and the NHS under particular pressure, the Conservatives want to respond to the argument that people from overseas add to the burden on the welfare state. Extending the immigration health surcharge to EU as well as non-EU migrants after the end of free movement is logical, but increasing the charge by 56% carries risks. The UK government is hoping foreign workers can fill desperate shortages of staff in health and social care. But nurses, doctors and carers are less likely to move to Britain if there are rising costs for them on arrival. Last week, the Tories promised to make it cheaper for foreigners coming to work in the NHS by reducing the cost of a visa. Today's announcement appears to do the opposite. For all the political parties, there is a balance to be struck between the concerns of some communities which fear immigration will constrain access to jobs and services, and the concerns of employers who argue restricting access to foreign workers may hamper their ability to create jobs or deliver services. The Conservatives say they would introduce an Australian-style points-based system, which would consider migrants' skills and whether they meet certain criteria. In recent years, the party had a long-standing goal - first introduced by David Cameron and also a promise in the 2017 election manifesto - to cut net migration to less than 100,000 a year. But the government never came close to meeting the target and faced repeated calls to drop it. A campaign unlike any other? Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? Relax rules for some foreign workers, say advisers Announcing more details of their immigration policy on Sunday, the Conservatives said the ""vast majority"" of migrants would need a job offer to come to the UK to work - although there will be a ""small number of exceptions"" for example high-skilled scientists. Rules on claiming benefits will be ""equalised"", meaning that like other migrants, EU citizens would have to wait five years before they can access benefits and will not be able to send child benefit payments abroad. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""What you don't want to do is encourage cheap labour from abroad"" And theimmigration health surcharge,external- the payment charged to migrants to use the NHS - would apply to all migrants, both EU and non-EU, and would be raised from Â£400 to Â£625 a year. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that such ""granular controls"" would help reduce pressure on the public services while ensuring the UK had access to the labour it needed, particularly in the health service. While the Conservatives were committed to bringing down the overall volume of immigration, he said he would ""not fix an arbitrary target"". ""We want to be able to plug gaps in specific sectors, whether it is the NHS or elsewhere but what you don't want to do is encourage a reliance on cheap labour from abroad which has a depressing effect on wages,"" he said. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? Relax rules for some foreign workers, say advisers Also appearing on Andrew Marr, Mr Corbyn said a future Labour government would not ""turn its back"" on migration from the EU and suggested it would make it easier for the partners and families or those who had settled in the UK to join them. ""There has to be a recognition that our economy and society has been enriched massively by people who have made their homes here,"" he said. ""No Labour government led by me will bring in a hostile environment."" But Mr Corbyn deflected questions on whether free movement could continue in its current form, saying people would have to wait untilLabour's manifesto is publishedon Thursday for more details. He also declined to say whether he wanted the UK to leave or remain in the EU. CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The BBC's Iain Watson said there had been a disagreement at a key meeting on Saturday - when Labour's ruling body approved the party's manifesto - on whether to incorporate Labour's conference policy of extending freedom of movement for workers. Mr Corbyn said freedom of movement would continue if voters back Remain in the new referendum pledged by Labour. But if voters back Leave, Labour would introduce its own immigration policy, recognising there would have to be high levels of labour mobility. This, he added, would be underpinned by stricter regulation of the employment market to prevent migrant workers ""undercutting"" employees here and to stop migrants being exploited. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told LBC that immigration was a ""mutual good thing"" and her party would oppose all of the changes to benefits and NHS charges being talked about by the Conservatives. And the SNP's leader Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland needed to maintain a healthy level of inward migration to avoid a long-term decline in the working-age population and the negative impact this would have on taxpayer-funded public services.

"This video can not be played How students Leah Mckee-Hearne and Courtney Peaker spotted the Bolton fire and raised the alarm Students who were forced to flee a block of flats hit by a major blaze in Bolton are to be re-housed. An investigation is under way after the fire ripped through The Cube on Friday, leaving dozens of students with ""no personal possessions"". More than Â£10,000 has been raised for the University of Bolton students through a crowdfunding appeal. Two people were injured in the fire,amid confusion among residents because fire alarms go off ""almost every day"". The blaze at The Cube in Bolton broke out on Friday and took more than nine hours to bring under control Concerns have also been raised about the cladding on the outside of the building, although it is different to the material used at Grenfell Tower, where a blaze killed 72 people in London, in 2017. The Cube, which is managed by private firm Valeo Urban Student Life, accommodates about 220 people. Kyra Rivett, who lived in the six-storey building, told BBC Breakfast: ""Most of us have [lost belongings], especially those who lived on the top and fifth floor - all their belongings have gone."" Prof George Holmes, vice-chancellor of the university, said affected students could access Â£500 for emergency provisions. ""We've made sure all students have accommodation for next week,"" he said.

Friday's blaze was tackled by up to 200 firefighters after it broke out at 20:30 GMT. ""The immediate evacuation clearly made an incredible difference... students ambassadors were going about banging on doors, getting everybody out,"" David Greenhalgh, leader of Bolton Council, said. ""We have been assured that all alarms were working so that building was evacuated in the time that was needed."" About 220 students lived at The Cube in Bolton Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the fire service had learnt from the Grenfell fire and had also sent a team ""to focus on the evacuation rather than fighting the fire"". A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said: ""It is not yet known when the students will be able to get back into their homes but work is ongoing to assess the safety of the building and access will be reviewed on Monday.""

Fire-hit student flats' cladding 'a concern' Huge fire at student flats block The GMFRS spokeswoman confirmed that The Cube was inspected along with other high-rise buildings in 2017 following the Grenfell tragedy. She said a letter was sent to the building's management ""requiring the fire risk assessment to be updated to consider the risk of internal and external fire spread"".

"This video can not be played Police tear gas met with petrol bombs A stand-off at a Hong Kong university campus has led to fiery clashes overnight, as hundreds of protesters tried to repel a police advance. Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades. Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons. Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city. The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began. The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force. Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons. A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday. The protests explained in 100 and 500 words The context to Hong Kong protests Timeline of Hong Kong unrest How is Hong Kong run? The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside. Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT). They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus. Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated. This video can not be played Protesters around Hong Kong Polytechnic University have armed themselves with an array of weapons ""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday. ""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back."" Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university. By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck. Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped. Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug. The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police. The government recently confirmedthe city had entered its first recession for a decade. In recent days, Hong Kong's university campuses have been the scenes of pitched battles between police and demonstrators. A police truck on a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel, which links Kowloon and Hong Kong island, was set on fire on Sunday and it was forced to retreat by large crowds of protesters hiding behind umbrellas and hurling petrol bombs. Fires raged around the campus on Monday morning Protesters have been holding a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel In a statement the university hadurged those occupying the campus to leave.,external ""Universities are venues for advancing knowledge and nurturing talents. Universities are not battlegrounds for political disputes and should not be drawn into violent confrontations,"" it said. Protesters armed with bows and arrows have been seen on the PolyU campus The officer was struck in the leg close to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University On Saturday, in a move that sparked controversy, Chinese soldiers in shorts and T-shirts took to the streets to help clean up debris and remove barricades. It was the first time since the protests erupted that Chinese soldiers, who very rarely leave their barracks in Hong Kong, had taken to the streets. This video can not be played In a rare move, Chinese soldiers left their barracks on Saturday to help clean up Hong Kong's streets Hong Kong - a British colony until 1997 - is part of China under a model known as ""one country, two systems"". Under this model, Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy and people have freedoms unseen in mainland China. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence The protests started in June after the government planned to pass a bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Many feared this bill would undermine the city's freedoms and judicial independence. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests continued, having evolved into a broader revolt against the police, and the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.

"Actor Stephen Graham has opened up about the time he attempted to take his own life, after suffering a breakdown. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the star of Line of Duty, The Irishman and This Is England said he ""didn't know how to cope"" at the time. The ordeal came about after he had left home to go to drama school in London. The 46-year-old said a series of traumatic family events that occurred before he moved away from home for the first time contributed to his collapse. In the space of a few years, his beloved grandmother died and his mother gave birth to a stillborn child. ""I'd been through these few traumatic things and never really grieved,"" said the Liverpudlian actor. His mother later became pregnant again and a baby brother arrived the day before Graham, then 20, went to start his new life in the capital. ""This beautiful joyous occasion of this little boy coming into my life and mum and pop's life and then me having to leave was kind of a bit difficult,"" he told host Lauren Laverne. ""But when you're 20 you have the world in front of you haven't you, so you try not to focus on that stuff."" He added: ""I had a breakdown with all of these things that had happened traumatically from my late teens that I hadn't really dealt with or I hadn't come to terms with."" Stephen Graham played undercover officer DS John Corbett in Line of Duty The star recalled how he returned home and tried to explain his feelings to his parents, who tried to help him, but in vain. He went on to attempt to hang himself in his room. ""It was very calculated,"" he said. ""I heard my nanna's voice - and I know it sounds strange and weird... and she shouted 'Stephen' and I thought I'd gone, because I'd tried to do that. And I just came to, I opened my eyes and the rope had snapped, thankfully. ""And then I put a high neck jumper on, one of them zip-up jumpers, and my ma and da came back and then my mum kind of saw it and she went, 'What's that?' And she seen it properly and then the three of us... I really opened up then, everything just came out and I just [said], 'I don't know how to cope.'

""They were really supportive and my mum and dad and slowly built me back, slowly come around to the understanding it was OK. Life was worth living, thankfully."" Graham also spoke about how he first attended a youth theatre group at Liverpool's Everyman theatre as a teenager on the advice of local actor Andrew Schofield, who lived over the road from his grandmother. One of Graham's grandfathers was Jamaican, and he told Laverne that at times in his youth he didn't know where he ""belonged"". ""There were times there growing up when I was slightly unsure where I fitted in,"" he said, referencing his white and black cousins. He stressed that his parents encouraged him ""to find my own way within it"". Graham (second left) with Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and the cast of The Irishman last month He can now be seen playing mobster Anthony Provenzano in Martin Scorsese's film The Irishman. The director had previously cast him in Gangs of New York and as Al Capone in HBO's Boardwalk Empire. Martin Scorsese's The Irishman review âââââ Graham admitted he was ""really nervous"" to meet Robert De Niro, his co-star in The Irishman, because movies like The Godfather, Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter were ""the films that I grew up on"". His dad showed them to him on video straight after he confessed to having a proper interest in acting. ""That weekend we watched those three films, and I think we watched The Godfather twice actually. It was amazing,"" he recalled. ""But that was that kind of a moment where he went to me, 'If you're serious, this is how it's done, seriously and brilliantly.' That began my love affair with films.""

In a Facebook post, her father John said he had spoken to his son Haydon on Thursday to reassure him, almost nine months after Leah's disappearance. He said the 24-year-old died hours later, after police arrived at his house to tell him his son was ""fighting for life."" Ms Croucher was last seen by her parents at their home in Quantock Crescent on the evening of 14 February. She told her family she was meeting a friend but police said the meeting did not happen. CCTV showed her walking about half a mile from her home at about 08:15 the next day. Leah's father John Croucher confirmed Haydon's death in a Facebook post Haydon had appeared in court earlier this year accused of making threats to a man he described as Leah's ex-boyfriend. He accepted a voluntary restraining order and the prosecution was dropped. Mr Croucher said he had arranged to meet up with his son on Friday so they could spend the day that marked nine months since Leah's disappearance together. He said his son was a ""kind, generous, funny, witty and loving person"". He added: ""Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there. ""We love and miss you both terribly. Our world could not be more broken than it is now.""

"The boy died while being treated at Glasgow's flagship hospital campus which includes the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and Royal Hospital for Children A three-year-old boy's death at Glasgow's largest hospital in 2017 has been investigated by police. The child died on 9 August 2017 at a unit within the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus, the Crown Office confirmed. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said they had fully investigated and shared their findings with the boy's family. The Scottish Mail on Sunday reported he was in the same hospital as 10-year-old Milly Main, who died three weeks later. The ward he was treated on was laterclosed because of problems with the water supply, the paper reported. The newspaper said the boy, who has not been named, was being treated for a rare genetic disease. A Crown Office spokesman said: ""The procurator fiscal has received a report in connection with the death of a three-year-old boy at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on 9 August 2017. ""The investigation into the death, under the direction of Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit (SFIU), is ongoing and the family will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."" Police Scotland confirmed the death had been investigated and a report passed to the fiscal. The Crown Office has recently received expert reports from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGCC), having received the initial report of the death from Police Scotland in August 2017. These will be considered to establish whether further investigation is required. A NHSGCC spokesman said: ""We have already provided information to this family but are sorry that they have further questions. ""We fully investigated this child's death at the time and also asked for two independent experts to investigate the case, the outcome of which has been communicated to the family. ""We are absolutely committed to providing patients and families with information and ensuring they get answers to the questions they have. In this case the full findings were shared with the family."" Milly Main contracted an infection while recovering from a stem cell transplant in Glasgow Last week it emerged that 10-year-old Milly Main died at the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC) which is part of the hospital campus, after contracting an infection while recovering from leukaemia treatment. 'I was let down and lied to over Milly' Her mother Kimberly Darroch told the BBC she was ""100%"" convinced her death was linked to problems with the water supply which were investigated the following year. Awhistleblower had earlier revealed that a doctor-led review,externalhad identified 26 infections at RHC during 2017 which were potentially linked to contaminated water. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde insists it is impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. MSP Anas Sarwar called for the health boardto be put in ""special measures""over its handling of hospital infection issues. Milly died at the hospital on 31 August 2017 while in remission from leukaemia following stem cell treatment. Her mother said she felt ""let down and lied to"" because she was given no information about water contamination as a possible factor in Milly's death. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has offered to meet the family to discuss their concerns. It said the hospital's water had been independently assessed as safe, and it criticised the whistleblower for causing ""stress and anxiety"" for Milly's parents when there was no evidence of a link. The Â£842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) ""super hospital"" has faced a number of problems since it opened in 2015. Two cancer wards at the adjoining children's hospitalwere closed last year amid concern about infections and investigation of water supplyissues, with patients decanted to the adult hospital. In January it emerged that two patients at the QEUH had died aftercontracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings.

"This video can not be played British Special Forces have been accused of covering up the killings of four young Afghans in 2012 The UK government and armed forces have been accused of covering up the killing of civilians by British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has spoken to 11 British detectives who said they found credible evidence of war crimes. Soldiers should have been prosecuted for the killings, say insiders. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it rejected the unsubstantiated allegation of a pattern of cover-ups. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC ""all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at"". He said ""the right balance"" had been struck over decisions whether or not to investigate alleged war crimes. The new evidence has come from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government decided to close IHAT and Operation Northmoor, after Phil Shiner, a lawyer who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off as a solicitor following allegations he had paid fixers in Iraq to find clients. But former detectives from IHAT and Operation Northmoor said Phil Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down criminal investigations. None of the cases investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor resulted in a prosecution. One IHAT detective told Panorama: ""The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn't wriggle their way out of it."" Another former detective said the victims of war crimes had been badly let down: ""I use the word disgusting. And I feel for the families because... they're not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?"" Panorama has re-examined the evidence in a number of alleged war crimes cases. One such case investigated by IHAT was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003. Raid al-Mosawi was serving as an Iraqi policeman in Basra when he was shot dead Raid al-Mosawi was shot in an alleyway as he left his family home, and later died from his wounds. The incident was investigated at the time by the British soldier's commanding officer, Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen. Within 24 hours, Maj Suss-Francksen concluded the shooting was lawful because the Iraqi police officer had fired first and the soldier had acted in self-defence. His report said another British soldier had seen the shooting and confirmed the Iraqi had fired first. IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewed 80 British soldiers, including the soldier who had supposedly witnessed the shooting. But he told detectives he was not in the alleyway. In his statement to IHAT, this soldier directly contradicted Maj Suss-Francksen's report: ""This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true."" Raid's brother shows where the soldier was when he fired the fatal shot The soldier said he had only heard one shot, which suggested the policeman had not fired at all. This was confirmed by other witnesses interviewed by IHAT. Detectives concluded the soldier who shot Raid should be prosecuted for killing the Iraqi police officer and Maj Suss-Francksen should be charged with covering up what happened. But military prosecutors have not taken anyone to court. Maj Suss-Francksen's lawyer said: ""My client has not seen the IHAT material and is unable to offer any comment on the quality or reliability of the evidence gathered by the IHAT investigators or why it was insufficient to satisfy a prosecution of any soldier under UK law."" Operation Northmoor was set up by the government in 2014 and looked into 52 alleged illegal killings. Its closure was announced by the government before Royal Military Police detectives even had a chance to interview the key Afghan witnesses. One Northmoor detective said: ""I wouldn't write off a job until I have spoken to both parties. If you are writing off a job and the only thing you have got is the British account, how is that an investigation? ""My view is that every one of those deaths deserved to be examined and due process of law to take place."" The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. ""Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute."" ""The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations."" Quizzed about the allegations on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK wanted ""to have accountability where there's wrongdoing"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous "" He said: ""What we're quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don't lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who have served their country for years on end - and we've got the right balance."" Mr Raab refused to be drawn on whether these claims were new to him, and said that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous in the world"". Meanwhile, a lawyer who has represented several soldiers investigated by IHAT, dismissed the claims of war crimes as ""flawed, baseless and biased"". Hilary Meredith, chair of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, said the claims were a ""witch hunt against our brave servicemen"" which ""had no credibility whatsoever"". She added: ""Solicitor Phil Shiner, who masterminded countless false claims, was struck off the role of solicitors for good reason - he was found guilty of charges including dishonesty over false witness accounts about UK soldiers' actions.""

"This video can not be played Hellynne and Barry Lee used a hosepipe to soak their neighbour A couple have admitted common assault on their neighbour by turning a hosepipe on him in a long-running dispute. Barry and Hellynne Lee, both aged 72, sprayed Harold Burrows with water as he was clearing up debris that washed into his garden from their pathway in June. Magistrates at Llandudno, Conwy county, were shown footage of the incident which Mr Burrows had caught on camera. The couple were given a 12-month conditional discharge. They were also each ordered to pay Â£170 costs. Barry and Hellynne Lee arriving at court on Friday Prosecutor Julia Galston said it was a ""nasty assault"" and that there had been a ""number of difficulties with the Lees"" over the years. Robert Vickery, mitigating, said the neighbours used to be friends but there had been a dispute about land and the Lees now planned to move. The couple banned from staring through windows Woman loses snoring row complaint Giant plant row woman gets new restraining order ""On this day Mr and Mrs Lee were doing what they have done for many years, hosing down their driveway and pathway,"" he said. ""But because of the lie of the land, water has the habit of going downhill and water containing some of the crud has gone under the fence panel."" Mr Vickery said Mr Burrows, a retired ambulance service regional staff officer, came out to brush up the debris, while carrying his camera. He was then sprayed with water, first by Mrs Lee and then by her husband. ""This is certainly, in my nearly 40 years' experience, the first time I have ever dealt with an assault by water from a hosepipe,"" said Mr Vickery. The couple, from Cae Fron, Denbigh, were both given a two-year restraining order banning communication with their neighbours, except through a third party, during Friday's hearing.

"Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis at Buckingham Palace There were three big questions and a whole pile of smaller ones that needed answering in this interview. On the big three, the Duke of York was pressed time and time again - did he have sex with Virginia Giuffre (then called Virginia Roberts), as she claims? Why did he go back to see (and stay with) Jeffrey Epstein two years after the businessman's conviction and imprisonment for child sex offences? And how did he explain the photograph of him with his arm round the waist of the 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre. About his visit to New York in 2010 when he stayed at Epstein's house, Prince Andrew was, if not remorseful, then clear that (with hindsight) he had done the wrong thing. He had gone there to tell Epstein that their friendship was over, he said. He said he did not speak to Epstein once he knew about the 2006 Palm Beach Police investigation into possible child sex offences. Nor did he speak to him or contact him when he was in prison. Then in 2010 he flew to New York and stayed with him - it was more ""convenient"", he said - for the sole purpose of telling him they could no longer be friends. By this point they had not seen each other for four years. Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims To have done it by phone would have been ""chicken"" and he is ""too honourable"" at times, he said. So, he says, he did the wrong thing for the right reasons. It was pretty much the only time in the interview that he admitted having made any kind of mistake over his 11-year relationship with Epstein. This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. About the claim by Virginia Giuffre that she slept with the prince three times, there was a categorical denial, alongside a string of reasons why her story did not add up. She says he bought her a drink in a nightclub; he said he doesn't know where the bar is in that club. She says he was sweating heavily as he danced with her; he says he didn't sweat at all back then because of an obscure medical condition that's now gone away. She says he slept with her; he said he was at home after taking one of his daughters to a party in a pizza restaurant. He said he didn't remember her, he didn't recollect her and again he absolutely categorically denied  sleeping with her. Ms Giuffre says she was abused by the prince in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, where she was pictured in 2001 And the photo of the prince with his arm slipped around Virginia Giuffre's naked midriff? It has plagued  Prince Andrew and the palace, undercutting their blunt denials. No recollection, said the prince. No explanation. Over the past few months, so-called ""friends"" of the prince have mounted a whispering campaign about the photo trying to undercut its authenticity. He wouldn't go so far but instead suggested he never wore the kinds of clothes he was wearing in the photo - travelling clothes - when in London, preferring a suit and tie, and that he never went to the upper floor of the house where the photo was taken. He just couldn't remember the photo, he said, and was at a loss to explain where it came from. There was notably little in the way of apology or remorse in the interview. Aside from that visit to Epstein's house in 2010, Prince Andrew does not think he has done anything wrong. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' He does not regret the friendship with Epstein, a man who by many accounts used and abused young girls for many years. It had, he said, ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"". In one horrible moment he described Epstein as having behaved ""in a manner unbecoming"", as if the convicted sex offender had simply passed the port round the wrong way in the regimental mess. He was picked up on that quickly, and apologised. ""I'm being polite,"" Prince Andrew said. Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein pictured walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 Nothing struck him as suspicious in the various Epstein households that he visited. The Miami Herald has painstakingly put together a picture in Palm Beach of a place where three or four young (14 and 15-year-old) girls might visit a day to give Epstein massages, during which he would sexually abuse many of them. But the prince was at pains to point out that he didn't know Epstein that well really, he might drop in a few times a year, and he said that Epstein ""may have changed his behaviour patterns"" so as to cover up his behaviour. Prince Andrew met Epstein through the businessman's girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell back in 1999. He said he had seen Ms Maxwell in late spring this year. Did they talk about their one-time friend, Jeffrey Epstein, who had accompanied Ms Maxwell to  Windsor Castle and to Sandringham, who had laid his personal jet and houses and holiday island at Prince Andrew's disposal? No, the prince replied, there was nothing to discuss: ""He wasn't in the news. We'd moved on.""

"In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis,,externalthe Duke of York, Prince Andrew has given details about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and addressed allegations about sex with a teenage girl. Here are six things we learned from the interview. Prince Andrew has defended his relationship with Epstein before -including as recently as August- two weeks afterthe disgraced financier took his own lifewhile awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But in the BBC interview broadcast on Saturday night, the prince gave more detail about why he ""still"" did not regret the friendship. He said knowing Epstein had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"", at a time when he had left a career in the Navy and begun one as a trade and industry special representative. Prince Andrew said: ""The people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn, either by him or because of him, were actually very useful."" Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York in 2005 Prince Andrew has always said he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 through the financier's then-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell - a well-connected socialite. Ms Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell, has generally kept a low profile since claims about Epstein began to emerge. But the prince said he met up with her earlier this year, before Epstein was arrested and charged over sex trafficking allegations. ""She was here (in the UK) doing some rally,"" the prince said. He said they did not discuss Epstein during the meet-up. ""There wasn't anything to discuss about him because he wasn't in the news, you know, it was justâ¦ we had moved on."" Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? The prince stressed throughout the interview that he and Epstein ""weren't that close"". Invitations Epstein had received to events at Windsor Castle and at Sandringham were in the financier's capacity as Ms Maxwell's ""plus one"" rather than as a friend in his own right, he said. Prince Andrew said this photo was taken on a walk where he told Epstein their friendship was over Much of the interview focused on why the prince went to stay with Epstein in 2010, following Epstein's conviction and imprisonment for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. The prince said the visit was to explain to Epstein that their friendship was over. He said he had considered speaking to Epstein on the phone, but decided to meet him face-to-face ""to show leadership"". ""I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him."" Prince Andrew returning from the Falklands War in September 1982 Maitlis asked the prince for his response to allegations against him made by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre (then known as Virginia Roberts). Ms Giuffre said she met the prince in 2001 when she dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub in London, and had sex with him at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in Belgravia. Maitlis pointed out that Ms Giuffre's accusations were ""very specific"" and included that the prince had been ""profusely sweating"". The prince said a ""problem"" with Ms Giuffre's story was that a medical condition meant he could not have been sweating. ""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simplyâ¦ it was almost impossible for me to sweat,"" he said. A picture shows Prince Andrew with the then Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre Prince Andrew revealed he had investigated the possibility that a photograph - or elements of it -provided by Ms Giuffre was fake. One reason the prince gave was his attire. ""I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because... when I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie,"" he said. ""That's what I would describe asâ¦ those are my travelling clothes... if I'm going overseas."" However, newspapers have previouslypictured the prince wearing jeans without a tie or blazer on a night out in London.,external Speaking about the photo with Ms Giuffre, Prince Andrew told Newsnight: ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken."" He also said he did not believe the photograph ""was taken in the way that has been suggested"" because it shows the prince's hand on the woman's waist. ""I am not one to, as it were, hug - and public displays of affection are not something that I do."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do' The duke said the day on which Ms Giuffre's allegations are said to have happened, 10 March 2001, he was not out in London but ""at home with the children"". He said he had taken his eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking at about four or 5pm. ""And then because the Duchess was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there."" He added he remembered the occasion ""weirdly distinctly"" because it was one of only a couple of times that he had been to Woking, and going to the Pizza Express there was ""a very unusual thing for me to do"".

"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 The US businesswoman at the centre of a misconduct controversy involving Boris Johnson has said he ""cast me aside like I am some gremlin"". It is alleged that Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London due to their friendship, claims he denies. Ms Arcuri told ITV,externalshe had kept his ""secrets"" but that her requests to him for media advice had been ""blocked"". The Conservatives say any claims of impropriety are ""unfounded"". Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? Johnson 'fails to answer Arcuri questions' Johnson, Arcuri, and the mysterious Annie Tacker During the interview to be aired later, Ms Arcuri addressed the now prime minister directly, saying: ""I've been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive, and a true confidante of yours. ""I've kept your secrets, and I've been your friend. ""And I don't understand why you've blocked me and ignored me as if I was some fleeting one-night stand or some girl that you picked up at a bar because I wasn't - and you know that. ""And I'm terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside like I am some gremlin."" Ms Arcuri appearing on the BBC's Talking Business programme in 2013 Her latest interview, follows allegations,first reported in the Sunday Times,externalin September, that Ms Arcuri's business was given Â£126,000 in public money along with privileged access to three foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor, between 2008 and 2016. The Greater London Authority (GLA) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor - launched an investigation into the alleged conflict of interest following the paper's report. That probe was paused after the authority referred the claims to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The watchdog will now decide whether or not to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office - before the GLA decides whether to continue its own probe. Last month, a government review ruled thata Â£100,000 government grant given to Ms Arcuri's business was ""appropriate"". Ms Arcuri said she had tried to ask Mr Johnson for advice on how to handle media attention over the allegations, but was left feeling ""humiliated"" after being told ""there are bigger things at stake"" by an aide. She added: ""I was brushed off as if I was one of Kennedy's girlfriends showing up to his White House switchboard, you know, here to do my, you know, calling"". Ms Arcuri would not be drawn on the nature of their relationship during the interview, but said that she had come under pressure from friends to ""admit the affair"". In response to the programme, the Conservative Party said it considered the decision to refer Mr Johnson to the police watchdog as ""vexatious and politically motivated"". A spokesman added that any claims of impropriety in office by Mr Johnson were ""untrue and unfounded"". 22 September:The Sunday Times publishes allegations about Mr Johnson's friendship with Ms Arcuri 24 September:The London Assembly gives Mr Johnson 14 days to provide ""details and a timeline of contact"" with Ms Arcuri 27 September:The monitoring officer of the Greater London Authority refers Mr Johnson to the Independent Office for Police Conduct 29 September:Mr Johnson denies any wrongdoing and tells BBC News everything was done ""with full propriety"" 7 October:Ms Arcuri tells ITV's Good Morning Britain programme she ""never spoke"" to Boris Johnson for help to secure any grants or sponsorship for her company 9 October:The London Assembly says a response it received from Number 10 does not answer its questions 31 October:Government rules the Â£100,000 grant given to Jennifer Arcuri's company was ""appropriate"" Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about?

"The SNP has called for TV licence decisions to be made independently of government, as it pledged to fight for free licences for over-75s. The party argues that powers over licence fees should be removed from the UK government to avoid political ""game-playing"". The BBCannounced in June that free licences for over-75s would go, affecting up to 3.7m households. The change is scheduled to come into effect next year. The UK government announced in 2015that the BBC would take over the cost of providing free licences for over-75s by 2020 as part of the licence fee settlement. Under the agreement the BBC would determine, after consultation, what the policy should be - and then fund that policy. The corporation has since said that the cost of maintaining the full benefit would jeopardise the future of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel and Radio 5 Live, as well as many local radio stations. In June it announcedthe licence would remain free to low income households, where one person receives pension credit, but other over 75-year-olds would be required to pay the fee, currently costing Â£154.50 a year. CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The SNP now wants an independent body to rule on who should pay the licence fee and how much it should cost. The party's Brendan O'Hara accused the Conservative UK government of having ""taken older people for granted for too long"". He said pensioners should get a better deal, adding: ""SNP MPs will fight to reverse that decision and restore the free TV licence for older people. ""But more broadly, we need to stop future governments from similar game-playing and have the licence fee set independently of government."" BBC licences: Who should pay? Labour has alreadypledged to keep free TV licences for over-75s if it wins power in the 12 December general election. The party's shadow culture secretarytold the Daily Mirror earlier this month,externalthat the removal of the benefit was ""utterly callous"" and ""disgraceful"". He added: ""Four in 10 older people say the TV is their main source of company, but from next year 3.7m older people will lose their free TV licence"". It has also been reported that Boris Johnson is looking to save free licences for older viewers as part of the Conservative election campaign. According to the Sun on Sunday,external, the prime minister ordered officials to find a way to ensure no over-75s would need to pay as a ""priority"". The Lib Dems say scrapping free TV licenses for over-75s will have a ""huge impact"" on the mental wellbeing of older people. They want to restore free TV licences for over-75s, and have these paid for by the UK government. Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

"This video can not be played Hellynne and Barry Lee used a hosepipe to soak their neighbour A couple have admitted common assault on their neighbour by turning a hosepipe on him in a long-running dispute. Barry and Hellynne Lee, both aged 72, sprayed Harold Burrows with water as he was clearing up debris that washed into his garden from their pathway in June. Magistrates at Llandudno, Conwy county, were shown footage of the incident which Mr Burrows had caught on camera. The couple were given a 12-month conditional discharge. They were also each ordered to pay Â£170 costs. Barry and Hellynne Lee arriving at court on Friday Prosecutor Julia Galston said it was a ""nasty assault"" and that there had been a ""number of difficulties with the Lees"" over the years. Robert Vickery, mitigating, said the neighbours used to be friends but there had been a dispute about land and the Lees now planned to move. The couple banned from staring through windows Woman loses snoring row complaint Giant plant row woman gets new restraining order ""On this day Mr and Mrs Lee were doing what they have done for many years, hosing down their driveway and pathway,"" he said. ""But because of the lie of the land, water has the habit of going downhill and water containing some of the crud has gone under the fence panel."" Mr Vickery said Mr Burrows, a retired ambulance service regional staff officer, came out to brush up the debris, while carrying his camera. He was then sprayed with water, first by Mrs Lee and then by her husband. ""This is certainly, in my nearly 40 years' experience, the first time I have ever dealt with an assault by water from a hosepipe,"" said Mr Vickery.

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do' The Duke of York has ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with an American woman, who says she was forced to have sex with him aged 17. Answering questions about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a BBC interview, Prince Andrew said the alleged incidents ""never happened"". Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince said he was at home with his children on one of the occasions. Prince Andrew, who is the Queen's third child, has been facing questions for several months over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. Virginia Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts - has said she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew  between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Speaking to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, the prince said: ""It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened."" ""I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" He said Ms Giuffre's account of him ""profusely sweating"" and ""pouring with perspiration"" when they danced at the club on the night in 2001 when she says they first had sex was impossible, because he had a medical condition preventing him from perspiring. ANALYSIS:'Little apology or remorse' TRANSCRIPT:Read Prince Andrew's interview in full AS IT HAPPENED:Newsnight interview REACTION:Prince Andrew 'bulldozed' into interview In an extraordinary interview, which you can watch in full onBBC iPlayerin the UK orYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the duke said: He had investigations carried out to establish whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre was faked, but they were inconclusive He would testify under oath if ""push came to shove"" and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited him to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He does not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him Addressing Ms Giuffre's claims that she had dined with the prince, danced with him at a nightclub, and went on to have sex with him at the house of Ghislaine Maxwell, a friend of the prince, in Belgravia, central London, he said ""there are a number of things that are wrong with that story"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' He said the date when Ms Giuffre says he had sex with her was 10 March 2001, when he had taken his daughter Beatrice to Pizza Express in Woking for a party before spending the night at home. ""Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,"" he said. ""I remember it weirdly distinctly."" Ms Giuffre described him providing her with alcohol at a nightclub, but Prince Andrew said: ""I don't drink, I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there."" BACKGROUND:Who was Jeffrey Epstein? TIMELINE:Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein GIUFFRE:Prince Andrew 'was an abuser' On claims he was sweating, he said: ""I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time,"" he said, blaming it on ""an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War"". He said he had only started to be able to sweat again ""in the recent past"". Asked about a photograph of him and Ms Giuffre being taken at Ghislaine Maxwell's house, he said he had ""absolutely no memory"" of it. The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 ""Investigations that we've done"" have been unable to prove whether the photograph was faked, he said, ""because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph"". Prince Andrew said he did not recall going upstairs in that house, said he was not dressed as he usually would be if he was in London and added ""we can't be certain as to whether or not that's my hand"". ""I'm at a loss to explain this particular photograph,"" he said. On the further accusation that he had sex with her in New York, the duke denied he was present at Epstein's home that day, although he had been travelling in the US. He also denied the claim he had sex with her on Epstein's private island with a group of seven or eight other girls. ""Absolutely no to all of it,"" he said. Prince Andrew said he never suspected Epstein's criminal behaviour on his visits, describing the house as a busy place with staff like Buckingham Palace. This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 He said: ""I live in an institution at Buckingham Palace which has members of staff walking around all the time and I don't wish to appear grand but there were a lot of people who were walking around Jeffrey Epstein's house. As far as I aware, they were staff."" But he denied that there were large numbers of underage girls present and said Epstein ""may have changed his behaviour patterns not to be obvious to me"". Asked if he would testify under oath, the duke said: ""I'm like everybody else and I will have to take all the legal advice that there was before I was to do that sort of thing. But if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so, then I would be duty bound to do so."" The duke rejected the perception of him as ""the party prince"" in the past, and said ""going to Jeffrey's was not about partying, absolutely not"". He said he had first met Epstein through his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999 but it was a ""stretch"" to say they were close friends and they saw each other ""a maximum of three times a year"". Prince Andrew acknowledged he had stayed on Epstein's private island, visited his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and travelled on his private plane. He said he wanted to learn more about the ""international business world and so that was another reason"" for going to visit the US financier in New York, as the prince became special representative for international trade and investment. He invited Epstein to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday at Windsor Castle in July 2006 but said ""certainly I wasn't aware"" that a warrant had been issued in May for his arrest for sex crimes. But the duke said he ceased contact with Epstein later that year, until 2010. Epstein was convicted of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008. The then 55-year-old Epstein received an 18-month prison sentence after prosecutors forged a deal with him. Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship In July 2010, Epstein was released and in December, Prince Andrew went to visit him in his New York mansion. Challenged on his decision to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender, he said: ""I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together."" He stayed several days and attended a dinner party, however. ""It was a convenient place to stay,"" he said, but added ""with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do"". The duke denied an account by another guest that he had been seen receiving a foot massage from a Russian woman. Asked about a picture of him and Epstein taken in Central Park in 2010, Prince Andrew said ""somebody very cleverly took that photograph"" but that they had not been able to ""find any evidence"" that Epstein had set it up. The fallout over Epstein's arrest had been ""a constant sore in the family"", the prince said. Following the allegations made against him in a 2015 deposition, Prince Andrew said the wider Royal Family ""couldn't be more supportive"" and his immediate family ""were at a loss"".

He said that choosing to talk about the allegations was ""almost a mental health issue to some extent for me"", adding that ""it's been nagging at my mind for a great many years"". Meeting Epstein after his conviction was ""the wrong decision and the wrong judgement"" but the allegations from Ms Giuffre were ""surprising, shocking and a distraction"", he said. But he refused to entirely disavow his relationship with Epstein, saying it had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"" that were unrelated to the accusations against them both. ""Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,"" he said. After interviewer Emily Maitlis challenged him, describing Epstein as a sex offender, the duke said: ""Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm being polite.""

"In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis,,externalthe Duke of York, Prince Andrew has given details about his relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and addressed allegations about sex with a teenage girl. Here are six things we learned from the interview. Prince Andrew has defended his relationship with Epstein before -including as recently as August- two weeks afterthe disgraced financier took his own lifewhile awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But in the BBC interview broadcast on Saturday night, the prince gave more detail about why he ""still"" did not regret the friendship. He said knowing Epstein had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"", at a time when he had left a career in the Navy and begun one as a trade and industry special representative. Prince Andrew said: ""The people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn, either by him or because of him, were actually very useful."" Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York in 2005 Prince Andrew has always said he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 through the financier's then-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell - a well-connected socialite. Ms Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell, has generally kept a low profile since claims about Epstein began to emerge. But the prince said he met up with her earlier this year, before Epstein was arrested and charged over sex trafficking allegations. ""She was here (in the UK) doing some rally,"" the prince said. He said they did not discuss Epstein during the meet-up. ""There wasn't anything to discuss about him because he wasn't in the news, you know, it was justâ¦ we had moved on."" Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? The prince stressed throughout the interview that he and Epstein ""weren't that close"". Invitations Epstein had received to events at Windsor Castle and at Sandringham were in the financier's capacity as Ms Maxwell's ""plus one"" rather than as a friend in his own right, he said. Prince Andrew said this photo was taken on a walk where he told Epstein their friendship was over Much of the interview focused on why the prince went to stay with Epstein in 2010, following Epstein's conviction and imprisonment for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. The prince said the visit was to explain to Epstein that their friendship was over. He said he had considered speaking to Epstein on the phone, but decided to meet him face-to-face ""to show leadership"". ""I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him."" Prince Andrew returning from the Falklands War in September 1982 Maitlis asked the prince for his response to allegations against him made by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre (then known as Virginia Roberts). Ms Giuffre said she met the prince in 2001 when she dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub in London, and had sex with him at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in Belgravia. Maitlis pointed out that Ms Giuffre's accusations were ""very specific"" and included that the prince had been ""profusely sweating"". The prince said a ""problem"" with Ms Giuffre's story was that a medical condition meant he could not have been sweating. ""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simplyâ¦ it was almost impossible for me to sweat,"" he said. A picture shows Prince Andrew with the then Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre Prince Andrew revealed he had investigated the possibility that a photograph - or elements of it -provided by Ms Giuffre was fake. One reason the prince gave was his attire. ""I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because... when I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie,"" he said. ""That's what I would describe asâ¦ those are my travelling clothes... if I'm going overseas."" However, newspapers have previouslypictured the prince wearing jeans without a tie or blazer on a night out in London.,external Speaking about the photo with Ms Giuffre, Prince Andrew told Newsnight: ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken."" He also said he did not believe the photograph ""was taken in the way that has been suggested"" because it shows the prince's hand on the woman's waist. ""I am not one to, as it were, hug - and public displays of affection are not something that I do."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do' The duke said the day on which Ms Giuffre's allegations are said to have happened, 10 March 2001, he was not out in London but ""at home with the children"". He said he had taken his eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking at about four or 5pm. ""And then because the Duchess was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there."" He added he remembered the occasion ""weirdly distinctly"" because it was one of only a couple of times that he had been to Woking, and going to the Pizza Express there was ""a very unusual thing for me to do"".

Harry, 19, died after the collision in Northamptonshire in August that led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. A filehas been passed to prosecutors, but no charges have been brought. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said support from the public was ""the only thing keeping us going"". Harry's father Tim said the support from those who took part in the motorbike and scooter ride, which started in Brackley, Northamptonshire, was ""fantastic"". Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Talking to Sky News, Mrs Charles said decisions in the case by the Crown Prosecution Service were ""taking too long"". ""The case is a pretty clear cut, we are just waiting on their decision,"" she added. Harry was fatally injured on 27 August, when his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas, 42, outside RAF Croughton, where her husband Jonathan was an intelligence officer. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn met Donald Trump at the White House Mr Dunn, who explained the family was ""struggling"", said: ""We are getting more frustrated by the delays and the authorities.""

"The London Marathon has also introduced measures to crack down on plastic waste Runners at north Wales' largest running event were warned they would be disqualified if they dropped litter during the race. Organisers of Sunday's Conwy Half Marathon said the measures had been introduced as plastic was becoming an ""increasing problem"". The Run Wales website said runners would also be ""taken off the results if seen discarding their rubbish outside of a water stop or not with a marshal"". About 3,000 runners took part.

"Everyone will be entitled to a ""free teeth MOT"" in England under a Labour government, the party says. Labour is proposing to scrap band one dentistry charges, which cover a check up, a scale and polish, and any X-rays that may be needed. It believes patients are put off going because of the fee - a check up costs Â£22.70 - with many ending up in A&E. Dental leaders welcomed the move, but said there was a shortage of dentists that needed addressing too. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said charges were a real barrier to access services for some. ""With 135,000 patients presenting at A&E with dental problems every year, it's time we put prevention at the heart of our approach to health."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn added: ""This is the first step towards making all dentistry services free of charge."" He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that free dental checks would ""save money in the long-run"" and it was ""actually an investment for the future"". ""If we don't have a dental check and then somewhere down the line we have a catastrophe, a disaster, massive pain, we have to go to A&E and that is then very expensive,"" he said. Labour said the policy would cost Â£450m a year. Health is devolved so the policy only covers England. Wales and Northern Ireland both charge for check ups, but Scotland does not. Labour reaches 'unanimous agreement' on manifesto NHS dentist charges rise by 5% in England MPs demand action over wrongly-issued NHS fines There are three fee bands for treatment. They are: Band one (Â£22,70) - check up, scale and polish and any X-rays Band two (Â£62.10) - all the treatments in band one plus fillings, extractions and root canal treatment Band three (Â£269.30) - all treatments in band one and two plus crowns, dentures and bridges People on low incomes, pregnant women and under 18s or under 19 and in full-time education are exempt from charges. Nearly half of treatments delivered each year are provided free. However, the exemption system has been criticised for being overly complex and has been blamed for people getting fined for wrongly claiming free dental care. Official NHS figures show about half of adults have not used an NHS dentist in the past two years and about four in 10 children for the past year. But that does not mean that they are all going without care. Some patients may feel they do not need to go, while large numbers pay to see dentists privately. The figures also do not cover those who get care from specialist community teams, such as those with mental health problems, learning disabilities and some people in care homes. No data is published on the actual number of people going without care when they need it. Labour has pointed to figures suggesting one in five delays going because they cannot afford to see dentists, but that is from research a decade ago. In theory, free checks should make a difference. The British Dental Association points to data from Scotland, which has had free check ups since 2006, that shows higher rates of NHS dentistry use. BDA chair Mick Armstrong said the system of exemptions was complex so simplifying the system should encourage more people to come forward for check ups - although they still face the prospect of charges if they need any work done. But he also said workforce problems needed to be addressed if access was going to improve significantly. Research by the BDA has suggested three quarters of NHS dental surgeries have vacancies they struggle to fill. ""Any plans to boost access must go hand-in-hand with support for a service facing serious recruitment problems. ""NHS dentistry cannot be delivered without NHS dentists.""

"25 days to go until the general election Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tells Andrew Marr his party plans a further referendum on Brexit - but ""can't commit"" to a Scottish independence referendum Asked about free movement of people from the EU to the UK after Brexit, he says there will be ""a great deal of movement"" Conservative Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab pledges to reduce immigration without ""arbitrary targets"" Labour promises everyone in England a ""free teeth MOT"" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford reiterates calls to be included in ITV's general election debate Joseph Lee and Vanessa Barford On a relatively quiet day for the campaign, we're bringing the live page to a close. We'll have coverage of any major developments on the rest of the site throughout the day. Here's a quick recap of some of today's events:  Ms Swinson also joins in the criticism of the Duke of York in his interview with BBC Newsnight for failing to acknowledge the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse and trafficking. She says: ""What I found hard to watch was the victims in these affairs were young women and girls who had been sexually abused, trafficked by Epstein, and the experience they had was traumatic, and for someone to be talking about it without really referencing that, without understanding that, without reaching out to understand that and how they must have felt was strange to see."" It was ""clearly not"" wise for him to do the interview, she says. And she says she was ""troubled"" by Prince Andrew's reference to sex being a ""positive act"" for a man - ""you have to take some sort of positive action"". ""I thought, 'Do you not think it's a positive act for a woman? Because if it's not a positive act, positive choice, that's not sex, that's rape. So I found that quite a worrying line."" In an interview with LBC, Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson criticises Conservative immigration plans and says the UK benefits from immigration. She says the Tory plans are ""predicated on an assumption that people coming to our country are trying to 'do us over'"". Ms Swinson says immigration is a ""mutual good thing"", rejecting each one of the Tory proposals put to her by presenter Iain Dale. ""At the moment we cause fear in those communities for the hoops we make them jump through for settled status - we are better than this,"" she says. The European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, is adding his voice to those calling on Boris Johnson to release the report into Russian interference in UK elections. He says if Russia did influence the UK's referendum in 2016, ""all European countries who face similar attacks need to know about it"". The Kremlin wants to ""divide the West"" and ""undermine democracies"", he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio 5 Live Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tells BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar on Politics that offers of peerages to his candidates to stand down shows how ""rotten and broken"" politics has become. On the same show, Conservative Security Minister Brandon Lewis had denied that any such deals had been offered. ""We are not offering deals, we are not doing deals,"" Mr Lewis said. But Mr Farage says: ""Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar?"" The Brexit Party candidate says she had two phone calls from No 10 offering her a role on the Brexit negotiating team to stand down. Mr Farage also says Sir Eddie Lister, a key Boris Johnson adviser, offered another candidate a job in higher education. ""Itâs corruption,"" he says. ""What shocks me is how little shock there is about this."" He says he does not expect to see any legal action taken, however. ""Are we going to have a politics based on rules or not?"" BBC Radio 5 Live One of the key figures involved in Labour's manifesto meeting yesterday, Len McCluskey, was speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics earlier. The leader of the Unite union says that working class voters who supported Leave should back Labour, because it is the only party offering an agenda that will improve their lives. He says: âOur message has got to be to those working class people,
for example who voted leave and may be considering voting for the Brexit party
or the Tories - they wonât do anything to change their lives. ""So my message to
your listeners is for people to come home to Labour, stay with
Labour.â He says the manifesto will build on 2017 pledges such as eliminating student debt, building a million homes, abolishing zero-hour contracts and offering a Â£10 minimum wage for young people. The manifesto will be accompanied by a ""grey book"" outlining the detailed spending commitments and how they will be funded, he says. âI would say to people who voted Leaveâ¦this will be about
whether people actually believe the Eton version of Del Boy in terms of Boris
Johnson or the cityâs answer to Del Boy in Nigel Farage and trust is going to
be a big issue,â Mr McCluskey says. More from the CBI, whose director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn was speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge earlier. She says there are ""real concerns"" for business about both of the main party's election pledges, with Labour's nationalisation plans undermining the economy and Conservative immigration plans creating a skills shortage. Asked if Jeremy Corbyn was a ""friend to business"", Dame Carolyn says: ""We look at the policies on the table and we have real concerns that they are going to crack the foundations of our economy."" She says the plans for free, publicly owned broadband would ""freeze investment"" and urges the party to ""work with business"". Restrictive Tory immigration proposals are ""a worry"", she says, adding that the country needs workers of all skill levels not just the ""brightest and best"". ""If you do want to build 200,000 houses a year, you don't just need the architects and the designers, you need the carpenters, you need the electricians, you need the labourers,"" Dame Carolyn says. ""We need people to come and help us renew our economy."" An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has found evidence that the government and military covered up allegations of war crimes -claims which the Ministry of Defence has rejected. Now SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald has responded, sayingthe Conservative government ""cannot be trusted"",externalto investigate the allegations. He says: ""What is outlined in these reports represent the most gross violations of the Geneva Convention and attempts to cover up crimes of the worst possible crimes."" But he adds that the ""allegations make clear that political interference by past Conservative ministers is part of the problem."" Mr McDonald says there is a case for a public inquiry and adds that the Human Rights Act must not be amended if it would prevent investigations into war crimes. ""The government must drop these plans at once,"" he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green Party co-leader Sian Berry also faced Sky's Sophy Ridge, saying the party was focusing on 11 seats but admitting that it faced an ""uphill battle"" to win them all. Many of the seats are part of their electoral pact with other Remain-supporting parties. ""Weâre really proud there are key seats where the
greens are standing as the strongest remain candidate,"" she says. She gave the example of a 23% swing in Bristol West in 2015 to support the idea that Green Party gains were possible. ""We can make big swings, Green members are fired up for this
election,"" she says. The other key target seat is in Sheffield, where there were widespread protests over plans to cut down thousands of trees. CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn has also been on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, telling the show that this is an ""extraordinary"" election for business. She says: ""Next year will be the most important year, I think in a generation, because we've seen so much uncertainty, investment plans put on hold."" Focus must return to long-term economic challenges, such as skills, climate change and inequality, she says. She also says infrastructure projects such as Heathrow's third runway and the Â£88bn HS2 railway are ""absolutely fundamental signals"" that the UK is ""open to the world"". Boris Johnson has sought to delay a decision on HS2 until after the election, but a draft report recommends it goes ahead despite rising costs. Earlier this year, the BBC announced thatit would means-test free TV licences for over-75sas part of its agreement with the government over its future funding. Now the SNP is making restoring the free TV licence to this age group an election pledge.

The 13-year-old is in a critical but stable condition. ""The baby was unharmed because his auntie is a hero. She's 13 years old and she threw her whole self over that baby, and she saved his life.

BBC Radio 5 Live One of the key figures involved in Labour's manifesto meeting yesterday, Len McCluskey, was speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics earlier. The leader of the Unite union says that working class voters who supported Leave should back Labour, because it is the only party offering an agenda that will improve their lives. He says: âOur message has got to be to those working class people,
for example who voted leave and may be considering voting for the Brexit party

your listeners is for people to come home to Labour, stay with
Labour.â He says the manifesto will build on 2017 pledges such as eliminating student debt, building a million homes, abolishing zero-hour contracts and offering a Â£10 minimum wage for young people. The manifesto will be accompanied by a ""grey book"" outlining the detailed spending commitments and how they will be funded, he says. âI would say to people who voted Leaveâ¦this will be about

Johnson or the cityâs answer to Del Boy in Nigel Farage and trust is going to

She says there are ""real concerns"" for business about both of the main party's election pledges, with Labour's nationalisation plans undermining the economy and Conservative immigration plans creating a skills shortage. Asked if Jeremy Corbyn was a ""friend to business"", Dame Carolyn says: ""We look at the policies on the table and we have real concerns that they are going to crack the foundations of our economy."" She says the plans for free, publicly owned broadband would ""freeze investment"" and urges the party to ""work with business"".

Now SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald has responded, sayingthe Conservative government ""cannot be trusted"",externalto investigate the allegations. He says: ""What is outlined in these reports represent the most gross violations of the Geneva Convention and attempts to cover up crimes of the worst possible crimes."" But he adds that the ""allegations make clear that political interference by past Conservative ministers is part of the problem."" Mr McDonald says there is a case for a public inquiry and adds that the Human Rights Act must not be amended if it would prevent investigations into war crimes.

"This video can not be played Police tear gas met with petrol bombs A stand-off at a Hong Kong university campus has led to fiery clashes overnight, as hundreds of protesters tried to repel a police advance. Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades. Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons. Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city. The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began. The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force. Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons. A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday. The protests explained in 100 and 500 words The context to Hong Kong protests Timeline of Hong Kong unrest How is Hong Kong run? The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside. Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT). They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus. Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated. This video can not be played Protesters around Hong Kong Polytechnic University have armed themselves with an array of weapons ""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday. ""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back."" Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university. By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck. Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped. Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug. The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police. The government recently confirmedthe city had entered its first recession for a decade. In recent days, Hong Kong's university campuses have been the scenes of pitched battles between police and demonstrators. A police truck on a bridge above the Cross Harbour tunnel, which links Kowloon and Hong Kong island, was set on fire on Sunday and it was forced to retreat by large crowds of protesters hiding behind umbrellas and hurling petrol bombs.

"25 days to go until the general election Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tells Andrew Marr his party plans a further referendum on Brexit - but ""can't commit"" to a Scottish independence referendum Asked about free movement of people from the EU to the UK after Brexit, he says there will be ""a great deal of movement"" Conservative Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab pledges to reduce immigration without ""arbitrary targets"" Labour promises everyone in England a ""free teeth MOT"" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford reiterates calls to be included in ITV's general election debate Joseph Lee and Vanessa Barford On a relatively quiet day for the campaign, we're bringing the live page to a close. We'll have coverage of any major developments on the rest of the site throughout the day. Here's a quick recap of some of today's events:  Ms Swinson also joins in the criticism of the Duke of York in his interview with BBC Newsnight for failing to acknowledge the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse and trafficking. She says: ""What I found hard to watch was the victims in these affairs were young women and girls who had been sexually abused, trafficked by Epstein, and the experience they had was traumatic, and for someone to be talking about it without really referencing that, without understanding that, without reaching out to understand that and how they must have felt was strange to see."" It was ""clearly not"" wise for him to do the interview, she says. And she says she was ""troubled"" by Prince Andrew's reference to sex being a ""positive act"" for a man - ""you have to take some sort of positive action"". ""I thought, 'Do you not think it's a positive act for a woman? Because if it's not a positive act, positive choice, that's not sex, that's rape. So I found that quite a worrying line."" In an interview with LBC, Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson criticises Conservative immigration plans and says the UK benefits from immigration. She says the Tory plans are ""predicated on an assumption that people coming to our country are trying to 'do us over'"". Ms Swinson says immigration is a ""mutual good thing"", rejecting each one of the Tory proposals put to her by presenter Iain Dale. ""At the moment we cause fear in those communities for the hoops we make them jump through for settled status - we are better than this,"" she says. The European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, is adding his voice to those calling on Boris Johnson to release the report into Russian interference in UK elections. He says if Russia did influence the UK's referendum in 2016, ""all European countries who face similar attacks need to know about it"". The Kremlin wants to ""divide the West"" and ""undermine democracies"", he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio 5 Live Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tells BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar on Politics that offers of peerages to his candidates to stand down shows how ""rotten and broken"" politics has become. On the same show, Conservative Security Minister Brandon Lewis had denied that any such deals had been offered. ""We are not offering deals, we are not doing deals,"" Mr Lewis said. But Mr Farage says: ""Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar?"" The Brexit Party candidate says she had two phone calls from No 10 offering her a role on the Brexit negotiating team to stand down. Mr Farage also says Sir Eddie Lister, a key Boris Johnson adviser, offered another candidate a job in higher education. ""Itâs corruption,"" he says. ""What shocks me is how little shock there is about this."" He says he does not expect to see any legal action taken, however. ""Are we going to have a politics based on rules or not?"" BBC Radio 5 Live One of the key figures involved in Labour's manifesto meeting yesterday, Len McCluskey, was speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics earlier. The leader of the Unite union says that working class voters who supported Leave should back Labour, because it is the only party offering an agenda that will improve their lives. He says: âOur message has got to be to those working class people,
for example who voted leave and may be considering voting for the Brexit party
or the Tories - they wonât do anything to change their lives. ""So my message to
your listeners is for people to come home to Labour, stay with
Labour.â He says the manifesto will build on 2017 pledges such as eliminating student debt, building a million homes, abolishing zero-hour contracts and offering a Â£10 minimum wage for young people. The manifesto will be accompanied by a ""grey book"" outlining the detailed spending commitments and how they will be funded, he says. âI would say to people who voted Leaveâ¦this will be about
whether people actually believe the Eton version of Del Boy in terms of Boris
Johnson or the cityâs answer to Del Boy in Nigel Farage and trust is going to
be a big issue,â Mr McCluskey says. More from the CBI, whose director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn was speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge earlier. She says there are ""real concerns"" for business about both of the main party's election pledges, with Labour's nationalisation plans undermining the economy and Conservative immigration plans creating a skills shortage. Asked if Jeremy Corbyn was a ""friend to business"", Dame Carolyn says: ""We look at the policies on the table and we have real concerns that they are going to crack the foundations of our economy."" She says the plans for free, publicly owned broadband would ""freeze investment"" and urges the party to ""work with business"". Restrictive Tory immigration proposals are ""a worry"", she says, adding that the country needs workers of all skill levels not just the ""brightest and best"". ""If you do want to build 200,000 houses a year, you don't just need the architects and the designers, you need the carpenters, you need the electricians, you need the labourers,"" Dame Carolyn says. ""We need people to come and help us renew our economy."" An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has found evidence that the government and military covered up allegations of war crimes -claims which the Ministry of Defence has rejected. Now SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald has responded, sayingthe Conservative government ""cannot be trusted"",externalto investigate the allegations. He says: ""What is outlined in these reports represent the most gross violations of the Geneva Convention and attempts to cover up crimes of the worst possible crimes."" But he adds that the ""allegations make clear that political interference by past Conservative ministers is part of the problem."" Mr McDonald says there is a case for a public inquiry and adds that the Human Rights Act must not be amended if it would prevent investigations into war crimes. ""The government must drop these plans at once,"" he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green Party co-leader Sian Berry also faced Sky's Sophy Ridge, saying the party was focusing on 11 seats but admitting that it faced an ""uphill battle"" to win them all. Many of the seats are part of their electoral pact with other Remain-supporting parties. ""Weâre really proud there are key seats where the
greens are standing as the strongest remain candidate,"" she says. She gave the example of a 23% swing in Bristol West in 2015 to support the idea that Green Party gains were possible. ""We can make big swings, Green members are fired up for this
election,"" she says. The other key target seat is in Sheffield, where there were widespread protests over plans to cut down thousands of trees. CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn has also been on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, telling the show that this is an ""extraordinary"" election for business. She says: ""Next year will be the most important year, I think in a generation, because we've seen so much uncertainty, investment plans put on hold."" Focus must return to long-term economic challenges, such as skills, climate change and inequality, she says. She also says infrastructure projects such as Heathrow's third runway and the Â£88bn HS2 railway are ""absolutely fundamental signals"" that the UK is ""open to the world"". Boris Johnson has sought to delay a decision on HS2 until after the election, but a draft report recommends it goes ahead despite rising costs. Earlier this year, the BBC announced thatit would means-test free TV licences for over-75sas part of its agreement with the government over its future funding. Now the SNP is making restoring the free TV licence to this age group an election pledge. The party also says the licence fee should be set independently of government to prevent a repeat of the issue. The SNP's Brendan OâHara says: ""We need to stop future governments from similar game-playing."" It is part of a package of measures for older people, including reversing cuts to pension credit and offering more support to women affected by the change in the state pension age.

The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn says Labour's nationalisation plans and proposals for free, universal services are ""very modest"". ""We not trying to grab hold of the economy,"" he says, identifying water and Royal Mail as among the services they want to nationalise. Taxing corporations by preventing them from concealing profits in low-tax nations will mean they can pay for their plans, he says. But he also says services like free dental checks are an ""investment for the future"" which can save money in the long run. The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn is asked for his view on Trident - Britain's nuclear deterrent. ""My view is that we have nuclear weapons, that there is a nuclear non-proliferation treaty,"" he says. ""Also I think we have to look at one of the real threats to
security around the world  - terrorists, cyber security and climate change."" He also says that under a Labour government, the UK will not sell arms to Saudi Arabia. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a controversial figure in Sri Lankan politics Sri Lanka's former wartime defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa has won a presidential election that has split the country along ethnic lines. Official results showed Mr Rajapaksa, 70, took 52.25% of the vote. His rival Sajith Premadasa had already conceded. Mr Rajapaksa was the clear victor in Sinhalese majority areas while Mr Premadasa scored better in the Tamil-dominated north. The election is Sri Lanka's first since the deadly Easter Sunday attacks. Militants linked to the Islamic State group targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island in April, killing more than 250 people. As a result, national security was seen as a dominant issue ahead of the vote. Sri Lanka unity a daunting task after election Who is Sri Lanka's controversial new president? Sri Lanka 'war crimes': Main allegations Mr Rajapaksa, who has positioned himself as a strong figure who can assure Sri Lankans' security, is a highly controversial figure among the country's more than two million Tamils. He and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president, spearheaded the defeat of separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, ending a decades-long war in which at least 100,000 people died. Supporters of the Rajapaksas celebrate with pictures of the two brothers Several journalists who were critics of the government when the Rajapaksas led Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 were abducted, tortured and killed. Thousands of people, particularly Tamils, vanished in what have been described as enforced disappearances. Earlier this year,Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the BBC that war crimes allegations against him were ""baseless"" Votes appeared to be starkly divided between the Sinhala Buddhist majority and minority Tamil, Hindu and Muslim groups, raising fears about the future of reconciliation in a country that remains heavily polarised along ethnic and religious lines a decade after the end of the bitter war. After his election win, Mr Rajapaksa made a call for unity in the country. ""It is my duty to serve all Sri Lankans without racial or religious discrimination,"" he said. ""I promise to discharge my duties in a fair manner."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Human rights groups expressed concern about accountability for wartime abuses - which were committed by both sides - given the election of a man so closely associated with the end of the conflict. Mr Premadasa, who took 42% of the vote, publicly conceded when partial results showed Mr Rajapaksa was certain to emerge the winner. ""It is my privilege to honour the decision of the people and congratulate Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his election as the seventh president of Sri Lanka,"" Mr Premadasa said. Turnout was 83.7%, the election commission said. Mr Rajapaksa is due to be sworn in at a ceremony on Monday. By Jill McGivering, BBC News, Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa commands passionate support among many in the Buddhist Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka. He and Mahinda, who was president here for 10 years, are credited with bringing an end to the country's long civil war. ""I think it's a turning point in the history of Sri Lanka,"" said a Rajapaksa supporter, lawyer Janaka Arunashantha. ""With economy and national security, I think the country will improve in every way in the next five years. We're very hopeful with him."" Sri Lanka is still in shock, seven months after the bomb attacks by a cell of Islamist militants which devastated the island's economy, blew apart the island's fragile communal relations and was the final blow to public confidence in a government already tarnished by infighting. But the news will be greeted with quiet dismay by many in the minority communities who voted overwhelmingly not for Mr Rajapaksa but his rival, Sajith Premadasa. They see him as a more liberal, inclusive choice. Unifying the different communities - and pursuing post-war reconciliation - will be a daunting task. Read more from Jill The Easter Sunday attacks cast a long shadow over the election. The government was forced to admit it had suffered a ""major intelligence lapse""after failing to adequately share information from Indian intelligence officials about a potential attack. But since the attacks, Muslims - who make up nearly 10% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people - say they have faced a more overt campaign of hate against them, fuelled by hardline Buddhist groups. Muslim shop owners say they have been boycotted and there have been outbreaks of mob violence. The family networks behind the bombings Controversial ex-defence chief eyes power Sri Lanka's Muslims 'demonised' after Easter bombings St Anthony's 'church of miracles' a symbol of hope A total of 35 candidates stood in the presidential election, the third since the end of the civil war. The country's incumbent president, Maithripala Sirisena, was not on the ballot. He decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. This video can not be played How the army finally crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after 25 years of bloody war Ruling party candidate Mr Premadasa focused on social issues as well as security - campaigning on a promise to eradicate poverty and improve housing. He is the son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993 and is the current housing minister. Sajith Premadasa had strong support among Tamil and Muslim voters The previous Rajapaksa era was marked by close ties between Sri Lanka and China, with the latter investing billions in infrastructure and development on the island. 'We don't like our land being given away to China' Searching for Father Francis 10 years after the war However the island's ballooning debt to Beijing worried many Sri Lankans. Regional powers including India expressed concern about the extent of Chinese influence in the country. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he planned to ""restore relations"" with China, if he won the election. Mr Premadasa, meanwhile, was seen as leaning more towards India and the US.

"This video can not be played British Special Forces have been accused of covering up the killings of four young Afghans in 2012 The UK government and armed forces have been accused of covering up the killing of civilians by British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has spoken to 11 British detectives who said they found credible evidence of war crimes. Soldiers should have been prosecuted for the killings, say insiders. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it rejected the unsubstantiated allegation of a pattern of cover-ups. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC ""all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at"". He said ""the right balance"" had been struck over decisions whether or not to investigate alleged war crimes. The new evidence has come from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government decided to close IHAT and Operation Northmoor, after Phil Shiner, a lawyer who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off as a solicitor following allegations he had paid fixers in Iraq to find clients. But former detectives from IHAT and Operation Northmoor said Phil Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down criminal investigations. None of the cases investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor resulted in a prosecution. One IHAT detective told Panorama: ""The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn't wriggle their way out of it."" Another former detective said the victims of war crimes had been badly let down: ""I use the word disgusting. And I feel for the families because... they're not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?"" Panorama has re-examined the evidence in a number of alleged war crimes cases. One such case investigated by IHAT was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003. Raid al-Mosawi was serving as an Iraqi policeman in Basra when he was shot dead Raid al-Mosawi was shot in an alleyway as he left his family home, and later died from his wounds. The incident was investigated at the time by the British soldier's commanding officer, Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen. Within 24 hours, Maj Suss-Francksen concluded the shooting was lawful because the Iraqi police officer had fired first and the soldier had acted in self-defence. His report said another British soldier had seen the shooting and confirmed the Iraqi had fired first. IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewed 80 British soldiers, including the soldier who had supposedly witnessed the shooting. But he told detectives he was not in the alleyway. In his statement to IHAT, this soldier directly contradicted Maj Suss-Francksen's report: ""This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true."" Raid's brother shows where the soldier was when he fired the fatal shot The soldier said he had only heard one shot, which suggested the policeman had not fired at all. This was confirmed by other witnesses interviewed by IHAT. Detectives concluded the soldier who shot Raid should be prosecuted for killing the Iraqi police officer and Maj Suss-Francksen should be charged with covering up what happened. But military prosecutors have not taken anyone to court. Maj Suss-Francksen's lawyer said: ""My client has not seen the IHAT material and is unable to offer any comment on the quality or reliability of the evidence gathered by the IHAT investigators or why it was insufficient to satisfy a prosecution of any soldier under UK law."" Operation Northmoor was set up by the government in 2014 and looked into 52 alleged illegal killings. Its closure was announced by the government before Royal Military Police detectives even had a chance to interview the key Afghan witnesses. One Northmoor detective said: ""I wouldn't write off a job until I have spoken to both parties. If you are writing off a job and the only thing you have got is the British account, how is that an investigation? ""My view is that every one of those deaths deserved to be examined and due process of law to take place."" The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. ""Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute."" ""The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations."" Quizzed about the allegations on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK wanted ""to have accountability where there's wrongdoing"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous "" He said: ""What we're quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don't lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who have served their country for years on end - and we've got the right balance."" Mr Raab refused to be drawn on whether these claims were new to him, and said that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous in the world"". Meanwhile, a lawyer who has represented several soldiers investigated by IHAT, dismissed the claims of war crimes as ""flawed, baseless and biased"". Hilary Meredith, chair of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, said the claims were a ""witch hunt against our brave servicemen"" which ""had no credibility whatsoever"". She added: ""Solicitor Phil Shiner, who masterminded countless false claims, was struck off the role of solicitors for good reason - he was found guilty of charges including dishonesty over false witness accounts about UK soldiers' actions.""

"This video can not be played Police tear gas met with petrol bombs A stand-off at a Hong Kong university campus has led to fiery clashes overnight, as hundreds of protesters tried to repel a police advance. Large fires broke out at entrances to the Polytechnic University (PolyU), where protesters hurled petrol bombs and shot arrows from behind barricades. Officers earlier warned they could use live ammunition if protesters did not stop attacking them using such weapons. Months of anti-government protests have caused turmoil in the city. The latest violence is some of the worst the semi-autonomous Chinese territory has seen since the movement began. The police have become targets for radical demonstrators, who accuse them of excessive force. Demonstrators have been occupying the PolyU for days. Fresh clashes erupted on Sunday, with tear gas and water cannon being met with petrol bombs, bricks and other improvised weapons. A police media liaison officer was wounded in the leg with an arrow on Sunday. The protests explained in 100 and 500 words The context to Hong Kong protests Timeline of Hong Kong unrest How is Hong Kong run? The protesters occupying the university had been told to leave immediately on Sunday evening but hundreds remained inside. Sporadic battles continued throughout the night, with police making a push to re-take the campus at about 05:30 local time (21:30 GMT). They were met with petrol bombs, which started blazes around the campus. Later, some protesters tried to leave the campus but were met with tear gas and retreated. This video can not be played Protesters around Hong Kong Polytechnic University have armed themselves with an array of weapons ""I hereby warn rioters not to use petrol bombs, arrows, cars or any deadly weapons to attack police officers,"" police spokesman Louis Lau said in a statement broadcast via Facebook late on Sunday. ""If they continue such dangerous actions, we would have no choice but to use the minimum force necessary, including live rounds, to fire back."" Earlier in the stand-off, police fired a live round in response to what they said was a car hurtling towards officers near the university. By the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Polytechnic University, at 04:00 Hong Kong time It's only the most radical left now - or the bravest, depending on your point of view. About a hundred of them are hunkered down at a junction outside the main entrance. On the other side of the road: an armoured police vehicle, and a water cannon truck. Every 10 minutes or so, these two sides play a game of cat and mouse. The police fire tear gas and the water cannon advances, squirting noxious blue liquid. The protesters, crouching behind umbrellas, respond with petrol bombs and rocks fired from improvised catapults. The police vehicles retreat. The net result is zero. It's a stalemate. There are several hundred more protesters milling around the campus. Medics treat those who have been hit by tear gas or the blue liquid in the water cannon, which stings on contact with the skin. Others man barricades at the many entrances to this sprawling campus which is now completely surrounded. When the police announced a 22:00 deadline for the protesters to surrender or face the possibility of lethal force a significant number changed out of their black outfits, ditched their masks, and disappeared into the night. Some were arrested but others escaped. Those who remain seem determined to fight to the end, no matter the risk. ""If I die, remember me,"" one young man said to me. ""Do you believe that could happen?"" I asked. He gave a nervous shrug. The protests in Hong Kong, which began in June, were triggered by a now-withdrawn plan to allow extradition to mainland China but have since expanded into wider demands for greater democracy and for investigations into the actions of police.

"This video can not be played British Special Forces have been accused of covering up the killings of four young Afghans in 2012 The UK government and armed forces have been accused of covering up the killing of civilians by British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has spoken to 11 British detectives who said they found credible evidence of war crimes. Soldiers should have been prosecuted for the killings, say insiders. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it rejected the unsubstantiated allegation of a pattern of cover-ups. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC ""all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at"". He said ""the right balance"" had been struck over decisions whether or not to investigate alleged war crimes. The new evidence has come from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government decided to close IHAT and Operation Northmoor, after Phil Shiner, a lawyer who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off as a solicitor following allegations he had paid fixers in Iraq to find clients. But former detectives from IHAT and Operation Northmoor said Phil Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down criminal investigations. None of the cases investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor resulted in a prosecution. One IHAT detective told Panorama: ""The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn't wriggle their way out of it."" Another former detective said the victims of war crimes had been badly let down: ""I use the word disgusting. And I feel for the families because... they're not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?"" Panorama has re-examined the evidence in a number of alleged war crimes cases. One such case investigated by IHAT was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003. Raid al-Mosawi was serving as an Iraqi policeman in Basra when he was shot dead Raid al-Mosawi was shot in an alleyway as he left his family home, and later died from his wounds. The incident was investigated at the time by the British soldier's commanding officer, Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen. Within 24 hours, Maj Suss-Francksen concluded the shooting was lawful because the Iraqi police officer had fired first and the soldier had acted in self-defence. His report said another British soldier had seen the shooting and confirmed the Iraqi had fired first. IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewed 80 British soldiers, including the soldier who had supposedly witnessed the shooting. But he told detectives he was not in the alleyway. In his statement to IHAT, this soldier directly contradicted Maj Suss-Francksen's report: ""This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true."" Raid's brother shows where the soldier was when he fired the fatal shot The soldier said he had only heard one shot, which suggested the policeman had not fired at all. This was confirmed by other witnesses interviewed by IHAT. Detectives concluded the soldier who shot Raid should be prosecuted for killing the Iraqi police officer and Maj Suss-Francksen should be charged with covering up what happened. But military prosecutors have not taken anyone to court. Maj Suss-Francksen's lawyer said: ""My client has not seen the IHAT material and is unable to offer any comment on the quality or reliability of the evidence gathered by the IHAT investigators or why it was insufficient to satisfy a prosecution of any soldier under UK law."" Operation Northmoor was set up by the government in 2014 and looked into 52 alleged illegal killings. Its closure was announced by the government before Royal Military Police detectives even had a chance to interview the key Afghan witnesses. One Northmoor detective said: ""I wouldn't write off a job until I have spoken to both parties. If you are writing off a job and the only thing you have got is the British account, how is that an investigation? ""My view is that every one of those deaths deserved to be examined and due process of law to take place."" The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. ""Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute."" ""The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations."" Quizzed about the allegations on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK wanted ""to have accountability where there's wrongdoing"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous "" He said: ""What we're quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don't lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who have served their country for years on end - and we've got the right balance."" Mr Raab refused to be drawn on whether these claims were new to him, and said that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous in the world"". Meanwhile, a lawyer who has represented several soldiers investigated by IHAT, dismissed the claims of war crimes as ""flawed, baseless and biased"". Hilary Meredith, chair of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, said the claims were a ""witch hunt against our brave servicemen"" which ""had no credibility whatsoever"". She added: ""Solicitor Phil Shiner, who masterminded countless false claims, was struck off the role of solicitors for good reason - he was found guilty of charges including dishonesty over false witness accounts about UK soldiers' actions.""

"Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a controversial figure in Sri Lankan politics Sri Lanka's former wartime defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa has won a presidential election that has split the country along ethnic lines. Official results showed Mr Rajapaksa, 70, took 52.25% of the vote. His rival Sajith Premadasa had already conceded. Mr Rajapaksa was the clear victor in Sinhalese majority areas while Mr Premadasa scored better in the Tamil-dominated north. The election is Sri Lanka's first since the deadly Easter Sunday attacks. Militants linked to the Islamic State group targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island in April, killing more than 250 people. As a result, national security was seen as a dominant issue ahead of the vote. Sri Lanka unity a daunting task after election Who is Sri Lanka's controversial new president? Sri Lanka 'war crimes': Main allegations Mr Rajapaksa, who has positioned himself as a strong figure who can assure Sri Lankans' security, is a highly controversial figure among the country's more than two million Tamils. He and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president, spearheaded the defeat of separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, ending a decades-long war in which at least 100,000 people died. Supporters of the Rajapaksas celebrate with pictures of the two brothers Several journalists who were critics of the government when the Rajapaksas led Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 were abducted, tortured and killed. Thousands of people, particularly Tamils, vanished in what have been described as enforced disappearances. Earlier this year,Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the BBC that war crimes allegations against him were ""baseless"" Votes appeared to be starkly divided between the Sinhala Buddhist majority and minority Tamil, Hindu and Muslim groups, raising fears about the future of reconciliation in a country that remains heavily polarised along ethnic and religious lines a decade after the end of the bitter war. After his election win, Mr Rajapaksa made a call for unity in the country. ""It is my duty to serve all Sri Lankans without racial or religious discrimination,"" he said. ""I promise to discharge my duties in a fair manner."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Human rights groups expressed concern about accountability for wartime abuses - which were committed by both sides - given the election of a man so closely associated with the end of the conflict. Mr Premadasa, who took 42% of the vote, publicly conceded when partial results showed Mr Rajapaksa was certain to emerge the winner. ""It is my privilege to honour the decision of the people and congratulate Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his election as the seventh president of Sri Lanka,"" Mr Premadasa said. Turnout was 83.7%, the election commission said. Mr Rajapaksa is due to be sworn in at a ceremony on Monday. By Jill McGivering, BBC News, Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa commands passionate support among many in the Buddhist Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka. He and Mahinda, who was president here for 10 years, are credited with bringing an end to the country's long civil war. ""I think it's a turning point in the history of Sri Lanka,"" said a Rajapaksa supporter, lawyer Janaka Arunashantha. ""With economy and national security, I think the country will improve in every way in the next five years. We're very hopeful with him."" Sri Lanka is still in shock, seven months after the bomb attacks by a cell of Islamist militants which devastated the island's economy, blew apart the island's fragile communal relations and was the final blow to public confidence in a government already tarnished by infighting. But the news will be greeted with quiet dismay by many in the minority communities who voted overwhelmingly not for Mr Rajapaksa but his rival, Sajith Premadasa. They see him as a more liberal, inclusive choice. Unifying the different communities - and pursuing post-war reconciliation - will be a daunting task. Read more from Jill The Easter Sunday attacks cast a long shadow over the election. The government was forced to admit it had suffered a ""major intelligence lapse""after failing to adequately share information from Indian intelligence officials about a potential attack. But since the attacks, Muslims - who make up nearly 10% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people - say they have faced a more overt campaign of hate against them, fuelled by hardline Buddhist groups. Muslim shop owners say they have been boycotted and there have been outbreaks of mob violence. The family networks behind the bombings Controversial ex-defence chief eyes power Sri Lanka's Muslims 'demonised' after Easter bombings St Anthony's 'church of miracles' a symbol of hope A total of 35 candidates stood in the presidential election, the third since the end of the civil war. The country's incumbent president, Maithripala Sirisena, was not on the ballot. He decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. This video can not be played How the army finally crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after 25 years of bloody war Ruling party candidate Mr Premadasa focused on social issues as well as security - campaigning on a promise to eradicate poverty and improve housing. He is the son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993 and is the current housing minister. Sajith Premadasa had strong support among Tamil and Muslim voters The previous Rajapaksa era was marked by close ties between Sri Lanka and China, with the latter investing billions in infrastructure and development on the island. 'We don't like our land being given away to China' Searching for Father Francis 10 years after the war However the island's ballooning debt to Beijing worried many Sri Lankans. Regional powers including India expressed concern about the extent of Chinese influence in the country. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he planned to ""restore relations"" with China, if he won the election. Mr Premadasa, meanwhile, was seen as leaning more towards India and the US.

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do' The Duke of York has ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with an American woman, who says she was forced to have sex with him aged 17. Answering questions about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a BBC interview, Prince Andrew said the alleged incidents ""never happened"". Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince three times. The prince said he was at home with his children on one of the occasions. Prince Andrew, who is the Queen's third child, has been facing questions for several months over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. Virginia Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts - has said she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew  between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Speaking to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, the prince said: ""It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened."" ""I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever."" He said Ms Giuffre's account of him ""profusely sweating"" and ""pouring with perspiration"" when they danced at the club on the night in 2001 when she says they first had sex was impossible, because he had a medical condition preventing him from perspiring. ANALYSIS:'Little apology or remorse' TRANSCRIPT:Read Prince Andrew's interview in full AS IT HAPPENED:Newsnight interview REACTION:Prince Andrew 'bulldozed' into interview In an extraordinary interview, which you can watch in full onBBC iPlayerin the UK orYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the duke said: He had investigations carried out to establish whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre was faked, but they were inconclusive He would testify under oath if ""push came to shove"" and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited him to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He does not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him Addressing Ms Giuffre's claims that she had dined with the prince, danced with him at a nightclub, and went on to have sex with him at the house of Ghislaine Maxwell, a friend of the prince, in Belgravia, central London, he said ""there are a number of things that are wrong with that story"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' He said the date when Ms Giuffre says he had sex with her was 10 March 2001, when he had taken his daughter Beatrice to Pizza Express in Woking for a party before spending the night at home. ""Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do,"" he said. ""I remember it weirdly distinctly."" Ms Giuffre described him providing her with alcohol at a nightclub, but Prince Andrew said: ""I don't drink, I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there."" BACKGROUND:Who was Jeffrey Epstein? TIMELINE:Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein GIUFFRE:Prince Andrew 'was an abuser' On claims he was sweating, he said: ""I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time,"" he said, blaming it on ""an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War"". He said he had only started to be able to sweat again ""in the recent past"". Asked about a photograph of him and Ms Giuffre being taken at Ghislaine Maxwell's house, he said he had ""absolutely no memory"" of it. The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 ""Investigations that we've done"" have been unable to prove whether the photograph was faked, he said, ""because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph"". Prince Andrew said he did not recall going upstairs in that house, said he was not dressed as he usually would be if he was in London and added ""we can't be certain as to whether or not that's my hand"". ""I'm at a loss to explain this particular photograph,"" he said. On the further accusation that he had sex with her in New York, the duke denied he was present at Epstein's home that day, although he had been travelling in the US. He also denied the claim he had sex with her on Epstein's private island with a group of seven or eight other girls. ""Absolutely no to all of it,"" he said. Prince Andrew said he never suspected Epstein's criminal behaviour on his visits, describing the house as a busy place with staff like Buckingham Palace. This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 He said: ""I live in an institution at Buckingham Palace which has members of staff walking around all the time and I don't wish to appear grand but there were a lot of people who were walking around Jeffrey Epstein's house. As far as I aware, they were staff."" But he denied that there were large numbers of underage girls present and said Epstein ""may have changed his behaviour patterns not to be obvious to me"". Asked if he would testify under oath, the duke said: ""I'm like everybody else and I will have to take all the legal advice that there was before I was to do that sort of thing. But if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so, then I would be duty bound to do so."" The duke rejected the perception of him as ""the party prince"" in the past, and said ""going to Jeffrey's was not about partying, absolutely not"". He said he had first met Epstein through his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell in 1999 but it was a ""stretch"" to say they were close friends and they saw each other ""a maximum of three times a year"". Prince Andrew acknowledged he had stayed on Epstein's private island, visited his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and travelled on his private plane. He said he wanted to learn more about the ""international business world and so that was another reason"" for going to visit the US financier in New York, as the prince became special representative for international trade and investment. He invited Epstein to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday at Windsor Castle in July 2006 but said ""certainly I wasn't aware"" that a warrant had been issued in May for his arrest for sex crimes. But the duke said he ceased contact with Epstein later that year, until 2010. Epstein was convicted of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008. The then 55-year-old Epstein received an 18-month prison sentence after prosecutors forged a deal with him. Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship In July 2010, Epstein was released and in December, Prince Andrew went to visit him in his New York mansion. Challenged on his decision to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender, he said: ""I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together."" He stayed several days and attended a dinner party, however. ""It was a convenient place to stay,"" he said, but added ""with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do"". The duke denied an account by another guest that he had been seen receiving a foot massage from a Russian woman. Asked about a picture of him and Epstein taken in Central Park in 2010, Prince Andrew said ""somebody very cleverly took that photograph"" but that they had not been able to ""find any evidence"" that Epstein had set it up. The fallout over Epstein's arrest had been ""a constant sore in the family"", the prince said. Following the allegations made against him in a 2015 deposition, Prince Andrew said the wider Royal Family ""couldn't be more supportive"" and his immediate family ""were at a loss"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew: Epstein 'a constant sore in the family' The duke denied the episode had been damaging to the Queen, but said ""it has to me, and it's been a constant drip in the background that people want to know"". He said he would like to be able to give ""closure"" on the issue but ""I'm just as much in the dark as many people"". He said that choosing to talk about the allegations was ""almost a mental health issue to some extent for me"", adding that ""it's been nagging at my mind for a great many years"". Meeting Epstein after his conviction was ""the wrong decision and the wrong judgement"" but the allegations from Ms Giuffre were ""surprising, shocking and a distraction"", he said. But he refused to entirely disavow his relationship with Epstein, saying it had ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"" that were unrelated to the accusations against them both. ""Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,"" he said. After interviewer Emily Maitlis challenged him, describing Epstein as a sex offender, the duke said: ""Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm being polite.""

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The Duke of York stands by his decision to take part in an interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sources have told the BBC. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"". It came after the prince's interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday was described as a ""car crash"". In the interview, the prince denied having sex with a then 17-year-old girl - Virginia Giuffre. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as ""excruciating"". The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the prince was ""very damaged"" by the interview and the opportunity to clear his name had ""failed, badly"". This video can not be played Mr Arbiter says ""questions will be asked"" in the palace about the decision Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she understood the Queen herself had given her approval for the interview to go ahead. Writingin The Times newspaper,external, she said it seemed the Queen was ""on board"" for the interview, after Prince Andrew had sought approval from ""higher up"". For several months the Duke of York had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17. A lawyer for some ofEpstein's alleged victimsurged the prince to talk under oath to the US authorities. Asked about the prince's decision to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, Mr Arbiter said he thought many questions would be asked in Buckingham Palace. He said: ""They will be wondering: Was this the right decision? Was the right decision made? Who made the decision to put him on? Did he make it himself or did he seek advice within the Palace? Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims ""My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice. ""Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror at the very suggestion that he puts himself up in front of a television camera to explain away his actions and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."" He added that the interview was ""not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash"". Mr Arbiter said he believed the interview would have an impact on the Duke of York's relationships with various charities. Ahead of Saturday's interview, Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Fergusonwrote of her support,externalfor him on social media. She said: ""I am deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man, [who] dares to put his shoulder to the wind and stands firm with his sense of honour and truth."" But other royal experts also questioned the prince's decision to speak so publicly about his relationship with Epstein. Royal biographer Angela Levin said she was gripped by the interview but felt it was ""ill-judged"" to offer insights into his life with Epstein. ""Unfortunately it was a sign of his arrogance,"" she said. ""He has always been arrogant. ""The Queen's motto is don't complain don't explain. I think in her heart she will be extremely embarrassed. ""I know for a fact Prince Andrew does not listen to his advisers. ""A very senior member of the press team left suddenly two weeks ago and the implication is he would not have approved of what Prince Andrew did."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship Another royal biographer, Catharine Mayer, spent time with Prince Andrew in 2004 in China on a trade mission and said the interview was ""terrible because it erased the victims of Epstein"". ""It was as bad as I expected,"" she said. ""Probably worse. ""He did not mention those women once."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond said the interview reminded her of onePrincess Diana gave to Panorama in 1995where she ""spilled her soul"". Mrs Bond added that Princes Andrew's lack of remorse in his interview was a ""glaring hole"". Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the young women who say they were victims of Epstein, said ""there is so much truth that is yet to be revealed"".

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The Duke of York stands by his decision to take part in an interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sources have told the BBC. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"". It came after the prince's interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday was described as a ""car crash"". In the interview, the prince denied having sex with a then 17-year-old girl - Virginia Giuffre. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as ""excruciating"". The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the prince was ""very damaged"" by the interview and the opportunity to clear his name had ""failed, badly"". This video can not be played Mr Arbiter says ""questions will be asked"" in the palace about the decision Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she understood the Queen herself had given her approval for the interview to go ahead. Writingin The Times newspaper,external, she said it seemed the Queen was ""on board"" for the interview, after Prince Andrew had sought approval from ""higher up"". For several months the Duke of York had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17. A lawyer for some ofEpstein's alleged victimsurged the prince to talk under oath to the US authorities. Asked about the prince's decision to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, Mr Arbiter said he thought many questions would be asked in Buckingham Palace. He said: ""They will be wondering: Was this the right decision? Was the right decision made? Who made the decision to put him on? Did he make it himself or did he seek advice within the Palace? Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims ""My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice. ""Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror at the very suggestion that he puts himself up in front of a television camera to explain away his actions and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."" He added that the interview was ""not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash"". Mr Arbiter said he believed the interview would have an impact on the Duke of York's relationships with various charities. Ahead of Saturday's interview, Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Fergusonwrote of her support,externalfor him on social media. She said: ""I am deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man, [who] dares to put his shoulder to the wind and stands firm with his sense of honour and truth."" But other royal experts also questioned the prince's decision to speak so publicly about his relationship with Epstein. Royal biographer Angela Levin said she was gripped by the interview but felt it was ""ill-judged"" to offer insights into his life with Epstein. ""Unfortunately it was a sign of his arrogance,"" she said. ""He has always been arrogant. ""The Queen's motto is don't complain don't explain. I think in her heart she will be extremely embarrassed. ""I know for a fact Prince Andrew does not listen to his advisers. ""A very senior member of the press team left suddenly two weeks ago and the implication is he would not have approved of what Prince Andrew did."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship Another royal biographer, Catharine Mayer, spent time with Prince Andrew in 2004 in China on a trade mission and said the interview was ""terrible because it erased the victims of Epstein"". ""It was as bad as I expected,"" she said. ""Probably worse. ""He did not mention those women once."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond said the interview reminded her of onePrincess Diana gave to Panorama in 1995where she ""spilled her soul"". Mrs Bond added that Princes Andrew's lack of remorse in his interview was a ""glaring hole"". Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the young women who say they were victims of Epstein, said ""there is so much truth that is yet to be revealed"". She added: ""I would say to Prince Andrew: the charges made by [Virginia Giuffre] against you are very, very serious charges.

"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 The US businesswoman at the centre of a misconduct controversy involving Boris Johnson has said he ""cast me aside like I am some gremlin"". It is alleged that Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London due to their friendship, claims he denies. Ms Arcuri told ITV,externalshe had kept his ""secrets"" but that her requests to him for media advice had been ""blocked"". The Conservatives say any claims of impropriety are ""unfounded"". Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? Johnson 'fails to answer Arcuri questions' Johnson, Arcuri, and the mysterious Annie Tacker During the interview to be aired later, Ms Arcuri addressed the now prime minister directly, saying: ""I've been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive, and a true confidante of yours. ""I've kept your secrets, and I've been your friend. ""And I don't understand why you've blocked me and ignored me as if I was some fleeting one-night stand or some girl that you picked up at a bar because I wasn't - and you know that. ""And I'm terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside like I am some gremlin."" Ms Arcuri appearing on the BBC's Talking Business programme in 2013 Her latest interview, follows allegations,first reported in the Sunday Times,externalin September, that Ms Arcuri's business was given Â£126,000 in public money along with privileged access to three foreign trade trips led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor, between 2008 and 2016. The Greater London Authority (GLA) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor - launched an investigation into the alleged conflict of interest following the paper's report. That probe was paused after the authority referred the claims to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The watchdog will now decide whether or not to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office - before the GLA decides whether to continue its own probe. Last month, a government review ruled thata Â£100,000 government grant given to Ms Arcuri's business was ""appropriate"". Ms Arcuri said she had tried to ask Mr Johnson for advice on how to handle media attention over the allegations, but was left feeling ""humiliated"" after being told ""there are bigger things at stake"" by an aide. She added: ""I was brushed off as if I was one of Kennedy's girlfriends showing up to his White House switchboard, you know, here to do my, you know, calling"". Ms Arcuri would not be drawn on the nature of their relationship during the interview, but said that she had come under pressure from friends to ""admit the affair"". In response to the programme, the Conservative Party said it considered the decision to refer Mr Johnson to the police watchdog as ""vexatious and politically motivated"". A spokesman added that any claims of impropriety in office by Mr Johnson were ""untrue and unfounded"". 22 September:The Sunday Times publishes allegations about Mr Johnson's friendship with Ms Arcuri 24 September:The London Assembly gives Mr Johnson 14 days to provide ""details and a timeline of contact"" with Ms Arcuri 27 September:The monitoring officer of the Greater London Authority refers Mr Johnson to the Independent Office for Police Conduct 29 September:Mr Johnson denies any wrongdoing and tells BBC News everything was done ""with full propriety"" 7 October:Ms Arcuri tells ITV's Good Morning Britain programme she ""never spoke"" to Boris Johnson for help to secure any grants or sponsorship for her company 9 October:The London Assembly says a response it received from Number 10 does not answer its questions 31 October:Government rules the Â£100,000 grant given to Jennifer Arcuri's company was ""appropriate"" Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about?

"This video can not be played John Bel Edwards addressed supporters after taking victory Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards has secured a second term as Louisiana governor after a tightly fought election race. Mr Edwards faced a strong challenge from Republican Eddie Rispone, winning with 51% of the vote. It comes as a blow to President Donald Trump who backed his fellow Republican. Mr Trump visited the state three times during the past two weeks, turning the race into a test of his own popularity in the southern state. ""Tonight, the people of Louisiana have chosen to chart their own path,"" Mr Edwards told a crowd of supporters on Saturday. ""And as for the president, God bless his heart,"" he added, drawing laughter from some onlookers. Mr Edwards, 53, was first elected governor in 2015 and remains the only state-wide elected Democrat in the historically Republican state. He positioned himself as a conservative Democrat, supporting the expansion of Obama-era healthcare reforms but opposing abortion and gun restrictions. Republican contender Eddie Rispone positioned himself as a ""conservative outsider"" with backing from President Trump The campaign also drew on the success of tax increases under his first term, which helped to end the state's overwhelming financial deficits. The new money has been used to fund investment in public colleges and the first pay rise in a decade for teachers. His Republican rival, Mr Rispone, billed himself as a ""conservative outsider"" in the mould of President Trump, and spent over $12m (Â£9.3m) of his own money on the race. But he avoided many traditional public events during the campaign, and often side-stepped questions about his plans for tax cuts and constitutional reform. ""We have nothing to be ashamed of,"" Mr Rispone told supporters after receiving news of his defeat. ""We had over 700,000 people in Louisiana really want something better and something different.""

"Actor Stephen Graham has opened up about the time he attempted to take his own life, after suffering a breakdown. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the star of Line of Duty, The Irishman and This Is England said he ""didn't know how to cope"" at the time. The ordeal came about after he had left home to go to drama school in London. The 46-year-old said a series of traumatic family events that occurred before he moved away from home for the first time contributed to his collapse. In the space of a few years, his beloved grandmother died and his mother gave birth to a stillborn child. ""I'd been through these few traumatic things and never really grieved,"" said the Liverpudlian actor. His mother later became pregnant again and a baby brother arrived the day before Graham, then 20, went to start his new life in the capital. ""This beautiful joyous occasion of this little boy coming into my life and mum and pop's life and then me having to leave was kind of a bit difficult,"" he told host Lauren Laverne. ""But when you're 20 you have the world in front of you haven't you, so you try not to focus on that stuff."" He added: ""I had a breakdown with all of these things that had happened traumatically from my late teens that I hadn't really dealt with or I hadn't come to terms with."" Stephen Graham played undercover officer DS John Corbett in Line of Duty The star recalled how he returned home and tried to explain his feelings to his parents, who tried to help him, but in vain. He went on to attempt to hang himself in his room. ""It was very calculated,"" he said. ""I heard my nanna's voice - and I know it sounds strange and weird... and she shouted 'Stephen' and I thought I'd gone, because I'd tried to do that. And I just came to, I opened my eyes and the rope had snapped, thankfully. ""And then I put a high neck jumper on, one of them zip-up jumpers, and my ma and da came back and then my mum kind of saw it and she went, 'What's that?' And she seen it properly and then the three of us... I really opened up then, everything just came out and I just [said], 'I don't know how to cope.'

Mind also has a confidential telephone helpline- 0300 123 339 (Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm). His best friends Lee and Jamie were ""magnificent"", he said. ""They were really supportive and my mum and dad and slowly built me back, slowly come around to the understanding it was OK. Life was worth living, thankfully."" Graham also spoke about how he first attended a youth theatre group at Liverpool's Everyman theatre as a teenager on the advice of local actor Andrew Schofield, who lived over the road from his grandmother. One of Graham's grandfathers was Jamaican, and he told Laverne that at times in his youth he didn't know where he ""belonged"". ""There were times there growing up when I was slightly unsure where I fitted in,"" he said, referencing his white and black cousins. He stressed that his parents encouraged him ""to find my own way within it"". Graham (second left) with Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and the cast of The Irishman last month He can now be seen playing mobster Anthony Provenzano in Martin Scorsese's film The Irishman. The director had previously cast him in Gangs of New York and as Al Capone in HBO's Boardwalk Empire. Martin Scorsese's The Irishman review âââââ Graham admitted he was ""really nervous"" to meet Robert De Niro, his co-star in The Irishman, because movies like The Godfather, Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter were ""the films that I grew up on"". His dad showed them to him on video straight after he confessed to having a proper interest in acting. ""That weekend we watched those three films, and I think we watched The Godfather twice actually. It was amazing,"" he recalled. ""But that was that kind of a moment where he went to me, 'If you're serious, this is how it's done, seriously and brilliantly.' That began my love affair with films.""

"This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' The Duke of York stands by his decision to take part in an interview about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sources have told the BBC. People close to Prince Andrew said he wanted to address the issues head-on and did so with ""honesty and humility"". It came after the prince's interview with BBC Newsnight on Saturday was described as a ""car crash"". In the interview, the prince denied having sex with a then 17-year-old girl - Virginia Giuffre. Six things we learned from Prince Andrew interview Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as ""excruciating"". The BBC's royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the prince was ""very damaged"" by the interview and the opportunity to clear his name had ""failed, badly"". This video can not be played Mr Arbiter says ""questions will be asked"" in the palace about the decision Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she understood the Queen herself had given her approval for the interview to go ahead. Writingin The Times newspaper,external, she said it seemed the Queen was ""on board"" for the interview, after Prince Andrew had sought approval from ""higher up"". For several months the Duke of York had been facing questions over his ties to Epstein - an American financier who, at the age of 66, took his own life while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Prince Andrew ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre known at the time as Virginia Roberts. The first occasion, she said, took place when she was aged 17. A lawyer for some ofEpstein's alleged victimsurged the prince to talk under oath to the US authorities. Asked about the prince's decision to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis, Mr Arbiter said he thought many questions would be asked in Buckingham Palace. He said: ""They will be wondering: Was this the right decision? Was the right decision made? Who made the decision to put him on? Did he make it himself or did he seek advice within the Palace? Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims ""My guess is that he bulldozed his way in and decided he was going to do it himself without any advice. ""Any sensible-thinking person in the PR business would have thrown their hands up in horror at the very suggestion that he puts himself up in front of a television camera to explain away his actions and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein."" He added that the interview was ""not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash"". Mr Arbiter said he believed the interview would have an impact on the Duke of York's relationships with various charities. Ahead of Saturday's interview, Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Fergusonwrote of her support,externalfor him on social media. She said: ""I am deeply supportive and proud of this giant of a principled man, [who] dares to put his shoulder to the wind and stands firm with his sense of honour and truth."" But other royal experts also questioned the prince's decision to speak so publicly about his relationship with Epstein. Royal biographer Angela Levin said she was gripped by the interview but felt it was ""ill-judged"" to offer insights into his life with Epstein. ""Unfortunately it was a sign of his arrogance,"" she said. ""He has always been arrogant. ""The Queen's motto is don't complain don't explain. I think in her heart she will be extremely embarrassed. ""I know for a fact Prince Andrew does not listen to his advisers. ""A very senior member of the press team left suddenly two weeks ago and the implication is he would not have approved of what Prince Andrew did."" Prince Andrew said this meeting with Epstein in 2010 was to end their relationship Another royal biographer, Catharine Mayer, spent time with Prince Andrew in 2004 in China on a trade mission and said the interview was ""terrible because it erased the victims of Epstein"". ""It was as bad as I expected,"" she said. ""Probably worse. ""He did not mention those women once."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond said the interview reminded her of onePrincess Diana gave to Panorama in 1995where she ""spilled her soul"". Mrs Bond added that Princes Andrew's lack of remorse in his interview was a ""glaring hole"". Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the young women who say they were victims of Epstein, said ""there is so much truth that is yet to be revealed"". She added: ""I would say to Prince Andrew: the charges made by [Virginia Giuffre] against you are very, very serious charges. ""I think the right and honourable thing to do would be for you to say unequivocally 'I will voluntarily speak to the FBI, I know it is the right thing to do, I have nothing to hide'."" In the lengthy interview, which UK viewers can watch in full onBBC iPlayeror onYouTube,externalelsewhere in the world, the duke said that: On the date Virginia Giuffre says he had sex with her - 10 March, 2001, he had taken his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking for a party before spending the night at home He dismissed claims he was sweating profusely because he had a ""peculiar medical condition"" meaning he cannot sweat, caused by an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War He had commissioned investigations into whether a photograph of him with Ms Giuffre had been faked, but they were inconclusive Speaking out about his relationship with the financier had become almost ""a mental health issue"" for him He would testify under oath about his relationship with Ms Giuffre if ""push came to shove"", and his lawyers advised him to He was unaware of an arrest warrant against Epstein when he invited the financier to Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle He did not regret his friendship with Epstein because of ""the opportunities I was given to learn"" from him about trade and business The duke was pictured with his accuser in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home in 2001 ""Car crash"" and ""disaster"" are some of the kinder words that spring to mind about Prince Andrew's misbegotten foray into the long-form interview. The reaction of the press and commentators is withering. Social media is burning with mockery, ridicule and a fair amount of anger. To a fair number of people doubtful about the worth of the monarchy, Prince Andrew has emerged as an avatar of all that is wrong with the institution. There is a reason the Royals don't do 'no-holds-barred' interviews. Unsurprisingly, given that they live in Palaces and have servants, they are somewhat out of touch. Which is why Prince Andrew spoke of ""a straightforward shooting weekend"" and appeared to smirk at the idea of going for a pizza in Woking. Neglecting to even mention the victims of his friend Jeffrey Epstein compounded the impression of a man who entirely fails to grasp the spirit of the times. Defending his friendship with a convicted child sex offender on the grounds that he had met lots of interesting people because of him suggested a degree of self-absorption that would not survive exposure to the outside world. Who in his staff thought this interview would be a good idea and what does Prince Andrew do next? He is very damaged. The interview was an opportunity to clear his name and rescue his reputation.  It has failed, badly. Prince Andrew: 'No indication' about Epstein.

"This video can not be played British Special Forces have been accused of covering up the killings of four young Afghans in 2012 The UK government and armed forces have been accused of covering up the killing of civilians by British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has spoken to 11 British detectives who said they found credible evidence of war crimes. Soldiers should have been prosecuted for the killings, say insiders. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it rejected the unsubstantiated allegation of a pattern of cover-ups. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC ""all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at"". He said ""the right balance"" had been struck over decisions whether or not to investigate alleged war crimes. The new evidence has come from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government decided to close IHAT and Operation Northmoor, after Phil Shiner, a lawyer who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off as a solicitor following allegations he had paid fixers in Iraq to find clients. But former detectives from IHAT and Operation Northmoor said Phil Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down criminal investigations. None of the cases investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor resulted in a prosecution. One IHAT detective told Panorama: ""The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn't wriggle their way out of it."" Another former detective said the victims of war crimes had been badly let down: ""I use the word disgusting. And I feel for the families because... they're not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?"" Panorama has re-examined the evidence in a number of alleged war crimes cases. One such case investigated by IHAT was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003. Raid al-Mosawi was serving as an Iraqi policeman in Basra when he was shot dead Raid al-Mosawi was shot in an alleyway as he left his family home, and later died from his wounds. The incident was investigated at the time by the British soldier's commanding officer, Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen. Within 24 hours, Maj Suss-Francksen concluded the shooting was lawful because the Iraqi police officer had fired first and the soldier had acted in self-defence. His report said another British soldier had seen the shooting and confirmed the Iraqi had fired first. IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewed 80 British soldiers, including the soldier who had supposedly witnessed the shooting. But he told detectives he was not in the alleyway. In his statement to IHAT, this soldier directly contradicted Maj Suss-Francksen's report: ""This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true."" Raid's brother shows where the soldier was when he fired the fatal shot The soldier said he had only heard one shot, which suggested the policeman had not fired at all. This was confirmed by other witnesses interviewed by IHAT. Detectives concluded the soldier who shot Raid should be prosecuted for killing the Iraqi police officer and Maj Suss-Francksen should be charged with covering up what happened. But military prosecutors have not taken anyone to court. Maj Suss-Francksen's lawyer said: ""My client has not seen the IHAT material and is unable to offer any comment on the quality or reliability of the evidence gathered by the IHAT investigators or why it was insufficient to satisfy a prosecution of any soldier under UK law."" Operation Northmoor was set up by the government in 2014 and looked into 52 alleged illegal killings. Its closure was announced by the government before Royal Military Police detectives even had a chance to interview the key Afghan witnesses. One Northmoor detective said: ""I wouldn't write off a job until I have spoken to both parties. If you are writing off a job and the only thing you have got is the British account, how is that an investigation? ""My view is that every one of those deaths deserved to be examined and due process of law to take place."" The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. ""Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute."" ""The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations."" Quizzed about the allegations on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK wanted ""to have accountability where there's wrongdoing"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous "" He said: ""What we're quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don't lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who have served their country for years on end - and we've got the right balance."" Mr Raab refused to be drawn on whether these claims were new to him, and said that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous in the world"". Meanwhile, a lawyer who has represented several soldiers investigated by IHAT, dismissed the claims of war crimes as ""flawed, baseless and biased"". Hilary Meredith, chair of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, said the claims were a ""witch hunt against our brave servicemen"" which ""had no credibility whatsoever"". She added: ""Solicitor Phil Shiner, who masterminded countless false claims, was struck off the role of solicitors for good reason - he was found guilty of charges including dishonesty over false witness accounts about UK soldiers' actions.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I don't want us to become an isolated society"" The Conservatives have set out plans for an ""equal"" immigration system after Brexit as Jeremy Corbyn said he still expected a ""great deal"" of movement of people from the EU to the UK. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined plans to change the rules on benefits which EU nationals can claim in time if they live and work in the UK. But he said there would be no arbitrary target for total immigration levels. The Labour leader said immigration was vital for growth and public services. In a BBC interview, Mr Corbyn defended the principle of free movement, which lets EU citizens travel, live, study and work in any member country but which is currently set to end at the start of 2021. Migration from the EU had ""enriched"" the country, he said, and this had to be a part of the close economic relationship he wanted to build with the continent going forward. So where do main parties stand on immigration? Do migrants put pressure on NHS? Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare? Pressed on whether this would involve retaining freedom of movement of people, he said immigration would form part of Labour's Brexit renegotiation if it won the election, but added ""there will be a great deal of movement"". The Lib Dems said the Conservatives' plans were based on the false assumption that overseas workers were trying to ""do us over"". And business groups said migrant labour was needed at ""all skills levels"" if the UK was to upgrade its infrastructure and housing. ""When we hear talk about brightest and best, I think that is a worry,"" Carolyn Fairbairn, the director of the CBI employer's group told Sky News. ""If you do want to build 200,000 houses a year, you don't just need the architects and the designers, you need the carpenters, you need the electricians, you need the labourers."" The Conservatives have said from the start of 2021, when the post-Brexit transition period ends, immigration rules will apply to EU nationals and non-Europeans in the same way, with no preferential treatment for any group. Earlier this week, Prime MinisterBoris Johnson also saidthat if he won the election, he would try to reduce the number of so-called ""unskilled"" migrants coming into the UK. The issue of immigration has slipped down the list of voter concerns since the Brexit referendum, now at its lowest point for almost two decades. However, with public services stretched and the NHS under particular pressure, the Conservatives want to respond to the argument that people from overseas add to the burden on the welfare state. Extending the immigration health surcharge to EU as well as non-EU migrants after the end of free movement is logical, but increasing the charge by 56% carries risks. The UK government is hoping foreign workers can fill desperate shortages of staff in health and social care. But nurses, doctors and carers are less likely to move to Britain if there are rising costs for them on arrival. Last week, the Tories promised to make it cheaper for foreigners coming to work in the NHS by reducing the cost of a visa. Today's announcement appears to do the opposite. For all the political parties, there is a balance to be struck between the concerns of some communities which fear immigration will constrain access to jobs and services, and the concerns of employers who argue restricting access to foreign workers may hamper their ability to create jobs or deliver services. The Conservatives say they would introduce an Australian-style points-based system, which would consider migrants' skills and whether they meet certain criteria. In recent years, the party had a long-standing goal - first introduced by David Cameron and also a promise in the 2017 election manifesto - to cut net migration to less than 100,000 a year. But the government never came close to meeting the target and faced repeated calls to drop it. A campaign unlike any other? Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? Relax rules for some foreign workers, say advisers Announcing more details of their immigration policy on Sunday, the Conservatives said the ""vast majority"" of migrants would need a job offer to come to the UK to work - although there will be a ""small number of exceptions"" for example high-skilled scientists. Rules on claiming benefits will be ""equalised"", meaning that like other migrants, EU citizens would have to wait five years before they can access benefits and will not be able to send child benefit payments abroad. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""What you don't want to do is encourage cheap labour from abroad"" And theimmigration health surcharge,external- the payment charged to migrants to use the NHS - would apply to all migrants, both EU and non-EU, and would be raised from Â£400 to Â£625 a year. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that such ""granular controls"" would help reduce pressure on the public services while ensuring the UK had access to the labour it needed, particularly in the health service. While the Conservatives were committed to bringing down the overall volume of immigration, he said he would ""not fix an arbitrary target"". ""We want to be able to plug gaps in specific sectors, whether it is the NHS or elsewhere but what you don't want to do is encourage a reliance on cheap labour from abroad which has a depressing effect on wages,"" he said. Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers? Relax rules for some foreign workers, say advisers Also appearing on Andrew Marr, Mr Corbyn said a future Labour government would not ""turn its back"" on migration from the EU and suggested it would make it easier for the partners and families or those who had settled in the UK to join them. ""There has to be a recognition that our economy and society has been enriched massively by people who have made their homes here,"" he said. ""No Labour government led by me will bring in a hostile environment."" But Mr Corbyn deflected questions on whether free movement could continue in its current form, saying people would have to wait untilLabour's manifesto is publishedon Thursday for more details. He also declined to say whether he wanted the UK to leave or remain in the EU. CONFUSED?:Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The BBC's Iain Watson said there had been a disagreement at a key meeting on Saturday - when Labour's ruling body approved the party's manifesto - on whether to incorporate Labour's conference policy of extending freedom of movement for workers. Mr Corbyn said freedom of movement would continue if voters back Remain in the new referendum pledged by Labour. But if voters back Leave, Labour would introduce its own immigration policy, recognising there would have to be high levels of labour mobility. This, he added, would be underpinned by stricter regulation of the employment market to prevent migrant workers ""undercutting"" employees here and to stop migrants being exploited. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told LBC that immigration was a ""mutual good thing"" and her party would oppose all of the changes to benefits and NHS charges being talked about by the Conservatives. And the SNP's leader Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland needed to maintain a healthy level of inward migration to avoid a long-term decline in the working-age population and the negative impact this would have on taxpayer-funded public services.

"25 days to go until the general election Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tells Andrew Marr his party plans a further referendum on Brexit - but ""can't commit"" to a Scottish independence referendum Asked about free movement of people from the EU to the UK after Brexit, he says there will be ""a great deal of movement"" Conservative Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab pledges to reduce immigration without ""arbitrary targets"" Labour promises everyone in England a ""free teeth MOT"" SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford reiterates calls to be included in ITV's general election debate Joseph Lee and Vanessa Barford On a relatively quiet day for the campaign, we're bringing the live page to a close. We'll have coverage of any major developments on the rest of the site throughout the day. Here's a quick recap of some of today's events:  Ms Swinson also joins in the criticism of the Duke of York in his interview with BBC Newsnight for failing to acknowledge the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse and trafficking. She says: ""What I found hard to watch was the victims in these affairs were young women and girls who had been sexually abused, trafficked by Epstein, and the experience they had was traumatic, and for someone to be talking about it without really referencing that, without understanding that, without reaching out to understand that and how they must have felt was strange to see."" It was ""clearly not"" wise for him to do the interview, she says. And she says she was ""troubled"" by Prince Andrew's reference to sex being a ""positive act"" for a man - ""you have to take some sort of positive action"". ""I thought, 'Do you not think it's a positive act for a woman? Because if it's not a positive act, positive choice, that's not sex, that's rape. So I found that quite a worrying line."" In an interview with LBC, Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson criticises Conservative immigration plans and says the UK benefits from immigration. She says the Tory plans are ""predicated on an assumption that people coming to our country are trying to 'do us over'"". Ms Swinson says immigration is a ""mutual good thing"", rejecting each one of the Tory proposals put to her by presenter Iain Dale. ""At the moment we cause fear in those communities for the hoops we make them jump through for settled status - we are better than this,"" she says. The European Parliament's Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, is adding his voice to those calling on Boris Johnson to release the report into Russian interference in UK elections. He says if Russia did influence the UK's referendum in 2016, ""all European countries who face similar attacks need to know about it"". The Kremlin wants to ""divide the West"" and ""undermine democracies"", he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio 5 Live Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tells BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar on Politics that offers of peerages to his candidates to stand down shows how ""rotten and broken"" politics has become. On the same show, Conservative Security Minister Brandon Lewis had denied that any such deals had been offered. ""We are not offering deals, we are not doing deals,"" Mr Lewis said. But Mr Farage says: ""Is he calling Ann Widdecombe a liar?"" The Brexit Party candidate says she had two phone calls from No 10 offering her a role on the Brexit negotiating team to stand down. Mr Farage also says Sir Eddie Lister, a key Boris Johnson adviser, offered another candidate a job in higher education. ""Itâs corruption,"" he says. ""What shocks me is how little shock there is about this."" He says he does not expect to see any legal action taken, however. ""Are we going to have a politics based on rules or not?"" BBC Radio 5 Live One of the key figures involved in Labour's manifesto meeting yesterday, Len McCluskey, was speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics earlier. The leader of the Unite union says that working class voters who supported Leave should back Labour, because it is the only party offering an agenda that will improve their lives. He says: âOur message has got to be to those working class people,
for example who voted leave and may be considering voting for the Brexit party
or the Tories - they wonât do anything to change their lives. ""So my message to
your listeners is for people to come home to Labour, stay with
Labour.â He says the manifesto will build on 2017 pledges such as eliminating student debt, building a million homes, abolishing zero-hour contracts and offering a Â£10 minimum wage for young people. The manifesto will be accompanied by a ""grey book"" outlining the detailed spending commitments and how they will be funded, he says. âI would say to people who voted Leaveâ¦this will be about
whether people actually believe the Eton version of Del Boy in terms of Boris
Johnson or the cityâs answer to Del Boy in Nigel Farage and trust is going to
be a big issue,â Mr McCluskey says. More from the CBI, whose director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn was speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge earlier. She says there are ""real concerns"" for business about both of the main party's election pledges, with Labour's nationalisation plans undermining the economy and Conservative immigration plans creating a skills shortage. Asked if Jeremy Corbyn was a ""friend to business"", Dame Carolyn says: ""We look at the policies on the table and we have real concerns that they are going to crack the foundations of our economy."" She says the plans for free, publicly owned broadband would ""freeze investment"" and urges the party to ""work with business"". Restrictive Tory immigration proposals are ""a worry"", she says, adding that the country needs workers of all skill levels not just the ""brightest and best"". ""If you do want to build 200,000 houses a year, you don't just need the architects and the designers, you need the carpenters, you need the electricians, you need the labourers,"" Dame Carolyn says. ""We need people to come and help us renew our economy."" An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has found evidence that the government and military covered up allegations of war crimes -claims which the Ministry of Defence has rejected. Now SNP defence spokesman Stewart McDonald has responded, sayingthe Conservative government ""cannot be trusted"",externalto investigate the allegations. He says: ""What is outlined in these reports represent the most gross violations of the Geneva Convention and attempts to cover up crimes of the worst possible crimes."" But he adds that the ""allegations make clear that political interference by past Conservative ministers is part of the problem."" Mr McDonald says there is a case for a public inquiry and adds that the Human Rights Act must not be amended if it would prevent investigations into war crimes. ""The government must drop these plans at once,"" he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Green Party co-leader Sian Berry also faced Sky's Sophy Ridge, saying the party was focusing on 11 seats but admitting that it faced an ""uphill battle"" to win them all. Many of the seats are part of their electoral pact with other Remain-supporting parties. ""Weâre really proud there are key seats where the
greens are standing as the strongest remain candidate,"" she says. She gave the example of a 23% swing in Bristol West in 2015 to support the idea that Green Party gains were possible. ""We can make big swings, Green members are fired up for this
election,"" she says. The other key target seat is in Sheffield, where there were widespread protests over plans to cut down thousands of trees. CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn has also been on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, telling the show that this is an ""extraordinary"" election for business. She says: ""Next year will be the most important year, I think in a generation, because we've seen so much uncertainty, investment plans put on hold."" Focus must return to long-term economic challenges, such as skills, climate change and inequality, she says. She also says infrastructure projects such as Heathrow's third runway and the Â£88bn HS2 railway are ""absolutely fundamental signals"" that the UK is ""open to the world"". Boris Johnson has sought to delay a decision on HS2 until after the election, but a draft report recommends it goes ahead despite rising costs. Earlier this year, the BBC announced thatit would means-test free TV licences for over-75sas part of its agreement with the government over its future funding. Now the SNP is making restoring the free TV licence to this age group an election pledge. The party also says the licence fee should be set independently of government to prevent a repeat of the issue. The SNP's Brendan OâHara says: ""We need to stop future governments from similar game-playing."" It is part of a package of measures for older people, including reversing cuts to pension credit and offering more support to women affected by the change in the state pension age.

The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn says Labour's nationalisation plans and proposals for free, universal services are ""very modest"". ""We not trying to grab hold of the economy,"" he says, identifying water and Royal Mail as among the services they want to nationalise. Taxing corporations by preventing them from concealing profits in low-tax nations will mean they can pay for their plans, he says. But he also says services like free dental checks are an ""investment for the future"" which can save money in the long run. The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn is asked for his view on Trident - Britain's nuclear deterrent. ""My view is that we have nuclear weapons, that there is a nuclear non-proliferation treaty,"" he says.

security around the world  - terrorists, cyber security and climate change."" He also says that under a Labour government, the UK will not sell arms to Saudi Arabia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a controversial figure in Sri Lankan politics Sri Lanka's former wartime defence chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa has won a presidential election that has split the country along ethnic lines. Official results showed Mr Rajapaksa, 70, took 52.25% of the vote. His rival Sajith Premadasa had already conceded. Mr Rajapaksa was the clear victor in Sinhalese majority areas while Mr Premadasa scored better in the Tamil-dominated north. The election is Sri Lanka's first since the deadly Easter Sunday attacks. Militants linked to the Islamic State group targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island in April, killing more than 250 people. As a result, national security was seen as a dominant issue ahead of the vote. Sri Lanka unity a daunting task after election Who is Sri Lanka's controversial new president? Sri Lanka 'war crimes': Main allegations Mr Rajapaksa, who has positioned himself as a strong figure who can assure Sri Lankans' security, is a highly controversial figure among the country's more than two million Tamils. He and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president, spearheaded the defeat of separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, ending a decades-long war in which at least 100,000 people died. Supporters of the Rajapaksas celebrate with pictures of the two brothers Several journalists who were critics of the government when the Rajapaksas led Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 were abducted, tortured and killed. Thousands of people, particularly Tamils, vanished in what have been described as enforced disappearances. Earlier this year,Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the BBC that war crimes allegations against him were ""baseless"" Votes appeared to be starkly divided between the Sinhala Buddhist majority and minority Tamil, Hindu and Muslim groups, raising fears about the future of reconciliation in a country that remains heavily polarised along ethnic and religious lines a decade after the end of the bitter war. After his election win, Mr Rajapaksa made a call for unity in the country. ""It is my duty to serve all Sri Lankans without racial or religious discrimination,"" he said. ""I promise to discharge my duties in a fair manner."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Human rights groups expressed concern about accountability for wartime abuses - which were committed by both sides - given the election of a man so closely associated with the end of the conflict. Mr Premadasa, who took 42% of the vote, publicly conceded when partial results showed Mr Rajapaksa was certain to emerge the winner. ""It is my privilege to honour the decision of the people and congratulate Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his election as the seventh president of Sri Lanka,"" Mr Premadasa said. Turnout was 83.7%, the election commission said. Mr Rajapaksa is due to be sworn in at a ceremony on Monday. By Jill McGivering, BBC News, Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa commands passionate support among many in the Buddhist Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka. He and Mahinda, who was president here for 10 years, are credited with bringing an end to the country's long civil war. ""I think it's a turning point in the history of Sri Lanka,"" said a Rajapaksa supporter, lawyer Janaka Arunashantha. ""With economy and national security, I think the country will improve in every way in the next five years. We're very hopeful with him."" Sri Lanka is still in shock, seven months after the bomb attacks by a cell of Islamist militants which devastated the island's economy, blew apart the island's fragile communal relations and was the final blow to public confidence in a government already tarnished by infighting. But the news will be greeted with quiet dismay by many in the minority communities who voted overwhelmingly not for Mr Rajapaksa but his rival, Sajith Premadasa. They see him as a more liberal, inclusive choice. Unifying the different communities - and pursuing post-war reconciliation - will be a daunting task. Read more from Jill The Easter Sunday attacks cast a long shadow over the election. The government was forced to admit it had suffered a ""major intelligence lapse""after failing to adequately share information from Indian intelligence officials about a potential attack. But since the attacks, Muslims - who make up nearly 10% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people - say they have faced a more overt campaign of hate against them, fuelled by hardline Buddhist groups. Muslim shop owners say they have been boycotted and there have been outbreaks of mob violence. The family networks behind the bombings Controversial ex-defence chief eyes power Sri Lanka's Muslims 'demonised' after Easter bombings St Anthony's 'church of miracles' a symbol of hope A total of 35 candidates stood in the presidential election, the third since the end of the civil war. The country's incumbent president, Maithripala Sirisena, was not on the ballot. He decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. This video can not be played How the army finally crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after 25 years of bloody war Ruling party candidate Mr Premadasa focused on social issues as well as security - campaigning on a promise to eradicate poverty and improve housing. He is the son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993 and is the current housing minister. Sajith Premadasa had strong support among Tamil and Muslim voters The previous Rajapaksa era was marked by close ties between Sri Lanka and China, with the latter investing billions in infrastructure and development on the island. 'We don't like our land being given away to China' Searching for Father Francis 10 years after the war However the island's ballooning debt to Beijing worried many Sri Lankans. Regional powers including India expressed concern about the extent of Chinese influence in the country. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he planned to ""restore relations"" with China, if he won the election.

"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets across Iran as fuel price rises were introduced Iran's Interior Minister has warned security officials will step up action against protesters taking to the streets over a new petrol policy. Protests have erupted across Iran after the government unexpectedly announced it was rationing petrol and increasing its price. At least one person has been killed and others injured in the violence. Officials say the changes, which have seen prices rise by at least 50%, will free up money to help the poor. Iran is already suffering economically due to stiff sanctions imposed by the US after Washington decided to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard Iran's network of influence in Mid-East 'growing' Protests erupted hours after the new policies were announced on Friday - with fresh demonstrations on Saturday in some cities. There are also reports that access to the internet may have been restricted, Reuters reported citing a web monitoring group. Protests have also spread to the capital Tehran Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli, speaking during an interview with state television on Saturday, warned that law enforcement and security officials will have ""no choice"" but to step in and restore calm if ""illegal"" actions continue. Mr Rahmani-Fazli criticised a ""limited number"" of people whom he accused of abusing the public mood to create ""intimidation and terror"". At least one person was killed during protests in the central city of Sirjan on Friday, officials confirmed. State news agency Irna said there were clashes with police when protesters attacked a fuel storage warehouse on Friday and tried to set fire to it. Fresh protests were held Saturday in the cities of Doroud, Garmsar, Gorgan, Ilam, Karaj, Khoramabad, Mehdishahr, Qazvin, Qom, Sanandaj, Shahroud and Shiraz, Irna reported. Footage posted on social media suggest other people may have been killed on Saturday. The semi-official Isna news agency reported that security officials have threatened to legally pursue social media users who were sharing footage online. A statement, accredited to the Security Emergency Centre (SEC) of Iran's Interior Ministry, accused some users ""rumour-mongering"" and ""spreading lies"" about the protests. The report also claimed that footage was being recycled from incidents in previous years to undermine public confidence and disrupt national security. A highway in Tehran, pictured on Saturday On both days there were reports of angry motorists blocking some roads by turning off car engines or abandoning vehicles in traffic. Videos posted online purportedly showed motorists in the capital, Tehran, stopping traffic on the Imam Ali Highway and chanting for the police to support them. Another clip shows what appeared to be a roadblock across the Tehran-Karaj motorway, hit by the season's first heavy snowfall. Other videos spreading online show clashes between security forces and protesters, and banks burning in several cities. Some pictures appeared to show police stations aflame in the southern city of Shiraz. Speaking on Iranian state TV, Prosecutor General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri blamed a ""few disruptors"" for the protests. He urged people to distance themselves from those who - in his words - want to show their opposition to the Islamic system. He also accused the protesters of having ""roots outside the country"". Under the new fuel measures, each motorist is allowed to buy 60 litres (13 gallons) of petrol a month at 15,000 rials ($0.13; Â£0.10) a litre. Each additional litre then costs 30,000 rials. Previously, drivers were allowed up to 250 litres at 10,000 rials per litre, AP reports. The revenues gained from removing subsidies on petrol will be used for cash payments to low-income households, the government says. Protestors took to the streets in Shiraz The head of the Iranian Planning and Budget Organisation, Mohammad Baqer Nobakht, said that from this month, 18 million families would get an extra cash allowance as a result of the price increase. The new measure is expected to bring in 300tn rials per annum, he said on state television. President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that 75% of Iranians were currently ""under pressure"" and the extra revenues from the petrol price hike would go to them and not the treasury. Iran has some of the world's cheapest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and the fall in value of its currency. It is also one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. But it has limited refining capacity and sanctions have made it difficult to obtain spare parts for oil plants. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Sanctions were reimposed last year after US President Donald Trump abandoned the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its controversial nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief. Since the US left the deal, Iran has been gradually stepping up its nuclear activity in breach of the accord, though it has consistently denied wanting to develop nuclear weapons. The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors and triggering protests.

"Firefighters have extinguished the blaze at The Cube in Bolton Cladding on a block of student flats that was hit by a major blaze is a cause for ""concern"", Greater Manchester's mayor has said. Two people were hurt when about 100 residents fled The Cube in Bolton after ablaze on Friday. Mayor Andy Burnham said its cladding was not the same as at Grenfell Tower,where 72 people died in 2017. But cladding is a ""bigger issue... than we have so far faced up to,"" Mr Burnham admitted. Residents of The Cube were also confused as to whether there was actually a fire in the building on Friday because, as one said, fire alarms go off ""almost every day"". Urban Student Life (USL), which manages the property, said all residents were successfully evacuated after the blaze broke out at about 20:30 GMT on Friday. In a statement,external, they said two students were treated for ""minor injuries"" on site, where up to 200 firefighters tackled the blaze. One witness said the fire was ""climbing up"" the building Assistant chief fire officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said: ""The fire... really did spread very quickly and that was evident to see on the footage that's on social media."" He said an investigation had been launched into the blaze. Mr Burnham said: ""[The Cube] does not have the same ACM cladding [that was on Grenfell Tower] but nevertheless it does have a form of cladding that causes concern and raises issues that will have to be addressed."" He said he would talk to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited the Bolton site earlier, about whether ""we need to go further to remove cladding from these buildings and give families peace of mind"". Salford mayor Paul Dennett said he would be asking the government for more money to remove flammable cladding, adding there was ""an industrial crisis"" around the issue. Roy Wilsher, chief of the National Fire Chiefs Council, said the fire ""once again highlights how changes to building regulations need to be moved on at a much quicker pace"". The fire has led to damage on all floors of the six-storey building On the issue of the fire alarms, resident Afnan Gohar said she thought it was a ""false alarm"" ""We didn't take notice of it until a girl came running and screamed, telling us to get out and we didn't believe it at first,"" she said.

Melissa McGarrigle said: ""The fire alarms in the corridor went off but they aren't particularly loud, especially if you're asleep. ""It just doesn't feel real, everyone thought it was just the fire alarms acting up as usual until we heard people screaming."" The fire started on the fourth floor, the property management firm said Witness Ace Love, 35, said the fire ""kept getting more intense, climbing up and to the right because the wind was blowing so hard"". ""We could see it bubbling from the outside and then being engulfed from the outside,"" he added. ""A lot of students got out very fast, someone was very distressed, the rest were on phones calling for help. ""The fire got worse and worse, to the point where you could see through the beams, it was just bare frame."" About 200 firefighters tackled the blaze Eva Crossan Jory, vice president of welfare for the National Union of Students (NUS), said it had been ""calling for a number of improvements in fire-safety measures in student accommodation"" across the UK. ""It shouldn't take another fire to put the issue of building safety back on the agenda,"" she said. ""Student safety must always be the first priority for accommodation providers and the government."" Huge fire at student flats block In 2016, Urban Student Life (USL) was criticised in a tribunal ruling for not providing clear written guidelines on fire safety procedures or displaying fire safety notices in one of its student accommodation blocks in Leeds. Leeds City Council sent in fire authority officers to inspect the building, who declared at the time it was not fit for use. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), said the latest fire was ""deeply troubling"". ""This is not how any building should react to a fire in the 21st century, let alone a building in which people live,"" he said. ""It's time for a complete overhaul of UK fire safety before it's too late."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson met people helping residents after the fire in Bolton Les Skarratts, of the FBU in the north-west, said there would be ""hard lessons to learn as the circumstances become clearer in the coming days"". Forty fire engines were called to the scene of the blaze, which affected every floor. Prof George E Holmes, vice-chancellor of the University of Bolton, whose students live at the block, said: ""I can't say enough about how pleased we were with the response - it's been amazing from all emergency services."" Football fans attending Bolton Wanderers' match were asked to donate items for evacuated residents. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

GMFRS has asked residents who are not yet accounted for to contact authorities to let them know they are safe. Mr Keelan added a team has ""concentrated purely on the high-rises across Greater Manchester to make sure that we learn from Grenfell"". ""The evacuation procedure and subsequent training - and putting it into practice last night - has paid absolute dividends,"" he told a press conference.

Official results showed Mr Rajapaksa, 70, took 52.25% of the vote. His rival Sajith Premadasa had already conceded. Mr Rajapaksa was the clear victor in Sinhalese majority areas while Mr Premadasa scored better in the Tamil-dominated north. The election is Sri Lanka's first since the deadly Easter Sunday attacks. Militants linked to the Islamic State group targeted churches and high-end hotels across the island in April, killing more than 250 people. As a result, national security was seen as a dominant issue ahead of the vote. Sri Lanka unity a daunting task after election Who is Sri Lanka's controversial new president? Sri Lanka 'war crimes': Main allegations Mr Rajapaksa, who has positioned himself as a strong figure who can assure Sri Lankans' security, is a highly controversial figure among the country's more than two million Tamils. He and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president, spearheaded the defeat of separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, ending a decades-long war in which at least 100,000 people died. Supporters of the Rajapaksas celebrate with pictures of the two brothers Several journalists who were critics of the government when the Rajapaksas led Sri Lanka from 2005-2015 were abducted, tortured and killed. Thousands of people, particularly Tamils, vanished in what have been described as enforced disappearances. Earlier this year,Gotabaya Rajapaksa told the BBC that war crimes allegations against him were ""baseless"" Votes appeared to be starkly divided between the Sinhala Buddhist majority and minority Tamil, Hindu and Muslim groups, raising fears about the future of reconciliation in a country that remains heavily polarised along ethnic and religious lines a decade after the end of the bitter war. After his election win, Mr Rajapaksa made a call for unity in the country. ""It is my duty to serve all Sri Lankans without racial or religious discrimination,"" he said. ""I promise to discharge my duties in a fair manner."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Human rights groups expressed concern about accountability for wartime abuses - which were committed by both sides - given the election of a man so closely associated with the end of the conflict. Mr Premadasa, who took 42% of the vote, publicly conceded when partial results showed Mr Rajapaksa was certain to emerge the winner. ""It is my privilege to honour the decision of the people and congratulate Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa on his election as the seventh president of Sri Lanka,"" Mr Premadasa said. Turnout was 83.7%, the election commission said. Mr Rajapaksa is due to be sworn in at a ceremony on Monday. By Jill McGivering, BBC News, Sri Lanka Gotabaya Rajapaksa commands passionate support among many in the Buddhist Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka. He and Mahinda, who was president here for 10 years, are credited with bringing an end to the country's long civil war. ""I think it's a turning point in the history of Sri Lanka,"" said a Rajapaksa supporter, lawyer Janaka Arunashantha. ""With economy and national security, I think the country will improve in every way in the next five years. We're very hopeful with him."" Sri Lanka is still in shock, seven months after the bomb attacks by a cell of Islamist militants which devastated the island's economy, blew apart the island's fragile communal relations and was the final blow to public confidence in a government already tarnished by infighting. But the news will be greeted with quiet dismay by many in the minority communities who voted overwhelmingly not for Mr Rajapaksa but his rival, Sajith Premadasa. They see him as a more liberal, inclusive choice. Unifying the different communities - and pursuing post-war reconciliation - will be a daunting task. Read more from Jill The Easter Sunday attacks cast a long shadow over the election. The government was forced to admit it had suffered a ""major intelligence lapse""after failing to adequately share information from Indian intelligence officials about a potential attack. But since the attacks, Muslims - who make up nearly 10% of Sri Lanka's 22 million people - say they have faced a more overt campaign of hate against them, fuelled by hardline Buddhist groups. Muslim shop owners say they have been boycotted and there have been outbreaks of mob violence. The family networks behind the bombings Controversial ex-defence chief eyes power Sri Lanka's Muslims 'demonised' after Easter bombings St Anthony's 'church of miracles' a symbol of hope A total of 35 candidates stood in the presidential election, the third since the end of the civil war. The country's incumbent president, Maithripala Sirisena, was not on the ballot. He decided against running after coming under criticism following the Easter Sunday bombings. This video can not be played How the army finally crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after 25 years of bloody war Ruling party candidate Mr Premadasa focused on social issues as well as security - campaigning on a promise to eradicate poverty and improve housing. He is the son of a president who was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993 and is the current housing minister. Sajith Premadasa had strong support among Tamil and Muslim voters The previous Rajapaksa era was marked by close ties between Sri Lanka and China, with the latter investing billions in infrastructure and development on the island. 'We don't like our land being given away to China' Searching for Father Francis 10 years after the war However the island's ballooning debt to Beijing worried many Sri Lankans. Regional powers including India expressed concern about the extent of Chinese influence in the country. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he planned to ""restore relations"" with China, if he won the election. Mr Premadasa, meanwhile, was seen as leaning more towards India and the US.

"Barack Obama said most ""ordinary Americans"" didn't want to completely tear down the system Former US President Barack Obama has issued a warning to Democratic presidential candidates, cautioning them against policies that are not ""rooted in reality"". Mr Obama said Democrats risked alienating voters if they lurched too far to the left politically. The former president, speaking at a fundraising event, said most voters didn't want to ""tear down the system"". Mr Obama is yet to publicly back a Democratic candidate. The field is crowded, with 18 Democrats vying for the nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. The Democratic 2020 race - in five charts Who will take on Trump in 2020? The key issues for 2020 Democrats The frontrunners are former Vice-President Joe Biden, senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. At the event held in Washington on Friday, Mr Obama did not mention any candidate by name nor criticise any specific policy proposal. Instead, he used the appearance to urge Democrats to ""pay some attention"" to voters on issues such as health care and immigration. These voters, Mr Obama said, did not necessarily have the same views as what he called ""certain left-leaning Twitter feeds"" or ""the activist wing of our party"". The comments, which come less than four months before the Democratic primaries, represent one of Mr Obama's most pointed interventions in the race so far. This video can not be played Watch former US President Barack Obama talk about ""woke"" culture They may be seen as a critique of senators Sanders and Warren - widely seen as two of the most left-wing candidates in the field. Both candidates have called for far-reaching political and economic change, including policies that would end private health insurance and decriminalise illegal border crossings. But Mr Obama, who occupied the White House from 2009 to 2017, said the country was ""less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement"". ""Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality,"" Mr Obama said at the meeting, reportedly attended by wealthy liberal donors. Barack Obama, pictured here with Joe Biden after giving his election victory speech in 2008, is viewed as a moderate Democrat The Democratic race is still largely up in the air even as the first of the state-by-state votes that will decide which of the contenders challenges Mr Trump for the White House looms in Iowa in February. Some Democrats are concerned that Mr Biden, a moderate, will struggle to beat Mr Trump, prompting a flurry of latecomers to join the race. In recent days Deval Patrick, the two-time former governor of Massachusetts, entered the field amid speculation that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg may follow suit. Clinton 'under enormous pressure' to run in 2020 Michael Bloomberg signals run for US presidency Meanwhile, political gossip about whether Hillary Clinton might enter the fray continues to set tongues wagging in Washington DC. In an interview with the BBC, Mrs Clinton said she was ""under enormous pressure"" to challenge Mr Trump, who beat her in the 2016 presidential election. Election day is less than a year away now and the race to become the Democratic challenger to Donald Trump is hotting up. The latest polling suggests Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are the front-runners, while Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg are not far behind.

"Thousands of people took to the streets of Paris to mark the first anniversary of the yellow vest movement Police in Paris arrested more than 100 people as protests to mark the first anniversary of the anti-government yellow vest movement turned violent. Yellow vest (gilets jaunes) rallies took place nationwide on Saturday, a year after they first erupted. Tear gas and water cannon were used by police in Paris, where thousands of protesters thronged the streets. Rioters unleashed some of the worst violence the city has seen in months. Anger of yellow vests still grips France a year on The story of the gilets jaunes Macron unveils reforms after yellow-vest protests With many clad in black and wearing masks to hide their faces, rioters in parts of the city burned barricades, vandalised banks, set rubbish bins on fire and hurled cobblestones at police. By Saturday evening,Paris police said 147 people had been arrested,externalacross the capital. The nationwide protests were intended to send a message to French President Emmanuel Macron, whose government has been accused of ignoring the needs of ordinary citizens. This video can not be played France fuel protests: Who are the people in the yellow vests? The protests first erupted in November last year over fuel price rises, but grew to cover wider grievances, including stagnating wages, living costs and economic inequality. Mr Macron attempted to quell the protests with promises of tax cuts, higher pensions and reforms, but many still feel he has not done enough. Anger of yellow vests still grips France a year on ""We're here even if Macron doesn't like it,"" demonstrators chanted as they marched through Paris on Saturday. At the Place d'Italie today, in south-east Paris, the rioters were out again. They burned barricades, smashed the front of a bank, defaced a World War Two memorial; and they flung stones and rocks at police, who responded with clouds and clouds of tear gas. There hasn't been a day of violence in Paris like this linked to the yellow vest movement for many months. The rioters may only have been a minority, but the other yellow vests did nothing to stop them. They were there, they said, to show they hadn't gone away. Police tactics against yellow vest protests are now ruthless and effective. A year on, the yellow vests are not the force they were, but the spirit of rebellion is still strong among many people in France. Protesters set up barricades against French riot police on Place d'Italie Elsewhere in the city, demonstrators and police clashed near the Porte de Champerret, close to the Arc de Triomphe. ""We are a bit disappointed that this has descended into violence,"" said one protester, who travelled from eastern France to Paris to mark the first anniversary. There were also skirmished between police and protesters in other cities, including Bordeaux, Nantes and Lyon. French riot police run past a vehicle set alight during yellow vests protests Much of the anger is directed at Mr Macron, who came to power in 2017 vowing to face down protesters and drive through long-postponed economic reforms. One of Mr Macron's least-popular measures, early in his presidency, was to scrap a special wealth tax. Yellow vest protesters accuse Mr Macron of protecting the Parisian elite, especially the rich, while neglecting the hardship of citizens in the provinces.

"Only 41 of the 353 councils who returned figures to central government reported a loss on their parking operations Councils in England made a total of Â£930m from parking activities in a year, figures show. The record figure during the past financial year is a 7% increase on 2017-18, the RAC Foundation says. Seventeen of the 20 councils making the most money are in London, with Westminster Council accruing the largest amount, at Â£69m. Brighton and Hove, Birmingham and Milton Keynes were the only three in the top 20 not in the capital. Kensington and Chelsea was second in London, with a total of Â£37m. Any money made from parking activities - which includes fines and tickets - must be spent on local transport projects. The study was carried out by transport consultant David Leibling, who analysed Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government data. Local authorities received an income of Â£1.746bn from their parking operations in 2018-19, which included Â£454m from penalties, which is up 6% year-on-year. The amount councils spent on running their day-to-day parking operations was Â£816m, not including interest payments or depreciation of assets such as car parks. David Renard, the Local Government Association's transport spokesman, said London had the highest number of vehicles moving about looking for spaces to park. ""I would expect the higher volume of vehicles moving around London means there'll be a higher level of infringement and fines,"" he said. ""[Councils] seek to ensure they can keep the traffic moving as efficiently as possible and that means people who infringe the regulations will get fined,"" he said.

"Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis at Buckingham Palace There were three big questions and a whole pile of smaller ones that needed answering in this interview. On the big three, the Duke of York was pressed time and time again - did he have sex with Virginia Giuffre (then called Virginia Roberts), as she claims? Why did he go back to see (and stay with) Jeffrey Epstein two years after the businessman's conviction and imprisonment for child sex offences? And how did he explain the photograph of him with his arm round the waist of the 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre. About his visit to New York in 2010 when he stayed at Epstein's house, Prince Andrew was, if not remorseful, then clear that (with hindsight) he had done the wrong thing. He had gone there to tell Epstein that their friendship was over, he said. He said he did not speak to Epstein once he knew about the 2006 Palm Beach Police investigation into possible child sex offences. Nor did he speak to him or contact him when he was in prison. Then in 2010 he flew to New York and stayed with him - it was more ""convenient"", he said - for the sole purpose of telling him they could no longer be friends. By this point they had not seen each other for four years. Prince Andrew 'categorically' denies sex claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Prince Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein abuse claims To have done it by phone would have been ""chicken"" and he is ""too honourable"" at times, he said. So, he says, he did the wrong thing for the right reasons. It was pretty much the only time in the interview that he admitted having made any kind of mistake over his 11-year relationship with Epstein. This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. About the claim by Virginia Giuffre that she slept with the prince three times, there was a categorical denial, alongside a string of reasons why her story did not add up. She says he bought her a drink in a nightclub; he said he doesn't know where the bar is in that club. She says he was sweating heavily as he danced with her; he says he didn't sweat at all back then because of an obscure medical condition that's now gone away. She says he slept with her; he said he was at home after taking one of his daughters to a party in a pizza restaurant. He said he didn't remember her, he didn't recollect her and again he absolutely categorically denied  sleeping with her. Ms Giuffre says she was abused by the prince in Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, where she was pictured in 2001 And the photo of the prince with his arm slipped around Virginia Giuffre's naked midriff? It has plagued  Prince Andrew and the palace, undercutting their blunt denials. No recollection, said the prince. No explanation. Over the past few months, so-called ""friends"" of the prince have mounted a whispering campaign about the photo trying to undercut its authenticity. He wouldn't go so far but instead suggested he never wore the kinds of clothes he was wearing in the photo - travelling clothes - when in London, preferring a suit and tie, and that he never went to the upper floor of the house where the photo was taken. He just couldn't remember the photo, he said, and was at a loss to explain where it came from. There was notably little in the way of apology or remorse in the interview. Aside from that visit to Epstein's house in 2010, Prince Andrew does not think he has done anything wrong. This video can not be played Prince Andrew on Epstein: 'There was no indication, absolutely no indication' He does not regret the friendship with Epstein, a man who by many accounts used and abused young girls for many years. It had, he said, ""some seriously beneficial outcomes"". In one horrible moment he described Epstein as having behaved ""in a manner unbecoming"", as if the convicted sex offender had simply passed the port round the wrong way in the regimental mess. He was picked up on that quickly, and apologised. ""I'm being polite,"" Prince Andrew said. Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein pictured walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 Nothing struck him as suspicious in the various Epstein households that he visited. The Miami Herald has painstakingly put together a picture in Palm Beach of a place where three or four young (14 and 15-year-old) girls might visit a day to give Epstein massages, during which he would sexually abuse many of them. But the prince was at pains to point out that he didn't know Epstein that well really, he might drop in a few times a year, and he said that Epstein ""may have changed his behaviour patterns"" so as to cover up his behaviour. Prince Andrew met Epstein through the businessman's girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell back in 1999. He said he had seen Ms Maxwell in late spring this year. Did they talk about their one-time friend, Jeffrey Epstein, who had accompanied Ms Maxwell to  Windsor Castle and to Sandringham, who had laid his personal jet and houses and holiday island at Prince Andrew's disposal?

"This video can not be played British Special Forces have been accused of covering up the killings of four young Afghans in 2012 The UK government and armed forces have been accused of covering up the killing of civilians by British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. An investigation by BBC Panorama and the Sunday Times has spoken to 11 British detectives who said they found credible evidence of war crimes. Soldiers should have been prosecuted for the killings, say insiders. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it rejected the unsubstantiated allegation of a pattern of cover-ups. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC ""all of the allegations, that had evidence, have been looked at"". He said ""the right balance"" had been struck over decisions whether or not to investigate alleged war crimes. The new evidence has come from inside the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which investigated alleged war crimes committed by British troops during the occupation of Iraq, and Operation Northmoor, which investigated alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The government decided to close IHAT and Operation Northmoor, after Phil Shiner, a lawyer who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, was struck off as a solicitor following allegations he had paid fixers in Iraq to find clients. But former detectives from IHAT and Operation Northmoor said Phil Shiner's actions were used as an excuse to close down criminal investigations. None of the cases investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor resulted in a prosecution. One IHAT detective told Panorama: ""The Ministry of Defence had no intention of prosecuting any soldier of whatever rank he was unless it was absolutely necessary, and they couldn't wriggle their way out of it."" Another former detective said the victims of war crimes had been badly let down: ""I use the word disgusting. And I feel for the families because... they're not getting justice. How can you hold your head up as a British person?"" Panorama has re-examined the evidence in a number of alleged war crimes cases. One such case investigated by IHAT was the shooting of an Iraqi policeman by a British soldier on patrol in Basra in 2003. Raid al-Mosawi was serving as an Iraqi policeman in Basra when he was shot dead Raid al-Mosawi was shot in an alleyway as he left his family home, and later died from his wounds. The incident was investigated at the time by the British soldier's commanding officer, Maj Christopher Suss-Francksen. Within 24 hours, Maj Suss-Francksen concluded the shooting was lawful because the Iraqi police officer had fired first and the soldier had acted in self-defence. His report said another British soldier had seen the shooting and confirmed the Iraqi had fired first. IHAT detectives spent two years investigating the case and interviewed 80 British soldiers, including the soldier who had supposedly witnessed the shooting. But he told detectives he was not in the alleyway. In his statement to IHAT, this soldier directly contradicted Maj Suss-Francksen's report: ""This report is inaccurate and gives the impression that I was an eyewitness. This is not true."" Raid's brother shows where the soldier was when he fired the fatal shot The soldier said he had only heard one shot, which suggested the policeman had not fired at all. This was confirmed by other witnesses interviewed by IHAT. Detectives concluded the soldier who shot Raid should be prosecuted for killing the Iraqi police officer and Maj Suss-Francksen should be charged with covering up what happened. But military prosecutors have not taken anyone to court. Maj Suss-Francksen's lawyer said: ""My client has not seen the IHAT material and is unable to offer any comment on the quality or reliability of the evidence gathered by the IHAT investigators or why it was insufficient to satisfy a prosecution of any soldier under UK law."" Operation Northmoor was set up by the government in 2014 and looked into 52 alleged illegal killings. Its closure was announced by the government before Royal Military Police detectives even had a chance to interview the key Afghan witnesses. One Northmoor detective said: ""I wouldn't write off a job until I have spoken to both parties. If you are writing off a job and the only thing you have got is the British account, how is that an investigation? ""My view is that every one of those deaths deserved to be examined and due process of law to take place."" The MoD said military operations are conducted in accordance with the law and there had been an extensive investigation of allegations. ""Investigations and decisions to prosecute are rightly independent from the MoD and have involved external oversight and legal advice,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""After careful consideration of referred cases, the independent Service Prosecuting Authority decided not to prosecute."" ""The BBC's claims have been passed to the Service Police and the Service Prosecuting Authority who remain open to considering allegations."" Quizzed about the allegations on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Raab said the UK wanted ""to have accountability where there's wrongdoing"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Andrew Marr that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous "" He said: ""What we're quite rightly doing is making sure spurious claims or claims without evidence don't lead to the shadow of suspicion, the cloud of suspicion hanging over people who have served their country for years on end - and we've got the right balance."" Mr Raab refused to be drawn on whether these claims were new to him, and said that prosecuting authorities for the British armed forces are ""some of the most rigorous in the world"". Meanwhile, a lawyer who has represented several soldiers investigated by IHAT, dismissed the claims of war crimes as ""flawed, baseless and biased"". Hilary Meredith, chair of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, said the claims were a ""witch hunt against our brave servicemen"" which ""had no credibility whatsoever"". She added: ""Solicitor Phil Shiner, who masterminded countless false claims, was struck off the role of solicitors for good reason - he was found guilty of charges including dishonesty over false witness accounts about UK soldiers' actions.""

"Brexit Party candidate Ann Widdecombe and leader Nigel Farage both said they had been approached Calls are growing for an investigation into claims the Tories offered peerages to Brexit Party election candidates to persuade them to stand down. Police say they are assessing two allegations of electoral fraud. Labour peer Lord Falconer has urged the Metropolitan Police and prosecution service to launch an investigation, saying the claims raised ""serious questions"" about the integrity of the 12 December election. The PM says the claims are ""nonsense"". ""I am sure there are conversations that take place between politicians of all parties but certainly nobody's been offered a peerage,"" Boris Johnsonsaid on Friday. The claims - first made public by the Brexit Party's Nigel Farage - came after the Brexit Party announced it would not field candidates in any seats won by the Conservatives in 2017, to avoid splitting the pro-Brexit vote. But the party said it would contest all other seats, prompting pressure from Conservatives who urged Mr Farage to withdraw more candidates to help Mr Johnson win a majority in Parliament. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Nobody's been offered a peerage"" Ina video posted on Twitter,externalearlier this week, Mr Farage claimed he and eight other Brexit Party figures had been offered jobs ""in the (Brexit) negotiating team and in government departments"" while there had been ""hints at peerages too"". Ann Widdecombe, a Brexit Party candidate, said she was prepared to swear on the Bible that she had been approached with an offer of ""a role"" in the next phase of Brexit negotiations. A Conservative source also told the BBC that the Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough, Mike Greene, had been offered an unpaid role in education in the hope it would convince him to stand aside. The Brexit Party candidate's team said Mr Greene would definitely be running in the Cambridgeshire constituency, which Labour held narrowly at a by-election in June. In a letter, Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor, said he wanted to raise the issue ""as a matter of urgency"". He wrote to Cressida Dick, the Met Police commissioner, and Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, saying: ""I believe these allegations raise serious questions about the integrity of the upcoming general election, and in particular whether senior individuals at CCHQ (Conservative Campaign Headquarters) or No 10 have breached two sections of the Representation of the People Act 1983."" Lord Falconer added: ""These are exceptionally serious allegations which the DPP must, in accordance with his statutory duty, fully investigate as a matter of urgency. ""In addition, in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes and this election, it is crucial that the Metropolitan Police also examine these accusations."" Brexit Party peerage claims are nonsense, says PM Where are the seats that could turn the election? A really simple guide to the UK general election Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Lord Falconer said: ""The law is that if somebody corruptly induces or procures another person to withdraw from being a candidate at an election, that's both a crime and a corrupt practice in an election, which can lead an election to be set aside. ""From my point of view, it looks as if the Conservatives might be going well beyond electoral law in trying to win this election by persuading Brexit UK candidates not to stand."" Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""This could be political corruption of the highest order and, in addition to that, it could be seen as criminal activity."" He said there should ""undoubtedly"" be an investigation. Responding to the claims, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: ""Nothing would surprise me about the Conservatives these days given what they've been prepared to do. ""If Boris Johnson's prepared to lie to the Queen, lie to the country, you know, I'm going to stop being shocked at where his lack of boundaries lies."" The SNP has also backed a probe into the allegations, insisting there should be an urgent inquiry by the Cabinet Office. Tommy Sheppard, the SNP candidate for Edinburgh, called for a ""full and frank investigation"". The Met Police said it was assessing two allegations of electoral fraud and malpractice in relation to the general election. The lord chancellor is a role dating back many centuries, the holder of which is also head of the Ministry of Justice. Where are the seats that could turn the election?
