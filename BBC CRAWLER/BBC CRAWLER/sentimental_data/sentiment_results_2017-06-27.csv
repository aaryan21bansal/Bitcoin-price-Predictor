"Many reports suggest that screens around the world are getting this message, indicating a ransomware attack is to blame. Companies across the globe are reporting that they have been struck by a major ransomware cyber-attack. British advertising agency WPP is among those to say its IT systems have been disrupted as a consequence. The virus, the source of which is not yet known, freezes the user's computer and demands an untraceable ransom be paid in the digital Bitcoin currency. Ukrainian firms, including the state power company and Kiev's main airport, were among the first to report issues. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has also had to monitor radiation levels manually after its Windows-based sensors were shut down. In a statement, the US National Security Council said government agencies were investigating the attack and that the US was ""determined to hold those responsible accountable"". The US Department of Homeland Security advised victims not to pay the ransom, saying there was no guarantee that access to files would be restored. The Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab saidits analysis showed,externalthat there had been about 2,000 attacks - most in Ukraine, Russia and Poland. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The international police organisation Interpol has said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation and liaising with its member countries. Experts suggest the malware is taking advantage of the same weaknesses used by theWannaCry attacklast month. ""It initially appeared to be a variant of a piece of ransomware that emerged last year,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward. ""The ransomware was called Petya and the updated version Petrwrap. ""However, now that's not so clear."" The malware hall of fame What can you do to protect your business? Kaspersky Lab reported that it believed the malware was a ""new ransomware that has not been seen before"" despite its resemblance to Petya. As a result, the firm hasdubbed it NotPetya,external. Kaspersky added that it had detected suspected attacks in Poland, Italy, Germany, France and the US in addition to the UK, Russia and Ukraine. Andrei Barysevich, a spokesman for security firm Recorded Future, told the BBC such attacks would not stop because cyber-thieves found them too lucrative. ""ASouth Korean hosting firmjust paid $1m to get their data back and that's a huge incentive,"" he said. ""It's the biggest incentive you could offer to a cyber-criminal."" A bitcoin wallet associated with the outbreak has received several payments since the outbreak began. The wallet currently holds just over 3.5 bitcoins (Â£6,775; $8,670). Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk? WannaCry: Your questions answered An email address associated with the blackmail attempt has been blocked by German independent email provider Posteo. It means that the blackmailers have not been able to access the mailbox. Problems have also affected: the aircraft manufacturer Antonov, and two postal services Russia's biggest oil producer, Rosneft Danish shipping company Maersk, including its container shipping, oil, gas and drilling operations. A port in Mumbai is among those that has halted operations a Pennsylvania hospital operator, Heritage Valley Health System, which reportedits computer network was down,external, causing operations to be delayed - but it is not yet clear if it was subject to the same type of attack US food giant Mondelez - whose brands include Oreo and Toblerone. A Cadbury factory in Tasmania, Australia is affected Netherlands-based shipping company TNT, which said some of its systems needed ""remediation"" French construction materials company St Gobain USpharmaceuticals-maker Merck Sharp & Dohme,external The local offices of thelaw firm DLA Piper,external- a sign in the firm's Washington DC officesaid,external: ""Please remove all laptops from docking stations and keep turned off - no exceptions."" The attacks come two months after another global ransomware assault, known as WannaCry, which caused major problems for the UK's National Health Service. Veteran security expert Chris Wysopal from Veracode said the malware seemed to be spreading via some of the same Windows code loopholes exploited by WannaCry. Many firms did not patch those holes because WannaCry was tackled so quickly, he added. The UK's National Crime Agency is investigating the threat Those being caught out were also industrial firms that often struggled to apply software patches quickly. ""These organisations typically have a challenge patching all of their machines because so many systems cannot have down time,"" he said. ""Airports also have this challenge."" Copies of the virus have been submitted to online testing systems that check if security software, particularly anti-virus systems, were able to spot and stop it. ""Only two vendors were able to detect it so many systems are defenceless if they are unpatched and relying on anti-virus,"" he said. Ukraine seems to have been particularly badly hit this time round. Reports suggest that the Kiev metro system has stopped accepting payment cards while several chains of petrol stations have suspended operations. Ukraine's deputy prime minister has tweeted a picture appearing to show government systems have been affected. His caption reads: ""Ta-daaa! Network is down at the Cabinet of Minister's secretariat.""

"Police were called to Shanghai Pudong International Airport after a report of some odd behaviour A superstitious elderly passenger delayed a flight in Shanghai after throwing coins at the engine for good luck, a Chinese airline has confirmed. The 80-year-old woman threw her change at the China Southern Airlines flight as she crossed the tarmac to board. She told police she launched the coins as she ""prayed for safety"" on Tuesday. Of the nine coins launched, only one hit its intended target - but this was enough to force the evacuation of 150 passengers for several hours. Police were called to Shanghai Pudong International Airport after a passenger noticed the woman's bizarre behaviour, apparently aimed at ensuring a safe flight, and alerted authorities. The woman, who was travelling with her husband, daughter and son-in-law, was then taken away for questioning by officers,local media report.,externalShe will not face charges. ""In order to make sure the flight is safe, China Southern maintenance has conducted a full examination of the plane's engine,"" China Southern Airlines said in a statement on the microblogging site Weibo. Police later shared their findings, which had a total value of about 1.7 yuan (Â£0.20 / $0.25). ""After an investigation the involved passenger, surnamed Qiu, said she threw the coins to pray for safety. According to Qiu's neighbour, Qiu believes in Buddhism,"" the police said. Flight 'shaking like washing machine' forced to change course Passenger 'tried to open door' mid-flight The flight was eventually given the all-clear and took off at 17:52 local time (09:52 GMT), more than five hours late. News of the incident caused a fair amount of turbulence on the social media site Weibo, with one user commenting: ""Grandma, this is not a wish fountain with turtles.""

"Nur Huda (left) and her mother Fouzia are feared dead in the fire A character in a new Philip Pullman book is to be named after a teenager feared dead in the Grenfell Tower fire, following an auction bid of Â£32,400. Pullman offered the right to name a character in his new book as a lot in theAuthors For Grenfell Tower,externalauction, which raised money for victims. Teacher James Clements had originally bid Â£1,500 to name the character after his ex-pupil Nur Huda El-Wahab, 15. Organisers say 448 people eventually added bids to his to secure the lot. Mr Clements said he used to teach Nur Huda, who lived on the 21st floor of the west London tower block, where 79 people are feared to have died in the fire on 14 June. Reacting to the news, Mr Clements said he had made a ""speculative bid"" to win the lot and that ""what has happened since has been truly amazing"". ""A huge thanks to everyone who has championed, shared or contributed to our team total,"" hetweeted,external. He also praised Pullman for ""offering such a wonderful prize and being such a gentleman throughout"". Pullman - best known for his fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials - said it was ""great news"",adding,external: ""I look forward to writing about Nur."" Fire brigade warned councils about cladding May calls for cladding investigation Why do high-rises keep failing fire tests? Who are the Grenfell Tower victims? He said her character would feature in the second novel of Pullman's Book of Dust series to be published next year. The first part in the series, La Belle Sauvage, is published in October. Pullman said he could not guarantee whether the character would be ""good, bad, beautiful or otherwise"", but it would be ""a speaking role with a part to play in the plot"". One of the organisers of the auction, Molly Ker Hawn, praised bidders who won the name for Nur Huda,saying,external: ""I love every one of you."" Organisers said more than Â£150,000 had been pledged in total in the auction when bidding closed.

"Two brothers died with three of their friends at Camber last year The RNLI turned down a request to provide lifeguards at Camber Sands 16 days before five friends drowned on the beach, an inquest has been told. The request from Rother District Council was rejected by the lifeboat charity because of a lack of resources. Darren Lewis, the RNLI's senior lifeguard manager, told the hearing in Hastings: ""We just physically did not have the manpower."" He said following the deaths the RNLI offered to put lifeguards on the beach. The charity offered to provide lifeguard cover for the next bank holiday and then for the rest of the season, after being able to reallocate resources, Mr Lewis said. Two brothers, Ken, 18, and Kobi Saththiyanathan, 22, died at the Sussex beach in August along with three of their friends. Earlier a beach-goer told the inquest into their deaths he felt ""unnerved"" by the sea conditions on the day five young friends drowned at Camber Sands. Stephen Deacon said the water looked calm on the surface but there was a strong undercurrent. ""I wouldn't have gone to the beach if I knew it was like that,"" he added. Mr Deacon told the hearing he saw the five men chest-deep in the water playing volleyball before later seeing a Coastguard helicopter. He said he was in the sea with his three children and their dinghy but took them back to shore when he realised how strong the current was. ""Competent swimmer"" Nitharsan Ravi was studying aeronautical engineering at Brighton ""It made me uncomfortable,"" he added, ""like I couldn't control my body."" Mr Deacon said there were no warning notices about the nature of the sands, which has ""lots of pockets of shallow and deep holes"", and no flag was flying on the day. The only warning he saw was about the possibility of jellyfish, he added. Another witness, surfer Amy Wood, 17, told the inquest she helped rescue another young man in trouble in the water on the same day, and also saw the five Asian men further out at sea ""waving their arms and bobbing up and down"". Miss Wood, from Kent, said she thought they were just playing around and was concentrating on getting the distressed man back safely to shore. She told the hearing when she went back to check she could not see the men, but said she did see the helicopter arrive. The inquest heard ""hysteria"" broke out as people were urged to get out of the water as the friends' bodies were discovered. Beach relief coastal officer Stephen Benn said there was a sense of shock as the first body was pulled from the water. In his statement he said someone had shouted: ""There's another body."" Five minutes after learning of the discovery of a second body, Mr Benn said they were made aware of a third one. He said: ""At this point I was just in shock. I couldn't believe it."" It was a perfect summer's day, with totally calm water, not even a ripple."" Beach patrol officer Katherine Morgan told the hearing there were lots of warnings across the beach about sandbars and leaflets about beach safety were available at the offices. She was asked if practices had changed after two people died at the beach earlier in July. ""We were told to be a lot more observant about people going into the sea who may have consumed alcohol, and vulnerable people going into the water, and the sandbars came into play as well,"" Ms Morgan said. Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, died alongside his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both from Erith, south east London. Their three friends, who also died on 24 August, were Nitharsan Ravi, 22, from Plumstead, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, from Grays, Essex, and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, from Welling. The inquest has previously heardall five were fit, healthy and competent swimmers, with some having visited the beach at Camber before without incident. On 24 July, Mohit Dupar, 36, from Hayes, west London, attempted to reach Brazilian Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. The deaths prompted calls for improved safety at Camber, resulting in Rother District Council agreeing in February to allocate Â£51,000 in its 2017/18 budget to bring in seasonal lifeguard cover from this summer. But council officials have said the beach, which is three miles (4.8km) long and nearly half-a-mile (700m) wide at low tide, could never be completely risk-free. The hearing was also told there was a death at Camber in 2015 and three ""near misses"" in 2013. The inquest continues.

"Shepherd's Court in west London fell victim to a fire in 2016 London Fire Brigade warned all 33 councils about the potential risks of external cladding on tower blocks in May this year, the BBC has learned. It followed tests on panels from a high rise that suffered a fire last August. The insulation panels were made up of polystyrene and plywood, and tests concluded they were the likely cause of the fire spreading up the outside. The fire brigade urged councils to review their use and ""take appropriate action to mitigate the fire risk"". Grenfell survivor makes first return to tower 'Fire safety risk inspections pointless' Grenfell girl's name wins Pullman auction External cladding has been identified as a potential factor in the rapid spread of the fire at Grenfell Tower, which is thought to have left at least 79 people dead. It was also highlighted at the coroner's inquest into a fire at Lakanal House in Camberwell in 2009, which led to the deaths of six people, including three children. The fire brigade's letter followed a blaze which broke out on the seventh floor of Shepherd's Court in Shepherd's Bush, west London, on the afternoon of 19 August 2016. The cause was a faulty tumble dryer. The fire spread up six floors along the outside of the building. No-one was injured but some people suffered from smoke inhalation. Who are the victims? Guide to what happened? Six questions for the investigation German flats cleared amid cladding fears The BBC has seen documents relating to Shepherd's Court, including a report commissioned by the fire brigade, which highlighted the external panels attached to the windows of the 1970s tower block as a probable cause of the fire's spread on the outside of the building. The report - first obtained byInside Housing,externalmagazine - was compiled by fire specialists Bureau Veritas which tested the panels beneath the windows. The fire experts found that panels withstood initial contact with fire but as it developed further, the polystyrene foam under the thin metal sheet began to melt. The metal sheet could then fall away exposing the foam and plywood beneath. In its letter last May, following that report, the fire brigade urged councils to consider carefully the arrangements for specifying, monitoring and approving ""all aspects of future replacement and improvement of building facades"" including insulation panels and in-fill panels. The letter also stated councils should ensure the works complied to building regulations ""to secure public safety and minimise fire losses"". Councils were ""strongly"" urged to make sure information on all replacement windows and facades was made available to fire risk assessors, and to undertake mitigation measures to ""ensure any potential fire spread does not pose a risk to health and safety"". Hammersmith and Fulham Council which owns Shepherd's Court is currently conducting further tests on the panels. The LFB letter was sent to all 33 London councils The BBC asked Kensington and Chelsea Council - the council responsible for Grenfell Tower - what action it took in response to the letter and received the following reply. ""The Council is committed to co-operating fully with both the public inquiry and the criminal investigation. ""We do not think it is right to make comments relevant to the inquiry or subject to the investigation until this issue has been discussed with the police and the solicitors to the public inquiry once they have been appointed."" Fire safety expert Prof Arnold Dix believes current risk assessments are totally inadequate Meanwhile, two leading fire experts have described as ""complete garbage"" the current system for checking fire safety in buildings, and said it had failed to prevent tragedies including the Grenfell Tower and Lakanal House fires. Prof Arnold Dix and Arnold Tarling said the fire risk assessment system was ""atrocious"" and ""garbage."" Mr Tarling, who has repeatedly warned about tower block safety, said the assessments can be carried out by ""inexperienced and unqualified people"". He said the responsibility for fire risk assessments had been taken from fire brigades in 2005 and turned into a self-certification exercise that could be carried out by anyone. ""I see garbage day in and day out on these reports. Some of them are not fit for burning. They're complete rubbish and people's lives are depending upon reports that are totally utterly worthless, that lead to a false sense of security. ""They're done by privately employed people or maybe in-house people and are required under the fire safety order. ""The parts of the building that they cover will be all the places where a workman would work or a postman would go, including staircases, landings and boiler rooms. It excludes everything inside the flat; it excludes the external walls."" Experts have also told the BBC the risk assessments do not take account of the outside of tower blocks, including cladding. Why do England's high-rises keep failing fire tests? Tower fails preliminary tests Listen to Andrew Hosken's exclusive report on Radio 4's World Tonight The Fire Brigades Union described the mandatory forms as ""not fit for purpose"" and said that anyone could set themselves up as a fire risk assessor and that no training or qualifications were necessary. David Sibert, an experienced fire fighter and qualified fire engineer who advises the union, told the BBC the government had failed to respond to demands from the fire industry to reform the system following the Lakanal House blaze. ""There are no controls on who can be a fire risk assessor or the competence or the skills that they should have,"" he said. ""Following the fire at Lakanal House the fire industry pushed the government very hard to require fire risk assessors to have certain qualifications or to be on certain registers but we didn't get any traction from government at all."" There are no controls on who can be a fire risk assessor says FBU fire safety expert David Sibert A fire risk assessment for Shepherd's Court conducted in October 2015 - before the blaze -identified the external panels as a possible fire risk. Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which owns the block, insisted that the fire risk assessor was ""trained and qualified"". But in its response to the London Fire Brigade in November 2015, the council admitted it did not know there was any probable risk with the panels. ""We are surprised to hear of any fire risk associated with faÃ§ade,"" the council wrote, ""as we had no knowledge of this prior to your letter."" A spokesman for Hammersmith & Fulham Council said: ""A fire risk assessment of Shepherd's Court was carried out in 2013 by CS Todd & Associates Ltd, who are generally considered to be leaders in the field of fire safety management. ""This was still current at the time of the successfully contained fire in the tower block in 2016, which was started by a faulty tumble dryer, and resulted in no injuries or fatalities. ""The London Fire Brigade has subsequently made recommendations, including the testing of some building materials at Shepherd's Court, and we are fully complying with their directions."" Local residents are demanding action after the Grenfell fire Prof Arnold Dix, a disaster specialist at the University of Western Sydney, described the letter to councils as ""about the strongest warning you could get"". He said: ""This is yet another example of an informed authority - in this case a fire brigade - and the best thing they can do is make a warning about something that they are obviously really, really concerned about. ""It's no different in substance to what the coroner did after the 2009 fire at Lakanal House. ""The coroner made a whole lot of recommendations that weren't acted on. ""It's just another example of the toothless nature of the administration of fire safety in the UK."" A statement from the Home Office said the law clearly sets out that the person responsible for the building has a duty to undertake a fire risk assessment and put in place adequate and appropriate fire precautions or ""bring in a competent fire risk assessor to undertake it"".

I thought I'd had it."" The host was on a practice run for a race in an electric car when the vehicle left the road, tumbled down the hill and burst into flames. He described the experience as ""like being in a tumble dryer full of bricks going down a hill"". Hammond later posted a video from hospital showing an X-ray of his knee Ina video posted on Drivetribe,external, he said: ""I was aware that I was up, that I was high, that inevitably the car was going to come down. ""And yes of course there was a moment of dread. 'Oh God I'm going to die.' And also I was aware that the car was taking just such a beating."" Hammond vows return after crash surgery Richard Hammond injured in Swiss crash The crash came 11 years after the presenter was left in a coma by a high-speed crash as he filmed for the BBC's Top Gear. This time, he said he was conscious throughout. ""I was thinking, 'Yeah, I can't make this.' ""You're aware of tumbling - sky, ground, sky, ground, sky, ground, sky, ground."" When the car finally came to a rest more than 100m from the road - and having narrowly missed a house - he dragged himself out of the vehicle before the first people came to his aid. ""I do remember saying to them, 'Drag me by my arms not my legs because I think I've broken that leg.'"" It transpired that he had fractured his knee. He described how the accident had ""collapsed the knee joint on the top of the bottom bone"". But he recounted how, when he showed his youngest daughter the dressing on his knee, she was not entirely sympathetic. She told him: ""Daddy you look like you've fallen over in the playground."" He also said it hadn't had a major impact on the filming schedule of the Amazon Prime programme. The incident on 10 June took place as Hammond completed a hill climb in the Hemberg area.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October last year Judges at the European Court of Human Rights have rejected a plea from the parents of terminally-ill baby Charlie Gard to intervene in his case. Chris Gard and Connie Yates lost their final legal bid to take their son to the US for treatment. Specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital believe Charlie has no chance of survival. The court agreed, concluding that further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. His parents had previously seen aSupreme Court challengeto continue Charlie's life support fail. Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry European Court judges have now concluded it was most likely Charlie was ""being exposed to continued pain, suffering and distress"" and undergoing experimental treatment with ""no prospects of success... would offer no benefit"". They said the application presented by the parents was ""inadmissible"" and said the court's decision was ""final"". The court ""also considered that it was appropriate to lift the interim measure"" which had required doctors to continue providing life support treatment to Charlie. BBC health correspondent Fergus Walsh said it is likely Charlie's life support machine will be turned off within a few days following discussions between the hospital and his family. Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London 11 April: Mr Justice Francis says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for the experimental treatment in the US. Ms Yates had already indicated the money would go towards a charity for mitochondrial depletion syndromes if Charlie did ""not get his chance"". ""We'd like to save other babies and children because these medications have been proven to work and we honestly have so much belief in them. ""If Charlie doesn't get this chance, we will make sure that other innocent babies and children will be saved"", she said. Great Ormond Street Hospital said the decision marked ""the end of what has been a very difficult process"" and its priority was to ""provide every possible support to Charlie's parents as we prepare for the next steps"". ""There will be no rush to change Charlie's care and any future treatment plans will involve careful planning and discussion,"" a hospital spokesman said. In April a High Court judge ruled against the trip to America and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Three Court of Appeal judges upheld the ruling in May and three Supreme Court justices dismissed a further challenge by the parents.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells Theresa May: ""When you cut local authority budgets by 40%, we all pay a price in public safety"" The limit on public sector salary rises could be reviewed, Downing Street has signalled, as a Labour attempt to scrap the 1% cap was defeated in Parliament. Two cabinet ministers have said the five-year cap may be reconsidered while the PM's spokesman suggested the autumn Budget could herald a change of course. Downing Street later sought to dampen down the speculation, insisting current government policy had not changed. And MPs rejected a Labour motion urging immediate change by a majority of 14. The government won the vote on the issue, the first of the new Parliament, by 323 votes to 309. Labour's amendment to the Queen's Speech, which also called for an end to cuts to the police and emergency services, was defeated as the Conservatives and all 10 DUP MPs joined forces to oppose it - for the first time since the two parties announced a parliamentary pact. Live: Prime Minister's Questions reaction More high-rises fail safety checks Unions criticise 1% pay rise for public sector workers May and DUP deal: What you need to know More Britons back tax and spend, survey says Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. This video can not be played Sir Oliver Letwin tells Today a large number of people may pay a little more tax to increase government spending Labour says its motion was a litmus test of MPs' willingness to oppose further austerity measures and the Conservatives had acted as if it was ""business as usual"". ""Although government ministers said they had learned the lessons of the general election and were listening to voters, it is clear that nothing has changed,"" Jeremy Corbyn said. Before the vote, several Conservative MPs called for the cap to be lifted. Speaking during the debate, Conservative MP Andrew Murrison said public sector workers ""give far more back to the service than we give to them in terms of the package"", adding that he was worried the ""well of goodwill"" among medical workers would soon run ""completely dry"". Another Tory MP, former nurse Maria Caulfield, said medical workers ""will vote with their feet"" unless the pay freeze is tackled. Earlier, taking questions at an event in London, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said pay rates were ""obviously something we have to consider not just for the army but right across the public sector as a whole"". Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor In line with Michael Fallon and Chris Grayling's comments, the government is ready to listen to the case to ""scrap the cap"" - bringing a potential end to the policy that was designed to save Â£5bn for the public purse by 2020. By teatime however, after the Treasury had slightly less enthusiastically said they were ""open to discussion"", that nurse, social worker, teacher or doctor had slightly less cause for feeling optimistic about a bigger pay rise any time soon. Number 10 had perhaps not changed, but certainly tweaked, their tune - saying when asked repeatedly that the policy has not changed, the independent pay review bodies will report in due course and the government will consider their proposals. So far, so confusing. Neither Number 10 nor the Treasury, who it's suggested were not entirely thrilled with the suggestion, are ready by the end of this political day to be able to make such a big change, or to give Labour such a big victory. The problem for them, however, is not just what appears to be a changing mood among some voters, but also very public hints by cabinet members that the cap, becoming painful for some as inflation starts to lift, could disappear along with Theresa May's majority. Read Laura's blog A Number 10 source said public sector pay restraint was ""one of the tough decisions"" the government had had to make but that ministers were going to ""listen to the messages that were sent at the election"" and said, ""we understand that people are weary after years of hard work to re-build the economy"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reiterated this, telling MPs that ministers would wait for the recommendations of the pay review bodies before deciding what action to take. The suggestion of a change of policy was welcomed by campaigners, with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady saying it would be a ""massive victory for trade union campaigning"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin said Labour were  ""playing politics"" but ""carefully judged"" tax increases might be needed to raise money for public services. This video can not be played Theresa May warns councils they should be ""doing the fire safety checks now"" ""It may well be that, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a bit more on the crucial public services that do need more spending,"" he added. Meanwhile, the latestBritish Social Attitudes Survey,externalhas found an increase in the number of Britons who think the government should raise taxes and increase spending to its highest level since 2004. Earlier, during PMQs, Mr Corbyn linked the Grenfell Tower disaster to spending cuts. After Mrs May confirmed cladding from 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England had now failed fire safety tests, Mr Corbyn - to an angry reaction from some on the Conservative benches - said this was because cuts to local authority budgets had led to fewer building control and planning inspectors. ""We all pay a price,"" he said, saying there were fewer firefighters in place and that the pay cap had affected recruitment. ""What the Grenfell Tower tragedy has exposed is the disastrous effect of austerity. Labour frontbenchers wore badges highlighting the campaign to end the NHS pay squeeze ""This disregard for working-class communities, the terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners - I urge the prime minister to come up with the resources needed to test and remove cladding, retrofit sprinklers, properly fund the fire service and the police so that all our communities can feel safe in their own homes."" Mrs May said the cladding of tower blocks had begun under Tony Blair's Labour government, saying this was an issue that had ""developed over decades"" under successive governments and different councils. Labour has claimed fire and rescue budgets were cut by 30% between 2010 and 2015, and a further 20% cuts are envisaged between 2015 and 2020. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the number of fire incidents had halved since 2010 and firefighters' rapid response to the Grenfell tragedy showed the strength of the service.

"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said legislation for a second referendum would not now be introduced until at least the autumn of next year Nicola Sturgeon has put her independence referendum plans temporarily on hold after announcing a ""reset"" of her proposed timetable. The first minister had called for an independence referendum to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. But Ms Sturgeon told Holyrood she would now delay her plans to introduce legislation for a referendum. However, she later said it was still ""likely"" a referendum would be held by 2021. Ms Sturgeon has been considering her options since the SNP lost 21 seats in the election earlier this month. She said the Scottish government would delay its proposed referendum legislation until at least the autumn of next year - although it would still need the permission of the UK government for a legally binding vote to be held. Live Scottish Parliament coverage Read Ms Sturgeon's statement in full,external In the meantime, she said she would ""redouble"" her efforts to secure the best possible Brexit deal for Scotland, and to keep the country in the European single market. Ms Sturgeon stressed that she continued to be ""strongly committed"" to Scotland having a choice on its future at the end of the Brexit process. And the first minister later told journalists she believed it was still ""likely"" there will be a second referendum on independence during the lifetime of the current Scottish Parliament, which is due to last until 2021. UK Prime Minister Theresa May had earlier urged Ms Sturgeon to take the possibility of a second referendum off the table completely. Theresa May had called on Ms Sturgeon to take the possibility of a second referendum completely off the table And Unionist opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament claimed Ms Sturgeon had not gone far enough, and that ""nothing has changed"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens urged the SNP leader not to retreat on her referendum bid, and to ""continue fighting"" for another vote on the issue. Ms Sturgeon has previously said that the prospect of an independence referendum was a factor in the election result, which saw her party's share of the vote drop from 50% to 37%. However, the SNP remained by far the largest party in Scotland after winning 35 of the country's 59 seats at Westminster. Anyone waiting to declare that Nicola Sturgeon has been forced to do a U-turn over her plans for a second independence referendum will have been sorely disappointed today. She has been forced to backtrack on the timing. The first minister is no longer insisting that any independence vote takes place before the UK leaves in EU in March 2019. But she has told the BBC that there could still be another referendum before the end of this Scottish Parliamentary term in 2021. In the parliamentary chamber this afternoon she said had listened to voters and reflected on the result. Read more from Sarah Ms Sturgeon said she had repeatedly been told during ""hundreds"" of conversations since the election that people were worried about the uncertainty caused by Brexit, and wanted a break from making big political decisions. The first minister said people also wanted greater clarity about the implications of Brexit to emerge, and that it was ""too soon right now"" to make a decision about a referendum. And she said people wanted the Scottish government to ""focus as hard as we can on securing the best possible outcome for Scotland"".Ms Sturgeon argued that the general election and the ""weakness"" of the UK government had ""reopened the possibility, however narrow, of averting a hard Brexit and maintaining membership of the single market"". She added: ""I want to reassure people that our proposal is not for a referendum now, or before there is sufficient clarity about the options. ""But rather to give them a choice at the end of the Brexit process, when that clarity has emerged. ""I am therefore confirming today that having listened and reflected, the Scottish government will reset the plan I set out on 13 March. ""We will not seek to introduce the legislation for an independence referendum immediately. Instead we will, in good faith, redouble our efforts and put our shoulders to the wheel in seeking to influence the Brexit talks in a way that protects Scotland's interests."" This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said it is still ""likely"" there will be a second referendum during the lifetime of the current Holyrood Parliament Nicola Sturgeon intends to focus upon securing the best possible deal from Brexit for Scotland. She believes, further, that such a mission is made more feasible by a UK Government weakened by the absence of a single party majority. So what has changed, in practice, as opposed to rhetorically? Firstly, Ms Sturgeon will not proceed now with legislation at Holyrood to prepare for a prospective referendum. The Bill will lie dormant. Not abandoned, but resting. Secondly, that means there is now no urgency about her demand for Westminster to transfer the necessary power to hold such a referendum, under Section 30 of the Scotland Act Not, you understand, that the UK Government and the Conservative Party regarded the demand as urgent in the first place. The Scottish Secretary David Mundell has said not now, almost certainly not within the lifetime of the present Holyrood Parliament. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, has come within a whisker of saying ""not ever"" - although, to be clear, she retains the option of indyref2 returning at some point. So, one, the indyref2 Bill is shelved. Two, the Section 30 request is also on ice. But, three, the First Minister intends to return to the topic once Brexit negotiations conclude which she anticipates should be in Autumn 2018. Read more from Brian The Scottish government will also work to build ""maximum support"" across the UK for the proposals it set out at the end of 2016 - which argued for both the UK and Scotland to remain part of the European single market with ""substantial new powers"" for Holyrood. She challenged the other parties at Holyrood to back her calls for Scottish government ministers to be ""at the table"" for Brexit negotiations. And she added that when negotiations with the EU are complete and ""when the terms of Brexit will be clearer"", ministers would come back to the Scottish Parliament to ""set out our judgment on the best way forward at that time"". Ms Sturgeon said this statement, which is likely to happen next autumn, would also set out the Scottish government's view on ""the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country's future"". She said independence ""may well be the only way to protect Scotland from the impact of Brexit"" but insisted the case for independence ""goes far beyond that"". ""We must persuade the majority in Scotland of that. We have not done that yet but I have no doubt that we can,"" she added. Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale accused Ms Sturgeon of not listening to what voters had told her in the election Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon had failed to give people any assurance that she has been listening to them since the election. Arguing that the first minister was ""in denial"" and ""leaking credibility"", the Tory leader added: ""Her response hasn't been to reflect. ""It has been simply to lash out at the UK government at every opportunity and to sing the same old songs in the same old tune. ""She now claims to be putting the referendum to one side. She should just give the country some certainty and take it off the table for the rest of this parliament at least."" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said: ""The truth is the threat of an unwanted second independence referendum is dead and this didn't happen because Nicola Sturgeon wanted it to, the people of Scotland have taken that decision for her. ""The first minister is digging her heels in, putting her fingers in her ears and pressing on regardless. She is just not listening."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon's ""long hard think"" had led her to conclude that she should call another independence referendum at a time of her choosing. He said: ""The people spoke loud and clear at the general election that they did not want another divisive independence referendum. She should listen.""

However, children will generally not be kept waiting in order to achieve an exact match where a family can be identified who is able to meet most if not all of the child's identified placement needs. When placing Children in Care for adoption local authorities will try firstly to identify appropriate prospective adopters for each child who reflect the child's culture and religion of heritage and who speak the child's first language. However, where this is unlikely to be achievable, the authority will usually give consideration to placing the child with prospective adopters who do not share the child's culture and/or religion and/or language of heritage, but who can demonstrate a willingness and ability to help the child to develop a positive understanding of and connection with his culture of birth as they are growing up. The couple contacted Adopt Berkshire, the official adoption agency for Windsor & Maidenhead Council, to look at adoption after several failed attempts at fertility treatment. ""We said that, having thought about it for six months, it was something that we really wanted to do,"" Mr Mander told the BBC. ""I could tell on the phone it wasn't going to end nicely. ""She asked what background we were from. ""I said we were from an Indian background, and she said that they were 'unable to prioritise us', and they wouldn't look at our case. ""They said we should, 'seek other means of adopting a child'."" Adoption agencies are allowed to prioritise on the basis of race in order to match children to prospective parents of the same ethnic background. But the government has also said that a child's ethnicity should not be a barrier to adoption. Adopt Berkshire's website says children in need of adoption ""will reflect the racial, cultural and religious backgrounds of the populations within the areas from which they originate."" It adds that the authority will seek prospective parents of a similar background to the child, though they would not keep children waiting to ""achieve a direct match"". Adoption law reform aims to speed up placements 'Why I'm crowdfunding to adopt an orphan boy' 'I sent my adopted son back into care' ""Although my cultural background is Indian, I don't have any links with India, I'm a British person,"" Mr Mander said. ""We are a great couple, we're happily married for 10 years and financially stable. ""We have a five-bedroom house with four spare bedrooms. ""We thought we would be able to at least get to an application stage."" Mr Mander said he understood that cultural heritage was important and should be looked at, but he said a number of factors should be considered and people should not be prevented from getting to the application stage because of one particular area. ""We are angry and upset that this happens in this particular day and age,"" he continued. ""We know that we will be very good adopters."" The Manders are applying to Slough County Court seeking a declaration that the policy should allow them to adopt. Their case is supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). Mr and Mrs Mander have also decided to pursue adoption abroad instead of locally. ""We are now looking at inter-country adoption, which is so costly"", added Mrs Mander. She said they wanted to raise awareness about their case so that other couples did not go through what they have experienced.

"Parents have raised a stink over ""ridiculous"" plans by some councils in England and Wales to charge them to take away nappies on top of their household waste. Among the gripes is that bin collections are getting less frequent and cause a smelly pile-up. So what options do parents have? Nappy bins are not always free - or available - across the UK. Dorset, for example, recently introduced a Â£13 charge for an annual supply of nappy sacks, which are available for children up to age three. Councils in Bournemouth and Poole let households of five people or more buy an extra bin for Â£43. Kalpana Fitzpatrick, a journalist from London, thinks the charges are ""absolutely ridiculous"". Shetweeted,external: ""Why not introduce a tax for dog owners where councils have to have poop bins instead of introducing a nappy tax?"" Wendy Richards says ""rubbish is an issue"" when you have a baby but that families can cut waste About eight million nappies are thrown away every day in the UK, according to local authorities, with one baby using enough disposable nappies to fill 40 black sacks a year. Mother-of-three Wendy Richards, who uses reusable cloth nappies, says a nappy bin charge is ""understandable"". ""The average baby goes through a huge amount of nappies,"" she says. ""People don't realise how much landfill waste that is. Someone's got to pay for it."" Young parents have complained of a ""poo problem"" as the time between bin collections has increased, with some areas in the UK having towait a whole month. Abi Jones, a PA from Essex whoblogs,externalabout being mother to two-year-old Alfie, says her family has ""definitely found it more difficult"" since their local council switched to fortnightly bin collections. ""Had Alfie been a newborn - and getting through the amount of disposals newborns do - we would have had to make extra trips to the local refuse centre,"" she says. Anglesey council, which has three-weekly collections, offers parents an extra nappy bin collection. But once a toddler reaches age three the service stops, as by this age the council says most children are potty trained. In Bridgend, the council introduced purple collection bags for nappies and other items, such as incontinence pads, in June after it said smaller households could throw away up to two rubbish bags a fortnight. Councils say the move from weekly rubbish collections saves money and encourages people to recycle more. Local authorities have atarget to recycle at least half of all waste by 2020, to meet the European Union's Waste Framework Directive. Councils often make exceptions for large families, disabled children and for people with medical conditions if they need more space for waste. But Carly Dashwood, responding to the charges on Facebook, said they were ""disgusting"" if parents with disabled children had to pay. She writes: ""I have a disabled child and he is in nappies. This is very unfair on people that don't have a choice in the matter."" It is not compulsory to use nappy bins or sacks, but councils can fine families if their household waste gets out of control. If a bin is so full it is deemed littering, councils can issue fixed penalty notices of about Â£60 to Â£80 - or slightly less for early payment - under the Environmental Protection Act. If the offence is classed as fly-tipping, fines are between Â£150 and Â£400. Rubbish collectors might to refuse to empty a bin if it is overflowing. The number offines issued for littering- which can include overflowing bins - was more than 140,000 in England and Wales in 2015 to 2016, according to a freedom of information request by civil liberties group, the Manifesto Club. Reusable nappies are typically made from a cloth, such as bamboo, and a fleecy liner, and go in the washing machine. Abi, who also uses both types of nappies for Alfie, thinks reusing is cheaper overall but can ""seem like a lot of work"". ""There is extra washing involved - about three loads a week - but this isn't much in the grand scheme of things,"" she says. ""You don't have to use them every day,"" she adds. ""If we're going out I use disposables, as they don't take up as much space."" But the upfront cost - about Â£200 for a kit of 20 - can be off-putting. Wendy says she always wanted to use cloth nappies as ""money was tight"" when she became a full-time mother. She says: ""I did think - 'oh my goodness, what if I don't use them?' but Â£300 has lasted me three children."" Prices of reusable nappies vary from about Â£7 to Â£30 per nappy. According to consumer group Which? a basic set of reusable nappies - Â£80 - is still cheaper than buying a cheap brand of disposable nappies, at Â£38 for the first few months. Some councils give away vouchers for reusable nappies, or free trial kits so parents can try different brands - but the giveaways depend on where you live. ""My council in Hampshire did nothing,"" says Wendy. ""It is frustrating"". TheReal Nappy campaign,externalhas a search tool for parents to find out if they can get free nappies from the council.

"Brexit Secretary David Davis has blamed the Tories' general election losses on a ""badly designed"" campaign and Theresa May's social care ""U-turn"". Mr Davis helped persuade Mrs May to call a ""snap election"" to strengthen his hand in Brexit talks. But he now says the party did not have enough time to prepare ""and some very significant mistakes were made"". It comes after ex-Tory chairman Grant Shapps called the party's manifesto the ""worst in the world"". At-a-glance guide: Conservative manifesto Tories 'wrong' to base campaign on PM Speaking to an audience of business leaders in London, Mr Davis said: ""What went wrong was a badly designed campaign in a nutshell,"" adding both the party's lead and Mrs May's own personal lead in the polls had been ""undermined by a set of relatively simple mistakes"". He said parties normally have several years to prepare for an election campaign but it was ""collapsed into a couple of weeks and some very significant mistakes were made"". The Brexit secretary was one of those to urge the PM to go to the polls Mr Davis singled out ""the social care proposals, which pretty much switched off a very large Tory vote in the elderly sector"" as well as ""the proposals on doing away with free school meals for certain categories of children"" which, he said, ""hit another Tory vote sector in the sort of middle age group"". That, he said, had ""knocked the whole campaign off balance and forced us into a U-turn which, in turn, undermined her (Theresa May's) standing, and the rest is history"". Mr Davis also praised Labour for managing to ""galvanise a left-of-centre youth vote"" in ""a phenomenal way"" using a ""ferocious and powerful"" social media campaign. And he argued that Lib Dem, Green and UKIP voters had switched to Labour in a return to two-party politics. He also suggested the terror attacks that occurred during the campaign, in Manchester and London, had taken ""huge chunks out of what would otherwise have been a very long campaign"" and meant the party's plans to talk about Brexit and the economy had to be shelved. Asked by Andrew Marr on Sunday if he had advised Mrs May to call a snap election, Mr Davis said: ""Yep. I take my share of the blame. Along with the other 20 members of the cabinet who also said it was a good idea."" This video can not be played Grant Shapps tells Today Conservatives lost seats because their manifesto was ""appalling"" Former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps earlier rejected claims voters had turned against the Tories because they were ""fed up"" with austerity. Instead, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he blamed the party's ""crazy policies"", describing Mrs May's manifesto as ""a long list of punishments for the public and our core supporters"". ""We were 20 points ahead and suddenly, in the space of two or three weeks. we lost that. And that wasn't down to people suddenly changing their minds on austerity, which none of us have ever liked. ""It was because we had forgotten the lessons of previous election campaigns,"" said Mr Shapps, who was Tory chairman between 2012 and 2015. He said the party ""forgot to build a team of activists"" on the ground and should have put one person in charge of the campaign - but he reserved the most scorn for his party's ""appalling manifesto"". If the party had not proposed policies such as ending the winter fuel allowance for better off pensioners and ending the guarantee that the state pension would rise by at least 2.5% a year - plus its social care reforms swiftly categorised as a dementia tax and ""raising the spectre of fox hunting as an issue... then we would have a majority today"", said the former minister. ""We had an unnecessary election and, actually, the world's worst manifesto from the world's oldest political party,"" he added. He refused to be drawn on Mrs May's future but said he was speaking out now to ensure the party did not learn wrong lessons from the election result, which saw Mrs May lose her Commons majority. If it repeated the mistakes it made in the run up to the 8 June polling day it ""would never win an election again"", he warned. Chancellor Philip Hammond hashighlighted growing ""weariness"" with austerityas a reason for the Conservatives' worse-than-expected results. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described his party's boost in vote share and seats as ""vote for hope for the future"" and a sign people were ""turning their backs on austerity"".

"Republicans will delay their vote on health insurance legislation US Senate Republicans have delayed a vote on their healthcare bill until after next week's 4 July holiday. The announcement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a setback to their plan to replace Obamacare. Eight Republican senators have vowed to oppose the bill and the party can only afford to lose two votes to get it passed in the upper chamber. US President Donald Trump invited Senate Republicans to the White House for a meeting on Tuesday afternoon. Sitting alongside some of the party rebels, he said: ""This will be great if we get it done.  And if we don't get it done, it's just going to be something that we're not going to like. And that's okay, and I understand that very well."" A similar version of the bill has already passed the House, after facing a similar delay. After Congress returns from the bank holiday, there will be a two-week window before the summer break. Mr McConnell vowed to continue to try to find the votes, and would make changes to the bill if necessary. Moderate senators say the bill will harm some of their vulnerable constituents, while conservatives say it has too much government interference. The news of a delay comes just one day after the non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office said the bill would strip 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next 10 years. What's wrong with Obamacare? 'I owe my life to Obamacare' Democrats held photos of patients during a press conference on the Capitol steps to oppose the bill The 142-page Senate bill - the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 - phases out the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the low-income Americans, and imposes deep cuts to the programme. The bill also gives states more latitude in requiring insurers to provide essential health benefits guaranteed under Obamacare, including emergency and maternity care and mental health services. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Details also include: Repealing taxes on the wealthy and insurance companies Continuing payments to health insurance companies to reimburse them for subsidies used to help pay for out-of-pocket costs for low-income Americans for at least two years Stripping funding for US women's health group Planned Parenthood for a year We have our first tangible indication of just how dire the situation is for the Senate healthcare bill. House Republicans faced similar setbacks, of course. In fact, their leaders didn't delay their measure until just hours before what would have been a doomed vote. The Senate, as always, moves more cautiously. The political reality in both instances, however, is the same. Moderates Republicans think the bill cuts government health programmes too much. Conservatives believe the reforms don't go far enough. The House eventually managed to find a compromise. Senators can be a bit more stubborn, though - and the Republican margins in that chamber are slimmer. Washington politicians now head home for a week of Fourth of July parades and constituent meetings. They're certain to get an earful from across the political spectrum. When they return, they'll have just three weeks to cobble together a solution - while also juggling the need to reach a budget agreement and raise the federal debt ceiling. A vote in July could be harder, not easier. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has proven to be a legislative magician, but if he pulls this off it will rank among his greatest tricks of all. This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words At least five Senate Republicans had announced opposition to the bill, before the delay was announced.  Another three senators joined the rebels hours later on Tuesday. Moderate Republicans who have opposed the bill criticised it for stripping protections for the poor and elderly, as well as access to women's health. Conservatives are upset that the bill ""does not go far enough"" to repeal the Affordable Care Act passed under Barack Obama. Not one single Democrat is expected to support the proposed legislation, having lambasted it as a huge transfer of wealth from poor to rich. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has warned that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Americans will die if the bill passes. ""Republicans cannot excise the rotten core"" of this bill, said Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer after the delay was announced. The American Association of Retired Persons, the nation's oldest non-profit organisation representing Americans over 50 years-old, slammed the bill as an ""age tax"". Trump took plaudits for the House bill he later condemned The president has already been playing a significant role, phoning wavering senators like Ted Cruz, to try to get them behind the plan. He has the power to offer perks and dole out punishment to individual members of Congress who need something more than simple persuasion. On Tuesday, a pro-Trump fundraising groupbegan a Â£1m television and radio campaign,externalagainst Senator Dean Heller as he prepares for re-election in Nevada in 2018. But the president has had an ambiguous relationship with his party's legislation, decrying the House bill as ""mean"" just weeks after celebrating its passing through the lower chamber. When asked what the president thought of the Senate bill, his spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she had not yet asked him. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Is Trump's 'Obamacare nightmare' over?

"Many reports suggest that screens around the world are getting this message, indicating a ransomware attack is to blame. Companies across the globe are reporting that they have been struck by a major ransomware cyber-attack. British advertising agency WPP is among those to say its IT systems have been disrupted as a consequence. The virus, the source of which is not yet known, freezes the user's computer and demands an untraceable ransom be paid in the digital Bitcoin currency. Ukrainian firms, including the state power company and Kiev's main airport, were among the first to report issues. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has also had to monitor radiation levels manually after its Windows-based sensors were shut down. In a statement, the US National Security Council said government agencies were investigating the attack and that the US was ""determined to hold those responsible accountable"". The US Department of Homeland Security advised victims not to pay the ransom, saying there was no guarantee that access to files would be restored.

This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The international police organisation Interpol has said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation and liaising with its member countries. Experts suggest the malware is taking advantage of the same weaknesses used by theWannaCry attacklast month. ""It initially appeared to be a variant of a piece of ransomware that emerged last year,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward. ""The ransomware was called Petya and the updated version Petrwrap. ""However, now that's not so clear."" The malware hall of fame What can you do to protect your business? Kaspersky Lab reported that it believed the malware was a ""new ransomware that has not been seen before"" despite its resemblance to Petya. As a result, the firm hasdubbed it NotPetya,external. Kaspersky added that it had detected suspected attacks in Poland, Italy, Germany, France and the US in addition to the UK, Russia and Ukraine. Andrei Barysevich, a spokesman for security firm Recorded Future, told the BBC such attacks would not stop because cyber-thieves found them too lucrative. ""ASouth Korean hosting firmjust paid $1m to get their data back and that's a huge incentive,"" he said. ""It's the biggest incentive you could offer to a cyber-criminal."" A bitcoin wallet associated with the outbreak has received several payments since the outbreak began. The wallet currently holds just over 3.5 bitcoins (Â£6,775; $8,670). Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk? WannaCry: Your questions answered An email address associated with the blackmail attempt has been blocked by German independent email provider Posteo. It means that the blackmailers have not been able to access the mailbox. Problems have also affected: the aircraft manufacturer Antonov, and two postal services Russia's biggest oil producer, Rosneft Danish shipping company Maersk, including its container shipping, oil, gas and drilling operations.

The attacks come two months after another global ransomware assault, known as WannaCry, which caused major problems for the UK's National Health Service. Veteran security expert Chris Wysopal from Veracode said the malware seemed to be spreading via some of the same Windows code loopholes exploited by WannaCry. Many firms did not patch those holes because WannaCry was tackled so quickly, he added. The UK's National Crime Agency is investigating the threat Those being caught out were also industrial firms that often struggled to apply software patches quickly. ""These organisations typically have a challenge patching all of their machines because so many systems cannot have down time,"" he said. ""Airports also have this challenge."" Copies of the virus have been submitted to online testing systems that check if security software, particularly anti-virus systems, were able to spot and stop it. ""Only two vendors were able to detect it so many systems are defenceless if they are unpatched and relying on anti-virus,"" he said. Ukraine seems to have been particularly badly hit this time round. Reports suggest that the Kiev metro system has stopped accepting payment cards while several chains of petrol stations have suspended operations.

"Jimmy Prout suffered months of physical abuse which included having his teeth knocked out Two people have been jailed for life for murdering a vulnerable man who was tortured for months and forced to eat his own testicle. Jimmy Prout, 45, was found dead on wasteland near his home in North Shields on 27 March 2016. A Newcastle Crown Court trial heard he suffered ""Dark Ages"" abuse at the hands of a group he thought of as friends. Ringleader Zahid Zaman, 43, was told he must serve a minimum term of 33 years and Ann Corbett, 26, at least 27 years. Zahid Zaman, left and Ann Corbett were convicted of murder after a seven-week trial Kay Rayworth, 56, and Myra Wood, 45, of North Shields, were also jailed for causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable man. Rayworth was sentenced to 12 years and four months and Wood for nine years. Get updates on this and other stories from the North East here Zaman, a wheelchair user, was branded as an ""evil, vindictive, manipulative and devious man"", by Mr Justice Dove, who accused him of scouring the internet and local soup kitchens to find vulnerable people he could control before coming across Mr Prout and making him his ""skivvy"". All four had previously admitted a further count of perverting the course of justice. Kay Rayworth, left, and Myra Wood were found guilty of allowing Mr Prout's death During the seven-week trial, the court heard the group of five, including Mr Prout, had a strange relationship which had developed an almost ""cultish dimension"". The jury were told Ann Corbett had shared a bedroom with Mr Prout and would have seen the suffering he endured and even watched him die, but did nothing to stop it. The court heard that a series of events in late 2015 created tensions that led to a number of serious assaults against Mr Prout, which included him having his teeth knocked out with hand tools. After Mr Prout's body had been dumped, the court was told the group then set about covering their tracks by pretending to look for him and asking others to help. Zaman was described as ""vengeful and controlling"" and was determined to get revenge on Mr Prout who he believed had been involved in stealing from him. Mr Justice Dove said words could not to do justice to the brutality Mr Prout endured or how they all had betrayed him, saying ""what he suffered was beyond imagining"". He added the case involved the ""sadistic torture of a vulnerable victim"" which was ""designed to inflict excruciating pain"" and ""monstrous violence"". The jury was shown CCTV images, often taken from cameras on Zaman's house, of the worsening condition of Mr Prout as the assaults continued, some of which showed him clearly unsteady on his feet and being pushed along the street. Images of some of Jimmy Prout's injuries were posted onto his Facebook page Det Ch Insp Andy Fairlamb, of Northumbria Police, said: ""This truly has been one of the most awful cases I have dealt with. ""The way these people treated this man was abhorrent. He was brutally tortured by these people who were supposed to be his friends. It's hard to believe that a human being could have been treated in this way."" He said a domestic homicide review, involving several agencies including the Northumbria force, was now under way into the circumstances surrounding Mr Prout's death. Mr Prout's brother Edward said: ""I buried my brother Jimmy on my birthday last year and it was one of the hardest things I've had to do.

"Google Shopping ads appear at the top of many search result pages Google has been fined 2.42bn euros ($2.7bn; Â£2.1bn) by the European Commission after it ruled the company had abused its power by promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results. The amount is the regulator's largest penalty to date against a companyaccused of distorting the market,external. The ruling also orders Google to end its anti-competitive practices within 90 days or face a further penalty. The US firm said it may appeal. However, if it fails to change the way it operates the Shopping service within the three-month deadline, it could be forced to make payments of 5% of its parent company Alphabet's average daily worldwide earnings. Based on the company'smost recent financial report,external, that amounts to about $14m a day. The commission said it was leaving it to Google to determine what alterations should be made to its Shopping service rather than specifying a remedy. ""What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" declared Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's Competition Commissioner. ""It has denied other companies the chance to compete on their merits and to innovate, and most importantly it has denied European consumers the benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation."" This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager explains how consumers have been harmed by Google's Shopping service Ms Vestager added that the decision could now set a precedent that determines how she handles related complaints about the prominence Google gives to its own maps, flight price results and local business listings within its search tools. Google hadpreviously suggested,externalthat Amazon and eBay have more influence over the public's spending habits and has again said it does not accept the claims made against it. ""When you shop online, you want to find the products you're looking for quickly and easily,"" a spokesman said in response to the ruling. ""And advertisers want to promote those same products. That's why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. ""We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case."" Google Shopping displays relevant products' images and prices alongside the names of shops they are available from and review scores, if available. Shopping results often push traditional links off screen when viewed on smartphones The details are labelled as being ""sponsored"", reflecting the fact that, unlike normal search results, they only include items that sellers have paid to appear. On smartphones, the facility typically dominates ""above-the-fold"" content, meaning users might not see any traditional links unless they scroll down. Google's giant fine: the net reacts Google ends ad-targeting Gmail scans EU fines Facebook over 'misleading' WhatsApp claim Cookie banner frustration to be tackled by EU Google also benefits from the fact the Shopping service adverts are more visual than its text-based ads. One recent study,externalsuggested Shopping accounts for 74% of all retail-related ads clicked on within Google Search results. However, the BBC understands Google's own data indicates the true figure is smaller. The European Commission has been investigating Google Shopping since late 2010. The probe was spurred on by complaints from Microsoft, among others. The rival tech giant has opted not to comment on the ruling, after the two struck a deal last year to try toavoid such legal battles in the future,external. However, one of the other original complainants - the British price comparison service Foundem - welcomed the announcement. ""Although the record-breaking 2.42bn euro fine is likely to dominate the headlines, the prohibition of Google's immensely harmful search manipulation practices is far more important,"" said its chief executive Shivaun Raff. ""For well over a decade, Google's search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online. Left unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power."" This is a big moment in a clash between the EU and the US's tech giants, which has been going on for more than a decade. The commission believes it has struck a blow for consumers and for little firms at a time when online advertising - particularly on mobile phones - is dominated by Google and Facebook. Google believes the regulator has a weak case and has failed to provide evidence that either consumers or rivals have been harmed. In essence, it sees this as a political move rather than one based on competition law. You can be pretty confident that the Trump administration will share that view. There's mounting anxiety in European capitals about something called Gafa - Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - the four American giants that play such a huge role in all of our lives. That means we can expect further action to try to limit their powers, with the potential for growing political tension between Brussels and Washington. Although the penalty is record-sized, it could have been bigger. The commission has the power to fine Alphabetup to 10% of its annual revenue,external, which was more than $90bn (Â£70.8bn)in its last financial year,external. Alphabet can afford the fine - it currently has more than $172bn of assets. The Shopping service has helped Google make ads appear more attractive But one expert said the company would be more concerned about the impact on its future operations. ""If it has to change the appearance of it results and rankings, that's going to have an impact on how it can monetise search,"" said Chris Green, from the tech consultancy Lewis. ""Right now, the way that Google prioritises some of its retail and commercial services generates quite a lot of ad income. ""When you consider the sheer number of search queries that Google handles on a daily basis, that's a lot of ad inventory going in front of a lot of eyeballs. ""Dent that by even a few percentage points, and there's quite a big financial drop."" At her press conference, Margrethe Vestager insisted her action was ""based on facts"" rather than any prejudice the European Commission might have against US tech companies. ""We have heard allegations of being biased against US companies,"" she said. ""I have been going through the statistics... I can find no facts to support any kind of bias."" But this is far from the first time the European Commission has penalised US tech giants for what it views to be bad behaviour. Others to have been targeted include: Microsoft (2008) - the Windows-developer was fined â¬899m for failing to comply with earlier punishments, imposed over its refusal to share key code with its rivals and the bundling of its Explorer browser with its operating system. Five years later, it was told to pay a further â¬561m for failing to comply with a pledge to provide users a choice screen of browsers Intel (2009) - the chip-maker was ordered to pay â¬1.06bn for skewing the market by offering discounts conditional on computer-makers avoiding products from its rivals. Intel challenged the fine, and a final court ruling in the matter is expected in 2018 Qualcomm (2015) - the chip-maker was accused of illegally paying a customer to use its technology and selling its chipsets below cost to push a rival out of the market. If confirmed, it faces a fine that could top â¬2bn, but the case has yet to be resolved Apple (2016) - Ireland was ruled to have given up to â¬13bn of illegal tax benefits to the iPhone-maker since 1991, and was ordered to recover the funds plus interest from the company. However, Dublin missed the deadline it was given to do so and has said it will appeal Facebook (2017) - the social network agreed to pay a â¬110m fine for saying it could not match user accounts on its main service to those of WhatsApp when it took over the instant messaging platform, and then doing just that two years later The commission is also investigating Amazon over concerns that a tax deal struck with Luxembourg gave it an unfair advantage. The European Commission continues to pursue two separate cases against Google. The first involves allegations that the technology company has made it difficult forothers to have their apps and search engines,externalpreinstalled on Android devices. The second covers claimsGoogle took steps to restrict rivals' ads,externalfrom appearing on third-party websites that had installed a Google-powered  search box.

"One of the London Bridge attackers was a follower of the banned al-Muhajiroun network. But has the UK been guilty of not taking the Islamist group seriously enough? The man in a white robe with the microphone at the front of the hall addressed his audience of al-Muhajiroun supporters. Even with cameras there, he didn't hold back. ""When Tony Blair came out, George Bush came out at the same time and he said: 'Are you with us or you're with the terrorists?' What did we Muslims say?"" He paused for effect. ""We're not with you, we're with theâ¦ terrorists."" The audience finished his sentence for him and cries of Allahu Akbar [God is great] echoed around the room. It was April 2004 and I'd been invited to film at an al-Muhajiroun meeting at a community hall in Bethnal Green in east London. I was following a convert to Islam called Sulayman Keeler - born Simon Keeler - for a film I was making for Newsnight. The next speaker was no less extreme. Abu Uzair, real name Sajid Sharif, took the microphone. The engineering graduate from Manchester launched into one of al-Muhajiroun's favourite topics - the 9/11 attacks on America. Abu Uzair defends the 9/11 attack at an al-Muhajiroun meeting in 2004 ""When the two planes magnificently run through those buildingsâ¦ people say, 'hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why did you have to do that?' You know why? Because of ignorance."" At this point, I put my hand up to interrupt, asking him how it could be justifiable to call the killing of innocent people in the Twin Towers ""magnificent"". Abu Uzair replied: ""For us it's retaliation."" I pressed on: ""But the killing of innocent civilians can't be right."" Jabbing his finger at me, Abu Uzair answered: ""It can't be right according to you. According to Islam it's right. Do you not kill innocent civilians in Afghanistan?"" ""I wouldn't call that magnificent,"" I ventured. Abu Uzair replied: ""Islamically speaking it's magnificent."" And with that exchange, the extreme, aggressive ideology of al-Muhajiroun became clear. It was a message of defiance, of hate. No compromise. For them Islam was at war with the West. They knew our camera was rolling but they were justifying violence. This was a year before the London bombings on 7 July 2005 that claimed 52 lives. The BBC understands that Abu Uzair has never faced legal action in the UK. He gave this lecture 13 years ago. The legal picture has changed now. New laws ban the glorification of terrorism and there've been many more successful prosecutions over the past decade. After the Manchester Arena bomb attack last month, MI5 let it be known that the scale of the threat from militant Islamists is huge. Some 3,000 people in the UK are assessed to have current links to violent Islamist extremism, with another 20,000 assessed to have had recent links. That makes for a longlist of 23,000 people - the population of a small town. Radical preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad, pictured in 1996 The fact that al-Muhajiroun was allowed to recruit in towns across the UK for years, largely unfettered by the state, is part of the picture. The group was the creation of the extremist preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad. Born in Syria, he was expelled in 1977 for his anti-Baath Party views and travelled to Lebanon where he joined Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Their aim was to create a single Islamic State - a caliphate - across the entire Middle East and, eventually, the world. After a brief stay in Egypt, Bakri Muhammad settled in Mecca in Saudi Arabia. In 1983, he created a new group there called Jamaat al-Muhajiroun. The name means ""the community of the emigrants"". In 1986, Bakri Muhammad's extreme Islamist views and connections to the banned Hizb ut-Tahrir led the Saudis to expel him. He fled to the UK where he was given asylum. He immediately created a UK branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir and began an aggressive recruitment drive among young British Muslims. In the UK, Bakri Muhammad's sermons called for the black flag of Islam to be hoisted over Downing Street and for a global caliphate. The next decade was spent peddling his narrative - that Muslims were the victims of international conspiracies, that Sharia [Islamic law] must come to the UK. But Hizb ut-Tahrir's international leadership grew tired of the man who would become known as the Tottenham Ayatollah, a reference to his office in north London. His focus on the UK was seen as a distraction from the wider goal of establishing a caliphate across the Middle East. He was expelled from the party in 1996. And that prompted him to set up a new group in the UK - al-Muhajiroun. In the late 1990s, Bakri Muhammad toured towns and cities with large Muslim populations in a recruitment drive for his new group. He was largely unchallenged by the British state, which had been preoccupied by the threat posed by Irish republican groups. 2002: A demonstrator at an al-Muhajiroun event in London They dismissed Bakri Muhammad as a fool. In the wider community, few realised how divisive and dangerous his views were. Over the years, I've spent a lot of time in Crawley, investigating terrorism for the BBC. With its well-kept houses and leafy streets, this Sussex new town seems an unlikely recruiting ground for jihad. But some of the UK's most notorious Islamists were born there. Three of those later convicted of planning to detonate a huge fertiliser bomb in 2004 grew up in the town. The leader of the plot, Omar Khyam, had strong links with al-Muhajiroun. Jawad Akbar and Omar Khyam (r) were given life sentences in 2007 for plotting bomb attacks Omar Khyam and another of the fertiliser bomb plotters, Jawad Akbar, both attended Hazelwick secondary school in the town. At one point Bakri Muhammad managed to get himself invited to talk to sixth formers there. The headteacher of Hazelwick school at that time was Gordon Parry. ""At the time our involvement with him was simply to promote religious tolerance and understanding and inclusivity,"" he says. ""I will put my hand up now and say that was an utterly naÃ¯ve thing to do. But at the time I didn't understand what he represented."" Fast-forward to 2017 and the terror attack at London Bridge had a strong link with al-Muhajiroun. The attack leader Khuram Butt was a supporter of the network, even appearing in a Channel 4 documentary last year called The Jihadis Next Door. Police officers on the scene after the London Bridge terror attack on 3 June Butt didn't exactly hide his extremist sympathies, and this raises a huge question for the British state - was the threat posed by radicals linked to al-Muhajiroun underestimated for years? One senior former government adviser on the threat from terrorism certainly thinks it was. Richard Kemp was chairman of the Cobra Intelligence Group at the time of the London bombings in 2005. He was responsible for co-ordinating intelligence from the Security Service MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service MI6, reporting to the secret Cobra committee that briefs the government on national security at times of crisis. Col. Richard Kemp: ""We've been far too tolerant of al-Muhajiroun"" ""We've been far too tolerant of al-Muhajiroun,"" says Kemp. Their use of abusive language and threats was not tackled, he suggests. ""It was a major failure and we've seen the consequences - we've seen Lee Rigby [murdered] by a follower of al-Muhajiroun, we've seen numerous attacks around the world."" Kemp, also a former commander of British armed forces in Afghanistan, says there was a certain amount of complacency about al-Muhajiroun, both in the intelligence community and in successive governments. ""There was a real failure politically and among the police and intelligence services to understand the way this situation was going to develop."" There was a period of inaction on the part of the authorities before 9/11 - but also after - that was extremely dangerous, Kemp believes. The 9/11 attack on New York's World Trade Center ""The networks and the individuals involved in them saw that we were weak. They saw that we wanted to appease them and we wanted to let them continue and they exploited that - in terms of developing and building a network. ""There was an element of complacency among those people who were monitoring their activities. I certainly heard words used like 'blowhard' and 'windbag' in relation to some casesâ¦ that we're looking at people who talk a big war but don't actually fight it and don't pose a big threat to the UK."" Peter Clarke, the former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, doesn't agree with this analysis. ""It is easy to say with hindsight that more should have been done sooner to focus on the Islamist threat. This is too simplistic. The Good Friday agreement may have been signed in 1998, but the dissident republicans of the Real IRA were attacking targets on the mainland UK, including the BBC, until 2001. At that time Islamist groups were involved in low-level criminality to raise funds to send back to political organisations in their countries of origin."" Mr Clarke says he never heard the term ""blowhard"" being used. Peter Clarke, former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police In 2004 it was clear the threat had escalated. An intercepted electronic communication about perfecting the ingredients for a massive fertiliser bomb prompted a huge counter-terrorism investigation by the police and MI5 - Operation Crevice. This was followed a few months later by another big investigation, Operation Rhyme, to foil a second Islamist bomb plot in the UK. There was a race to investigate these plots, Clarke says. ""These were both intercepted as a result of intensive investigation by MI5 and police, and preceded the 7/7 attacks. So it is not right to say that the Islamist threat was ignored. ""Priorities were chosen according to the threat posed by various groups. After 9/11, Irish terrorist groups pulled back on their activities, allowing a shift in focus towards finding out if Islamists did indeed pose a threat."" The fertiliser bomb plotters - and the 7/7 London bombers who murdered 52 people the following year - also had strong links to al-Muhajiroun. Mohammad Sidique Khan, one of the bombers in the 7/7 London attacks in 2005 By 2004, it was clear that the al-Muhajiroun network had been at the very least a gateway to terror. Al-Muhajiroun and its leaders always played a cat and mouse game with the state. Bakri Muhammad wound up the group in 2004 because he thought it was about to be banned. But the network then launched a series of groups which were, in effect, different names for the same thing. Al-Ghurabaa and the Saviour Sect both emerged in 2005 as splinter groups, and were proscribed in 2006. Other groups created by the same network included Muslims Against Crusades, Islam4UK, Shariah4UK, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, the London School of Sharia, and Need4Khilafah. All of them were proscribed by the government after they emerged. All of these groups can be considered as the al-Muhajiroun network. They all wanted to see Sharia law introduced to the UK by force, do not believe in democracy, and have hostile views about Shia Muslims and other minorities that they claim are consistent with the teachings of the Koran. So why was more not done? This was ideological extremism and the leaders of the network, like Anjem Choudary, were always careful to stay, just, on the right side of the law so they could not be arrested. Anjem Choudary, one of the co-founders of al-Muhajiroun, currently jailed for supporting IS ""No-one knew whether the ideological stance of al-Muhajiroun was going to inevitably lead to violence in this country,"" says Mr Clarke. ""Once the threat from dissident republicans receded, the focus on the Islamist threat grew very quickly. It's also probably fair to say that no-one had before encountered a terrorist threat that was rooted in ideology rather than political goals, that knew no boundaries and for whose adherents capture or death was not a risk but an aspiration."" The British state did take action. Bakri Muhammad was stopped from re-entering the UK after the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005, moving back to Lebanon, where he is serving a prison sentence for terrorism offences today. But his network continued under different names. Flowers left near the spot where serviceman Lee Rigby was murdered in 2013 The network's supporters have been linked to terror plots across the world. And a number of adherents in the UK have been imprisoned. In addition to the five fertiliser bomb plotters - Omar Khyam, Jawad Akbar, Waheed Mahmood, Anthony Garcia and Salahuddin Amin - other followers such as Sulayman Keeler and Abu Izzadeen have been convicted of terror-related offences. Figurehead Anjem Choudary was eventually jailed for five years for inviting support for so-called Islamic State. 2003: Suicide bombing attack on Mike's Place bar in Israel 2004: Fertiliser bomb plot and Operation Rhyme in the UK 2005: London bombings 2013: Murder of Lee Rigby 2014: Suicide bombing attack in Iraq by Waheed Majid 2017: London Bridge attacks This latest connection, between the recent London Bridge terrorist attack and al-Muhajiroun, is likely to feature in the ongoing police investigation. We know Khuram Butt, the attack leader, was a long-term supporter of the group. But if you dig a little further some interesting facts emerge about the gym in east London where he used to train - the Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford. Khuram Butt, one of the London Bridge attackers, had connections to Al-Muhajiroun Newsnight discovered that a man called Sajeel Shahid applied for planning permission to create a gym for Muslims from warehouse space in 2011. To understand the significance of this, we have to look back to the late 1990s when Omar Bakri Muhammad set up a branch of al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan. Sajeel Shahid is alleged to have helped run the office in Lahore. Just after the 9/11 attack, an American jihadist called Mohammed Junaid Babar joined them. Three years later, he turned against his old friends and became a jihadi ""supergrass"", testifying against people in the al-Muhajiroun network who went on to plan a terror attack in the UK. We obtained a confidential transcript of the FBI's interview with Junaid Babar. In it, Junaid Babar tells the FBI that Sajeel Shahid was the leader of al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan. The document alleges that Junaid Babar said that Sajeel Shahid co-ordinated training for jihadi recruits at a camp in Pakistan where they ""most likely received explosives training"". Junaid Babar also said in court, during the 2007 trial of the fertiliser bomb plotters, that in February 2003 he and Sajeel Shahid had found a good location for weapons training in Pakistan's north-west frontier province near the town of Malakand. The future leader of the fertiliser bomb plot, Omar Khyam, and the future leader of the London 7/7 bombers, Mohammad Siddique Khan, trained there. We tried to contact Sajeel Shahid to ask him about this, but a man answering the phone number we had simply said it was the wrong number and hung up. There's absolutely no suggestion that Sajeel Shahid had a hand in the London Bridge attack, and he has never been charged with any terror-related offence. Sajeel Shahid has previously denied being the leader of al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan and said that he had only been a student in the country. Sajeel Shahid being interviewed by the BBC in London in 2007 The named groups connected with al-Muhajiroun have been proscribed, but the networks of supporters persist. After the recent spate of attacks, Prime Minister Theresa May said ""enough is enough"" and declared her intent to do something about it. But based on the last two decades of various governments failing to get on top of the problem of radicalisation, Richard Kemp remains worried.

"Google faces having to pay a huge fine for giving its Shopping service such prominence The EU's Competition Commissioner said her team analysed a gigantic 5.2 terabytes of search results before determining that Google had indeed abused its position by running its Shopping service price comparison ads at the top of search results. That's the equivalent of nearly two billion search queries. As news that she had fined its parent company Alphabet a record 2.4bn euros ($2.7bn; Â£2.1bn) spread, it became clear that many thought the case against the tech firm was obvious without needing to dive that deep into the data. But others perceive the penalty to be unfair and even prejudicial against the US, despite the fact several American firms had spoken out against Googlein advance of the ruling,external. For its part, Google says it does not accept the criticism and may appeal. Below is a sample of the early reactions to the news culled from emailed press releases, social media, blogs and elsewhere. ""For over a decade Google has abused and leveraged its monopoly power in search - where it has a 95% market share in Europe... The commission's decision will finally put a stop to that abusive conduct, and it will enable those competitors that have survived despite Google's behaviour, as well as new entrants, to compete on their merits,"" Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to Fairsearch, a group of internet businesses that have lobbied against Google. ""Further legal action will be needed if Google tries to circumvent the commission's verdict. It will be important to have a very strong monitoring trustee and oversight to ensure that the remedy is put into practice,"" Richard Stables, chief executive of the price comparison site Kelkoo. ""Other regulators and companies have been intimidated by Google's overwhelming might, but the commission has taken a strong stand and we hope that this is the first step in remedying Google's shameless abuse of its dominance in search. We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,""News Corp via its site,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager explains how consumers have been harmed by Google's Shopping service ""[It's] eurotechnopanic at its worst: anti-American, anti-technology, anti-capitalism... Europe, you can't regulate yourself into competition. You have to invest and innovate,"" Prof Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do?via Twitter,external. ""The EU has effectively decided that some companies have become too big to innovate. The EU's actions have created a cloud of uncertainty that will make large tech companies overly cautious about making changes to the user experience and service offerings that would benefit consumers... The only real beneficiary of today's ruling is the EU's treasury,"" Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. ""Prioritising a particular shopping search engine is not akin to gouging water users with higher prices because there are alternatives to Google that users can switch to easily. If the overall user experience is made worse by Google Shopping being prioritised, then users will have the option of moving to a search engine like Bing which is perhaps less good at search but better overall because it does not prioritise a bad shopping tool,"" Sam Bowman, executive director,Adam Smith Institute via its website.,external ""Given the depth of Google's pockets, this is by no means a commercial disaster but it has the makings of a brand disaster. Google has always presented itself as 'the good guy' of technology, but if this record fine stands then it would be harder for them to argue that,"" Rupert Bhatia, director of public relations at crisis management agency Rhizome Media. ""Prepare to see more such divided action (geographically based)... but [it's] not simply America v EU. Some huge US companies (Oracle) agree with the EU fine, saying Google hurts competition."" Adrian Weckler, tech editor, The Irish Independentvia Twitter,external. Google faces further penalties if it does not change the way Google Shopping ads are displayed within three months ""It's simply not possible for us to operate a complex economy without certainty... Vital to this is that we all know what the law is ahead of time. It must be possible for us to know that we are acting illegally that is, the law must be known, it must be possible for us to know that we are subject to it.

"The best and worst broadband speeds across the UK have been revealed by a new study, with the bottom threeall found in Scotland. The Which? research found the Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands and Highland local authorities all averaged the lowest speeds. Ryedale in Yorkshire and Purbeck in Dorset also made up the bottom five. But how do you how check your broadband service or choose which package to get at home? Newsbeat asked Alan Blake, a broadband and wi-fi specialist atGBR Networks,external. It's looks so pretty but you probably won't want to work from home in the Orkney Islands It's all about cost and speed. The perfect equation is lowest cost for highest speed but do try to look for deals that offer lower installation and activation costs. Also, some ISPs offer bundles whereby you receive discounted broadband if you also subscribe to TV and telephone packages. There are other considerations like usage - make sure you are not capped and have an unlimited usage bundle and also check the contract length. Speeds are an indicator of how much data can be transferred per second and measured in Megabits Per second (Mbps). The higher the ""Mbps"" number the more data you can download and the faster your internet connection is. Data files are typically referred to as a unit of measurement in Megabytes (MB) and 1 MB is equal to 8 Megabits (Mb). Many confuse the two and use them interchangeably. The minimum download speed proposed under the government's Universal Service Obligation is 10Mbps. A good website to check your internet speed is atWhich? Broadband Test,externalor atSpeed Test,external. If you want to be more accurate with your broadband speed test, make sure your computer or laptop is cabled so you don't include the wi-fi speed into your broadband speed test. Yes, concurrent users on shared broadband will directly impact speed and performance as bandwidth becomes saturated. Typically this happens during peak periods, on Friday night when lots of people are watching Netflix. This is what a local telephone and broadband exchange looks like if you were wondering If you're further away from the exchange, things like latency and noise will increase - which means less speed and performance. Yes, you need to have a really fast high-speed broadband. Go for the best broadband if you want to watch House of Cards without buffering Video streaming files are getting bigger to pack in more definition like 4K and online gaming files are getting bigger to pack in more graphics and data to improve your gaming and viewing experience. Faster speeds also prevent buffering. Netflix recommends 3Mb for SD quality shows, 5Mb for HD and 25Mb for 4K. I say wire if you can, wireless if you can't. If you have good wi-fi coverage in your home and are using the latest technology, ie your router is less than two years old, then for most things, you don't need to cable. This is what fibre optic cables look like when they're being laid But if you like gaming, make sure you cable your PS4/Xbox directly to your broadband router to get the best gaming performance and speeds. If you want to stream HD TV or game then you need more speed.

"Team Fast sitting in front of their prototype bus that runs on formic acid A group of students has developed a way of storing energy that could be cheaper to make, more practical and more sustainable than alternative renewable fuels. They are young and clever, and they want to change the world - one bus at a time. ""We've created the world's first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits,"" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin-off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. ""We're building our own future."" Around 40 of his fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. And they're also trying to create careers for themselves. Formic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica. And this simple carboxylic acid (chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers. The hydrozine-filled trailer will attach to the back of the bus But Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles. The fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine (not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels. The difference is that it is much cleaner. ""The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,"" explains Mr van Cappellen. ""No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted."" To prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where it will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs. The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind. ""Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km (180 miles). However, we could of course make the tank bigger very easily,"" says Mr van Cappellen. Team Fast tested its concept in a one-metre length model car in January 2016 Current hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km. But why develop a bus rather than a car? ""If we built a car, we would compete with electric cars, but we believe battery-powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,"" says Mr van Cappellen. ""But if we prove that we can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, we will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet."" Hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). More Technology of Business 'I lost my eye': How insurance saved one man from debt 'How I could have stolen my old car using my smartphone' 'How foul-mouthed hackers messed up my life' Could you cope with smartphone rationing? ""In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. This is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,"" explains Mr van Cappellen. The hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent. Its newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why ""it is now applicable in transport applications for the first time"". The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor. Zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell buses are becoming more common on our city streets ""We are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,"" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions. ""The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies."" But does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable? ""It costs about 35,000 euros (Â£30,000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,"" says Mr van Cappellen. As such, it is ""100 times cheaper"" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, he maintains. ""Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future we expect prices to come down so it will be cheaper than both,"" he adds. Although the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it's a closed carbon cycle in the jargon. Some types of ant squirt formic acid as a defence mechanism Some experts believe the technology shows promise. ""Team Fast has a very good project,"" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research. ""It works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used."" Andseveral companies,externalare supporting the project. ""What we're working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,"" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry. ""If we achieve this it will give us a stable future."" The students' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20-25 hours per week. ""We don't get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,"" Mr van Cappellen says. ""It's our own future we're making.""

"Amy Dickman has had a number of narrow escapes during her years working with big cats, but her closest shave came when tackling lion-killing warriors. It was late evening and Amy Dickman was walking through the bush to a household she suspected was celebrating a lion kill. ""It was dark but I suddenly got the feeling I was being watched,"" Dickman recalls. ""I was concerned that a big cat might be lying in wait."" For a brief moment the moon appeared from behind the clouds, illuminating the landscape. ""I realised I was surrounded by young men carrying spears. Then it went dark again. I was terrified,"" she says. This was Dickman's first encounter with warriors from the Barabaig - a community with a history of killing non-Barabaig people and still widely feared. A conservation biologist from Devon, Dickman has been running a big carnivores project in Ruaha, southern Tanzania, since 2009. An estimated 3,000 lions, one in 10 of the world's wild population, live in the remote region - a massive unfenced national park, bounded by tribal lands. Dickman knew she had to make contact with Barabaig warriors to find out whether humans and big cats were coming into conflict, so when she heard sounds of celebration she set off with two volunteers. What they hadn't realised was that the Barabaig were on high alert, due to a power struggle with the Maasai, with accusations of cattle rustling flying between the two sides. After the moonlight revealed the circle of warriors with raised spears, one of Dickman's assistants hastily called out: ""We're just doing research, there's no problem!"" ""Thankfully they realised we were bumbling around like buffoons and weren't a threat,"" Dickman says. ""They agreed to come and talk to us at our camp."" The next day Dickman's team sat down with a delegation of Barabaig warriors to get to know one another. ""I told them I had been scared one night when they had passed our camp chanting and banging spears, as I thought they might attack us,"" Dickman says. ""They laughed and explained it was a ceremony they do after making the first bricks in the year. ""Then they wanted to know what I kept in the Tupperware containers. I showed them it was sugar and they looked abashed. They said they had thought it could be body parts."" The warriors also revealed that lions regularly attacked the livestock in the villages on the edge of the national park.  It was worse in the rainy season when the lion's natural prey travelled away from the river. ""Lions were viewed as vermin,"" Dickman says. Killing a lion provided a warrior with both wealth and status. ""We had found a lot of lion carcasses with the right paw cut off,"" Dickman says. ""It turns out warriors take the central claw to the witchdoctor who agrees a price in cattle that they can collect from nearby households. They can get around 20 cattle for one lion, which is worth $4,000."" Dickman began collecting data on the number of lion kills and was staggered by the results. ""In 2011, 37 lions were killed around just one village we were working in. That was equivalent to half the wild lions trophy-hunted across the whole of Africa in a year."" When Dickman first arrived in southern Tanzania she found there was just a small pop-up tent to sleep in. It had been placed on the trail hippos used to reach water, so she moved it away from the river to avoid being trampled, and assumed she would be safe. ""But on my first night a male lion came sniffing around my tent,"" she says. She grabbed a deodorant and pocket knife in case she had to defend herself, but at that point the lion just lay down on the tent, trapping her arm. ""I was terrified. I thought it was going to eat me. Then I realised it had fallen asleep,"" she says. The tent on the hippo trail Inside the tent, the temperature began to rise. ""I genuinely thought I would die from heat exhaustion as it got so hot,"" Dickman says. She thinks she passed out shortly afterwards and woke the next morning to find the lion had gone. That night she made sure she slept on a raised platform. ""It was my closest shave with a lion but actually most of my close shaves came when interacting with some of the local people,"" she says. Listen to Amy Dickman describe how shetook a leopard to the dentiston Outlook, on the BBC World Service But Dickman's team began to make progress. They reduced attacks on livestock by reinforcing thornbush cattle enclosures with wire and introducing specially bred guard dogs. ""Dogs weren't really valued there at the time. The idea you could train dogs was quite alien to them,"" Dickman says. ""I remember telling our camp dogs to sit in Swahili while talking with some locals and the meeting ground to a halt. They wanted to know where I had got the magic dogs from, dogs that could speak Swahili."" They introduced a handful of Anatolian dogs, which were first bred for guarding livestock in Turkey, but had been used successfully by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in Namibia, where Dickman had worked for six years. That role had also had its hair-raising moments. ""One time we took on a leopard with a broken tooth that had been captured by a farmer. The tooth would have to be replaced if he was to make it back into the wild,"" Dickman says. The team called a local dentist and booked an appointment, leaving out the vital information that the patient would be an anaesthetised leopard. ""He wasn't happy but eventually we persuaded him to take a look, and he got quite enthusiastic,"" Dickman says. The dentist made a false tooth using an amalgam of steel and silver, as it needed to be very strong. Each time they went back for a fitting people would crowd into the dentist's surgery in order to get a glimpse of the big cat. ""On the final fitting the dentist said he had seen the leopard open his eyes, but we didn't believe him. Minutes later the leopard pulled the top half of his body off the table,"" Dickman says. People escaped through doors and windows as the big cat was put under again. ""I'm glad that was the last fitting as I don't think the dentist would have had us back."" In Tanzania, the Anatolian guard dogs proved a success. Dickman's project also offered local warriors the role of Lion Defenders - conservation jobs that came with responsibilities and status. ""We taught Lion Defenders to read and gave them the chance to travel. They can buy their own cattle with their pay."" The wider community is involved in conservation via a camera trap competition. Dickman's team has provided villagers with equipment and training, and points are allotted for the wildlife recorded, based on the size of the animals and how endangered they are. These points can then be exchanged for money towards healthcare, education and vet medicine. ""We are saying, 'If you want extra benefits, the way to get them is to protect the wildlife better,'"" Dickman says. The project seems to be working. Livestock killings have fallen by 60% and lion killings by 80% over a five-year period. They currently work with 10 villages but plan to expand it to all 22 that adjoin the park. But for that they will need more money. ""There isn't a meaningful way to make the project self-sustaining as these communities wouldn't be the ones benefitting from tourism,"" Dickman says. This video can not be played Listen: Dr Amy Dickman tells BBC Outlook how she took a leopard to the dentist ""However, if we consider lions to be part of our global heritage then we need to fund this. We can't expect people on less than $1 a day to pay the price."" Dickman now splits her time between Tanzania, the US, where she raises funds, and the UK, where she has a husband and a two-year-old daughter. ""The hardest part of my job is being away from my daughter Millie, but I know I'm making a difference,"" Dickman says. ""People don't realise how at risk lions are. They have halved in the past 20 years and there are now fewer than 25,000 left. Their fate hangs in the balance."" Dickman says she will never lose her wonder of big cats. ""It's very primal when you see them. Not long ago I was changing a tyre and got the sensation I was being watched. I looked up and a leopard was sitting on the other side of the road looking at me. ""He was quite young and I didn't feel scared, as he just looked curious. We watched each other for a minute before he disappeared in to the bush. Seeing things like that renews your soul.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May sets out 'offer' on EU citizens' rights Over a year after the referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, Theresa May hassought to clarify plansregarding the future of EU citizens living in the UK. It is a subject which had attractedmore questions than answers- hundreds were submitted to the BBC. On Monday the government released a 15-page document outlining some of the detail of their plans. BBC Reality Check has pored through the details and returned to your questions with some answers. Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals? Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK Government are committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements. What rights will EU citizens lose under the current proposal? The residents who have ""settled status"" will be treated the same way as UK nationals in terms of benefits, pension, social security and access to public services. But under the UK proposal, ""settled status"" would not give citizens the same family or legal rights they currently enjoy. For example, income tests would be applied for those who want to bring non-EU family members to the UK. And the European Court of Justice would no longer guarantee EU citizens' rights. The EU wants to preserve all these rights and this will be an important subject of the EU-UK Brexit talks. What will happen to the matter of combining pension contributions from different EU countries to build up your pensions? Will this remain? The UK document proposes that it should remain. Brexit: What is UK offering EU citizens? Brexit couples react to deal: Anxiety put to rest or not? Will UK-born children of EU nationals (living here more than 20 years) be able to register as British Citizens rather than naturalizing? If a child is born in the UK after a parent acquires settled status, the child would automatically become British. The lawyer advising us said: ""The following question relating to children of EU nationals and citizenship is difficult to answer as UK nationality law is a very complex area. ""The scenario in the question raises numerous further questions. To be able to advise definitively we would need to know when the child was born in the UK (before or after the parent acquired settled status in the UK) as a child born in the UK after a parent acquires settled status would automatically become British. ""Separate to this, the child may also have become British after 10 years of residence in the UK, which would negate the need for registering as British."" What kind of document will I be provided with to prove I have rights to stay in UK as a citizen? Those with ""settled status"" will be provided with a residence document of some kind. If one already has a document certifying permanent residency would he/she still need to apply for a UK settled status? Yes, he/she will still have to apply for the ""settled status"" but the government says it would make the application process ""as streamlined as possible for those who already hold such documents"". Will the ""settled status"" be lost if you leave the UK for two years (like Permanent Residency)? Yes, it will be lost, unless you have ""strong ties"" in the UK, the UK government paper says. What happens to the EU citizens who have not lived in the UK up to five years? They will also be allowed to stay. Those who arrived less than five years before a cut-off date will be able to apply for settled status once they reach the five-year total, providing that falls within the two-year grace period which will start after the cut-off date. The UK proposed 29 March 2017 as the earliest cut-off date and the day the UK exits the EU as the latest. Those who don't reach the five-year total within the grace period will be able to apply for a temporary residence permit. If you still haven't reached the five-year total after the end of the grace period, your situation will depend on the new rules, which are yet to be decided. Can the UK take over existing EU trade agreements? Brexit court ruling: Your questions answered Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019? Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then. Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over EU citizens rights living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit? The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This will be an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law? Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules, and the UK parliament would decide on the new law. I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit? You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that, but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations. I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change? Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.

"Car finance borrowing is rising rapidly Ultra low interest rates were put in place after the financial crisis to stop a recession turning into a depression. Many believe they worked. Alongside a huge money-printing exercise to keep the financial system operating. Some of the consequence of those policies are now becoming clear. A struggling economy has meant income growth has been low, and at present, real incomes are falling as inflation approaches 3%. Millions of consumers are resorting to borrowing to maintain their economic standing. If you exclude mortgages, consumers are now borrowing 10% more than they were last year. The total amount of borrowing now stands at Â£198bn. The fastest growth has been in car financing, with dealers encouraging people to buy new cars by lending at low interest rates and then asking for a ""balloon payment"" at the end of the loan period to complete the car purchase. Car finance borrowing is rising at 15%. Credit card borrowing is also up, at around 10%. And general loans, for example for a house extension, are rising at a little under 10%. These are the fastest growth rates since 2005. At the moment the Bank of England is being cautious. Yes, it is warning High Street banks to take care whom they lend to. But officials also point out that at present employment rates are high and interest rates are low. And wage growth is expected to pick up from its present low point of just above 2%, meaning that consumers will be better able to sustain repayments. General borrowing for things like home extensions has also risen The total level of consumer borrowing is also low compared with the total level of mortgage lending, which is valued at around Â£1.3tn. That is rising at about 2.8% a year, so much more slowly. Though even here, the Bank says that High Street banks need to take care as loan to value rates creep up. The Bank is sending out an amber warning. There are not the red flashing lights apparent before the financial crisis, when over-indebted consumers faced much higher interest rates and banks themselves had very thin cushions of money to protect them from loans that turned bad. Banks have much more of that money now - called a capital buffer. But even at ""amber"", the Bank of England has demanded that they raise it, by Â£11.4bn over the next 18 months. And has said that lenders should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the present low interest rates and high employment levels. The next move in interest rates could be up. And record high employment levels may not last. Officials say that the Financial Stability Report today is a warning to banks chasing new customers with loan deals, not to consumers. But there is a message today for consumers as well. Take care over how much you borrow - in an uncertain world of Brexit, slowing economic growth and an incomes squeeze, the present benign conditions may not last forever.

"Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 3.5 million people in this country and is thought to cost the UK around Â£20bn per year in both direct and indirect costs. This is a staggering amount of money spent on a condition largely caused by our lifestyle choices and environment. On Doctor in the House, I try to help 39-year-old La-Vern. Her mother, Doreen, already has type 2 diabetes and is worried that La-Vern is going down the same route. La-Vern is a busy, single mother who does two jobs and, as a result, is exhausted and stressed. She has not yet crossed our diagnostic threshold where we would say she has type 2 diabetes, but her blood sugar and fasting insulin levels are not ""normal"" either.  Her results suggested that she was on the road towards type 2 diabetes. This is an ideal opportunity to practise true preventive medicine. Type 2 diabetes is a late event. By the time you get a diagnosis, things will have been going wrong in your body for many years. La-Vern's symptoms of fatigue have already affected her quality of life. However, her lifestyle is not only causing her to feel unwell, but is driving her towards a type 2 diabetes diagnosis further down the line. This is one of the big problems in medicine today - things are often said to be black or white, normal or abnormal - but what about optimal? I am an advocate for trying to recognise problems before they happen. Why should we wait for people to get a type 2 diabetes diagnosis before we take action? Type 2 diabetes is often viewed as a dietary illness. That is partially true as diet is a big contributor. However, other lifestyle factors such as insufficient sleep, long-term stress, and inappropriate physical activity all contribute, as well. For many of my patients, addressing these factors can be as important as their food choices. La-Vern's mum Doreen already has type 2 diabetes and worries that her daughter will also develop it Most cases of type 2 diabetes are caused by a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin is an important hormone and one of its functions is to keep your blood sugar tightly controlled. If you are in optimal health and not insulin resistant, a sugary bowl of breakfast cereal will cause your blood sugar to go up. Your body will then release a little bit of insulin to bring it back down again. As your health deteriorates and you start to become insulin-resistant, you need more and more insulin to keep your blood sugar under control. Your body has become deaf to insulin's sound. It is a little bit like alcohol - the very first time you have a drink, it may only take a few sips of wine to feel tipsy but as you become accustomed to drinking more and more, you need more and more alcohol to have the same effect - your body has become resistant to the effects of the alcohol. This is similar to what happens in insulin resistance. This raised level of insulin can itself cause many problems. And when the insulin can no longer keep your blood sugar under control - at that point, we give you a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. As I explainedin a TED talk,external, there is a problem with blood sugar in type 2 diabetes, but it is not a blood sugar problem. By the time your blood sugar goes into the diabetic range, things have been going wrong in your body for many years. The four areas of treatment I focused on with La-Vern are the same four areas I look at with almost all of my patients: food, movement, stress and sleep. Problems in these areas can all contribute to the development of insulin resistance. Food The main change I made with La-Vern's diet was to cut out highly processed junk food. Because of her insulin resistance, she was unable to efficiently process foods that quickly converted to sugar in her body, so I advised her to eliminate refined carbohydrates in her diet such as sugary breakfast cereals, white rice and bread. I encouraged her to increase her intake of healthy, natural fats such as avocados, nuts, and olives as well as healthy protein sources such as salmon and anchovies. Being on your phone late at night can affect your sleep Sleep La-Vern had trouble sleeping and this was contributing to her exhaustion. However, sleep deprivation can also cause insulin resistance. Like many of us, La-Vern was glued to her smartphone every evening. This late-night usage can cause major sleep issues. There are two main reasons for this: Light- The blue light emitted from smartphones is not seen in nature in the evening. This blue light can suppress your body's melatonin levels, a critical hormone that gets you to sleep. Switching off -An inability to switch off is one of the biggest causes of sleep disruption. Staying ""on"" while mindlessly scrolling through social media feeds and emails is a sure-fire way to keep your mind active. This in turn can affect your sleep. I advised La-Vern to switch off all electronic screens at least one hour before going to bed. I also gave her some amber glasses to wear in the evening to reduce the amount of blue light hitting her eyes. These small changes had an immediate impact - her sleep improved and her energy levels increased. 3. Exercise and stress La-Vern is a very typical case of what I see in my practice. She's extremely busy - a single mother working two jobs and highly stressed. I explained to La-Vern how her energy reserve is a bit like a bank account - you cannot keep making withdrawals without going into overdraft. She had very little energy reserve left with the demands of being a single mum, her two jobs and lack of sleep. Whatever time she did have left, she spent going to the gym three times per week for an intense one-hour workout session, which left her feeling drained. La-Vern was simply doing too much and her exercise regime was actually putting more stress on her body. This is a common problem these days - we have been conditioned to think that more exercise is always better. I persuaded La-Vern to swap these intense workouts for yoga, a more restorative practice. This was life-changing. At the end of her yoga session, La-Vern not only felt as though she had worked out but also felt rejuvenated and energised. Plus, it was the only ""switch off"" time she had all week. By addressing these four areas of health - food, movement, sleep and stress - I not only helped La-Vern feel significantly better, but, just as importantly, I've reduced her risk of following her mother down the road towards type 2 diabetes. La-Vern is unstinting in her praise of Dr Chatterjee. She says he ""saved"" her life. She adds: ""[That's} a profound statement I know; however he came into our lives at such a crucial time. By sharing his knowledge he has given me, my mum and my family the tools to implement very subtle changes that have literally turned our lives around. ""As humans we take certain things for granted but do we realise how such things like stress, the food we eat and a lack of sleep, the quality of the sleep actually has such a detrimental impact on the way we think, our overall health and general well-being? Until now, I certainly did not. ""Our lack of understanding meant we were tackling aspects of our lives and health believing it was for the best when in fact we were doing more harm than good. With the benefit of hindsight, this is quite a scary concept. ""We felt truly blessed to have had the opportunity to have Dr Chatterjee in our lives. He is a very wise, caring and such a genuine person and we are so grateful to him for helping us to bring about changes that are having such a positive impact."" Too much of our focus in medicine is reactive and treatment kicks in only once you have a disease. If there is any hope of saving our NHS, we have to be much more proactive at recognising and treating problems early on. The future of healthcare needs to be preventive and personalised. It's what I call progressive medicine, and there is an ever-growing need for us to practise it right now. Type 2 diabetes: a real need for preventive medicine.

"Charlie Gard has been in intensive care since October last year Judges at the European Court of Human Rights have rejected a plea from the parents of terminally-ill baby Charlie Gard to intervene in his case. Chris Gard and Connie Yates lost their final legal bid to take their son to the US for treatment. Specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital believe Charlie has no chance of survival. The court agreed, concluding that further treatment would ""continue to cause Charlie significant harm"". Charlie is thought to be one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a condition which causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage. His parents had previously seen aSupreme Court challengeto continue Charlie's life support fail. Charlie Gard's rare disease has left him unable to cry European Court judges have now concluded it was most likely Charlie was ""being exposed to continued pain, suffering and distress"" and undergoing experimental treatment with ""no prospects of success... would offer no benefit"". They said the application presented by the parents was ""inadmissible"" and said the court's decision was ""final"". The court ""also considered that it was appropriate to lift the interim measure"" which had required doctors to continue providing life support treatment to Charlie. BBC health correspondent Fergus Walsh said it is likely Charlie's life support machine will be turned off within a few days following discussions between the hospital and his family. Connie Yates and Chris Gard raised more than Â£1.3m for treatment in the US 3 March 2017: Mr Justice Francis starts to analyse the case at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London 11 April: Mr Justice Francis says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment 3 May: Charlie's parents ask Court of Appeal judges to consider the case 23 May: Three Court of Appeal judges analyse the case 25 May: Court of Appeal judges dismiss the couple's appeal 8 June: Charlie's parents lose fight in the Supreme Court 20 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights start to analyse the case after lawyers representing Charlie's parents make written submissions 27 June: Judges in the European Court of Human Rights refuse to intervene Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, raised Â£1.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for the experimental treatment in the US. Ms Yates had already indicated the money would go towards a charity for mitochondrial depletion syndromes if Charlie did ""not get his chance"". ""We'd like to save other babies and children because these medications have been proven to work and we honestly have so much belief in them. ""If Charlie doesn't get this chance, we will make sure that other innocent babies and children will be saved"", she said. Great Ormond Street Hospital said the decision marked ""the end of what has been a very difficult process"" and its priority was to ""provide every possible support to Charlie's parents as we prepare for the next steps"". ""There will be no rush to change Charlie's care and any future treatment plans will involve careful planning and discussion,"" a hospital spokesman said. In April a High Court judge ruled against the trip to America and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Three Court of Appeal judges upheld the ruling in May and three Supreme Court justices dismissed a further challenge by the parents.

"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said legislation for a second referendum would not now be introduced until at least the autumn of next year Nicola Sturgeon has put her independence referendum plans temporarily on hold after announcing a ""reset"" of her proposed timetable.

But Ms Sturgeon told Holyrood she would now delay her plans to introduce legislation for a referendum. However, she later said it was still ""likely"" a referendum would be held by 2021.

"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said legislation for a second referendum would not now be introduced until at least the autumn of next year Nicola Sturgeon has put her independence referendum plans temporarily on hold after announcing a ""reset"" of her proposed timetable. The first minister had called for an independence referendum to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. But Ms Sturgeon told Holyrood she would now delay her plans to introduce legislation for a referendum. However, she later said it was still ""likely"" a referendum would be held by 2021. Ms Sturgeon has been considering her options since the SNP lost 21 seats in the election earlier this month. She said the Scottish government would delay its proposed referendum legislation until at least the autumn of next year - although it would still need the permission of the UK government for a legally binding vote to be held. Live Scottish Parliament coverage Read Ms Sturgeon's statement in full,external In the meantime, she said she would ""redouble"" her efforts to secure the best possible Brexit deal for Scotland, and to keep the country in the European single market. Ms Sturgeon stressed that she continued to be ""strongly committed"" to Scotland having a choice on its future at the end of the Brexit process. And the first minister later told journalists she believed it was still ""likely"" there will be a second referendum on independence during the lifetime of the current Scottish Parliament, which is due to last until 2021. UK Prime Minister Theresa May had earlier urged Ms Sturgeon to take the possibility of a second referendum off the table completely. Theresa May had called on Ms Sturgeon to take the possibility of a second referendum completely off the table And Unionist opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament claimed Ms Sturgeon had not gone far enough, and that ""nothing has changed"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens urged the SNP leader not to retreat on her referendum bid, and to ""continue fighting"" for another vote on the issue. Ms Sturgeon has previously said that the prospect of an independence referendum was a factor in the election result, which saw her party's share of the vote drop from 50% to 37%. However, the SNP remained by far the largest party in Scotland after winning 35 of the country's 59 seats at Westminster. Anyone waiting to declare that Nicola Sturgeon has been forced to do a U-turn over her plans for a second independence referendum will have been sorely disappointed today. She has been forced to backtrack on the timing. The first minister is no longer insisting that any independence vote takes place before the UK leaves in EU in March 2019. But she has told the BBC that there could still be another referendum before the end of this Scottish Parliamentary term in 2021. In the parliamentary chamber this afternoon she said had listened to voters and reflected on the result. Read more from Sarah Ms Sturgeon said she had repeatedly been told during ""hundreds"" of conversations since the election that people were worried about the uncertainty caused by Brexit, and wanted a break from making big political decisions. The first minister said people also wanted greater clarity about the implications of Brexit to emerge, and that it was ""too soon right now"" to make a decision about a referendum. And she said people wanted the Scottish government to ""focus as hard as we can on securing the best possible outcome for Scotland"".Ms Sturgeon argued that the general election and the ""weakness"" of the UK government had ""reopened the possibility, however narrow, of averting a hard Brexit and maintaining membership of the single market"". She added: ""I want to reassure people that our proposal is not for a referendum now, or before there is sufficient clarity about the options. ""But rather to give them a choice at the end of the Brexit process, when that clarity has emerged. ""I am therefore confirming today that having listened and reflected, the Scottish government will reset the plan I set out on 13 March. ""We will not seek to introduce the legislation for an independence referendum immediately. Instead we will, in good faith, redouble our efforts and put our shoulders to the wheel in seeking to influence the Brexit talks in a way that protects Scotland's interests."" This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said it is still ""likely"" there will be a second referendum during the lifetime of the current Holyrood Parliament Nicola Sturgeon intends to focus upon securing the best possible deal from Brexit for Scotland. She believes, further, that such a mission is made more feasible by a UK Government weakened by the absence of a single party majority. So what has changed, in practice, as opposed to rhetorically? Firstly, Ms Sturgeon will not proceed now with legislation at Holyrood to prepare for a prospective referendum. The Bill will lie dormant. Not abandoned, but resting. Secondly, that means there is now no urgency about her demand for Westminster to transfer the necessary power to hold such a referendum, under Section 30 of the Scotland Act Not, you understand, that the UK Government and the Conservative Party regarded the demand as urgent in the first place. The Scottish Secretary David Mundell has said not now, almost certainly not within the lifetime of the present Holyrood Parliament. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, has come within a whisker of saying ""not ever"" - although, to be clear, she retains the option of indyref2 returning at some point. So, one, the indyref2 Bill is shelved. Two, the Section 30 request is also on ice. But, three, the First Minister intends to return to the topic once Brexit negotiations conclude which she anticipates should be in Autumn 2018. Read more from Brian The Scottish government will also work to build ""maximum support"" across the UK for the proposals it set out at the end of 2016 - which argued for both the UK and Scotland to remain part of the European single market with ""substantial new powers"" for Holyrood. She challenged the other parties at Holyrood to back her calls for Scottish government ministers to be ""at the table"" for Brexit negotiations. And she added that when negotiations with the EU are complete and ""when the terms of Brexit will be clearer"", ministers would come back to the Scottish Parliament to ""set out our judgment on the best way forward at that time"". Ms Sturgeon said this statement, which is likely to happen next autumn, would also set out the Scottish government's view on ""the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country's future"". She said independence ""may well be the only way to protect Scotland from the impact of Brexit"" but insisted the case for independence ""goes far beyond that"". ""We must persuade the majority in Scotland of that. We have not done that yet but I have no doubt that we can,"" she added. Ruth Davidson and Kezia Dugdale accused Ms Sturgeon of not listening to what voters had told her in the election Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon had failed to give people any assurance that she has been listening to them since the election. Arguing that the first minister was ""in denial"" and ""leaking credibility"", the Tory leader added: ""Her response hasn't been to reflect. ""It has been simply to lash out at the UK government at every opportunity and to sing the same old songs in the same old tune. ""She now claims to be putting the referendum to one side. She should just give the country some certainty and take it off the table for the rest of this parliament at least."" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said: ""The truth is the threat of an unwanted second independence referendum is dead and this didn't happen because Nicola Sturgeon wanted it to, the people of Scotland have taken that decision for her. ""The first minister is digging her heels in, putting her fingers in her ears and pressing on regardless. She is just not listening."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon's ""long hard think"" had led her to conclude that she should call another independence referendum at a time of her choosing. He said: ""The people spoke loud and clear at the general election that they did not want another divisive independence referendum. She should listen.""

"Doctors have backed decriminalising abortion, as momentum gathers to overhaul the 1967 Abortion Act. Currently women in England and Wales have to prove to a doctor that carrying on with the pregnancy is detrimental to health or wellbeing to get permission for a termination. Without permission, abortion is a criminal offence. But medics at the British Medical Association's annual conference voted to scrap that rule. The organisation wants abortion to be treated like any other medical procedure and therefore to be regulated and subject to certain standards and will now look to lobby government to change the law. Dr John Chisholm, who chairs the BMA medical ethics committee, said: ""This is clearly a sensitive and complex issue, on which doctors voiced a broad range of views during an informed and considered debate. ""Abortion is currently a crime, with exceptions, throughout the UK. ""Following the debate, the majority of doctors were clear that abortion should be treated as a medical issue rather than a criminal one. ""What must be clear is that decriminalisation does not mean deregulation. ""The debate and the BMA's new policy only relate to whether abortion should or should not be a criminal offence - the policy does not address the broader issue of when and how abortion should be available."" The vote at the doctors' annual conference in Bournemouth does not change the BMA's policy on the 24-week limit for an abortion. The union still backs that. Speaking after the debate, Dr Clare Gerada, former chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, who is also a trustee of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), said: ""Abortion is never an easy thing to do for any woman or for any man. ""But for abortion to be governed by criminal law rather than governed by healthcare regulation is nonsense. ""The BMA doesn't make law, but the BMA is a very powerful voice for doctors and it's a very powerful voice for people of this country."" But Dr Anthony McCarthy, of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said the BMA the move would ""trivialise"" abortion. ""The BMA has betrayed all who take seriously healthcare for pregnant woman in favour of an extremist agenda in line with the abortion industry's laissez faire 'up to birth' attitude to ending the lives of unborn children,"" he said. Meanwhile Dr Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship, commented: ""This decision defies common sense and will dismay thousands of ordinary doctors and nurses with their unprecedented decision."" MPsdebated the decriminalisation,externalof abortion in March 2017. The 1967 Abortion Act permits abortions to be performed under certain conditions in England, Wales and Scotland Most abortions are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy - for example, when two doctors agree that continuing the pregnancy would involve greater risk  to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family than if there was a termination Abortions are usually available free-of-charge on the NHS and can be carried out in only an NHS hospital or a licensed clinic They can be carried out after 24 weeks in certain circumstances - for example, if the mother's life is at risk Abortion is a criminal offence in Northern Ireland. The exceptions include to save a woman's life, or if there is a risk to her health Taking drugs to bring on a miscarriage without doctors' consent is an offence in the UK Source:NHS choices,external Online abortion pill sales 'increasing' From relief to regret: Readers' experiences of abortion BMA At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Google faces having to pay a huge fine for giving its Shopping service such prominence The EU's Competition Commissioner said her team analysed a gigantic 5.2 terabytes of search results before determining that Google had indeed abused its position by running its Shopping service price comparison ads at the top of search results. That's the equivalent of nearly two billion search queries. As news that she had fined its parent company Alphabet a record 2.4bn euros ($2.7bn; Â£2.1bn) spread, it became clear that many thought the case against the tech firm was obvious without needing to dive that deep into the data. But others perceive the penalty to be unfair and even prejudicial against the US, despite the fact several American firms had spoken out against Googlein advance of the ruling,external. For its part, Google says it does not accept the criticism and may appeal. Below is a sample of the early reactions to the news culled from emailed press releases, social media, blogs and elsewhere. ""For over a decade Google has abused and leveraged its monopoly power in search - where it has a 95% market share in Europe... The commission's decision will finally put a stop to that abusive conduct, and it will enable those competitors that have survived despite Google's behaviour, as well as new entrants, to compete on their merits,"" Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to Fairsearch, a group of internet businesses that have lobbied against Google. ""Further legal action will be needed if Google tries to circumvent the commission's verdict. It will be important to have a very strong monitoring trustee and oversight to ensure that the remedy is put into practice,"" Richard Stables, chief executive of the price comparison site Kelkoo. ""Other regulators and companies have been intimidated by Google's overwhelming might, but the commission has taken a strong stand and we hope that this is the first step in remedying Google's shameless abuse of its dominance in search. We strongly believe that the abuse of algorithms by dominant digital platforms should be of concern to every country and company seeking a fair, competitive and creative society,""News Corp via its site,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager explains how consumers have been harmed by Google's Shopping service ""[It's] eurotechnopanic at its worst: anti-American, anti-technology, anti-capitalism... Europe, you can't regulate yourself into competition. You have to invest and innovate,"" Prof Jeff Jarvis, author of What Would Google Do?via Twitter,external. ""The EU has effectively decided that some companies have become too big to innovate. The EU's actions have created a cloud of uncertainty that will make large tech companies overly cautious about making changes to the user experience and service offerings that would benefit consumers... The only real beneficiary of today's ruling is the EU's treasury,"" Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. ""Prioritising a particular shopping search engine is not akin to gouging water users with higher prices because there are alternatives to Google that users can switch to easily. If the overall user experience is made worse by Google Shopping being prioritised, then users will have the option of moving to a search engine like Bing which is perhaps less good at search but better overall because it does not prioritise a bad shopping tool,"" Sam Bowman, executive director,Adam Smith Institute via its website.,external ""Given the depth of Google's pockets, this is by no means a commercial disaster but it has the makings of a brand disaster. Google has always presented itself as 'the good guy' of technology, but if this record fine stands then it would be harder for them to argue that,"" Rupert Bhatia, director of public relations at crisis management agency Rhizome Media. ""Prepare to see more such divided action (geographically based)... but [it's] not simply America v EU. Some huge US companies (Oracle) agree with the EU fine, saying Google hurts competition."" Adrian Weckler, tech editor, The Irish Independentvia Twitter,external. Google faces further penalties if it does not change the way Google Shopping ads are displayed within three months ""It's simply not possible for us to operate a complex economy without certainty... Vital to this is that we all know what the law is ahead of time. It must be possible for us to know that we are acting illegally that is, the law must be known, it must be possible for us to know that we are subject to it. And that's where this decision fails,"" Tim Worstall, Adam Smith Institutevia Forbes,external. ""Alphabet can easily afford [the fine]. The sting may come more from what the ruling means for current and future cases in Europe targeting Google and other large tech firms - most of them hailing from Silicon Valley or thereabouts. Antitrust experts and tech executives say the ruling, in particular, could be precedent-setting in instances where tech giants have become gatekeepers for our digital lives,"" Sam Schechner,Wall Street Journal via its site,external. ""Whereas the antitrust laws in the US and the EU used to be broadly in line with each other, a gradual deregulation in the US has led to the clash of cultures we are seeing here. The vast success of Silicon Valley has been fostered by a deregulated marketplace, but this causes problems when these businesses do business against the very different legal backdrop operating in Europe,"" Susan Hall, head of technology at the law firm Clarke Willmott. ""So, the EU has fined Google for breaking competition law and given it 90 days to stop, but not said what stopping looks like. Anyone find that odd?"" James Titcomb, Technology editor, The Telegraphvia Twitter,external ""They are dominant, but other search engines are available. When I go into Tesco I don't see adverts for Lidl,"" Tony Smithvia Facebook,external.

"It was Theresa May's controversial big idea, to open a wave of new grammar schools in England. It dramatically restarted a row over academic selection at the age of 11 which for almost 20 years had been quietly sidelined. The speech defining her vision of a ""great meritocracy"" was just last September, but those plans have been shredded by the election. So what has changed for England's 163 grammar schools and the many non-selective schools affected by them? On the surface apparently nothing, beneath that almost everything. Or, as one grammar school leader said to me ""politically, grammar schools are now an issue in a way they weren't. The 1997 ban on new selective schools brought a truce. David Cameron respected that truce."" The school of Theresa May's former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, has a special place in this story. King Edward VI Aston School looks like a bastion of tradition, but it's taken a radical step to become more inclusive. Nick Timothy, Theresa May's former close adviser, is a great believer in grammar schools At Aston a quota system has been introduced to set aside 25% of places for pupil premium children who had passed the entrance test. This means their family income will have been low enough at some point in the last six years to entitle them to free school meals. Similar quota systems were widely expected to be part of any plans for new grammar schools, which overall have only 3% of pupils on free school meals. There was even the possibility they might have been applied to existing grammar schools. Grammar school expansion abandoned Grammar schools must be open to 'ordinary families' Did grammar schools help social mobility? Grammar schools: What are they and why are they controversial? Aston is part of a foundation that runs six of Birmingham's grammar schools. Executive director Heath Monk thinks the ditched plans, guided by May's chief of staff, might have been more surprising than many realised. ""Nick Timothy was unique in seeing the expansion of grammar schools, and making them more inclusive, as part of the same agenda."" Grammar schools, quietly tolerated for years, found themselves in the spotlight. Our BBC investigation of admission policiesshowed fewer than half gave priority to poorer children when allocating places. This included some schools with poor neighbourhoods on their doorstep. A new law might have compelled grammar schools to change, but without that what will happen to efforts to make them socially inclusive? David Cameron did not seek to overturn the ban on new grammar schools in England At the King Edward VI grammar schools Mr Monk says they hope to go significantly further than the current 20-25% quotas. The risk of slightly lower exam results down the road is one they can take as the foundation runs most of the grammar schools in Birmingham. About 5% of England's secondary school pupils are educated in a grammar school. The influence of selection is greater, because grammar schools only give places to about a quarter of the children in their areas. The other local schools accept children who don't reach the score needed, don't sit the test or have special needs. ""We'll be back to the bad old days, where people didn't recognise we still had grammars and secondary moderns,"" Ian Widdows tells me. He's the head teacher at Giles Academy in Boston Lincolnshire, which he is proud to call a secondary modern. He set up the National Secondary Moderns Association to gain recognition that they do a good job for the pupils they have. This matters, says Mr Widdows, because the system that judges how schools are performing uses GCSE results as a key measure. ""It's based on a misguided assumption that we have a comprehensive system,"" he says. But there is now a new performance measure, of the progress made by pupils, which should make the system fairer. There are 163 grammar schools in England, but just 213 schools classed as ""non-selective schools in highly selective areas"", which are effectively secondary moderns. Many more do not wish labelled as such, perhaps fearing some kind of stigma. But Ian Widdows believes the true number of secondary moderns is closer to 600. Weald of Kent Grammar School is set to establish an annexe in Sevenoaks There is just one recent example of a new grammar school site opening. In Sevenoaks this September the first pupils will arrive at what is officially an annexe of the Weald of Kent grammar school more than 10 miles away. Threatened legal challenges have been dropped, but the new site will be closely watched by anti-selection campaigners. It will have to prove it is truly operating as part of the existing grammar school. Such is the legal complexity that few believe there will be more grammar annexes of this kind in the near future. That does not mean the number of grammar school places will not go up. None of the Â£50m promised by Theresa May for expansion appears to have been allocated, and it's not clear if its still available. But in counties such as Gloucestershire grammar schools have simply expanded on their existing sites, to the consternation of other secondary head teachers who face losing pupils and money. Theresa May sought to open a wave of new grammar schools in England There's a simple reason why some grammar schools are adding a form of entry, as each pupil brings funding. ""A significant number of grammar schools are looking at a very bleak financial future,"" says Charlotte Martens, vice-chairman of the Grammar School Heads Association. This is partly an accident of geography, as many grammar schools are in lower funded areas. The low number of pupil premium pupils they admit also means less money. As head teacher of Rugby High School, Charlotte Martens has decided to join forces with a nearby non-selective academy to form one organisation running both schools. In the last budget Philip Hammond promised to extend free school transport to up to 15 miles for poorer pupils attending a grammar school. It's a promise she hopes they keep as it would allow her school to extend its catchment for children from low income families to Nuneaton or Hinckley. Philip Hammond promised to extend free school transport for poorer grammar school pupils That would make the school more inclusive and bring in more money. Ms Martens also thinks the debate has shifted significantly after the last year. ""It's opened up some wounds which go back a long way, everybody feels slightly shakier,"" she said. Privately many argue that canny grammar schools will have to keep on changing to survive. Politics is in a more febrile and unpredictable state than for a generation. The truce, now broken, means it's not impossible that calls for the abolition of existing schools could reappear from the left.

"Mark Carney stressed that the UK financial system has strengthened The Bank of England has forced banks to find a further Â£11.4bn in the next 18 months to beef up their finances against the risk of bad loans. Banks will have to set aside Â£5.7bn in the next six months in case future economic shocks mean some borrowers cannot keep up their repayments. A further Â£5.7bn will have to be found by the end of next year. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) suggested lenders had become complacent about their lending. ""Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions,"" the FPC said. The committee has also taken action to stop banks getting around key tests which are designed to stop them lending too much to consumers. Kamal Ahmed: Banks warned on ballooning borrowing The FPC's assessment is that the risks facing the financial system remain at a normal level for now. But there are ""pockets of risk that warrant vigilance"" it said, in the Bank'shalf-yearly Financial Stability Report,external. Lenders, the committee said, are relying too heavily on borrowers keeping up payments as well as they have recently, and banks and other lenders have started lending to people with weaker credit records. The FPC highlighted rapidly growing consumer borrowing via credit cards, personal loans and, notably, car finance. Collectively known as consumer credit, these forms of borrowing have grown by more than 10% in the past year, far outstripping the growth of incomes. While the amount of borrowing for consumer credit is just a seventh of the size of mortgage lending, the amount lenders have to write off because it is not likely to be repaid is ten times greater than for defaulting mortgage borrowers. Some of the fastest growth in borrowing has been in car financing In a news conference, the Bank Governor Mark Carney explained that the Bank was worried about those households who are heavily in debt. But their borrowing, he said, had not in fact increased the threat to the general resilience of banks. ""We are reinforcing some of the protection [for banks],"" he explained, by telling banks to add to their financial cushions. He declined to blame people for borrowing more, and said that most personal borrowing decisions were reasonable. However, he advised: ""Borrowers should consider adverse scenarios as well as positive scenarios."" The Bank is bringing forward by six months a so-called ""stress test"" in respect of consumer credit, whereby lenders have to test their ability to withstand losses on loans that go bad and are not repaid. It is also blocking lenders from getting around affordability tests for lenders designed to stop them over-lending on mortgages. Banks and building societies are currently allowed to lend a maximum of 15% of their mortgages to homebuyers who take especially large loans of more than four and a half times their income. The lenders have to scrutinise the borrowers to ensure they could still afford their repayments if the Bank of England raised its official base rate by three percentage points. But some lenders have been assuming they would not in fact pass on all of that increase in higher standard variable rates, thus allowing them to lend slightly more. Mr Carney said these lenders were not ""gaming the system"" but instead appeared to have forgotten some of the lessons of the recent past. Despite these concerns, Mr Carney stressed that the UK financial system was far stronger than at the time of the great banking crash in 2008-09.

"Many reports suggest that screens around the world are getting this message, indicating a ransomware attack is to blame. Companies across the globe are reporting that they have been struck by a major ransomware cyber-attack. British advertising agency WPP is among those to say its IT systems have been disrupted as a consequence. The virus, the source of which is not yet known, freezes the user's computer and demands an untraceable ransom be paid in the digital Bitcoin currency. Ukrainian firms, including the state power company and Kiev's main airport, were among the first to report issues. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant has also had to monitor radiation levels manually after its Windows-based sensors were shut down. In a statement, the US National Security Council said government agencies were investigating the attack and that the US was ""determined to hold those responsible accountable"". The US Department of Homeland Security advised victims not to pay the ransom, saying there was no guarantee that access to files would be restored. The Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab saidits analysis showed,externalthat there had been about 2,000 attacks - most in Ukraine, Russia and Poland. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? The international police organisation Interpol has said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation and liaising with its member countries. Experts suggest the malware is taking advantage of the same weaknesses used by theWannaCry attacklast month. ""It initially appeared to be a variant of a piece of ransomware that emerged last year,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward. ""The ransomware was called Petya and the updated version Petrwrap. ""However, now that's not so clear."" The malware hall of fame What can you do to protect your business? Kaspersky Lab reported that it believed the malware was a ""new ransomware that has not been seen before"" despite its resemblance to Petya. As a result, the firm hasdubbed it NotPetya,external. Kaspersky added that it had detected suspected attacks in Poland, Italy, Germany, France and the US in addition to the UK, Russia and Ukraine. Andrei Barysevich, a spokesman for security firm Recorded Future, told the BBC such attacks would not stop because cyber-thieves found them too lucrative. ""ASouth Korean hosting firmjust paid $1m to get their data back and that's a huge incentive,"" he said. ""It's the biggest incentive you could offer to a cyber-criminal."" A bitcoin wallet associated with the outbreak has received several payments since the outbreak began. The wallet currently holds just over 3.5 bitcoins (Â£6,775; $8,670). Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk? WannaCry: Your questions answered An email address associated with the blackmail attempt has been blocked by German independent email provider Posteo. It means that the blackmailers have not been able to access the mailbox. Problems have also affected: the aircraft manufacturer Antonov, and two postal services Russia's biggest oil producer, Rosneft Danish shipping company Maersk, including its container shipping, oil, gas and drilling operations. A port in Mumbai is among those that has halted operations a Pennsylvania hospital operator, Heritage Valley Health System, which reportedits computer network was down,external, causing operations to be delayed - but it is not yet clear if it was subject to the same type of attack US food giant Mondelez - whose brands include Oreo and Toblerone. A Cadbury factory in Tasmania, Australia is affected Netherlands-based shipping company TNT, which said some of its systems needed ""remediation"" French construction materials company St Gobain USpharmaceuticals-maker Merck Sharp & Dohme,external The local offices of thelaw firm DLA Piper,external- a sign in the firm's Washington DC officesaid,external: ""Please remove all laptops from docking stations and keep turned off - no exceptions."" The attacks come two months after another global ransomware assault, known as WannaCry, which caused major problems for the UK's National Health Service. Veteran security expert Chris Wysopal from Veracode said the malware seemed to be spreading via some of the same Windows code loopholes exploited by WannaCry. Many firms did not patch those holes because WannaCry was tackled so quickly, he added. The UK's National Crime Agency is investigating the threat Those being caught out were also industrial firms that often struggled to apply software patches quickly. ""These organisations typically have a challenge patching all of their machines because so many systems cannot have down time,"" he said. ""Airports also have this challenge."" Copies of the virus have been submitted to online testing systems that check if security software, particularly anti-virus systems, were able to spot and stop it. ""Only two vendors were able to detect it so many systems are defenceless if they are unpatched and relying on anti-virus,"" he said. Ukraine seems to have been particularly badly hit this time round. Reports suggest that the Kiev metro system has stopped accepting payment cards while several chains of petrol stations have suspended operations. Ukraine's deputy prime minister has tweeted a picture appearing to show government systems have been affected. His caption reads: ""Ta-daaa! Network is down at the Cabinet of Minister's secretariat.""

The first minister had called for an independence referendum to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. But Ms Sturgeon told Holyrood she would now delay her plans to introduce legislation for a referendum. However, she later said it was still ""likely"" a referendum would be held by 2021. Ms Sturgeon has been considering her options since the SNP lost 21 seats in the election earlier this month. She said the Scottish government would delay its proposed referendum legislation until at least the autumn of next year - although it would still need the permission of the UK government for a legally binding vote to be held.

"More than 700,000 patient notes were stored in the warehouse At least 1,700 patients may have been harmed by a 'colossal' blunder that meant thousands of patient records were left to pile up in a warehouse. The number at risk is likely to rise as only two thirds of the 700,000 notes found had been checked, officials said. Cancer test results and child protection notes were among the documents that were missing in England. The National Audit Office also said there were questions to answer,externalabout the handling of the incident. Its review of the issue looked at the role of the government and the company responsible for the mix-up, which is part-owned by the Department of Health. The company, NHS Shared Business Services (SBS), was employed in the East Midlands, South West and north-east London to redirect mail for the health service. It was meant to pass on documents that had either been incorrectly addressed or needed re-routing because the patient had moved to a new GP surgery. But between 2011 and 2016 a backlog of 709,000 pieces of correspondence piled up in a NHS SBS warehouse. The issue came to light in February after theGuardian newspaper,externalreported it. Now the NAO has reviewed what exactly happened and found: The company had become aware of a risk to patients in January 2014, but senior managers had not developed a plan to deal with it or tell the government or NHS England for another two years A label with ""clinical notes"" on it had been removed from the room where the files were stored. A manager had apparently said: ""You don't want to advertise what's in that room"" In August 2015, a member of staff raised concerns the records were being destroyed NHS SBS finally told NHS England and Department of Health of the problem in March 2016, but neither Parliament nor the public were told The episode suggested there had been a conflict of interest between the health secretary's responsibility for the health service as a whole and his department's position as a shareholder in NHS SBS NHS England said the company had been ""obstructive and unhelpful"" when it had tried to investigate issue The report by the NAO found the cost of dealing with the incident was likely to be in the region of at least Â£6.6m. A spokeswoman for NHS SBS acknowledged there had been ""failings"". She added: ""We regret this situation and have co-operated fully with the NAO in its investigation."" Information about child protection was among the notes that were stored A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was committed to being transparent over the handling of the issue and was working to make sure this did not happen again. It said it was given advice not to raise the alarm publicly until it had a better understanding of the problem, concerns about patient safety would always outweigh its role as a shareholder in the company and as yet there had still been no proof of harm to patients. Individual investigations - overseen by NHS England - are taking place into the 1,788 cases of potential harm identified by GPs who have reviewed the missing notes. On top of that over 200,000 records have still to be reviewed by GPs in the first place to determine if there was a potential for harm to have happened. All investigations are expected to be completed by the end of the year. Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said the ""disastrous"" situation should never happen again. ""The handling and transfer of clinical correspondence is a crucial part of how general practice operates, and it's essential that important information reaches GPs as soon as possible so that they can provide the best possible care to their patients."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron described it as ""colossal blunder"". And shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the whole episode was a ""scandal"" that ministers needed to answer for. ""This is a staggering catalogue of mistakes on this government's watch,"" he added.

And the first minister later told journalists she believed it was still ""likely"" there will be a second referendum on independence during the lifetime of the current Scottish Parliament, which is due to last until 2021.

"Holidaymakers face an average delay of 21 minutes One in five flights from the UK to popular holiday destinations are delayed by more than 30 minutes, a BBC analysis has found. Some 38,000 out of 199,000 international flights that ran at least once a day departed late between June and September 2016. Most were from London airports - Luton, Stansted, Gatwick and Heathrow. The BBC analysed Civil Aviation Authority data from 25 airports. The figures do not cover flights that were cancelled. Gatwick had the biggest proportion of flights delayed by 30 minutes or more, with almost a third of all international departures affected. BBC England's data unit found: International flights from UK major airports were delayed by an average of 21 minutes last summer. The longest delay was a chartered flight from Manchester to Dusseldorf, which was delayed by 779 minutes, or almost 13 hours, last September. Gatwick Airport experienced the most flight delays last summer, with 30% - or 107,825 - of all flights from that airport recorded to be delayed by over 30 minutes. Our analysis also found that delays across all airports were more likely to take place in June, compared to the other summer months. Three-quarters of the 40 most delay-prone popular routes out of the UK last summer were to European countries. Popular routes are defined as those that ran at least one flight a day on average. The non-European destinations with high numbers of delays were Ghana, Canada, US, Israel, Ukraine and Pakistan. The most delay-afflicted route was from Heathrow to Accra, Ghana. 85 out of 122 - or 70% - of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer. Radio presenter Steve Power was flying on a British Airways flight from Gatwick to Limoges in France last week that was delayed by almost three hours. He said: ""It's the total lack of information as to why there is a delay. So many social platforms and nothing but estimated time of departure updated. Other passengers were equally in the dark and shared the exasperation over the lack of detailed information. ""Surely in these days of social media platforms a little more transparency would go a long way in raising passenger confidence in the service."" Under EU law, you have the right to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination over three hours late. EU law covers flights departing from or arriving to an EU country. You can claim compensation if the delay was the fault of the airline, such as aircraft problems or flight crew being unavailable, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. However, delays caused by extreme weather, airport or air traffic control employee strikes, airport closures or other extraordinary circumstances are not eligible for compensation. Even if you cannot claim compensation, your airline must provide you with care and assistance. Care and assistance include a reasonable amount of food and drink and accommodation if delayed overnight, as well as transport to and from the accommodation. If you end up paying for any of the above yourself, the CAA recommends keeping every receipt and not spending more than is reasonable. Advice on claiming compensation and a standard letter are available onthe CAA website,external. A spokesman for Gatwick said the airport would continue to do everything possible to prevent delays occurring. ""Repeated strike action on the continent over recent years and heavily congested airspace above parts of Europe and London, have led to a significant increase in the number of delays caused by wider air traffic control issues outside Gatwick's control,"" he added. ""Gatwick has more flights to Europe than any UK airport and is impacted disproportionately by events on the continent."" A spokesperson for Belfast International Airport said: ""We do all we can to minimise delays. ""Our on-time performance is generally very good but sometimes we, too, fall victim to things that are outside our control. ""There is congested airspace in London and across Europe and it is clear there is a need to make improvements in aviation infrastructure.""

"Nearby residents are scrutinising the response in the aftermath of the fire There should be a ""major national investigation"" into the use of cladding on high-rise towers, Theresa May says. It comes as it was revealed cladding from 95 towers in 32 local authority areas in England had failed fire safety tests - all of the samples submitted so far since the Grenfell Tower fire. An expert panel to advise on immediate safety action has been appointed. A public inquiry has already been ordered into the 14 June blaze, which is feared to have left 79 people dead. It has also emerged that London Fire Brigadeissued a warning to all 33 London councilsabout panels attached to the exterior of buildings in May this year, in a letter seen by the BBC. The warning was issued as a result of the fire at the Shepherd's Court tower block in west London last year, as experts believed that insulation panels installed as part of an earlier refurbishment may have helped facilitate the spread of the fire up the side of the building. Meanwhile, campaign group Justice4Grenfell has said it will set up an unofficial database of the victims of the fire amid distrust of the official death toll from police. Who are the victims? Guide to what happened? Six questions for the investigation German flats cleared amid cladding fears Ishmahil Blagrove, a co-ordinator for the group, said: ""There are people who are still missing, people who are undocumented, we are unhappy with the 79 victims who have been recorded by the media and the police. ""We want to do some probing to find out how accurate that figure is and give them something that reflects a fuller picture."" He said that Ramadan meant there were visitors in the tower at the time of the fire and ""dozens"" staying in flats who ""shouldn't have been there"". Earlier, an open letter from residents, part of the campaign, demanded their voices were ""heard and fully included"" in the inquiry into the blaze. The group said bereaved families and survivors should be given funding for legal representation in that probe. People who live at the Hurstway, Testerton, Barandon and Grenfell Walks on the Lancaster West estate said in the letter: ""The investigation must leave no stone unturned. ""It must identify each and every individual and organisation who must bear responsibility and accountability for this tragedy and the mishandling of the aftermath. ""There must be swift recommendations to ensure there can be no chance of a repeat of this disaster elsewhere."" The blaze, believed to have started in a fridge-freezer, destroyed 151 homes in the north Kensington block and in the surrounding area of the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The response to the fire has come under scrutiny. This video can not be played Grenfell locals Layla and Hassin on how they're coping with mental health issues Questions were raised about the cladding used on Grenfell in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and a nation-wide operation has taken place to identify and test buildings with similar cladding. Where have cladding tests failed? Why do England's high-rises keep failing fire tests? Tower fails preliminary tests BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said: ""The various regulations say you can use cladding that is potentially going to burn in a fire as long as the system, the design that you put it in as part of, is safe and that is a separate sort of test. ""The government is doing a test of the materials, so again that is a different approach and I think there is a growing feeling that the goalposts have been moved and councils don't really know what is safe now."" The prime minister's official spokesman said evidence suggested the use of the cladding goes back into at least the last decade. He added that the exact nature of the cladding investigation had not yet been determined, but it could be a second phase of the public inquiry into the Grenfell fire. The expert panel, chaired by former London Fire commissioner and former government chief fire and rescue adviser Sir Ken Knight, will be made up of building and fire safety experts and will meet this week. This video can not be played ""I can't do that to her"": Sabah Abdullah lost his wife in the Grenfell Tower fire Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said all councils should send in samples of cladding from tall buildings and schools and hospitals may do the same if they have concerns. About 31,600 NHS and private hospitals, hospices, care homes and other providers were told by England's health and social care regulator, the Care Quality Commission, on Tuesday to review their fire safety. Fire safety is one of the issues it can take into account when it inspects premises. It then tells local fire authorities about any problems found. Meanwhile, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has said that student accommodation providers should be urged to conduct safety checks. Edinburgh Napier University has saidit is removing cladding from one of its halls of residence, Bainfield Halls, after it found that it featured the same type reportedly used on Grenfell. The firm that supplied Grenfell Tower's claddinghas ended global sales of the productfor use in high-rise blocks. But it was no ""great surprise"" samples had failed fire tests, director of the Centre for Window and Cladding Technology David Metcalfe said. He said it was never ""entirely clear"" under the regulations whether or not the products used in cladding had to be of limited combustibility. What a filler material consists of is not defined, he explained, and regulations do not say ""specifically the cladding should be of limited combustibility"". ""Timber isn't an insulation product, it's not a filler material, so there's nothing stopping you using timber on a high-rise building - but the government now are saying that all cladding should be of limited combustibility - there is a massive inconsistency there."" The government had a new ""strict interpretation"" of the rules, he said. Before the west London blaze, tower block fires in England were at anat least seven-year low, figures show.,external According to newly released Home Office statistics, there were 714 fires in purpose-built blocks of 10 storeys or more in England in the 12 months to April - compared with 1,261 fires in 2009-10.

"Trump isn't shy of sharing views on many countries - but what do they think of him? Donald Trump's presidency has had a ""major impact on how the world sees the United States"", a large new study says. The survey, by the Pew Research Center, interviewed more than 40,000 people in 37 countries this year. It concluded that the US president and his policies ""are broadly unpopular around the globe"". The survey shows only two of the 37 countries have a better opinion of Mr Trump than they had of his predecessor Barack Obama: Israel and Russia. But the report indicates many feel their country's relationship with the US will not change over the coming years. This video can not be played Do Trump voters care if world dislikes him? The key findings from the survey, carried out between 16 February and 8 May, include: People were surveyed at the end of Barack Obama's eight-year presidency, and after the start of Mr Trump's term - they were asked if they had faith that the president would do the right thing for world affairs. This is how some US allies (and Russia) responded: Mr Trump wasted little time in making his mark on world affairs - making clear he expected Nato countriesto pay their fair shareand encouraging Gulf countriesto isolate Qatarin recent weeks. His presidency has shaken up old allies to the extent that German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, after she met Mr Trump, that she felt Europe could no longer ""completely depend"" on its old ally. In fact, it is among the traditional US allies that the confidence has dropped the most, according to the survey - while 86% of Germans had faith in Mr Obama, for example, only 11% do so in Mr Trump. This video can not be played ""We Europeans have to take our destiny in our own hands,"" says Mrs Merkel In his five months in office, the US president has, however, reached out to important friends - visiting Israel, Saudi Arabia and other countries early on. His focus on the relationship with Israel, for one, has paid off - though his preferred status among Israelis is also reflective of Mr Obama's unpopularity there. India, whose prime minister Narendra Modimet Mr Trump on Monday, is one of the countries that looks on the US president most favourably - 40% of respondents had confidence in him compared with 58% for Mr Obama. Read more:The results at the same point in Obama's second term Responders were asked if they viewed Mr Trump in seven particular ways. Here is a sample of answers from three random countries from three continents: ""Across all the characteristics tested, positive and negative, President Trump is most likely to be described as arrogant,"" the Pew report says. In 26 of the 37 countries, more than half of respondents consider Mr Trump dangerous. Having said that, the opinion changes depending on who is answering - those who say they are left-leaning are far more likely to consider him dangerous. In Peru and Brazil, it is those in the centre politically who are more likely to be worried. Across the board, Mr Trump is seen as a strong leader - Latin American and African countries in particular really believe this. The downside for him is that very few countries believe he is qualified to be president. The findings were released only hours after the US Supreme Courtpartially lifted an injunctionagainst President Trump's ban on visitors from six majority-Muslim countries. The ban, which had previously been blocked in lower courts, proved unpopular with 62% of respondents across the 37 countries. A majority of people in only three of the countries - Israel, Hungary and Russia - supported the ban. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' In countries with large Muslim populations, the ban is unsurprisingly unpopular - with Jordan (disapproval rating of 96%), Lebanon (88%) and Senegal (82%) especially unhappy with the ban. Big win for Trump and his travel ban That's not us saying it, it is the opinion of many of the 40,447 people interviewed by Pew and their associates. People may be worried about what Trump means for their country, many may see him as arrogant or dangerous - but that doesn't mean they think his presidency will have any effect on them. This is not true of everyone of course, but a median of 41% of people think their country's relationship with the US will stay the same. While only 15% think ties will improve, some countries are extremely optimistic, especially in Africa - 54% of Nigerians and 51% Ghanaians think things will get better (as do 53% of Russians, who are generally optimistic about the world with Trump in the White House, according to the survey). The country with the bleakest outlook for their ties with the US?Mexico, by some distance. The survey focused on international attitudes, buta recent report,externalfrom Pew found that Mr Trump's approval ratings in his home country have remained low since he took office in January. It suggests just 39% of Americans think he is doing a good job - dropping to just 7% among black voters. However, there is still strong support for Mr Trump among his own party: 81% of those who lean or are Republican say he has been doing well, rising to 88% among those who consider themselves more staunchly conservative.

"This video can not be played Theresa May sets out 'offer' on EU citizens' rights Over a year after the referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, Theresa May hassought to clarify plansregarding the future of EU citizens living in the UK. It is a subject which had attractedmore questions than answers- hundreds were submitted to the BBC. On Monday the government released a 15-page document outlining some of the detail of their plans. BBC Reality Check has pored through the details and returned to your questions with some answers. Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals? Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK Government are committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements. What rights will EU citizens lose under the current proposal? The residents who have ""settled status"" will be treated the same way as UK nationals in terms of benefits, pension, social security and access to public services. But under the UK proposal, ""settled status"" would not give citizens the same family or legal rights they currently enjoy. For example, income tests would be applied for those who want to bring non-EU family members to the UK. And the European Court of Justice would no longer guarantee EU citizens' rights. The EU wants to preserve all these rights and this will be an important subject of the EU-UK Brexit talks. What will happen to the matter of combining pension contributions from different EU countries to build up your pensions? Will this remain? The UK document proposes that it should remain. Brexit: What is UK offering EU citizens? Brexit couples react to deal: Anxiety put to rest or not? Will UK-born children of EU nationals (living here more than 20 years) be able to register as British Citizens rather than naturalizing? If a child is born in the UK after a parent acquires settled status, the child would automatically become British. The lawyer advising us said: ""The following question relating to children of EU nationals and citizenship is difficult to answer as UK nationality law is a very complex area. ""The scenario in the question raises numerous further questions. To be able to advise definitively we would need to know when the child was born in the UK (before or after the parent acquired settled status in the UK) as a child born in the UK after a parent acquires settled status would automatically become British. ""Separate to this, the child may also have become British after 10 years of residence in the UK, which would negate the need for registering as British."" What kind of document will I be provided with to prove I have rights to stay in UK as a citizen? Those with ""settled status"" will be provided with a residence document of some kind. If one already has a document certifying permanent residency would he/she still need to apply for a UK settled status? Yes, he/she will still have to apply for the ""settled status"" but the government says it would make the application process ""as streamlined as possible for those who already hold such documents"". Will the ""settled status"" be lost if you leave the UK for two years (like Permanent Residency)? Yes, it will be lost, unless you have ""strong ties"" in the UK, the UK government paper says. What happens to the EU citizens who have not lived in the UK up to five years? They will also be allowed to stay. Those who arrived less than five years before a cut-off date will be able to apply for settled status once they reach the five-year total, providing that falls within the two-year grace period which will start after the cut-off date. The UK proposed 29 March 2017 as the earliest cut-off date and the day the UK exits the EU as the latest. Those who don't reach the five-year total within the grace period will be able to apply for a temporary residence permit. If you still haven't reached the five-year total after the end of the grace period, your situation will depend on the new rules, which are yet to be decided. Can the UK take over existing EU trade agreements? Brexit court ruling: Your questions answered Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019? Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then. Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over EU citizens rights living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit? The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This will be an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law? Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules, and the UK parliament would decide on the new law. I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit? You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that, but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations. I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change? Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK.

"A suntan is a sign of skin damage, not glowing health, NHS England and the Met Office are reminding parents in Britain just days after a heatwave. A survey suggests a third of parents mistakenly believe going brown is good for children. A quarter have even encouraged their children to tan. A few said they had allowed their children to use sun beds. The findings come from interviews with 1,000 parents with children aged 11 and younger. Hottest June day since summer of 1976 in heatwave How to keep your baby safe in hot weather Second-degree burns from the sun One in 10 said they had told their child to take their top off in the sun ""so they don't get tan lines"". More than one in five (21%) of the parents said they would think about applying sunscreen only if their child started to go red and burn. A tan will not stop the sun's harmful rays from causing harm. It is actually a sign that the skin has been damaged and is trying to protect itself. After our skin has been exposed to sunlight, cells called melanocytes produce more dark pigment, called melanin, in an attempt to absorb further UV radiation, and so the skin becomes darker. Repeated sun exposure can lead to skin cancer in later life. You can't feel UV radiation, so it's very easy to get sunburnt in the UK, even when it's not particularly warm. Children and babies have more sensitive skin than adults. Infants aged under six months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight. From March to October in the UK, children should: cover up with suitable clothing spend time in the shade - particularly from 11:00 to 15:00 wear at least SPF15 sunscreen Clare Nasir, Met Office presenter and meteorologist, said: ""Protecting against skin cancer isn't something parents should leave to chance. ""UV levels are usually highest between May and September. Clouds don't always stop UV rays, and unlike the sun's warmth, it's difficult to know when they may be harming you."" She said parents could check the UV forecast on the Met Office website or app. Dr Nigel Acheson, from NHS England, said although exposure to some sunlight was good for boosting vitamin D levels, people should not overdo it. ""We typically recommend that people spend no more than 10 to 15 minutes in the UK summer sun, unprotected, several times a week,"" he said. ""People who spend more than 15 minutes in the sun on any given day, should apply sun protection factor 15 or higher."" Nicola Smith, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""There's no such thing as a safe tan, from the sun or sunbeds. ""A suntan is your skin's way of trying to protect itself from too much sun. And a sunburn is a clear sign that your skin has been damaged. ""While everyone needs a little bit of sun for vitamin D, most children and adults get enough from a short amount of time outside, less than it takes to burn.""

By Peter Hunt, royal correspondent, BBC News For decades, royals and their use of taxpayers' money have had the potential to be a toxic combination. This latest increase in funding - the Sovereign Grant will have risen from Â£31m to Â£82m over six years - has been made public at a time of continued pay restraint in the public sector and when there is a focus, after the Grenfell Tower fire, on the divide between rich and poor.

"Google Shopping ads appear at the top of many search result pages Google has been fined 2.42bn euros ($2.7bn; Â£2.1bn) by the European Commission after it ruled the company had abused its power by promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results. The amount is the regulator's largest penalty to date against a companyaccused of distorting the market,external. The ruling also orders Google to end its anti-competitive practices within 90 days or face a further penalty. The US firm said it may appeal. However, if it fails to change the way it operates the Shopping service within the three-month deadline, it could be forced to make payments of 5% of its parent company Alphabet's average daily worldwide earnings. Based on the company'smost recent financial report,external, that amounts to about $14m a day. The commission said it was leaving it to Google to determine what alterations should be made to its Shopping service rather than specifying a remedy. ""What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" declared Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's Competition Commissioner. ""It has denied other companies the chance to compete on their merits and to innovate, and most importantly it has denied European consumers the benefits of competition, genuine choice and innovation."" This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager explains how consumers have been harmed by Google's Shopping service Ms Vestager added that the decision could now set a precedent that determines how she handles related complaints about the prominence Google gives to its own maps, flight price results and local business listings within its search tools. Google hadpreviously suggested,externalthat Amazon and eBay have more influence over the public's spending habits and has again said it does not accept the claims made against it. ""When you shop online, you want to find the products you're looking for quickly and easily,"" a spokesman said in response to the ruling. ""And advertisers want to promote those same products. That's why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both. ""We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case."" Google Shopping displays relevant products' images and prices alongside the names of shops they are available from and review scores, if available. Shopping results often push traditional links off screen when viewed on smartphones The details are labelled as being ""sponsored"", reflecting the fact that, unlike normal search results, they only include items that sellers have paid to appear. On smartphones, the facility typically dominates ""above-the-fold"" content, meaning users might not see any traditional links unless they scroll down. Google's giant fine: the net reacts Google ends ad-targeting Gmail scans EU fines Facebook over 'misleading' WhatsApp claim Cookie banner frustration to be tackled by EU Google also benefits from the fact the Shopping service adverts are more visual than its text-based ads. One recent study,externalsuggested Shopping accounts for 74% of all retail-related ads clicked on within Google Search results. However, the BBC understands Google's own data indicates the true figure is smaller. The European Commission has been investigating Google Shopping since late 2010. The probe was spurred on by complaints from Microsoft, among others. The rival tech giant has opted not to comment on the ruling, after the two struck a deal last year to try toavoid such legal battles in the future,external. However, one of the other original complainants - the British price comparison service Foundem - welcomed the announcement. ""Although the record-breaking 2.42bn euro fine is likely to dominate the headlines, the prohibition of Google's immensely harmful search manipulation practices is far more important,"" said its chief executive Shivaun Raff. ""For well over a decade, Google's search engine has played a decisive role in determining what most of us read, use and purchase online. Left unchecked, there are few limits to this gatekeeper power."" This is a big moment in a clash between the EU and the US's tech giants, which has been going on for more than a decade. The commission believes it has struck a blow for consumers and for little firms at a time when online advertising - particularly on mobile phones - is dominated by Google and Facebook. Google believes the regulator has a weak case and has failed to provide evidence that either consumers or rivals have been harmed. In essence, it sees this as a political move rather than one based on competition law. You can be pretty confident that the Trump administration will share that view. There's mounting anxiety in European capitals about something called Gafa - Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon - the four American giants that play such a huge role in all of our lives. That means we can expect further action to try to limit their powers, with the potential for growing political tension between Brussels and Washington. Although the penalty is record-sized, it could have been bigger. The commission has the power to fine Alphabetup to 10% of its annual revenue,external, which was more than $90bn (Â£70.8bn)in its last financial year,external. Alphabet can afford the fine - it currently has more than $172bn of assets. The Shopping service has helped Google make ads appear more attractive But one expert said the company would be more concerned about the impact on its future operations. ""If it has to change the appearance of it results and rankings, that's going to have an impact on how it can monetise search,"" said Chris Green, from the tech consultancy Lewis. ""Right now, the way that Google prioritises some of its retail and commercial services generates quite a lot of ad income. ""When you consider the sheer number of search queries that Google handles on a daily basis, that's a lot of ad inventory going in front of a lot of eyeballs. ""Dent that by even a few percentage points, and there's quite a big financial drop."" At her press conference, Margrethe Vestager insisted her action was ""based on facts"" rather than any prejudice the European Commission might have against US tech companies. ""We have heard allegations of being biased against US companies,"" she said. ""I have been going through the statistics... I can find no facts to support any kind of bias."" But this is far from the first time the European Commission has penalised US tech giants for what it views to be bad behaviour. Others to have been targeted include: Microsoft (2008) - the Windows-developer was fined â¬899m for failing to comply with earlier punishments, imposed over its refusal to share key code with its rivals and the bundling of its Explorer browser with its operating system. Five years later, it was told to pay a further â¬561m for failing to comply with a pledge to provide users a choice screen of browsers Intel (2009) - the chip-maker was ordered to pay â¬1.06bn for skewing the market by offering discounts conditional on computer-makers avoiding products from its rivals. Intel challenged the fine, and a final court ruling in the matter is expected in 2018 Qualcomm (2015) - the chip-maker was accused of illegally paying a customer to use its technology and selling its chipsets below cost to push a rival out of the market. If confirmed, it faces a fine that could top â¬2bn, but the case has yet to be resolved Apple (2016) - Ireland was ruled to have given up to â¬13bn of illegal tax benefits to the iPhone-maker since 1991, and was ordered to recover the funds plus interest from the company. However, Dublin missed the deadline it was given to do so and has said it will appeal Facebook (2017) - the social network agreed to pay a â¬110m fine for saying it could not match user accounts on its main service to those of WhatsApp when it took over the instant messaging platform, and then doing just that two years later The commission is also investigating Amazon over concerns that a tax deal struck with Luxembourg gave it an unfair advantage. The European Commission continues to pursue two separate cases against Google. The first involves allegations that the technology company has made it difficult forothers to have their apps and search engines,externalpreinstalled on Android devices. The second covers claimsGoogle took steps to restrict rivals' ads,externalfrom appearing on third-party websites that had installed a Google-powered  search box.

"This video can not be played Abo Rabeea says he is still suffering from the suspected chemical weapons strike in Khan Sheikhoun The US says Syria's government appears to be preparing for a chemical weapons attack and has warned that it will ""pay a very heavy price"" if one takes place. The White House said similar activities had been seen before the nerve agent Sarin was allegedly dropped on rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun in April. Dozens of people were killed, prompting President Donald Trump to order a missile strike on a Syrian airbase. Syria's government denies it is preparing a chemical attack. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has previously said the Khan Sheikhoun incident was fabricated. On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said activity had been spotted at the Syrian army's Shayrat airfield, from where the US says jets departed before the Khan Sheikhoun incident. ""This involved specific aircraft in a specific hangar, both of which we know to be associated with chemical weapons use,"" Capt Davis said. In astatement,externalon Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US had ""identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children"". He added that if ""Mr Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price"". The White House provided no supporting evidence or further explanation. US media had reported that the state department and Pentagon were caught off-guard by the statement, suggesting they were not consulted in advance, but the White House later said all ""were involved in the process from the beginning"". The US permanent representative to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, also warned Russia and Iran - Mr Assad's allies. ""Any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people,"" shetweeted,external. Syria 'still producing chemical weapons' Syria chemical 'attack': What we know The Associated Press news agencycited,externala non-governmental source with close ties to the White House as saying that the US had received intelligence that Syrian government forces were mixing precursor chemicals for a possible Sarin attack in either the east or south of the country. This video can not be played Trump: ""Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children"" More than 80 people were killed in Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April, according to the local opposition-run health directorate. Video posted following the alleged air strike showed people struggling to breathe and foaming at the mouth - symptoms consistent with nerve agent poisoning. President Assad's close ally, Russia, said an air strike had hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions and released toxic agents into the air - a claim that rebel factions and the Western powers which back them have dismissed. The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) hassaid,externaltests on samples collected from victims indicated that they were exposed to Sarin or a Sarin-like substance. This video can not be played Former US deputy national security adviser James Jeffrey says ""it's high time President Assad learns a lesson"" President Trump cited the pictures of children in distress as one of the reasons he had decided to reverse previous US policy on Syria andlaunch a direct attackon Shayrat airbase days later. Why was Syria's Shayrat airbase bombed? At the time, Capt Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, said Shayrat was used to store chemical weapons, and that US intelligence assessed that aircraft from there had dropped bombs filled with a nerve agent on Khan Sheikhoun. The very public warning to the Syrian government against using chemical weapons is highly unusual. Such a step , which must surely be based upon detailed intelligence, might usually be delivered behind the scenes through diplomatic channels. The use of chemical weapons requires tell-tale preparations such as the movement of particular units, the distribution of weapons to a base from which they can be delivered and so on, all capable of being picked up by US satellites or drones. The warning is clearly intended to forestall such an attack and to make it clear that if the Syrian regime again crosses this line - just as it did last April - the US will respond with force. This time though the context is very different. There is growing friction between the US and pro-Assad forces. A US strike now would risk Washington being drawn further into the conflict. But the warning from the White House is crystal clear. Why is there a war in Syria? Islamic State group: The full story Speaking to AP on Tuesday, Ali Haidar, the Syrian minister for national reconciliation, dismissed the US allegation. Russia, meanwhile, said it considered ""such threats against the Syrian leadership to be unacceptable"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised the White House's use of the term ""another"" chemical weapons attack, pointing out that there had been no independent investigation of the Khan Sheikhoun deaths. President Assad hasdeniedever using chemical weapons and maintains that the country's entire arsenal was destroyed as part of a deal brokered by the US and Russia after a deadly Sarin attack on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in 2013. The latest development comes amid increasing tension between the US and Russia, which recently warned the US-led coalition fighting so-called Islamic State that it would view its aircraft as targets after a Syrian military jet was shot down.

"This video can not be played Fifty years of the cash machine Cash will remain a part of our day-to-day lives for decades, the Bank of England's chief cashier has said on the 50th anniversary of the ATM. Victoria Cleland said that although the use of notes and coins in transactions is falling, cash is part of all the Bank's future plans. She pointed out that 94% of UK adults use cash machines. It was 50 years ago today that the world's first ATM was unveiled at a Barclays branch in Enfield, London. As a tribute to the golden anniversary, Barclays has transformed the modern-day Enfield cash machine into gold. Can a 'bank in a box' replace a branch? Test your knowledge: Try our ATM quiz Free cash machine network under scrutiny Ms Cleland said that more than half of UK adults use an ATM at least once a week. Cash was used in nearly half of all transactions and was also important as a store of value, she added. Barclays Bank unveiled its first cash machine in the UK in 1967 Raheel Ahmed, head of customer experience at Barclays, echoed Ms Cleland's views. ""Even though recent years have seen a huge uptake of digital banking and card payments, cash remains a crucial part of most people's day-to-day lives - whether it is paying for groceries or doing the office coffee run - and we're very proud of the role that Barclays has played in the history of the cash machine."" The first cash machine came about after some hurried signing of contracts, over a pink gin, between Barclays and Scottish inventor John Shepherd-Barron, who died in 2010. ""It struck me there must be a way I could get my own money, anywhere in the world or the UK,"" he told the BBC in 2007. ""I hit upon the idea of a chocolate bar dispenser, but replacing chocolate with cash."" All did not go entirely to plan with the first ATMs. When one was installed in Zurich, Switzerland, there was a mysterious malfunction. Eventually, it was found that wires from two intersecting tramlines nearby were interfering with the mechanism. Developments mean some modern ATMs look like tablet computers There are now about 70,000 cash machines across the UK, and 176 million cards in the UK that can be used to withdraw cash at them. These cards were used to withdraw a total of Â£180bn from UK cash machines last year. The latest developments aim to make the ATM a ""bank branch in a box"". Manufacturer NCR said its research showed that 80% of the transactions typically completed inside a physical branch could be completed through a video teller at an ATM. Portugal has the highest proportion of cash machines in western Europe with 1,516 machines per one million residents. Sweden, typical of a Scandinavian shift towards a cashless society, has the lowest with 333 machines per one million inhabitants.

"DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson sign paperwork as DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds, leader Arlene Foster, PM Theresa May and First Secretary of State Damian Green look on. Theresa May's Â£1bn deal with the Democratic Unionist Party to back her minority government has been branded ""a bung"" and ""shabby"" by opposing parties. The Northern Irish party's 10 MPs will support the Conservatives in key Commons votes in areas such as the Queen's Speech, Budget and Brexit. Labour warned it would undermine trust in the UK government over Northern Ireland. But the Conservatives said they had a duty to form a government. The Conservatives and the DUP have said the deal makes the restoration of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland - which collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Fein about a botched green energy scheme - more likely. May's deal with the DUP Where does this leave power-sharing talks? Where will the money go? Who are the DUP? Negotiations lasted 18 days after the general election on 8 June resulted in a hung parliament. The support of the DUP, added to the Tories' 317 MPs, means Mrs May passes the 326 figure needed for an overall Commons majority under a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement planned to last until 2022. After talks with DUP leader Arlene Foster at Number 10, the prime minister said the two parties ""share many values"" and the agreement was ""a very good one"". Mrs May said it would would ""enable us to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom, give us the certainty we require as we embark on our departure from the European Union, and help us build a stronger and fairer society at home"". Mrs Foster said she was ""delighted"" with a package that includes Â£1bn of new funding, plus more flexibility on almost Â£500m of previously announced funds, on infrastructure, health and education in Northern Ireland. The agreement has prompted calls for more money for Wales and Scotland. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones called the deal a ""straight bung"" and said it ""kills the idea of fair funding"". The Scottish National Party's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said Scotland should get ""its fair share"". ""For years the Tories have been cutting budgets and services, but suddenly they have found a magic money tree to help them stay in power,"" he said. Labour said the deal was ""shabby and reckless"" and would undermine the trust in the impartiality of the UK government which was vital to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: ""For the government to be putting such an agreement in jeopardy just to prop up this dismal prime minister is nothing short of a disgrace."" Sinn Fein said the DUP were effectively supporting continued austerity and cuts, as well as ""a blank cheque for a Tory Brexit which threatens the Good Friday Agreement"". However, First Secretary of State Damian Green said only the Conservatives had ""the ability and legitimacy to lead the government our country needs"". ""As the party with the most seats at the general election, the Conservative Party had a duty to form a government,"" he added. ""It is right that we talked to other parties to seek to ensure that the government can provide the competence the country needs at this crucial time."" Mr Green said the agreement should help to break the deadlock at Stormont which has meant there has been no power-sharing executive since elections in March. The DUP has said that if there is not a devolved government, Westminster would still administer the financial package for Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said any extra money for Northern Ireland was a good thing, and the restoration of power-sharing was the only way to ensure it was fairly distributed. ""We may be able to say well done Arlene, when we have the executive in place,"" he said. The DUP and Sinn Fein have been holding talks at Stormont in attempts to restore power-sharing, with negotiators working into the night on Monday. The leaders of all the main political parties in Northern Ireland are expected to be involved in round-table discussions on Tuesday. A sitting of the assembly has been scheduled for Thursday at noon which could involve the election of a first minister and deputy first minister - but only in the event of a deal. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney has warned that the parties must be close to an agreement by Tuesday night, and both the DUP and Sinn Fein would have to be ""willing to move towards each other's position"". Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing executive since March, and without a first and deputy first minister since January.

"More than 700,000 patient notes were stored in the warehouse At least 1,700 patients may have been harmed by a 'colossal' blunder that meant thousands of patient records were left to pile up in a warehouse. The number at risk is likely to rise as only two thirds of the 700,000 notes found had been checked, officials said. Cancer test results and child protection notes were among the documents that were missing in England. The National Audit Office also said there were questions to answer,externalabout the handling of the incident. Its review of the issue looked at the role of the government and the company responsible for the mix-up, which is part-owned by the Department of Health. The company, NHS Shared Business Services (SBS), was employed in the East Midlands, South West and north-east London to redirect mail for the health service. It was meant to pass on documents that had either been incorrectly addressed or needed re-routing because the patient had moved to a new GP surgery. But between 2011 and 2016 a backlog of 709,000 pieces of correspondence piled up in a NHS SBS warehouse. The issue came to light in February after theGuardian newspaper,externalreported it. Now the NAO has reviewed what exactly happened and found: The company had become aware of a risk to patients in January 2014, but senior managers had not developed a plan to deal with it or tell the government or NHS England for another two years A label with ""clinical notes"" on it had been removed from the room where the files were stored. A manager had apparently said: ""You don't want to advertise what's in that room"" In August 2015, a member of staff raised concerns the records were being destroyed NHS SBS finally told NHS England and Department of Health of the problem in March 2016, but neither Parliament nor the public were told The episode suggested there had been a conflict of interest between the health secretary's responsibility for the health service as a whole and his department's position as a shareholder in NHS SBS NHS England said the company had been ""obstructive and unhelpful"" when it had tried to investigate issue The report by the NAO found the cost of dealing with the incident was likely to be in the region of at least Â£6.6m. A spokeswoman for NHS SBS acknowledged there had been ""failings"". She added: ""We regret this situation and have co-operated fully with the NAO in its investigation."" Information about child protection was among the notes that were stored A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was committed to being transparent over the handling of the issue and was working to make sure this did not happen again. It said it was given advice not to raise the alarm publicly until it had a better understanding of the problem, concerns about patient safety would always outweigh its role as a shareholder in the company and as yet there had still been no proof of harm to patients. Individual investigations - overseen by NHS England - are taking place into the 1,788 cases of potential harm identified by GPs who have reviewed the missing notes. On top of that over 200,000 records have still to be reviewed by GPs in the first place to determine if there was a potential for harm to have happened. All investigations are expected to be completed by the end of the year. Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said the ""disastrous"" situation should never happen again. ""The handling and transfer of clinical correspondence is a crucial part of how general practice operates, and it's essential that important information reaches GPs as soon as possible so that they can provide the best possible care to their patients."" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron described it as ""colossal blunder"". And shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the whole episode was a ""scandal"" that ministers needed to answer for.

"Prime Minister Theresa May and DUP leader Arlene Foster Many of the papers feature pictures of Theresa May and Arlene Foster after the DUP leader reached an agreement to support a minority Conservative government. ""Thanks a billion,""is the i's headline,external, referring to the financial benefits that Northern Ireland will receive in the deal. The Daily Mirror calls their photo,externala ""handshake of shame"" and accuses the prime minster of ""blowing taxpayers money"" with a ""Â£1bn bribe to crackpots"" to keep herself in power.

"Amy Dickman has had a number of narrow escapes during her years working with big cats, but her closest shave came when tackling lion-killing warriors. It was late evening and Amy Dickman was walking through the bush to a household she suspected was celebrating a lion kill. ""It was dark but I suddenly got the feeling I was being watched,"" Dickman recalls. ""I was concerned that a big cat might be lying in wait."" For a brief moment the moon appeared from behind the clouds, illuminating the landscape. ""I realised I was surrounded by young men carrying spears. Then it went dark again. I was terrified,"" she says. This was Dickman's first encounter with warriors from the Barabaig - a community with a history of killing non-Barabaig people and still widely feared. A conservation biologist from Devon, Dickman has been running a big carnivores project in Ruaha, southern Tanzania, since 2009. An estimated 3,000 lions, one in 10 of the world's wild population, live in the remote region - a massive unfenced national park, bounded by tribal lands. Dickman knew she had to make contact with Barabaig warriors to find out whether humans and big cats were coming into conflict, so when she heard sounds of celebration she set off with two volunteers. What they hadn't realised was that the Barabaig were on high alert, due to a power struggle with the Maasai, with accusations of cattle rustling flying between the two sides. After the moonlight revealed the circle of warriors with raised spears, one of Dickman's assistants hastily called out: ""We're just doing research, there's no problem!"" ""Thankfully they realised we were bumbling around like buffoons and weren't a threat,"" Dickman says. ""They agreed to come and talk to us at our camp."" The next day Dickman's team sat down with a delegation of Barabaig warriors to get to know one another. ""I told them I had been scared one night when they had passed our camp chanting and banging spears, as I thought they might attack us,"" Dickman says. ""They laughed and explained it was a ceremony they do after making the first bricks in the year. ""Then they wanted to know what I kept in the Tupperware containers. I showed them it was sugar and they looked abashed. They said they had thought it could be body parts."" The warriors also revealed that lions regularly attacked the livestock in the villages on the edge of the national park.  It was worse in the rainy season when the lion's natural prey travelled away from the river. ""Lions were viewed as vermin,"" Dickman says. Killing a lion provided a warrior with both wealth and status. ""We had found a lot of lion carcasses with the right paw cut off,"" Dickman says. ""It turns out warriors take the central claw to the witchdoctor who agrees a price in cattle that they can collect from nearby households. They can get around 20 cattle for one lion, which is worth $4,000."" Dickman began collecting data on the number of lion kills and was staggered by the results. ""In 2011, 37 lions were killed around just one village we were working in. That was equivalent to half the wild lions trophy-hunted across the whole of Africa in a year."" When Dickman first arrived in southern Tanzania she found there was just a small pop-up tent to sleep in. It had been placed on the trail hippos used to reach water, so she moved it away from the river to avoid being trampled, and assumed she would be safe. ""But on my first night a male lion came sniffing around my tent,"" she says. She grabbed a deodorant and pocket knife in case she had to defend herself, but at that point the lion just lay down on the tent, trapping her arm. ""I was terrified. I thought it was going to eat me. Then I realised it had fallen asleep,"" she says. The tent on the hippo trail Inside the tent, the temperature began to rise. ""I genuinely thought I would die from heat exhaustion as it got so hot,"" Dickman says. She thinks she passed out shortly afterwards and woke the next morning to find the lion had gone. That night she made sure she slept on a raised platform. ""It was my closest shave with a lion but actually most of my close shaves came when interacting with some of the local people,"" she says. Listen to Amy Dickman describe how shetook a leopard to the dentiston Outlook, on the BBC World Service But Dickman's team began to make progress. They reduced attacks on livestock by reinforcing thornbush cattle enclosures with wire and introducing specially bred guard dogs. ""Dogs weren't really valued there at the time. The idea you could train dogs was quite alien to them,"" Dickman says. ""I remember telling our camp dogs to sit in Swahili while talking with some locals and the meeting ground to a halt. They wanted to know where I had got the magic dogs from, dogs that could speak Swahili."" They introduced a handful of Anatolian dogs, which were first bred for guarding livestock in Turkey, but had been used successfully by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in Namibia, where Dickman had worked for six years. That role had also had its hair-raising moments. ""One time we took on a leopard with a broken tooth that had been captured by a farmer. The tooth would have to be replaced if he was to make it back into the wild,"" Dickman says. The team called a local dentist and booked an appointment, leaving out the vital information that the patient would be an anaesthetised leopard. ""He wasn't happy but eventually we persuaded him to take a look, and he got quite enthusiastic,"" Dickman says. The dentist made a false tooth using an amalgam of steel and silver, as it needed to be very strong. Each time they went back for a fitting people would crowd into the dentist's surgery in order to get a glimpse of the big cat. ""On the final fitting the dentist said he had seen the leopard open his eyes, but we didn't believe him. Minutes later the leopard pulled the top half of his body off the table,"" Dickman says. People escaped through doors and windows as the big cat was put under again. ""I'm glad that was the last fitting as I don't think the dentist would have had us back."" In Tanzania, the Anatolian guard dogs proved a success. Dickman's project also offered local warriors the role of Lion Defenders - conservation jobs that came with responsibilities and status. ""We taught Lion Defenders to read and gave them the chance to travel. They can buy their own cattle with their pay."" The wider community is involved in conservation via a camera trap competition. Dickman's team has provided villagers with equipment and training, and points are allotted for the wildlife recorded, based on the size of the animals and how endangered they are. These points can then be exchanged for money towards healthcare, education and vet medicine. ""We are saying, 'If you want extra benefits, the way to get them is to protect the wildlife better,'"" Dickman says. The project seems to be working. Livestock killings have fallen by 60% and lion killings by 80% over a five-year period. They currently work with 10 villages but plan to expand it to all 22 that adjoin the park. But for that they will need more money. ""There isn't a meaningful way to make the project self-sustaining as these communities wouldn't be the ones benefitting from tourism,"" Dickman says. This video can not be played Listen: Dr Amy Dickman tells BBC Outlook how she took a leopard to the dentist ""However, if we consider lions to be part of our global heritage then we need to fund this. We can't expect people on less than $1 a day to pay the price."" Dickman now splits her time between Tanzania, the US, where she raises funds, and the UK, where she has a husband and a two-year-old daughter. ""The hardest part of my job is being away from my daughter Millie, but I know I'm making a difference,"" Dickman says. ""People don't realise how at risk lions are. They have halved in the past 20 years and there are now fewer than 25,000 left. Their fate hangs in the balance."" Dickman says she will never lose her wonder of big cats. ""It's very primal when you see them. Not long ago I was changing a tyre and got the sensation I was being watched. I looked up and a leopard was sitting on the other side of the road looking at me. ""He was quite young and I didn't feel scared, as he just looked curious. We watched each other for a minute before he disappeared in to the bush. Seeing things like that renews your soul.""

"Trust between the UK and EU negotiating teams appears to be in rather short supply When British Prime Minister Theresa May first trailed the Conservative Party's proposals for EU citizens living in the UK at last week's EU summit, the initial response from her fellow leaders was hardly enthusiastic. Now they've seen the details, they haven't changed their tune. There is actually a fair amount of common ground between the two sides, but the details - naturally - matter. The EU's goal on citizens' rights, said its chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, is ""the same level of protection as [is offered] in EU law"". ""More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed than in today's UK position,""Mr Barnier tweeted,external. This is a crucial point for the European negotiating team. However pleased it may be that the UK has finally produced a detailed policy document on one aspect of Brexit, this proposal falls short of what it wants in several respects. The EU'sEssential Principles on Citizens' Rights,externalargued that the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and British citizens elsewhere in the EU, should not change as a result of Brexit. All their rights should be respected. Brexit couples' anxiety put to rest? Watch: May sets out post-Brexit offer Guide: What is UK offering EU citizens? How many are affected by May's offer? The British proposal, on the other hand, entails the loss of some of those rights - the legal protection of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), for example, or the unconditional right to bring family members into the UK from third countries. The cut-off date for eligibility for settled status also needs to be clarified. The UK proposal suggests that the cut-off could be as early as 29 March 2017, the day when Article 50 was triggered. But it is unlikely that the EU would be willing to agree to any date that has already passed. It would mean - in effect - that some citizens would lose some of their rights while the UK was still a member of the EU. Opposition to such an idea would be seen in many EU capitals not just as a point of principle, but as a matter of EU law. It is more likely that British negotiators will eventually agree to settle on their other suggested date - the date on which the UK actually leaves the EU, which is currently due to be 29 March 2019. If the UK shows flexibility on the cut-off date, it will expect equal flexibility on other matters from the EU. But trust between the negotiating teams appears to be in rather short supply. It will need to be established quickly because a similar mood of compromise will be needed to reach agreement on the legal system that will underpin any agreement. The British side insists that the ECJ will have no jurisdiction in the UK after Brexit. The EU insists that the ECJ must continue to offer legal protection for their citizens in the UK, just as it does now. The obvious answer to this conundrum is to create a joint UK-EU arbitration panel that will ensure that the terms of an agreement are respected under international law. But this will require both sides to alter fairly entrenched positions. Well, the UK proposal does contain a few carrots. It accepts that child benefit payments will still be paid for the children of EU workers in the UK whose families live abroad. This was a right that David Cameron tried but failed to abolish. It advocates a ""grace period"" of two years to allow EU citizens to get their status in order. It is an idea that could dovetail conveniently with the need for transitional arrangements, to ensure that the British exit from the EU takes place without sudden shocks. As for British citizens who have retired abroad, the UK proposal offers the reassurance that the government will continue to export and ""uprate"" the UK state pension within the EU. So if, for example, you live in Spain, you will still get annual pension increases - something that is not always guaranteed if you live elsewhere in the world. There is also a promise to simplify bureaucratic procedures for people applying for settled status in the future. But many of them will be furious that they have just spent time and money to obtain permanent residence in the UK, only to find out that they need to start again from scratch. ""How can you promise to give people certainty and then tell tens of thousands that their permanent residence is going to be invalidated?"" says Ian Robinson, a partner at the immigration law firm Fragomen. ""It would have been just as easy to continue to recognise permanent residence already granted but just stop accepting new applications,"" Mr Robinson adds. The UK may argue that its proposal at least tries to offer something to everyone. But so far it doesn't do enough to satisfy the EU. So even if the basis for a deal can be envisaged on this one aspect of Brexit, there is plenty of bridge-building still to be done. When the UK proposal was first trailed, it was described as a generous offer. That was quickly amended to a ""fair and serious"" one. Because the EU doesn't see this as a generous offer, and it has been prepared to say so. It involves millions of EU citizens losing some of the rights they currently enjoy, and for EU leaders that is no cause for celebration.

"This video can not be played Lyn Rigby remembers hearing of the Manchester terror attack, on the fourth anniversary of her son's death The mother of murdered soldier Lee Rigby has said the Ministry of Defence failed to support her family. Lyn Rigby told theVictoria Derbyshire programmeonly her son's next of kin - his partner - received help, and ""the main charities didn't want to know"". She said the recent attacks in London and Manchester had ""brought everything back"", but she had received no contact from the MoD to ""check we're OK"". The MoD said it does its ""utmost"" to help families who have lost loved ones. Lee Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London in May 2013, when Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale drove into the 25-year-old before hacking him to death. Adebolajo later claimed he was a ""soldier of Allah"". Both were found guilty of murder. Ms Rigby told the BBC: ""The support we had, was from people we'd never met - the public. ""The Ministry of Defence... barely support people who aren't listed as next of kin. The main charities didn't want to know. ""We had an Army liaison officer for three months after Lee died, but after the funeral we've had no support from them since. ""Some families are 10 years on and they still haven't had support,"" she added. ""When Lee lost comrades in Afghanistan, he'd seen mums left by the wayside."" Lee Rigby died in May 2013 The recent terror attack in Manchester, in which 22 people were killed, took place on the fourth anniversary of Fusilier Rigby's death. Ms Rigby - who lives in Manchester - said she was with family, remembering and celebrating her son's life, when she heard about the bombing. ""I just fell on to the settee, I was so heartbroken. ""There are so many parents who are left now without their children, having to go through what we've been through. ""All I can do is send our sincere condolences."" She said one of her daughters had now sought counselling again, after the events brought back memories of Fusilier Rigby's murder. Ms Rigby added she has had ""no contact from the Army or anyone - the MoD - after the Manchester bombing"". ""Not a call to check we're OK or anything like that."" She said the London Bridge terror attack in June - in which three men hit pedestrians with a van before carrying out knife attacks - was ""like Lee's murder all over again"". ""I didn't want to leave the house. I wanted to curl up in a corner and not leave."" She added: ""I do get angry, but you can't give in to these people. You can't let them win."" Veterans are helping Ms Rigby to renovate Lee Rigby House Ms Rigby has nowset up a retreat, Lee Rigby House,where the families of fallen soldiers can go for support - and to grieve in peace away from the media. ""Lee would have wanted us to do this, for the families and the siblings,"" she said. ""We've got a long list of families who want to stay at the house."" Ms Rigby hopes the house - which will have space for two families to stay at a time - will open in early September, and wants it to become ""a lasting legacy for Lee"". There are also plans to open another house for veterans. Families staying at the house will also have access to large grounds nearby She added: ""People think you're strong on the outside when you're dying on the inside. ""We miss him so much every single day. ""The kids are saying, 'You're not the same person that you were before Lee died'. That's heartbreaking."" An MoD spokesman said: ""We do our utmost to support Armed Forces families that have lost loved ones, providing trained visiting officers who offer guidance on accessing help, as well as a range of support from individual regiments, including financial aid.

"In July 1997, more than 150 years of British rule came to an end in Hong Kong with its handover to China, a historic event viewed with a mixture of uncertainty and hope. We asked observers how their predictions turned out 20 years on. Back then, cosmopolitan and prosperous Hong Kong was seen as China's vital gateway to the outside world - and many believed it would stay that way for years to come. Fast forward 20 years, and it is no longer the only jewel in China's crown, with cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou becoming financial or manufacturing powerhouses. ""Hong Kong was the golden goose in China,"" said politician Martin Lee. ""I couldn't have thought that China's economy would develop so quicklyâ¦ and Hong Kong's bargaining power would diminish so fast."" Many also did not envision Hong Kong ending up as ""a paradise for money laundering and capital outflow"" for the mainland, said financial analyst Agnes Wu. In recent years Chinese tycoons have sought to park their assets, businesses and even themselves within the city amid a corruption crackdown in Beijing - something which the Chinese government has frowned upon. Many wondered in 1997 how the reunion of a freewheeling, liberal city with its tightly-controlled mainland would pan out, particularly a few years after the Tiananmen Massacre which saw the brutal crushing of pro-democracy protests. One hope was that Hong Kong could eventually ""infect China with democracy"", said Keith Richburg, a former correspondent with The Washington Post. With China's rapid pace of economic development, many believed it would open up politically as well, and ""if Hong Kong could just hold on for 20 years, there would be a convergence"". Some believe the opposite has happened. Last month, Hong Kong's last British governorChris Patten said,externalthere had been ""a steady tightening of grip on Hong Kong's windpipe"" and its autonomy. China has promised to preserve the city's rights and autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. But there are fears it is not keeping that promise, followingthe disappearance of Hong Kong booksellers and a Chinese tycoonand Beijing'sintervention in the selection of Hong Kong lawmakers. China now sees Hong Kong ""as a threat... a base of subversion, a place to be controlled,"" said Mr Richburg, particularly after a series of large-scale protests culminating in the2014 pro-democracy demonstrations. China has also become emboldened by ""the fact it's become clear that outside powers, including Britain, are not going to make any trouble... it's got a pretty free hand,"" said Jonathan Fenby, a former editor of the South China Morning Post newspaper. Hong Kong: Twenty years on Young in Hong Kong Have Hong Kong's youth lost hope in the future? Growing up in post-handover Hong Kong But others disagree. Hong Kong's chief executive-elect Carrie Lamrecently told the BBCthat ""one country, two systems"" is as ""robust as ever"", and rule of law is ""better than pre-1997"". Ms Lam, a former civil servant, is herself an example of Beijing keeping its promises, according to politician Regina Ip. ""Without the reunification, a lot of us local administrative officers (like Ms Lam) would not have risen to the top.... To this extent, 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' has been fulfilled,"" said Ms Ip. She believes the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland needs more time to evolve. ""'One country, two systems' is proving to be more complex and more challenging than originally expected,"" she said, but she hopes outstanding issues ""will be resolved in the coming years, sooner rather than later."" With the handover, ""many of us thought it would be only natural that young children were going to learn the (Chinese) national anthem, and learn to respect and love China in their classes,"" said anthropologist Gordon Mathews. Beijing had thought Hong Kong would embrace this return to the Chinese motherland after decades of foreign rule, said observers. Instead, Hong Kongers ended up developing a strong sense of local identity, one that is often defined by anti-mainland sentiment. Hong Kong journalist Ching Cheong recalled that in 1997 one worry was of ""mainlandisation"" where Hong Kong's values would be eroded, turning it into ""just another Chinese city"". ""But something that I didn't predict took place instead - the appearance of localism, or separatism,"" he said, referring to thepolitical movementwhere some advocate independence from the mainland. Local identity has only been strengthened with perceived attempts by Beijing to exert influence. Singer Anthony Wong says ""many people started caring about their own rights"" following attempts to introduce mainland-styled anti-subversion laws and national education in Hong Kong, which sparked large-scale protests and a ""political awakening"". But others like Hong Kong business magnate Allan Zeman believe that assimilation is inevitable. ""In the next 20 years, things are going to change... we have the bridge between Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai, we have the high-speed rail. These infrastructures will change Hong Kong and eventually the borders will become seamless."" ""Hong Kong will integrate more in China, whether we like it or not.""

"Simon Coveney said the DUP and Sinn Fein would have to be prepared to compromise The Irish foreign minister has warned that the Northern Ireland parties must be close to an agreement by Tuesday night in their talks to restore power-sharing. The parties were holding further talks at Stormont on Monday evening. They have until Thursday to reach an agreement. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that time was running out and both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in would have to be prepared to compromise. The leaders of all the main political parties in Northern Ireland are expected to be involved in round-table discussions on Tuesday. A sitting of the assembly has been scheduled for Thursday at noon which could involve the election of a first and deputy first minister - but only in the event of a deal. Tory-DUP deal's impact on power-sharing Q&A: What you need to know Where will the money go? Earlier on Monday, it was announced that adeal between the Conservatives and the DUPincludes an extra Â£1bn in public spending for Northern Ireland. ""There are some big political issues to be addressed this evening,"" Mr Coveney said. ""If we're going to get that done, both parties [the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in] need to be willing to move towards each other's position to try and accommodate each other. ""If that happens and we make significant progress on the issues that are separating the two large parties, then I think we can have a very constructive day tomorrow to try and include the SDLP, Alliance and the UUP, who have real issues also that need to be part of an agreement if we're going to have an executive that involves all five parties."" Mr Coveney added: ""We're going to need to be close to a final agreement by late tomorrow evening, if not we start to run out of time, because parties will have to go back to check with their support bases or their executives or whatever support processes they need to be able to sign up to a full deal. ""We'll have a much clearer picture by this time tomorrow as to where we're at."" Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing executive since March DUP leader Arlene Foster returned to Belfast from London earlier on Monday. She said she was ""delighted"" with the agreement reached to prop up Theresa May's minority government. Addressing the talks to restore devolution, the DUP's Nigel Dodds said: ""We want to see the executive up and running, we haven't set any red lines, no pre-conditions, lets get an executive up and running. ""Let's get on with the job, if Sinn FÃ©in continue to mess about, I think they will pay a heavy price."" However, Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd said: ""All outstanding issues are yet to be resolved; until we agree everything, nothing is agreed. ""There's a lot of talking yet to be done in terms of Stormont Castle if we are going to reach an agreement by Thursday."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was time to ""stop playing games"" and form an ""inclusive executive"" to make sure the Â£1bn was ""spent properly for all our benefit"". He said it would be ""very dangerous"" if the money was spent by a Tory party ""under the thumb of the DUP"". Robin Swann, Ulster Unionist Party leader, said NHS waiting lists were spiralling out of control and schools did not know whether they had a budget for next year because of financial uncertainty. He said the ball was in Sinn FÃ©in's court now the terms and conditions of the DUP-Conservativepact were known. The Alliance Party's Stephen Farry said Monday evening and Tuesday would be the ""critical phase"" of the talks. Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing executive since March and without a first and deputy first minister since January. The institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in about a botched green energy scheme. The late deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness,stood down, in a move that triggered a snap election.

"This video can not be played Abo Rabeea says he is still suffering from the suspected chemical weapons strike in Khan Sheikhoun The US says Syria's government appears to be preparing for a chemical weapons attack and has warned that it will ""pay a very heavy price"" if one takes place. The White House said similar activities had been seen before the nerve agent Sarin was allegedly dropped on rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun in April. Dozens of people were killed, prompting President Donald Trump to order a missile strike on a Syrian airbase. Syria's government denies it is preparing a chemical attack. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has previously said the Khan Sheikhoun incident was fabricated. On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said activity had been spotted at the Syrian army's Shayrat airfield, from where the US says jets departed before the Khan Sheikhoun incident. ""This involved specific aircraft in a specific hangar, both of which we know to be associated with chemical weapons use,"" Capt Davis said. In astatement,externalon Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US had ""identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children"". He added that if ""Mr Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price"". The White House provided no supporting evidence or further explanation. US media had reported that the state department and Pentagon were caught off-guard by the statement, suggesting they were not consulted in advance, but the White House later said all ""were involved in the process from the beginning"". The US permanent representative to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, also warned Russia and Iran - Mr Assad's allies. ""Any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people,"" shetweeted,external. Syria 'still producing chemical weapons' Syria chemical 'attack': What we know The Associated Press news agencycited,externala non-governmental source with close ties to the White House as saying that the US had received intelligence that Syrian government forces were mixing precursor chemicals for a possible Sarin attack in either the east or south of the country. This video can not be played Trump: ""Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children"" More than 80 people were killed in Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April, according to the local opposition-run health directorate. Video posted following the alleged air strike showed people struggling to breathe and foaming at the mouth - symptoms consistent with nerve agent poisoning. President Assad's close ally, Russia, said an air strike had hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions and released toxic agents into the air - a claim that rebel factions and the Western powers which back them have dismissed. The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) hassaid,externaltests on samples collected from victims indicated that they were exposed to Sarin or a Sarin-like substance. This video can not be played Former US deputy national security adviser James Jeffrey says ""it's high time President Assad learns a lesson"" President Trump cited the pictures of children in distress as one of the reasons he had decided to reverse previous US policy on Syria andlaunch a direct attackon Shayrat airbase days later. Why was Syria's Shayrat airbase bombed? At the time, Capt Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, said Shayrat was used to store chemical weapons, and that US intelligence assessed that aircraft from there had dropped bombs filled with a nerve agent on Khan Sheikhoun. The very public warning to the Syrian government against using chemical weapons is highly unusual. Such a step , which must surely be based upon detailed intelligence, might usually be delivered behind the scenes through diplomatic channels. The use of chemical weapons requires tell-tale preparations such as the movement of particular units, the distribution of weapons to a base from which they can be delivered and so on, all capable of being picked up by US satellites or drones. The warning is clearly intended to forestall such an attack and to make it clear that if the Syrian regime again crosses this line - just as it did last April - the US will respond with force. This time though the context is very different. There is growing friction between the US and pro-Assad forces. A US strike now would risk Washington being drawn further into the conflict.
