"The most commonly used drug among students is cannabis About two in five students are drug users, says a study from the National Union of Students. But the students' union argues that students should not be disciplined for ""drug-related behaviour that does not constitute a criminal offence"". The most widely used drugs, in a survey of 2,800 students, were cannabis, ecstasy, nitrous oxide and cocaine. A formal warning was the most common disciplinary action taken by universities over drug use. The NUS report found drug use to be ""a common, although infrequent, behaviour"" - with 39% of students using drugs, and cannabis by far the most widely used. A further 17% had used drugs before, meaning 56% in total had at some time tried them. As well as recreational use, there was also a small number of users of ""study drugs"", intended to keep people concentrating during the exam season. The report, produced in collaboration with Release, a charity with expertise on drugs and drugs law, argues against a ""punitive"" approach from university authorities. Sir Anthony Seldon says universities must take more responsibility for giving drug advice Instead of calling the police or imposing punishments for drug-related incidents, the report says students should be given advice and health education. ""Policy responses that focus solely on disciplining students fail to recognise the complex reasons that lead people to use drugs,"" says the NUS report. It says there were more than 2,000 incidents last year of ""student misconduct for possession of drugs"", recorded by universities. The disciplinary measures were most commonly a formal warning, which could be escalated to a temporary or permanent exclusion. About a quarter of incidents were reported to police. There have been rising concerns about mental health problems and student well-being - and this report describes students as often seeing drug use in the context of stress and mental health. About a third of drug users claimed that they were using drugs to reduce stress - while another third claimed that their mental health was worsened by using drugs. The report says that for some university authorities, drug use is seen ""wholly as a problem to be eradicated through suspensions, evictions and surveillance"". ""We believe that these punitive measures rarely help,"" says the report. ""Instead, they make our educational institutions complicit in practices that prevent marginalised and potentially vulnerable students from seeking help and support."" Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said universities needed to take much greater responsibility for making students aware of the risks of drug use. ""It needs to be made far less socially acceptable. They are profoundly damaging on the minds of the young, especially those with a propensity for mental health problems,"" he said. ""Drugs wreck people's minds."" He called for tougher action against ""pushers who are making money out of the misery of others"". And he called for more education over drugs, in the manner of health campaigns against tobacco, so that students could ""make up their own minds"". Professor Steve West, chairman of Universities UK's mental health working group, said: ""Universities cannot address drug misuse alone and, working with the NUS, we need to establish closer working partnerships with schools, employers, the NHS and other statutory services to co-ordinate care for students.""

"This video can not be played Oliver Wood, 15, is one of thousands of children being taught outside of a school The number of children being homeschooled has risen by about 40% over three years, the BBC has found. Across the UK 48,000 children were being home-educated in 2016-17, up from about 34,000 in 2014-15. Mental health issues and avoiding exclusion are two reasons parents gave for removing children from classrooms. The government will publish new guidance on the ""rights and responsibilities on home education"" but councils want more monitoring powers. They are concerned about the quality of the education homeschooled children receive as well as ""safeguarding"" issues, such as the ability to properly protect children from abuse or maltreatment. Dr Carrie Herbert, the founder of a charity for children outside mainstream education, said the rise in homeschooling suggested ""something quite tragic about the state of the education system"". She said she was concerned some parents might also feelpressured into home-schooling their childrento avoid exclusion or prosecution over poor attendance. ""I'm not sure it's very useful anymore to put 30 children in one classroom with an adult all doing the same thing in the same way at the same time,"" said Dr Herbert, of The Red Balloon charity. ""We should really be thinking more 21st century and outside the box about this and teaching online in real time can help do this."" Oliver Wood is taught at home in Thetford by Laura Saggers Oliver Wood, from Thetford in Norfolk, was severely bullied at his former school before becoming a pupil of Red Balloon. The 15-year-old has autism and suffers from anxiety. ""Every school we were offered was looking at him like a problem to solve, rather than a person they could work with,"" said his mother, Sophie. Oliver hopes to take four GCSEs next June. Red Balloon has anonline school,externalthat follows a ""normal"" school day as much as possible. Its curriculum is tailored to suit the child's interests, with the aim of getting them back into the habit of learning, socialising with others and for some, returning to school. The charity has 93 pupils and has had to close its books until it can afford to hire more teachers. The BBC contacted councils in England, Wales and Scotland and the Northern Ireland Department of Education for figures on homeschooling. Of the 177 authorities that were able to provide data for all three years, 164 reported an increase. Only 11 with figures for all three years had fewer homeschooled children in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. While they make up just 0.5% of the school age population for England and Wales, the large rise has prompted calls from councils and education bodies for more statutory monitoring powers of homeschooled children. Companies pledge to cut plastic pollution Drugs used by two in five students Home Office had migrant removal targets There is no legal obligation for children to attend school but the law says they must receive an education. They can be taught by parents or private tutors and the guidance from both the English and Welsh education departments is that it must be a ""suitable education"". The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) in England wants parents and carers who home-educate to be obliged to register with their local authority and for inspectors to be able to take action if they find a problem. Councils should have resources to ensure homeschooled children receive ""a good standard of education, delivered in a suitable learning environment and that they are safe,"" theADCS said in a report,externalin December 2017. Safety of pupils was also raised in astudy by Norfolk County Council,external. Its children's services reported an ""unprecedented year-on-year rise"" in home-schooling with 1,309 (1.1%) of its school-aged pupils being home taught during the 2016-17 academic year. ""Given that children by the nature of being home-educated can be essentially 'invisible', an inability to make timely and appropriate contact with these families has an inherent risk attached,"" they said. The Isle of Wight has the highest proportion of home-educated pupils, almost one in 50. Criticisms by Ofsted over the island'shigh proportion of ""inadequate"" schoolsmay have had an impact, the council said, adding it was tackling ""lower educational standards"". A spokeswoman said it had a ""good relationship"" with many families contacting it ""directly when they are thinking of home-educating"" as another possible explanation for the figures. In Wales just over 1,800 out of about 430,000 children, about 0.4%, were homeschooled in 2016-17. In Scotland, just 0.1% of children are home-educated, 969 in total. The department of education in Northern Ireland saw just 293 pupils being home educated out of a possible 343,082, representing less than 0.1% of the school-aged population in 2017. Why are parents choosing to educate children at home? Many authorities could not provide reasons why more parents appeared to be choosing homeschooling. Of those that did, the reasons included: Devon: Most parents who offered a reason for homeschooling blamed ""dissatisfaction with the school environment"" East Sussex: Lack of school choice, unmet special educational needs and the ""rigour and limits"" of the current school curriculum Gateshead: Parents felt some pressure from school to remove their children especially if the young person had poor attendance Cambridgeshire: The council said it had increased support for the home-educated community, including extending ""borrowing rights"" at libraries Darlington: Local authority staff are ""currently working with the police and health to ensure the safeguarding of home educated children and this may have contributed to the rise in numbers identified"" In December Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, found overseeing the growing number of home-educated children was ""becoming a challenge for local authorities."" The education watchdog also observed the numbers of children with special educational needs or disabilities guided towards home-education ""was typically high"". Ms Spielman said it was ""unacceptable"" that parents reported being asked to keep their children at home because school leaders said they could not meet their children's needs. Abill,externalseeking more powers for local authorities to assess children receiving home education has gone through a second reading in the House of Lords. Speaking in parliament,external, education minister Lord Agnew said many parents home-educate for ""positive reasons"" and it should be allowed to continue ""with a minimum of fuss and bureaucracy"". ""There is a need to ensure that, where there is genuine cause for concern about a child, local authorities are clear about the powers open to them,"" he said. The Department for Education (DfE), which covers England, and the Welsh government will both consult on ways to improve home-education guidance for parents and councils. A spokesman for the DfE said this would ensure local authorities ""are clear on the action âthey can take where these responsibilities are not being metâ"". A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""We recognise that we are currently unable to provide reliable figures on how many children are educated at home and that is one of the reasons why we will be consulting on a database as well as statutory guidance for elective home education.""

"Alfie Evans was taken off life support on Monday evening Bosses at the hospital treating seriously ill Alfie Evans have defended staff, as judges rejected a further legal bid to take the toddler abroad. Protesters have been gathered outside Alder Hey in Liverpool amid a court battle over the 23-month-old's care. Over the past fortnight, hospital chair Sir David Henshaw said, staff had endured a ""barrage"" of abuse. Earlier, the Court of Appeal upheld a ruling preventing him from travelling abroad after life support was stopped. His parents Tom Evans and Kate James had mounted a last-ditch attempt to allow Alfie to be transported to Rome for treatment. Lord Justice McFarlane, who led the appeal court panel, said Alfie's parents were trying to take ""one last chance"". But, he said, there was no prospect of the couple's challenge succeeding. In an open letter, Sir David and chief executive Louise Shepherd said staff had been ""deeply affected"" by Alfie's ""desperate"" story. ""We share the heartbreak that occurs when a child cannot be cured and when a child dies,"" they wrote. Who is Alfie Evans and what is the row over his treatment? When are parents denied the final say? World's reaction to Alfie Evans case ""All of us feel deeply for Alfie and his whole family and we continue to do everything we can to support them as best we can, just as we have for the last 17 months"". But, they said, staff had recently been the subject of ""unprecedented personal abuse that has been hard to bear"". The hospital has seen several protests in recent weeks, and police have investigated claims patients and staff were intimidated. Sir David and Ms Shepherd said the previous fortnight had been ""a very difficult time."" ""As an organisation, we have endured attacks upon our motivation, our professionalism and our ethics,"" they said. This video can not be played BBC News went to meet the people calling themselves 'Alfie's Army' They described the requirement for a ""significant police presence"" at the hospital as ""completely unacceptable"". Staff had also received ""a barrage of highly abusive and threatening language and behaviour that has shocked us all"", they said. ""Worse still, patients and visitors to Alder Hey have also reported abuse."" Sir David and Ms Shepherd thanked Merseyside Police for its ""unstinting support"" and said the hospital's first priority remained ""Alfie's comfort, dignity and privacy"". Earlier, Ch Insp Chris Gibson warned social media users the force would act upon reports of malicious communications and threatening behaviour where necessary. Tom Evans and Kate James wanted to move the 23-month-old from Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital to Rome. Lawyers for the couple had urged judges to reconsider the case when Alfie kept breathing despite his life support being removed on Monday. But the Court of Appeal upheld Mr Justice Hayden's earlier High Court ruling. At the hearing in London, three senior judges rejected all of the appeal grounds raised by his parents. Tom Evans and Kate James had hoped Alfie could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome Lawyers for Ms James told the court Alfie was ""struggling"" and in need of ""immediate intervention"". Mr Evans' barrister Paul Diamond said if the court had ruled in the family's favour then Alfie would be taken to Italy straight after the hearing. The couple want to take their son to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Hospital. Mr Diamond told the court a military air ambulance was on standby ""at the request of the Pope"". On Monday, the Italian government granted Alfie citizenship in the hope he would be given an ""immediate transfer"". But hours later, his ventilator was switched off and the order preventing him from travelling abroad was put in place. Alfie, who has a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition, has been in Alder Hey since December 2016.

"The NHS needs Â£50bn more by 2030 in England, a former health minister and leading surgeon says. The prediction, by Labour's Lord Darzi, comes after Prime Minister Theresa May said the government planned to devise a long-term funding plan for the health service. There is speculation this will be unveiled during the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS in July. Lord Darzi's report has been supported by both Tory and Lib Dem politicians. NHS at 70: Share your memories and stories NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff May backs long-term funding plan for NHS Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff It said the extra funding was in line with what the NHS had traditionally received - just under 4% extra a year. The analysis said this was needed to help cope with the ageing population, advances in technology and inflation. It also noted that the NHS was struggling to hit key targets, such as the four-hour mark for accident and emergency treatment. The report said it would mean the NHS budget would grow to Â£173bn by 2030 to get back on track - and this would require significant improvements in productivity. If this increase in efficiency was not achieved, the bill would top Â£200bn. And it recommended another Â£10bn for social care was needed. All the extra funds should come from taxation, the report said, not social or private insurance.

It comes 10 years after Lord Darzi produced an influential report for the then Labour government. The latest review also involved Lord Prior, a former Conservative Health Minister, and Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb. Lord Darzi, who is a world-renowned surgeon, said the extra money was needed as it was getting ""harder and harder"" to access care. ""While the prospect of a long-term funding settlement is welcome, it is vital that it delivers enough money to meet the demands of the decade ahead,"" he added. The politicians were supported by the Institute for Public Policy Research in carrying out the analysis.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd told MPs she ""bitterly"" regretted not recognising the ""systemic"" problem sooner The Home Office and Downing Street were told in 2016 about problems faced by the Windrush generation, the BBC understands. They were alerted after the Barbados government raised concerns with the Foreign Office, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Labour has urged Home Secretary Amber Rudd to quit over the Windrush saga. Ms Rudd told MPs she ""bitterly"" regretted not recognising the ""systemic"" problem sooner. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged relatives of migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants if they could not provide a range of documentation proving they had lived in the UK continuously. Some have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment. Their plight has provoked a storm of criticism for the government, with Prime Minister Theresa May apologising for their treatment. Who are the Windrush generation? Rethink 'cruel' migration policy - Corbyn Windrush cancer patient gets treatment date 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories In April 2016, the then Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond - who is now the chancellor - was told by Caribbean ministers about immigrants facing deportation despite having lived in the UK for most of their lives, and the BBC understands a report about their concerns was passed to the Home Office, which was led at the time by Mrs May. It is not clear at what level the concerns were raised. The government has set up a task force to help those affected formalise their status. So far 3,800 calls have been made to the helpline, of which 1,364 were potentially Windrush cases, MPs were told on Wednesday. This video can not be played Who are the Windrush generation? Ms Rudd told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that she had known about the problem for months and said officials were still checking how many people had been detained over their supposed immigration status. ""I look back with hindsight and I'm surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner,"" she said. ""I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn't see it as more than individual cases that had gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn't see it as a systemic issue until very recently."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg As the Windrush scandal has unfolded it has been said again and again that the Home Office was not aware of the problem as a pattern where one particular group was being scooped up into the immigration system unfairly, on multiple occasions. Yes, individual cases reared their heads, we know they were raised as far back as 2011. But Amber Rudd repeated to MPs again today she wasn't aware of the issue as being ""systemic"", even though she ""bitterly regrets"" not spotting the pattern. Ministers' defence has been: we simply didn't realise, but we know now it was a big mistake. That defence looks a bit shakier tonight. It's not just that some of the government's own work on immigration policy warned in advance of the rules changing that it could hypothetically hit the wrong people. Read more from Laura The Home Office is investigating whether anyone has been wrongly deported. Ms Rudd told the committee that so far 7,000 out of about 8,000 records dating back to 2002 had been checked with no wrongful removals discovered so far. And she rejected suggestions that the Conservatives' goal of reducing net migration below 100,000 had contributed to the problem. ""It's wrong to think the net migration target is the problem here,"" she said. ""The problem here is that people were not properly documented."" Call for Army veteran to get UK passport Advice for the Windrush generation on what to do next Earlier the issue dominated Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urging Mrs May to abandon the government's ""cruel"" immigration policy and abandon ""bogus"" targets. Mrs May rejected claims she was ""ignoring"" the plight of the families of Caribbean migrants who have had their residency rights questioned, repeating the government's promise they and others from Commonwealth nations who came between 1948 and 1973 would now be offered British citizenship free of charge and would be helped in clarifying their status. But she said a distinction should be drawn between those people who had settled in the UK legally and contributed to British life and those with no right to be in the UK.

"The number of cars made in the UK during March fell by 13.3% from a year earlier as both domestic and overseas demand for vehicles declined. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said poor weather had affected production. But it said that double-digit falls in output for the both home market and exports were a ""considerable concern"". The SMMT said the UK must stay in the customs union to ensure ""frictionless trade"". The number of cars made for the UK fell by 17.7% in March from a year earlier, while production for markets overseas dropped by 11.9%. Uncertainty over the UK's exit from the European Union, as well ashigher taxes on diesel vehicles, has led to concerns over jobs and production in the UK's car sector.

"This video can not be played 'Don't panic' over dementia link, says expert A study links the long-term use of some drugs with a higher risk of dementia. In England, 1.5 to two million people are likely to be taking anticholinergics for depression, Parkinson's and bladder problems. University of East Anglia researchers found more cases of dementia in patients prescribed larger quantities of particular anticholinergics. But experts said patients should not stop taking them, as their benefits may outweigh any risk. The study found no risk with other anticholinergic medicines used to treat common conditions such as hay fever, travel sickness and stomach cramps. The research, funded by Alzheimer's Society andpublished in the British Medical Journal,external, looked at the medical records of 40,770 patients aged from 65 to 99 with a diagnosis of dementia between April 2006 and July 2015 and compared them with those of 283,933 people without dementia. It also analysed more than 27 million prescriptions - making it the biggest study of its kind into the long-term impact of anticholinergic drugs in relation to dementia. They block acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that carries signals across the nervous system. Some are available on prescription only. The most important thing is ""not to panic"", according to Dr Ian Maidment, from Aston University. ""Don't do anything suddenly. Don't stop taking your medication,"" he told the BBC. ""As a patient, if you are concerned about it, go and speak to your doctor or your pharmacist. You don't have to see them urgently."" Not taking prescribed drugs could have serious consequences, Dr Maidment said. ""Having untreated depression is also a risk as people can die from that, so it is a question of balancing risks,"" he added. Alzheimer's Society head of research Dr James Pickett told the BBC that compared with the risk of dementia being caused by an unhealthy lifestyle, the potential risk of an anticholinergic drug contributing to the onset of the disease was ""quite small"". ""We don't exactly know within those that are taking these drugs, who is at the increased risk and who isn't,"" he said. Dr James Pickett said it was hard to say who may be affected Dementia Research national director Prof Martin Rossor said: ""It is important to be cautious about associations as they do not prove causation."" Alzheimer's Research UK research director Dr Carol Routledge said: ""The study didn't investigate what might cause this link between anticholinergics and dementia risk, and researchers will need to build on these findings in future studies."" Rob Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, said: ""It is possible that use of some of these drugs may have actually been to treat the very earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, which can be associated with low mood and lower urinary tract infections, many years before the development of dementia."" Dr Parastou Donyai, associate professor of social and cognitive pharmacy at the University of Reading, said: ""This type of study imagines that patients actually take their drugs as they were prescribed for them. ""But we know from other research that people with long-term health conditions really only take their medication as prescribed around half of the time - the other half, people either take more or less of their medication or not at all.""

"Chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-injected beef should be part of a UK/US free trade deal, a farming union said. Roger Johnson, president of America's National Farmers Union, said US food was ""perfectly safe"" and there had been a lot of ""fear-mongering"". The politically-influential union represents more than 200,000 US farms. Mr Johnson also told the BBC that a free trade deal would open up the huge US market to British products in a boost for UK farmers. Agricultural products are likely to form a central part of any free trade deal with America that both the UK and US governments have said they want to sign when Brexit has been completed. Any deal is likely to be controversial and the British National Farmers Union has already made it clear its reservations about allowing open access to US food products. American food standards have been criticised in the UK and the European Union prohibits many US products. They include chicken, which is routinely washed in chlorine to remove bacteria; beef injected with growth hormones and pork injected with the drug ractopamine, which aids the building of muscle mass in pigs. Read more from Kamal The EU and the US also have very different approaches to genetic modification, with America allowing it in many crops that are exported. The EU is more cautious and any opening up of the market between the US and the UK on food could affect the UK's trade with the rest of Europe, where much of Britain's food exports are sent. Roger Johnson of America's National Farmers Union says US food is 'perfectly safe' The United States Trade Representative, which draws up policy recommendations for the President, said that the EU bans on American food ""unnecessarily restrict trade"" and were not based on ""scientific principles"". With the UK due to leave the EU and the single market and the government planning to quit the customs union, the UK will able to sign free trade deals with other countries, including America. ""I would not argue that it is a lower standard, I would argue it's a different standard,"" Mr Johnson told me about the different scientific approaches on either side of the Atlantic. He said that America was more ""risk-tolerant"": ""I think it is fair to say that the standards that we follow allow for more rapid scientific advancement, that a more cautionary approach [from the EU] means that scientific advances are going to happen more slowly. ""The trade negotiations need to figure out a way to allow both of these standards to be used and in a way that is honest and truthful - and let consumers choose."" Mr Johnson said that strong cultural and political links between the US and Britain meant that agreement was possible and stronger trade would be a boost to the economies of both countries. He also argued that clear labelling would be important so that consumers could decide what they wanted to buy. There was also a growing market in America for British products because of the different standards, which were often a ""fashionable"" choice for many Americans. ""Why is it that it is governments that are saying 'no you're not allowed to do this' or 'you're not allowed to do that' if the processes are judged to be safe, in one or both of the countries?"" he said. ""Let's be transparent about it and let the consumers make the decision. There's a lot of fear-mongering that happens around these kinds of things: 'Oh my god, we don't want to be eating chlorine, that's a gas that kills people'.

"Abbas Edalat was reportedly attending an academic workshop in Tehran, Iran, when he was detained The Foreign Office has said it is urgently looking into reports that a British-Iranian man has been detained in Iran. Abbas Edalat, a professor at London's Imperial College, was detained on 15 April while attending an academic workshop in Tehran, the Centre for Human Rights in Iran has said. It claimed he protested his innocence and refused an offer of bail. It is not known what charges - if any - he faces. Mr Edalat's home in Iran was reportedly raided and his belongings confiscated. The Centre for Human Rights in Iran, based in New York, described Mr Edalat as a British-Iranian national and anti-war activist who campaigns against foreign intervention in Iran. It said he was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Imperial College has said it was also looking into the reports. Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Johnson criticised over jailed mother In recent years, Iran has detained several British-Iranian nationals, including Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 39, is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of spying charges. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe,who was arrested at Tehran Airport on 3 April 2016, has denied the charges against her. The British-Iranian dual citizen maintains she was in Iran to introduce her three-year-old daughter Gabriella to her parents. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, said the latest arrest comes amid growing tensions between Iran and the United States as the UK and other European powers try to stop both sides pulling out of the deal curbing Iran's nuclear capability.

"Cheerleader Bailey Davis says she was fired by the NFL for posting an Instagram photo in a lingerie body suit Two former National Football League (NFL) cheerleaders have offered to settle their gender discrimination lawsuit against the league for just $1. Their lawyer instead proposed a four-hour ""good faith"" meeting with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to create new rules for cheerleading squads. Ex-cheerleaders Bailey Davis and Kristan Ware said they want to address concerns about wages and harrassment. But the $1 offer comes with a mandate that teams could not fire cheerleaders. Sara Blackwell, the lawyer representing Ms Davis and Ms Ware, said the deal would stipulate that teams that have cheerleading squads would have to keep them for at least five years in an effort to protect the women raising discrimination issues. ""This was never about money for me,"" Ms Davis told ABC News. ""This is about having respect for our sport and standing up for our sport and standing up for women."" Ms Blackwell drafted the proposal, which asks for the NFL to meet at least four cheerleaders to ""prepare a set of binding rules and regulations which apply to all NFL teams"". The total proposal is only one page and calls on the NFL to respond by 4 May. ""We're not asking them to admit fault, or to admit guilt, or even admit that there is anything wrong,"" Ms Blackwell told the New York Times, adding that it is just ""common sense"" that they have a conversation about cheerleader working environments. Ms Davis claims she was fired on 23 Jan for posting an Instagram photo of herself in a one-piece bodysuit, which goes against a rule that prohibits cheerleaders from posting revealing images online - a rule that she says does not apply to men. NFL cheerleader 'fired for Instagram post' The Saints organisation has denied that she was discriminated against because she is female. Ms Ware claims she was discriminated against because of her religion and gender. She says only male players were allowed to discuss their religion online and in interviews. Cheerleader 'bullied for being a virgin' In response to a recent wave of complaints from cheerleaders alleging sexual harassment, unfair wages and gender discrimination, the NFL recently said in a statement that it wanted to support its squads. ""Everyone who works in the NFL, including cheerleaders, has the right to work in a positive and respectful environment that is free from any and all forms of harassment and discrimination and fully complies with state and federal laws. Our office will work with our clubs in sharing best practices and employment-related processes that will support club cheerleading squads within an appropriate and supportive workplace.""

"This video can not be played Oliver Wood, 15, is one of thousands of children being taught outside of a school The number of children being homeschooled has risen by about 40% over three years, the BBC has found. Across the UK 48,000 children were being home-educated in 2016-17, up from about 34,000 in 2014-15. Mental health issues and avoiding exclusion are two reasons parents gave for removing children from classrooms. The government will publish new guidance on the ""rights and responsibilities on home education"" but councils want more monitoring powers. They are concerned about the quality of the education homeschooled children receive as well as ""safeguarding"" issues, such as the ability to properly protect children from abuse or maltreatment. Dr Carrie Herbert, the founder of a charity for children outside mainstream education, said the rise in homeschooling suggested ""something quite tragic about the state of the education system"". She said she was concerned some parents might also feelpressured into home-schooling their childrento avoid exclusion or prosecution over poor attendance. ""I'm not sure it's very useful anymore to put 30 children in one classroom with an adult all doing the same thing in the same way at the same time,"" said Dr Herbert, of The Red Balloon charity. ""We should really be thinking more 21st century and outside the box about this and teaching online in real time can help do this."" Oliver Wood is taught at home in Thetford by Laura Saggers Oliver Wood, from Thetford in Norfolk, was severely bullied at his former school before becoming a pupil of Red Balloon. The 15-year-old has autism and suffers from anxiety. ""Every school we were offered was looking at him like a problem to solve, rather than a person they could work with,"" said his mother, Sophie. Oliver hopes to take four GCSEs next June. Red Balloon has anonline school,externalthat follows a ""normal"" school day as much as possible. Its curriculum is tailored to suit the child's interests, with the aim of getting them back into the habit of learning, socialising with others and for some, returning to school. The charity has 93 pupils and has had to close its books until it can afford to hire more teachers. The BBC contacted councils in England, Wales and Scotland and the Northern Ireland Department of Education for figures on homeschooling. Of the 177 authorities that were able to provide data for all three years, 164 reported an increase. Only 11 with figures for all three years had fewer homeschooled children in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. While they make up just 0.5% of the school age population for England and Wales, the large rise has prompted calls from councils and education bodies for more statutory monitoring powers of homeschooled children. Companies pledge to cut plastic pollution Drugs used by two in five students Home Office had migrant removal targets There is no legal obligation for children to attend school but the law says they must receive an education. They can be taught by parents or private tutors and the guidance from both the English and Welsh education departments is that it must be a ""suitable education"". The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) in England wants parents and carers who home-educate to be obliged to register with their local authority and for inspectors to be able to take action if they find a problem. Councils should have resources to ensure homeschooled children receive ""a good standard of education, delivered in a suitable learning environment and that they are safe,"" theADCS said in a report,externalin December 2017. Safety of pupils was also raised in astudy by Norfolk County Council,external. Its children's services reported an ""unprecedented year-on-year rise"" in home-schooling with 1,309 (1.1%) of its school-aged pupils being home taught during the 2016-17 academic year. ""Given that children by the nature of being home-educated can be essentially 'invisible', an inability to make timely and appropriate contact with these families has an inherent risk attached,"" they said. The Isle of Wight has the highest proportion of home-educated pupils, almost one in 50. Criticisms by Ofsted over the island'shigh proportion of ""inadequate"" schoolsmay have had an impact, the council said, adding it was tackling ""lower educational standards"". A spokeswoman said it had a ""good relationship"" with many families contacting it ""directly when they are thinking of home-educating"" as another possible explanation for the figures. In Wales just over 1,800 out of about 430,000 children, about 0.4%, were homeschooled in 2016-17. In Scotland, just 0.1% of children are home-educated, 969 in total. The department of education in Northern Ireland saw just 293 pupils being home educated out of a possible 343,082, representing less than 0.1% of the school-aged population in 2017. Why are parents choosing to educate children at home? Many authorities could not provide reasons why more parents appeared to be choosing homeschooling. Of those that did, the reasons included: Devon: Most parents who offered a reason for homeschooling blamed ""dissatisfaction with the school environment"" East Sussex: Lack of school choice, unmet special educational needs and the ""rigour and limits"" of the current school curriculum Gateshead: Parents felt some pressure from school to remove their children especially if the young person had poor attendance Cambridgeshire: The council said it had increased support for the home-educated community, including extending ""borrowing rights"" at libraries Darlington: Local authority staff are ""currently working with the police and health to ensure the safeguarding of home educated children and this may have contributed to the rise in numbers identified"" In December Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, found overseeing the growing number of home-educated children was ""becoming a challenge for local authorities."" The education watchdog also observed the numbers of children with special educational needs or disabilities guided towards home-education ""was typically high"". Ms Spielman said it was ""unacceptable"" that parents reported being asked to keep their children at home because school leaders said they could not meet their children's needs. Abill,externalseeking more powers for local authorities to assess children receiving home education has gone through a second reading in the House of Lords. Speaking in parliament,external, education minister Lord Agnew said many parents home-educate for ""positive reasons"" and it should be allowed to continue ""with a minimum of fuss and bureaucracy"". ""There is a need to ensure that, where there is genuine cause for concern about a child, local authorities are clear about the powers open to them,"" he said. The Department for Education (DfE), which covers England, and the Welsh government will both consult on ways to improve home-education guidance for parents and councils. A spokesman for the DfE said this would ensure local authorities ""are clear on the action âthey can take where these responsibilities are not being metâ"". A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""We recognise that we are currently unable to provide reliable figures on how many children are educated at home and that is one of the reasons why we will be consulting on a database as well as statutory guidance for elective home education.""

"The university cites the remote locations of club activities as a reason to end outdoors events A US college outdoors club is being disbanded because its activities, which include hiking, running and backpacking, are deemed too risky. Pennsylvania State University officials said the group will be reconstituted to focus more on safety. The 98-year-old Outing Club is one of three that will be disbanded from next semester: the caving and scuba clubs have also been deemed unsafe. But the Outing Club said its community ""is not going anywhere."" Hiking is among the activities carried out by the students The decision came after a two-month review process, but the students say they were not consulted. ""Safety is a legitimate concern, but it wasn't an open dialogue,"" Richard Waltz, president of the 169-member Outing Club, told local media. The club's officers told the BBC that though they had spoken with some of the university members involved, ""the main decision-makers"" were not present in these conversations. They added that despite requests, ""none of the officers have been permitted to see the results of the risk management assessment"". University spokeswoman Lisa Powers said in a statement their risk assessment was based on the club's activities in dangerous, remote environments. Students participating in one of the club's outdoor activities ""In addition to the inherent risks found in many of these student activities that occur without fully trained guides or leaders, the behaviours of some students on unsupervised trips have become a concern,"" she said. ""These concerns have, at times, included the misuse of alcohol in the context of already risky activities. This mix is obviously dangerous."" The university said the clubs were only being disbanded in their ""current high-risk model"" and will be ""re-organised"" in order to provide more oversight by trained staff during activities. According to the college, safety concerns were initially raised by students themselves. However, Christina Platt, incoming president of the Outing Club, said there were no alcohol-related incidents or injuries that she is aware of on any of their trips. Allow Facebook content?

The students said in a Facebook post: ""The community that has grown around the Outing Club is not going anywhere. ""The officers of the club have been working diligently with our club adviser and Penn State staff to find the appropriate structure within the University to continue to foster this ever-growing outdoor community."" Could a stroll in a summery meadow be fraught with risk? Reaction to the club's statement underlined just how upset students - and alumni - are over the university's risk-averse policy. ""Club Sports is treating students like children who cannot be trusted to even leave campus for a moment,"" one commenter said. Another wrote: ""Leading and participating in student-led PSOC trips was one of the most valuable experiences of my time at Penn State, and the fact that students were given the responsibility made all the difference."" The club has received over 230 responses on social media, and a petition for the club has gained more than 2,200 signatures in the past two days, students told the BBC. In addition, they said dozens of clubs nationwide and even from Greece have offered support. Another adventure loving American: Dylan McWilliams survived a bear mauling and a shark attack Man mauled by bear survives shark attack The people trying to visit every place on Earth Where is the remotest spot in the United States? The Outing Club's officers also said they are meeting with the university's Office of Student Activities on Wednesday to discuss restructuring the club to be a ""special interest organisation"". Under this title, the club would be able to host certain community events like film festivals, but would not be able to provide volunteer, student-led trips. ""Moving forward we are going to continue having discussions with the university to ensure that there are affordable opportunities for students to go outside."" The university offers an outdoor adventures programme for students, but it is significantly more expensive than student-led club. The Outing Club said their fees amount to $20 (Â£14) a year, while a weekend trip with the university programme could cost around $110 (Â£79). The club's last meeting, which took place on Monday evening, was ""full of energy"", the students told the BBC. ""It was bittersweet, but many were hopeful for positive change in the upcoming year.""

"Plastic waste is ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". These are the words of Prime Minister Theresa May, who has pledged to ban all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. About 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally by 2015, with almost 80% of it going to landfills or the natural environment. And despite extending the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, major retailers in England stillsold 2.1 billion,externalin the last financial year. In a bid to tackle the problem, the PM has called on supermarkets to introduce ""plastic-free"" aisles and consider taxes and charges on single-use plastic items like food containers. But organisations like Greenpeace UK are sceptical about the plan, citing Mrs May's ""vague aspirations"" and calling for ""concrete action"", such as a bottle deposit return scheme or a ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. So what are Britain's 10 biggest supermarkets doing to combat the ""scourge"" of plastic? By 2025, Tesco wantsall its packaging to be recyclable or compostable,externaland its total packaging weight to be halved compared to 2007. It has removedall polystyrene from its fish packaging,external, and claims that more than 78% of its packaging is recyclable, though this depends on the type of material accepted by local authorities.

M&S to stop selling 'cauliflower steak' Marks & Spencer says thatmore than 90%,externalof all its UK packaging is recyclable, and less than 1% (by weight) of all its packaging can be traced back to polystyrene. It hastrialled new materials,externalto replace its blackCPET (a type of plastic) packaging,external, and the foils in packaging for biscuits and crisps. Between 2007 and 2012 itreduced its total packaging by 25%,external, and between 2012 and 2014, its food packaging usage per itemdecreased by 10%,external. It is also looking at using plastics made from plant-based oils. Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said that while initiatives like these were good, ""more radical and comprehensive policies"" were needed to tackle the plastic waste crisis. ""We need to see supermarkets making firm commitments to move away from using disposable plastic packaging altogether, starting with going plastic free in their own brands."" Businesses should be using ""reusable containers wherever possible"", she said, and investment in research and development was ""vital"" to finding less problematic packaging materials. Supermarkets also needed to avoid solving one problem by causing another, such as reducing the weight of packaging by replacing glass with plastic, she said. But the most important step for retailers was to make an open commitment to reducing the use of resources and carbon emissions. ""None of these processes will be reliable without significantly increased transparency,"" she added. Greenpeace UK suggests retailers should: Eliminate all non-recyclable plastics from own brand products Remove single-use plastic packaging for own brand products Trial dispensers and refillable containers for own brand items like shampoos, house cleaning products, beverages Push national brand suppliers to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and to stop using single use plastic packaging Install free water fountains in-store and water re-fill stations Support deposit return schemes in-store Trial reusable packaging and product refills via home deliveries A spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was committed to stemming the damage caused by plastic waste and had made great progress in boosting recycling rates. ""We are encouraged by industry action to reduce plastic and packaging waste and look forward to seeing others following its lead,"" it said. Written and researched by Becca Meier.

"This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic Wet wipes have been added to the list of items being targeted by government plans to eliminate plastic waste. Plastic straws and cotton buds were already on a list of items whichcould be banned in England. It comes after the prime minister pledged in January to eradicate all ""avoidable plastic waste"" by 2042. Some businessesand cafes have started stocking appropriate replacements for plastic and60 music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, have banned plastic straws, so what are the alternatives? Paper, card and steel are all alternative materials that can be used to replace plastic straws. Paper and card will not seem much different to plastic in terms of texture but some people have raised questions about the use of steel straws. Julian Kirby, Friends of the Earth's waste expert, has tried all the different materials and says ""it's a personal preference"". ""[Steel] is comfortable for a room-temperature drink - I was drinking a smoothie and it did feel very cold, so I think if you've got sensitive teeth or sensitive gums, you might not like that."" This video can not be played Plastic pollution is killing animals in the Arctic He welcomes calls for a ban and regards straws are the most unnecessary of plastic products. ""We should always ask ourselves - do we actually need this thing? That applies to straws more than anything else. ""They're liberally dispersed, they're not necessary for most people - the drink would be just as good without a strawâ¦. if they are so necessary, why not reuse them?"" Mr Kirby points out thatfor people with certain disabilities, using a straw to eat or drink with is necessary. ""[The government] does say there will be medical exemptions. People who need straws to eat or to drink, they will still be able to use plastic straws."" He is optimistic that many more alternatives will come: ""We've seen again and again that when you ban something - for good reasons - innovations create all sorts of alternatives."" Blogger Rachael Stilgoe, who runs the lifestyle blogBe a Shade Greener,external, has been using cotton buds with card stems for the past two years. ""I've had no problem with them at all in terms of the quality of the product,"" she says. Ms Stilgoe has been using ones with stems made of stiff paper, so they can be composted. ""They're available widely online and in supermarkets, and are easy to get hold of."" Dr Abigail Entwistle, director of conservation science at Fauna & Flora International, says ""clear alternatives exist"". ""Cotton buds are a particular menace on beaches around the world, and are consistently one of themost regularly reported items on UK beaches"" she adds. She welcomed the government's ""positive leadership"" on reducing plastic, saying that it sends ""a very clear message that nonsensical use of plastic, as a default material, needs to stop. ""We encourage everyone to think carefully about their choices in using plastic - remember you can still just say no to that unnecessary plastic item!"" Wet wipes contain non-biodegradable plastic. They make up around 93% of sewer blockages in the UK and are a key component of the giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to Water UK. Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against marine pollution, says: ""There are alternatives. You can carry around re-usable, washable cloths and washable baby wipes. ""It is quite a leap for people to think about doing that, but it is possible. There are thousands of people who do it already."" Ms Fee also suggests more can be done to deter people from buying plastic wipes. ""We can look at changing the labelling like we have with cigarettes,"" she says. ""If we had images of marine animals dying of plastic pollution on the front of baby wipes, that would certainly make people stop and think twice about flushing them down the toilet.""

"Rodney Saunders body was found by fishermen in February South African police have identified the body of a British horticulturalist who was kidnapped with his wife in a case with suspected links to the Islamic State group (IS). Rodney Saunders, 73, and his wife Rachel, 63, disappeared while looking for rare seeds in KwaZulu-Natal province in February. The body was discovered days later in a river. Rachel has not been found. The news came as the four alleged kidnappers appeared in a Durban court. The British Foreign Office has confirmed the positive identification of Rodney Saunders. The couple have dual South African and British citizenship. ""We are saddened to learn of the death of a South African-British national, and offer our sympathies to their family at this deeply upsetting time,"" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said in a statement to the BBC. ""We are working closely with the South African authorities on their investigation, and continue to offer consular support to the family."" South African police said that ""a dedicated team remain on the ground for the search of Rachel"". Authorities are checking mortuaries and doing forensic and DNA tests. Suspects Fatima Patel, 27, and Saffydeen Aslam del Vecchio, 38, were arrested on 16 February, one day before the body was found. Before the arrest, they were both under police surveillance and are alleged to have hoisted an IS flag in the reserve where the couple disappeared. The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The mystery of the horticulturalists missing in South Africa âIslamic Stateâ around the world Another suspect, Themba Xulu, 19, was arrested after being found in possession of the victims' mobile phones. The fourth suspect is a 36-year-old Malawian, Ahmad Mussa. The BBC has declined to comment on reports that, shortly before they were kidnapped, the Saunders had been working with a film crew from the television programme Gardeners' World. After the couple's disappearance, their car was found with blood marks and 734,000 rand (Â£42,000) was reportedly drained from their bank accounts. There have been no known attacks by IS, or any other jihadist group, in South Africa. The most prominent case ever linked to IS in the country involved the Thulsie twins, Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee. They were arrested during raids in 2016 that also saw Fatima Patel detained - though she was not charged at the time. The twins are expected to face trial on terrorism charges related to alleged plans to attack the US embassy in South Africa and Jewish targets. The Saunders' disappearance led the British Foreign Office to update its warning about the threat of a terrorist attack in the country, which upset many South Africans.

"This video can not be played Five times Macron ripped up Trump agenda French President Emmanuel Macron has used his speech to the joint houses of the US Congress to denounce nationalism and isolationism. Mr Macron said such policies were a threat to global prosperity. The speech was widely interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on President Donald Trump's America First agenda. Mr Macron also raised differences on global trade, Iran and the environment, seemingly in contrast to the warm bonhomie of his visit so far. The French president was given a three-minute standing ovation as he took his place in the chamber for his speech. This video can not be played Trump and Macron's touching moments He hailed the ""unbreakable bonds"" of the US and France, forged in ""liberty, tolerance and equal rights"". What does a Trump-Macron bromance mean for the world? He has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, and is in Washington as the first foreign leader to be afforded a US state visit by the Trump White House. But the French president's comments showed that the pair do not agree on all subjects. Mr Macron said isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism ""can be tempting to us as a temporary remedy to our fears. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse but inflame the fears of our citizens"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He added: ""We will not let the rampaging work of extreme nationalism shake a world full of hopes for greater prosperity."" Mr Macron said that the US had invented multilateralism and now needed to reinvent it to create a new 21st Century world order. He said the UN and the Nato military alliance might not be able to fulfil their mandates and assure stability if the West ignored the new dangers arising in the world. Analysis by BBC North America editor Jon Sopel Macron has provided a masterclass to other world leaders on how to handle Donald Trump - you cuddle up close, you flatter where necessary - but you use that to allow you to pack a big punch. He also spoke about the very special relationship between France and the US, a move that might have had some in Downing Street choking on their tea. In a cleverly crafted speech, he started with the entente between himself and the US president that some said was just too cordial. But then came the punches - and they were hard-hitting jabs, taking direct aim at Donald Trump's policy agenda. On free trade, on the importance of science, on inequality - and Mr Trump's America First policies. Then he audaciously borrowed Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan to talk about the environment, and the importance of the climate change agreement the US has said it will withdraw from. He said it was time to make the Earth great again. The speech was punctuated by applause and cheering. This was an important moment in the US Congress. Emmanuel Macron has emerged as a world leader who offers a competing and sharply different world vision to the US president - while all the time maintaining a bonhomie with him. That's quite a political feat. On trade, Mr Macron said that ""commercial war is not the proper answer"", as it would ""destroy jobs and increase prices"", adding: ""We should negotiate through the World Trade Organization. We wrote these rules, we should follow them."" Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Mr Trump has in the past said that trade wars are good and easily won. He has taken on Europe and China with new tariffs, saying the US has suffered from unfair trade practices. This video can not be played Melania's big role during Macron visit On another issue of difference, Iran, Mr Macron said his country would not abandon a nuclear deal with Tehran that was agreed by world powers when President Barack Obama was in office but which Mr Trump has branded ""terrible"". Mr Macron said: ""This agreement may not address all concerns, and very important concerns. This is true. But we should not abandon it without having something more substantial instead."" Is the Iran nuclear deal about to collapse? What's in the Iran nuclear deal? But he added: ""Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. Not now. Not in five years. Not in 10 years. Never."" On the environment, he said by ""polluting the oceans, not mitigating CO2 emissions and destroying biodiversity we are killing our planet. Let us face it, there is no Planet B"". Donald Trump last year announced that he intended to withdraw the US from the Paris global climate accord, another landmark Obama achievement, saying it was a ""very bad deal for the US"". The accord, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to cut damaging emissions. What's in the Paris climate deal? Mr Macron's wide-ranging address highlighted numerous political and cultural links, citing American Revolutionary War officer Marquis de Lafayette, writer and feminist Simone de Beauvoir, Abraham Lincoln, author Ernest Hemingway, the founder of French romanticism FranÃ§ois-RenÃ© Chateaubriand and both Presidents Roosevelt. This video can not be played Macron on the environment: ""There is no Planet B"" His quoting of Franklin D's ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" drew one of his biggest applauses. Senior House Democrat Adam Schiff said Mr Macron had offered ""more of a direct contradiction of the president than I was expecting"", telling AFP: ""There were more than a few uncomfortable moments on the [Republican] side of the aisle."" Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte visited the Library of Congress Republican Senator Jeff Flake said the speech was ""very contrary to Trumpism, very much contrary to an America First agenda"". But Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy denied there was any rebuke. ""He said in there that he believes in free and fair trade. That's exactly what the president asked for,"" he said.

"More than 40 companies have signed up to a pact to cut plastic pollution over the next seven years. The firms, which include Coca-Cola and Asda, have promised to honour a number of pledges such as eliminating single-use packaging through better design. They have joined the government, trade associations and campaigners to form the UK Plastics Pact. The signatories are responsible for more than 80% of plastic packaging on products sold through UK supermarkets. One of the promises which companies, such as consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble and Marks & Spencer, have signed up to is to make 100% of plastic packaging ready for recycling or composting by 2025. Led by the sustainability campaign group WRAP, the pact is described as a ""once-in-a lifetime opportunity"" to rethink plastic both to make use of its value and to stop it damaging the environment. What are the alternatives to plastic? What are supermarkets doing to fight plastic? A month without plastic - 10 years on The plastic choking Indonesian rivers WRAP's chief executive Marcus Gover, said: ""This requires a whole scale transformation of the plastics system and can only be achieved by bringing together all links in the chain under a shared commitment to act. ""That is what makes the UK Plastics Pact unique.  It unites every body, business and organisation with a will to act on plastic pollution. We will never have a better time to act, and together we can."" This video can not be played Five ways to break up with plastic The set of pledges to tackle plastic pollution over the next seven years include: Eliminate difficult or unnecessary single use plastic packaging through better design Make 100% of plastic packaging reusable or recyclable or compostable Make sure 70% of plastic packaging is recycled or composted 30% of all plastic packaging to include recycled material The pact is also supported by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The yachtswoman, who broke the solo record for sailing around the world in 2005, has long campaigned for plastic products to be re-used and not allowed to enter the oceans. Research conducted by her foundation concluded that 95% of plastic packaging around the world is used only once. She said the Plastics Pact would create ""a circular economy for plastics that tackles the causes of plastics waste and pollution, not just the symptoms."" ""Focusing on innovation, better packaging design and end-of-use systems will not only generate long-term benefits for the environment, but is also a huge economic opportunity."" The agreement has been welcomed by environmental groups who have for years been critical of businesses for failing to design products with recycling in mind. Friends of the Earth said government measures were also needed to make sure the targets are met. Reality Check: Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Festivals aim to go plastic-free by 2021 Reality Check: Is this how to cut plastic waste? Julian Kirby, plastics campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said: ""To discourage industry from using virgin plastic, and to boost their recycling and re-use of the material, regulations and taxes should be introduced."" The pact is the latest in a flurry of actions designed to meet public concern about plastic waste, the so-called ""Blue Planet"" effect following the television series narrated by Sir David Attenborough. This video can not be played The plastic choking Indonesian rivers The test will be whether the pledges are translated into real changes to products and the ways they are sold, to make recycling easier and more effective and to do that quickly.

"This video can not be played The ups and downs of Trump and Macron France's President Emmanuel Macron is in Washington this week, the first foreign leader to make a state visit under Donald Trump. The two men - both seen as outsiders before their presidential campaigns - have developed an unlikely personal rapport, but what's behind the connection, and what does it mean for French interests and influence? Emmanuel Macron's relationships have raised eyebrows more than once. Weeks after taking office,he passed over France's key allies and chose the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, as his first foreign guest- a man he's due to visit in Moscow next month, despite recently ordering airstrikes against Russia's Syrian ally. His ecumenical approach has sometimes caused diplomatic tiffs, most recently with Ankara, incensed by the suggestion that it might like France to mediate between Turkey and the Kurds. But nothing has drawn the same attention as his ""bromance"" with Donald Trump. This video can not be played The US president attended France's Bastille Day celebrations in 2017 There is the unlikely age difference between the two men, their difference in political vision and values, in their style and personality, their backgrounds, their interests, their use of the media. And yet, the ElysÃ©e describes their relationship as ""very close"", and the two men really do, by all accounts, speak often and frankly by telephone, and seem to have a genuine rapport. This rapport has pushed France ahead of Germany and the UK, to become America's primary European contact. Britain's retreat from Europe and Germany's trade and immigration policies helped open the way for Mr Macron, and it has not escaped notice here that it's he, and not Mrs May or Mrs Merkel, who is making the first state visit of the Trump presidency, when he will be a guest at a formal banquet and  address the Congress. An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born Long read: Macron's meteoric rise And there are personal reasons for the new Franco-American bond. Both Mr Macron and Mr Trump were seen as shaking up the political systems in their countries; both are - in their own ways - outspoken; and both like to project an image of strength. It doesn't hurt either, say some on the American side, that Mr Macron is male, and seen as handsome. But France may also have an easier time adjusting to the disruptive Trump presidency precisely because it didn't have the kind of close, shared vision that both Germany and the UK have had with recent American presidents. France is pragmatic in its approach to Washington - an alliance based on mutual interests rather than a shared moral vision of the world. This video can not be played Donald Trump's handshakes with world leaders have been closely watched Those mutual interests are still dominated by security and counter-terrorism. France needs the US for its international fight against terrorism, and as analysts here will tell you, Paris has come to be seen as Washington's best bet for military support, in the wake of British caution following the Iraq War. Syria: What can Macron and Trump do? Macron on Brexit, Frexit and Trump Mr Trump's approach to security has sometimes helped President Macron's own agenda in Europe. The American leader has been robust in asking EU states to take a greater role in their own security, and raise their defence spending to 2% of GDP. Mr Macron, who has promised France will meet that target by 2025, is keen for Europe to have more autonomy in security and defence matters, and is pushing his proposal of a European Intervention Initiative, with the common resources and strategic goals that would allow it to carry out its own missions, as France does now. But in a country where too close a proximity to the US can be politically dangerous for a president, Mr Macron will need to have something more to have show for it. Mr Macron's close relationship with Mr Trump makes France America's primary European contact He recently claimed to have convinced his American counterpart to stay engaged in Syria, but that was quickly denied by the White House. And so far, despite raising expectations, there's little evidence of the French leader's influence over President Trump on key issues like climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, or the status of Jerusalem. This visit will be a chance to discuss those policy differences with the US, with France hoping to agree ""a document of recommendations"" with Washington ahead of Mr Trump's planned withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement next month. President Macron will also talk to Donald Trump about his planned tariffs on EU steel and aluminium, the conflict in Syria, and Washington's controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. But, even without any concrete influence over these issues, there's intrinsic value for Mr Macron in his relationship with Donald Trump. This video can not be played Toned-down Trump: What happened to the tough talk on Paris? Mr Macron began his presidency with a commitment to restore French status abroad and a sense of its mission in the world.Lofty aims, which he believes are key to France regaining a sense of national identity and optimism. His close relationship to Donald Trump, even without much policy influence, raises France's global profile and boosts its influence and leverage elsewhere. Emmanuel Macron's diplomatic trademark is strong personal connections combined with robust policy differences - a delicate juggling act, on occasion. President Trump's relationships can be unpredictable - analysts point out that Macron has been careful not to criticise him personally. And if Mr Trump's decisions directly harm French interests, Emmanuel Macron could find himself on the receiving end of far more damaging criticism - from French voters.

"The charges were announced at a news conference in Sacramento California police have arrested a former police officer for a notorious spree of murders, rapes and burglaries in the 1970s and 80s. Sacramento police say they arrested suspect Joseph James DeAngelo, 72. The suspect has been living in the Sacramento area and was identified after new efforts to solve the case, investigators say. Police blame the so-called Golden State Killer for 12 murders, 51 rapes and more than 120 burglaries. Mr DeAngelo is being held on suspicion of four counts of murder - the 1978 deaths of Brian and Katie Maggiore in Sacramento and the 1980 killings of Charlene and Lyman Smith in Ventura County. Prosecutors say additional charges are likely to follow. Police had been monitoring the suspect and used ""discarded DNA"" to match him to the crimes, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. This video can not be played Golden State Killer: 'A staggering crime spree' Announcing the arrest, Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said: ""The answer has always been in Sacramento."" ""The magnitude of this case demanded that it be solved,"" she added. Ventura County District Attorney Greg Totten said that prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty. Two years ago the FBI offered a $50,000 (Â£36,000) reward to anyone who could help crack the case. By James Cook, BBC News Los Angeles correspondent After four decades of frustration for detectives, it turned out the suspect had been living under their noses all along. ""We found the needle in the haystack and it was right here in Sacramento,"" said district attorney Anne Marie Schubert. Joseph James DeAngelo had apparently been living an ordinary life on a quiet suburban street, a former police officer with grown-up children who was ""very surprised"" when he was arrested and taken into custody. Details of his alleged crimes are deeply disturbing and collective psychological scars endure. Many police officers and prosecutors involved in the case vividly recall the terror of the crime spree in their communities. ""Everyone was afraid,"" said FBI special agent Marcus Knutson, who was born and raised in Sacramento, as he announced a fresh appeal for information on the case two years ago. ""We had people sleeping with shotguns, we had people purchasing dogs. People were concerned, and they had a right to be. This guy was terrorising the community. He did horrible things."" According to the Sacramento Bee newspaper, he had been living with his daughter and granddaughter in the city's Citrus Heights neighbourhood. He was fired from the Auburn Police Department in 1979 after he was charged with shoplifting, according to the Auburn Journal. Allow Twitter content?

Police say it was ""very likely"" that he was committing these crimes while employed as a police officer. He had also worked as an officer in Exeter, California from 1973 to 1976, during a time when several crimes were committed there, police say. Jane Carson-Sandler, who was the rapist's fifth victim in October 1976, told the Island Packet newspaper that detectives had emailed her on Wednesday,externalto inform her of the arrest. ""I just found out this morning,"" she said. ""I'm overwhelmed with joy. I've been crying, sobbing."" The case was investigated by author Michelle McNamara for her book I'll Be Gone in the Dark. McNamara died before the book could be published. Her co-author, Billy Jensen, tweeted on Tuesday night to say there would be a ""rather large announcement tomorrow"".

The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, and the Diamond Knot Killer is believed to have carried out rapes and murders between 1976 and 1986, killing girls and women aged between 12 and 41. Prosecutors say the ""reign of terror"" began in Sacramento and spread to San Francisco and then on to central and southern California. Links between the cases were established by DNA evidence, police say. A police reward poster shows photofit pictures of the suspect The attacker broke into homes at night and then tied up and raped his female victims. Before fleeing he stole items such as cash, jewellery and identification. The last case to be linked to the Golden State Killer was the rape and murder of an 18-year-old woman in Irvine, Orange County, in May 1986. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said the suspect had been called many names but added: ""Today, it's our pleasure to call him 'defendant'.""

"Amazon has released coloured versions of its Echo Dot speaker to accompany the new features Amazon's smart assistant Alexa can now be made to encourage children to say: ""Please,"" and: ""Thank you,"" when issuing it voice commands. The new function addresses some parents' concerns that use of the technology was teaching their offspring to sound officious or even rude. In addition, parents can now set time limits on when requests are responded to, and can block some services. The move has been welcomed by one of Alexa's critics. In January, the research company ChildWise published a report warning that youngsters that grew up accustomed to barking orders at Alexa, Google Assistant or some other virtual personality might become aggressive in later dealings with humans. ""This is a very positive development,"" research director Simon Leggett told the BBC. ""We had noticed that practically none of the children that we had talked to said they ever used the words 'please' or 'thank you' when talking to their devices. ""Younger children will enjoy having the added interactivity, but older children may be less likely to use it as they will be more aware it's a robot at the other end."" For now,the new facilities have been announced,externalonly in the US, where they will become available on 9 May via a software update. The politeness feature - which has been branded Magic Word - encourages children to say: ""Please,"" and: ""Thank you,"" by acknowledging use of the terms. So, for example, if the child asks: ""What will the weather be today please?"" Alexa will add to its response: ""Thanks for asking so nicely."" Likewise, once Alexa has completed a task, if the child says: ""Thank you,"" it will prompt one of several follow-ups, including ""No worries,"" and ""You're welcome."" Toymaker Mattel had previously considered going further, with its aborted smart-speaker, Aristotle. In 2017, it hadproposed a machine that would complete tasks,externalonly if the word ""please"" were included. Amazon, however, said it had been advised that this approach would backfire. ""We talked to third-party child development experts as we were building this feature,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""They said that if you are going to try and offer them guidance, then positive reinforcement is the best way to do that as it's not punitive. ""They had found that saying, 'You will not get this if you do not say please,' is not useful with kids and doesn't work."" Amazon patents 'voice-sniffing' algorithms Amazon Echo trial to help elderly and disabled people Amazon's race to make Alexa smarter She added that Amazon intended to see how parents and children reacted to the feature, and if it was welcomed would probably extend its capabilities. The good manners facility is part of a host of new child-centric tools unveiled for Alexa - some of which will require a subscription fee. A new Disney Stories skill and ad-free Disney Radio station are two of the features included with a premium FreeTime subscription The basic ""free"" FreeTime package includes the abilities to: set bedtime hours during which it will not accept commands switch off certain services, such as voice-purchasing or listening to news bulletins block songs with explicit lyrics A $2.99 (Â£2.15) monthly fee unlocks added functions, including: wake-up alarms featuring well-known cartoon characters access to several hundred child-focused audio books exclusive use of premium software - known as skills - from brands including Disney and National Geographic This offers a way for the company to make money from its Echo smart-speakers, which it sells for roughly the same price they cost to develop and manufacture. In addition, Alexa's voice-recognition software has been tweaked to account for the fact children have higher-pitched voices than adults, and will soon respond to ""Awexa"" to help those that cannot yet pronounce the letter L. ""It is commendable that Amazon is trying to get kids to say their please and thank yous, but for most parents it will be the content controls and other kid-centric features that will be the most appealing aspect of the new offering,"" said Ben Wood, a technology consultant at CCS Insight.

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall on why Britain is losing the fat fight Can we trust BMI to measure obesity? The Truth About Obesity Britain's Fat Fight When using the calculator above your postcode is required so that the BBC can show how body mass index in your region compares with the rest of the UK. The other data you provide in this calculator is not stored in a personally identifiable way and we will not share it with a third party. Read theBBC Privacy & Cookies Policyfor more information. Comparative data for this calculator comes from the most recent national health surveys from the four constituent nations of the UK (see data sources below). We calculate BMI using the standard formula of a person's mass in kg divided by the square of their height in metres (kg/m2) and display it to one decimal place. Where a user's data is entered in imperial units, we first convert to metric and then carry out the BMI calculation. The BMI result is assigned to a standard category: Less than 18.5 - underweight 18.5 to 24.9 - healthy weight 25 to 29.9 - overweight 30 to 39.9 - obese 40 and over - very obese (also known as morbidly obese) Experts say that for people of an Asian descent, 18.5 to 23 is a healthy BMI. We highlight this fact in a later section. BMI does not take into account body composition so some people who are lean and carry a lot of muscle may have a BMI which does not necessarily reflect theirhealth status. However, Prof Naveed Sattar from the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow says this is likely to apply to far less than 1% of individuals. Thewaist circumference measurementis an additional check which can be used in conjunction with BMI. This section compares the user's BMI result with the mean average BMI for their sex and age group in their nation (as defined by the postcode entered in the form). The Northern Ireland health survey does not publish average BMI data so this comparison is excluded when an NI postcode is entered. Results for all nations are shown in 10-year age bands apart from the lower end (16-24) and upper end (85+ in  England, 75+ in all other nations) The silhouette body shapes represent the range of BMI categories. We worked with original images developed by Prof Martin Tovee of the University of Lincoln. England data is broken down into five categories from ""underweight"" to ""very obese"". Scotland and Wales have four categories, with those who are ""very obese"" included in the ""obese"" category. Northern Ireland has three categories: ""healthy or underweight"", ""overweight"" and ""obese or very obese"". In all cases, the breakdown reflects the data available. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. This part of the results shows the percentage of adults who are overweight or obese in the area of the UK that matches the user's postcode. The figures are divided into male or female, to match the user's details. The Welsh figure may be an underestimate, as the survey asks for self-reported measurements. Information in this section was written in conjunction with Prof Naveed Sattar from the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow, and experts at Public Health England. Information in this section was also written in conjunction with the medical experts. The details about how waist size influences risk of developing certain diseases comes fromNHS England,external. We used data from the most recent national health surveys for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

"This video can not be played Rose McGowan tells the Victoria Derbyshire show Harvey Weinstein has tried to contact her Actress Rose McGowan has told the BBC Harvey Weinstein has tried to contact her since she went public with her allegations that he raped her. She said she had received ""texts, things like that"", adding: ""I've got no idea how he got my number."" Ms McGowan also said the alleged assault by Mr Weinstein had been ""worse than I wrote about"". She is one of several women to accuse Mr Weinstein of rape. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. When asked whether she had been approached directly by the Hollywood producer, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Texts, things like that - I've got no idea how he got my number, but he also had former [Israeli intelligence agency] Mossad agents involved in my life so getting my personal phone number wasn't that hard."" How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers When asked how recently there had been contact, she replied: ""A month ago - somebody that worked with him, represented him, I don't know, on his behalf - I shook, it was like a bullet once again. ""It was basically just kind of this person is reaching out. And I don't even understand what the point was. I can't understand to what end. The cat's out of the bag."" Mr Weinstein, through a spokeswoman, says he âunequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex"". Asked what the purpose of the message had been, she said it had been suggesting that Mr Weinstein had wanted to get in touch or to talk to her. She said: ""It could have been some random person, but that would be a long shot."" Ms McGowan also said the response had been ""nothing short of cataclysmic"" since she had become one of the most prominent figures in the #MeToo movement after sharing her allegations. ""In some ways I feel it's an honour to almost be a receptacle for so many people's pain and voices, people who want to identify and reach out and say, 'Me too,'"" she said. ""I had hoped that by showing people that if you can cut off the head of power, that you can achieve an awful lot."" Ms McGowan claims she was raped by Mr Weinstein in a hotel room during a business meeting at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. She told Victoria Derbyshire: ""The reality of what happened in that hotel room is even worse than I wrote about [in her book]. I just thought, 'This is enough to really get my point across.' ""There's a strange thing that happens with becoming a survivor, that you feel like you are almost trapped in this weird relationship with this person that you can't get away from. ""It shocks me that I was touched by this person, and so many, I was just a thing to be eaten."" She added the alleged incident ""did a lot of damage, it still does"" as his name and face was everywhere. ""There's something really strange about having this abstract envy over a victim who doesn't need to see her perpetrator again,"" she said. Mr Weinstein's representatives have been contacted for a response to Ms McGowan's claims he has tried to contact her. In relation to her rape allegations, they said: ""Mr Weinstein has vigorously denied Ms McGowan's claims and an investigation of those claims and of Ms McGowan suggests in our judgment, that she has taken a consensual act of intimacy between her and Mr Weinstein and falsely attempted to turn it into an act of sexual assault."" On claims that Ms McGowan had been spied on by an intelligence agency made up of former Mossad spies called Black Cube, the company said it applied high moral standards to its work and operated in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

"Madsen was sentenced to life for the murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall Danish inventor Peter Madsen has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of the Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his submarine. Madsen had planned to kill Ms Wall, 30, either by suffocating her or cutting her throat, the Copenhagen court heard. Her dismembered remains were found by Danish police at sea on 21 August last year, 11 days after she interviewed him on board his homemade vessel. Madsen, 47, has said he will appeal against the conviction. He was found guilty of premeditated murder and sexual assault after previously admitting to dismembering Ms Wall's body on the submarine and throwing her remains overboard. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far His claim that Ms Wall's death was accidental was dismissed by the court. What really happened? Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Kim Wall: âExceptional journalistâ remembered The case was heard by Copenhagen City Court Judge Anette Burkoe and two jurors. Judge Burkoe said: ""It is the court's assessment that the defendant killed Kim Wall. Peter Madsen and Kim Wall on the submarine Nautilus in Aug 2017 ""We are talking about a cynical and planned sexual assault and brutal murder of a random woman, who in connection with her journalistic work had accepted an offer to go sailing in the defendant's submarine."" She said Madsen had ""failed to give trustworthy explanations"" and had ""shown an interest for the killing and maiming of people and has shown an interest for impaling"". BBC's Jenny Hill, at the court in Copenhagen In the stuffy, crowded press room, everyone exhaled at once as the judge announced her verdict. This case has horrified Denmark - and not just because of the brutality of the crime. Peter Madsen's stunts and projects, after all, had captured the public imagination. But the man people thought they knew as a harmless eccentric turned out to be a calculating and violent killer. Madsen went to extraordinary lengths to evade justice, scuttling his own submarine and changing his story several times. Today he sat, staring ahead, betraying no emotion as the judge told him that she didn't believe that Kim Wall had died accidentally. This was, she insisted, a ""cynically planned murder"". Only Madsen knows exactly what happened on board the Nautilus that night but the details pieced together by investigators suggest a crime so gruesome that even the prosecuting lawyer admitted afterwards that he'd found the case particularly hard to deal with. Ms Wall had been researching a story about Madsen's venture and was last seen on the evening of 10 August as she departed with him on his self-built 40-tonne submarine, UC3 Nautilus, into waters off Copenhagen. Her boyfriend raised the alarm the next day when she did not return from the trip. Madsen was rescued at sea after his submarine sank the same day. Police believe he deliberately scuttled the vessel. Ms Wall's mutilated torso was spotted by a passing cyclist on 21 August but her head, legs and clothing, placed in weighted-down bags, were not discovered by police divers until 6 October. After his arrest, Madsen gave differing accounts of what had happened on board his submarine. During the opening session of his trial last month, prosecutors said there was a suspicion that he had ""psychopathic tendencies"" after investigators discovered films on his computer showing women being tortured and mutilated. Madsen's shifting and unconvincing explanations helped convict him. Initially, he said he had dropped Ms Wall off at about 22:30 the night before she disappeared and had not seen her since. The next day Madsen gave police a new account of events, telling them there had been a ""terrible accident"" on board the self-built submarine. Ms Wall, he said, had been accidentally hit on the head by the submarine's 70kg (150lb) hatch. He had then dumped her body somewhere in Koge Bay, about 50km (30 miles) south of Copenhagen. On 30 October, police said the inventor had changed his story again and told them Ms Wall had died on board of carbon monoxide poisoning while he was up on deck. He also admitted dismembering her body, which he had previously denied. Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen left court saying he was ""satisfied"" After the verdict was announced, Madsen's lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court her client would appeal. He will remain in custody pending the process. Theoretically it means just that, but in reality life-term prisoners do not serve the sentence. Police killer Palle Sorensen, paroled in 1998 after 32 years, and Naum Conevski, jailed in 1984 for killing two young men, are unusual in having served considerably more than the average of about 16 years. Sorensen died earlier this year. Conevski is still in jail. The sentence range for murder starts at five years and runs to life. One study shows the number of life-termers in Danish prisons increased from 10 in 1997 to 25 in 2013,external. The 2015 study said only every fifth or sixth murder convict was serving life. Friends and family describe her as a formidable character and driven journalist. She was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the ""Oxbridge of journalism"". Even within her cohort she was top of the class, winning honours in her year, her classmate and friend Anna Codrea-Rado told the BBC. Ms Wall's close family members were not present in court for the verdict. Kim Wall: What really happened on Peter Madsen's submarine?

"The charges were announced at a news conference in Sacramento California police have arrested a former police officer for a notorious spree of murders, rapes and burglaries in the 1970s and 80s. Sacramento police say they arrested suspect Joseph James DeAngelo, 72. The suspect has been living in the Sacramento area and was identified after new efforts to solve the case, investigators say. Police blame the so-called Golden State Killer for 12 murders, 51 rapes and more than 120 burglaries. Mr DeAngelo is being held on suspicion of four counts of murder - the 1978 deaths of Brian and Katie Maggiore in Sacramento and the 1980 killings of Charlene and Lyman Smith in Ventura County. Prosecutors say additional charges are likely to follow. Police had been monitoring the suspect and used ""discarded DNA"" to match him to the crimes, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. This video can not be played Golden State Killer: 'A staggering crime spree' Announcing the arrest, Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said: ""The answer has always been in Sacramento."" ""The magnitude of this case demanded that it be solved,"" she added. Ventura County District Attorney Greg Totten said that prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty. Two years ago the FBI offered a $50,000 (Â£36,000) reward to anyone who could help crack the case. By James Cook, BBC News Los Angeles correspondent After four decades of frustration for detectives, it turned out the suspect had been living under their noses all along. ""We found the needle in the haystack and it was right here in Sacramento,"" said district attorney Anne Marie Schubert. Joseph James DeAngelo had apparently been living an ordinary life on a quiet suburban street, a former police officer with grown-up children who was ""very surprised"" when he was arrested and taken into custody. Details of his alleged crimes are deeply disturbing and collective psychological scars endure. Many police officers and prosecutors involved in the case vividly recall the terror of the crime spree in their communities. ""Everyone was afraid,"" said FBI special agent Marcus Knutson, who was born and raised in Sacramento, as he announced a fresh appeal for information on the case two years ago. ""We had people sleeping with shotguns, we had people purchasing dogs. People were concerned, and they had a right to be. This guy was terrorising the community. He did horrible things."" According to the Sacramento Bee newspaper, he had been living with his daughter and granddaughter in the city's Citrus Heights neighbourhood. He was fired from the Auburn Police Department in 1979 after he was charged with shoplifting, according to the Auburn Journal. Allow Twitter content?

Police say it was ""very likely"" that he was committing these crimes while employed as a police officer. He had also worked as an officer in Exeter, California from 1973 to 1976, during a time when several crimes were committed there, police say. Jane Carson-Sandler, who was the rapist's fifth victim in October 1976, told the Island Packet newspaper that detectives had emailed her on Wednesday,externalto inform her of the arrest. ""I just found out this morning,"" she said. ""I'm overwhelmed with joy. I've been crying, sobbing."" The case was investigated by author Michelle McNamara for her book I'll Be Gone in the Dark. McNamara died before the book could be published. Her co-author, Billy Jensen, tweeted on Tuesday night to say there would be a ""rather large announcement tomorrow"".

The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker, and the Diamond Knot Killer is believed to have carried out rapes and murders between 1976 and 1986, killing girls and women aged between 12 and 41. Prosecutors say the ""reign of terror"" began in Sacramento and spread to San Francisco and then on to central and southern California. Links between the cases were established by DNA evidence, police say. A police reward poster shows photofit pictures of the suspect The attacker broke into homes at night and then tied up and raped his female victims. Before fleeing he stole items such as cash, jewellery and identification. The last case to be linked to the Golden State Killer was the rape and murder of an 18-year-old woman in Irvine, Orange County, in May 1986. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said the suspect had been called many names but added: ""Today, it's our pleasure to call him 'defendant'.""

"Jeremy Corbyn has rejected claims by close ally Len McCluskey that ""Corbyn-hater"" Labour MPs were using an anti-Semitism row to ""smear"" him. Mr McCluskey said he backed action to stamp out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. But the Unite union leader warned MPs trying to ""re-toxify"" Labour by attacking Mr Corbyn they ""can expect to be held to account"". Mr Corbyn has repeatedly vowed to stamp out anti-Semitism in Labour. Asked if he agreed with Mr McCluskey that there was a smear campaign against him, Mr Corbyn said: ""No, because we have to deal with the issue of anti-Semitism. ""Anti-Semitism is a poison in our society, I am determined to drive it out of our society, including wherever is raises its head in my own party and that's exactly what we are doing."" Appearing on the BBC's Question Time, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott would not be drawn on whether she agreed or disagreed with Mr McCluskey's comments. She said Labour clearly had a problem with anti-Semitism that had not been ""tackled properly"" in the past, but urged people not to treat the issue as ""some party political game"". ""The idea that there is much more anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and none in any other party - that can't be right,"" she said. MPs escort Smeeth to anti-Semitism hearing Labour has been dogged by a series of incidents including criticism last month of Mr Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and the party's suspension of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. Mr Corbyn has apologised for anti-Semitism - prejudice against Jewish people - in his party and said he was ""absolutely committed"" to rooting it out. This video can not be played MPs given standing ovations after anti-Semitism speeches But several Labour MPs have criticised his response, and in a Commons debate last week the leadership was urged to do more to combat the problem within the party. Writingin the New Statesman,external, Mr McCluskey - who has previously dismissed the anti-Semitism row as ""mood music"" - said anti-Semites ""have no place in the party"", called for the party's Chakrabarti report to be implemented in full, and for the case of former London mayor Ken Livingstone - who has been suspended since 2016 - to be ""resolved"". But he criticised ""a few dozen MPs"" who he said ""appear to wake up each morning thinking only: 'How can I undermine Jeremy Corbyn today?'"" Naming MPs including Chris Leslie and Wes Streeting, he accused them of a ""sustained smearing"" of the leader. Mr McCluskey said he did not personally support mandatory re-selection - meaning all MPs would face an open selection battle before an election - but added: ""I look with disgust at the behaviour of the Corbyn-hater MPs who join forces with the most reactionary elements of the media establishment and I understand why there is a growing demand for mandatory reselection."" Members of the Board of Deputies said Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of their suggestions He added: ""To watch as these so-called social democrats tried to demean and attack, in front of our enemy, a decent and honourable man who has fought racism and anti-Semitism all his life and who has breathed life and hope back into the hearts of millions, especially the young, made my stomach churn. To see Tory MPs cheer and applaud them was shameful. ""Promiscuous critics must expect to be criticised, and those who wish to hold Corbyn to account can expect to be held to account themselves."" Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he disagreed with the Unite leader. ""We have got to deal with it robustly and effectively,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Part of that is the disciplinary procedure, which needs to be much quicker and much more effective, but there is also a cultural question. Part of that cultural question is to stop those denying that there is even a problem. That is part of the problem."" Labour's shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, also suggested Mr McCluskey had got it wrong. Speaking on Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, she said: ""I think it is not helpful for people to talk about about it in that way."" One of the MPs singled out by Mr McCluskey, Neil Coyle, accused the union chief of undermining Mr Corbyn's pledge to tackle anti-Semitism. Mr Streeting said he would not be deterred from voicing Jewish constituents' concerns, and Mr Woodcock told Mr McCluskey to focus on protecting Unite members' jobs. Mr McCluskey's intervention comes after Mr Corbyn held what he described as  ""positive and constructive"" talks on Tuesday with the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews. But the groups' leaders took a different view, saying the talks were a ""disappointing, missed opportunity"" and did not agree a minimum plan of action.

"Kollegah and Farid Bang's lyrics have prompted a number of musicians to return their Echo awards Germany's music industry is abolishing its prestigious Echo prize, after an outcry over its award to a rap duo with lyrics denounced as anti-Semitic. German rappers Kollegah and Farid Bang won the hip-hop/urban prize for an album featuring verses comparing their muscles to an Auschwitz survivor. The music industry said it did not want the Echo to be seen as a platform for anti-Semitism. The brand was so badly damaged a completely new start was needed. Germany's Jewish community has faced a wave of attacks and threats in recent months, described by Chancellor Angela Merkel as ""a new phenomenon"" distinct from the old, far-right anti-Semitism. ""We have many refugees among whom there are, for example, people of Arab origin who bring another form of anti-Semitism into the country,"" she said at the weekend. Berlin and several other German cities were holding rallies against anti-Semitism on Wednesday. Those taking part were urged to wear kippahs (Jewish skullcaps) to show their support for the Jewish community. Last week,two young men wearing kippahs were attackedby a man shouting anti-Semitic abuse in Berlin. One rally was called off in the NeukÃ¶lln area of the capital on Wednesday after organisers said they were spat on and called terrorists. An Israeli flag was seized by a passerby. This video can not be played Footage of last week's attack in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin The decision to award Kollegah and Farid Bang the best rap album prize for their album JBG3 (Young, brutal, good looking 3) led to a succession of musicians handing back their Echo awards in protest. One of the tracks on their album, 0815, includes the line: ""My body is more defined than those of Auschwitz inmates."" Another includes the words: ""I'm doing another Holocaust, coming with the Molotov."" Germany's Jews urged not to wear skullcaps German fury at Holocaust memorial remark Germany country profile Berlin-based conductor Daniel Barenboim said he was returning his prizesin protest at the rappers' lyrics which he condemned as ""clearly anti-Semitic, misogynist, homophobic and contemptuous of human dignity"". Rock singer Marius MÃ¼ller-Westernhagen said he would be handing back the seven Echos he had won since the 1990s. Others include pianist Igor Levit and renowned musician and record producer Klaus Voormann, who designed the Beatles' Revolver album cover. Germany's Tageszeitung urged readers to attend Wednesday's rallies with the headline ""Have you got your kippah?"" But the most searing criticism came on the night of the awards when the lead singer of Die Toten Hosen spoke out on stage after winning the rock award. It was one thing to be provocative, but using misogynist, homophobic, far-right or anti-Semitic content was crossing a line, said Campino. Kollegah, a Muslim convert, has apologised for his Auschwitz lyric. He said on the night he did not want to engage in political debate. ""We are here to party"" he said. The duo's record company, BMG, which has sold more than 200,000 copies of the album, said it was utterly opposed to anti-Semitism and pledged to contribute to a campaign against anti-Semitism. The Echo classical and jazz prizes, due to be awarded at the end of May, will also be affected by the German industry's decision to scrap the brand. In its statementthe German music industry association (BVMI) said Germany had the third largest music market in the world,externaland still needed to recognise artists who crossed genres and generations.

They were alerted after the Barbados government raised concerns with the Foreign Office, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said. Labour has urged Home Secretary Amber Rudd to quit over the Windrush saga. Ms Rudd told MPs she ""bitterly"" regretted not recognising the ""systemic"" problem sooner. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged relatives of migrants from Commonwealth Caribbean countries who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants if they could not provide a range of documentation proving they had lived in the UK continuously. Some have been threatened with deportation, lost their jobs or been refused access to medical treatment. Their plight has provoked a storm of criticism for the government, with Prime Minister Theresa May apologising for their treatment. Who are the Windrush generation? Rethink 'cruel' migration policy - Corbyn Windrush cancer patient gets treatment date 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories In April 2016, the then Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond - who is now the chancellor - was told by Caribbean ministers about immigrants facing deportation despite having lived in the UK for most of their lives, and the BBC understands a report about their concerns was passed to the Home Office, which was led at the time by Mrs May. It is not clear at what level the concerns were raised. The government has set up a task force to help those affected formalise their status. So far 3,800 calls have been made to the helpline, of which 1,364 were potentially Windrush cases, MPs were told on Wednesday. This video can not be played Who are the Windrush generation? Ms Rudd told the Commons Home Affairs Committee that she had known about the problem for months and said officials were still checking how many people had been detained over their supposed immigration status. ""I look back with hindsight and I'm surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner,"" she said. ""I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn't see it as more than individual cases that had gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn't see it as a systemic issue until very recently."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg As the Windrush scandal has unfolded it has been said again and again that the Home Office was not aware of the problem as a pattern where one particular group was being scooped up into the immigration system unfairly, on multiple occasions. Yes, individual cases reared their heads, we know they were raised as far back as 2011. But Amber Rudd repeated to MPs again today she wasn't aware of the issue as being ""systemic"", even though she ""bitterly regrets"" not spotting the pattern. Ministers' defence has been: we simply didn't realise, but we know now it was a big mistake. That defence looks a bit shakier tonight. It's not just that some of the government's own work on immigration policy warned in advance of the rules changing that it could hypothetically hit the wrong people. Read more from Laura The Home Office is investigating whether anyone has been wrongly deported. Ms Rudd told the committee that so far 7,000 out of about 8,000 records dating back to 2002 had been checked with no wrongful removals discovered so far. And she rejected suggestions that the Conservatives' goal of reducing net migration below 100,000 had contributed to the problem. ""It's wrong to think the net migration target is the problem here,"" she said. ""The problem here is that people were not properly documented."" Call for Army veteran to get UK passport Advice for the Windrush generation on what to do next Earlier the issue dominated Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urging Mrs May to abandon the government's ""cruel"" immigration policy and abandon ""bogus"" targets. Mrs May rejected claims she was ""ignoring"" the plight of the families of Caribbean migrants who have had their residency rights questioned, repeating the government's promise they and others from Commonwealth nations who came between 1948 and 1973 would now be offered British citizenship free of charge and would be helped in clarifying their status. But she said a distinction should be drawn between those people who had settled in the UK legally and contributed to British life and those with no right to be in the UK.

"Jeremy Corbyn has rejected claims by close ally Len McCluskey that ""Corbyn-hater"" Labour MPs were using an anti-Semitism row to ""smear"" him. Mr McCluskey said he backed action to stamp out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. But the Unite union leader warned MPs trying to ""re-toxify"" Labour by attacking Mr Corbyn they ""can expect to be held to account"". Mr Corbyn has repeatedly vowed to stamp out anti-Semitism in Labour. Asked if he agreed with Mr McCluskey that there was a smear campaign against him, Mr Corbyn said: ""No, because we have to deal with the issue of anti-Semitism. ""Anti-Semitism is a poison in our society, I am determined to drive it out of our society, including wherever is raises its head in my own party and that's exactly what we are doing."" Appearing on the BBC's Question Time, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott would not be drawn on whether she agreed or disagreed with Mr McCluskey's comments. She said Labour clearly had a problem with anti-Semitism that had not been ""tackled properly"" in the past, but urged people not to treat the issue as ""some party political game"". ""The idea that there is much more anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and none in any other party - that can't be right,"" she said. MPs escort Smeeth to anti-Semitism hearing Labour has been dogged by a series of incidents including criticism last month of Mr Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and the party's suspension of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. Mr Corbyn has apologised for anti-Semitism - prejudice against Jewish people - in his party and said he was ""absolutely committed"" to rooting it out. This video can not be played MPs given standing ovations after anti-Semitism speeches But several Labour MPs have criticised his response, and in a Commons debate last week the leadership was urged to do more to combat the problem within the party. Writingin the New Statesman,external, Mr McCluskey - who has previously dismissed the anti-Semitism row as ""mood music"" - said anti-Semites ""have no place in the party"", called for the party's Chakrabarti report to be implemented in full, and for the case of former London mayor Ken Livingstone - who has been suspended since 2016 - to be ""resolved"". But he criticised ""a few dozen MPs"" who he said ""appear to wake up each morning thinking only: 'How can I undermine Jeremy Corbyn today?'"" Naming MPs including Chris Leslie and Wes Streeting, he accused them of a ""sustained smearing"" of the leader. Mr McCluskey said he did not personally support mandatory re-selection - meaning all MPs would face an open selection battle before an election - but added: ""I look with disgust at the behaviour of the Corbyn-hater MPs who join forces with the most reactionary elements of the media establishment and I understand why there is a growing demand for mandatory reselection."" Members of the Board of Deputies said Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of their suggestions He added: ""To watch as these so-called social democrats tried to demean and attack, in front of our enemy, a decent and honourable man who has fought racism and anti-Semitism all his life and who has breathed life and hope back into the hearts of millions, especially the young, made my stomach churn. To see Tory MPs cheer and applaud them was shameful. ""Promiscuous critics must expect to be criticised, and those who wish to hold Corbyn to account can expect to be held to account themselves."" Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he disagreed with the Unite leader. ""We have got to deal with it robustly and effectively,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Part of that is the disciplinary procedure, which needs to be much quicker and much more effective, but there is also a cultural question. Part of that cultural question is to stop those denying that there is even a problem. That is part of the problem."" Labour's shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, also suggested Mr McCluskey had got it wrong. Speaking on Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, she said: ""I think it is not helpful for people to talk about about it in that way."" One of the MPs singled out by Mr McCluskey, Neil Coyle, accused the union chief of undermining Mr Corbyn's pledge to tackle anti-Semitism. Mr Streeting said he would not be deterred from voicing Jewish constituents' concerns, and Mr Woodcock told Mr McCluskey to focus on protecting Unite members' jobs. Mr McCluskey's intervention comes after Mr Corbyn held what he described as  ""positive and constructive"" talks on Tuesday with the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews. But the groups' leaders took a different view, saying the talks were a ""disappointing, missed opportunity"" and did not agree a minimum plan of action.

"The hack could be used to access restricted floors as well as locked rooms Millions of electronic door locks fitted to hotel rooms worldwide have been found to be vulnerable to a hack. Researchers say flaws they found in the equipment's software meant they could create ""master keys"" that opened the rooms without leaving an activity log. The F-Secure team said it had worked with the locks' maker over the past year to create a fix. But the Swedish manufacturer is playing down the risk to those hotels that have yet to install an update.

"Alfie Evans was taken off life support on Monday evening Bosses at the hospital treating seriously ill Alfie Evans have defended staff, as judges rejected a further legal bid to take the toddler abroad. Protesters have been gathered outside Alder Hey in Liverpool amid a court battle over the 23-month-old's care. Over the past fortnight, hospital chair Sir David Henshaw said, staff had endured a ""barrage"" of abuse. Earlier, the Court of Appeal upheld a ruling preventing him from travelling abroad after life support was stopped. His parents Tom Evans and Kate James had mounted a last-ditch attempt to allow Alfie to be transported to Rome for treatment. Lord Justice McFarlane, who led the appeal court panel, said Alfie's parents were trying to take ""one last chance"". But, he said, there was no prospect of the couple's challenge succeeding. In an open letter, Sir David and chief executive Louise Shepherd said staff had been ""deeply affected"" by Alfie's ""desperate"" story. ""We share the heartbreak that occurs when a child cannot be cured and when a child dies,"" they wrote. Who is Alfie Evans and what is the row over his treatment? When are parents denied the final say? World's reaction to Alfie Evans case ""All of us feel deeply for Alfie and his whole family and we continue to do everything we can to support them as best we can, just as we have for the last 17 months"". But, they said, staff had recently been the subject of ""unprecedented personal abuse that has been hard to bear"". The hospital has seen several protests in recent weeks, and police have investigated claims patients and staff were intimidated. Sir David and Ms Shepherd said the previous fortnight had been ""a very difficult time."" ""As an organisation, we have endured attacks upon our motivation, our professionalism and our ethics,"" they said. This video can not be played BBC News went to meet the people calling themselves 'Alfie's Army' They described the requirement for a ""significant police presence"" at the hospital as ""completely unacceptable"". Staff had also received ""a barrage of highly abusive and threatening language and behaviour that has shocked us all"", they said. ""Worse still, patients and visitors to Alder Hey have also reported abuse."" Sir David and Ms Shepherd thanked Merseyside Police for its ""unstinting support"" and said the hospital's first priority remained ""Alfie's comfort, dignity and privacy"". Earlier, Ch Insp Chris Gibson warned social media users the force would act upon reports of malicious communications and threatening behaviour where necessary. Tom Evans and Kate James wanted to move the 23-month-old from Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital to Rome. Lawyers for the couple had urged judges to reconsider the case when Alfie kept breathing despite his life support being removed on Monday. But the Court of Appeal upheld Mr Justice Hayden's earlier High Court ruling. At the hearing in London, three senior judges rejected all of the appeal grounds raised by his parents. Tom Evans and Kate James had hoped Alfie could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome Lawyers for Ms James told the court Alfie was ""struggling"" and in need of ""immediate intervention"". Mr Evans' barrister Paul Diamond said if the court had ruled in the family's favour then Alfie would be taken to Italy straight after the hearing. The couple want to take their son to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Hospital. Mr Diamond told the court a military air ambulance was on standby ""at the request of the Pope"". On Monday, the Italian government granted Alfie citizenship in the hope he would be given an ""immediate transfer"". But hours later, his ventilator was switched off and the order preventing him from travelling abroad was put in place. Alfie, who has a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition, has been in Alder Hey since December 2016.

"Kollegah and Farid Bang's lyrics have prompted a number of musicians to return their Echo awards Germany's music industry is abolishing its prestigious Echo prize, after an outcry over its award to a rap duo with lyrics denounced as anti-Semitic. German rappers Kollegah and Farid Bang won the hip-hop/urban prize for an album featuring verses comparing their muscles to an Auschwitz survivor. The music industry said it did not want the Echo to be seen as a platform for anti-Semitism. The brand was so badly damaged a completely new start was needed. Germany's Jewish community has faced a wave of attacks and threats in recent months, described by Chancellor Angela Merkel as ""a new phenomenon"" distinct from the old, far-right anti-Semitism. ""We have many refugees among whom there are, for example, people of Arab origin who bring another form of anti-Semitism into the country,"" she said at the weekend. Berlin and several other German cities were holding rallies against anti-Semitism on Wednesday. Those taking part were urged to wear kippahs (Jewish skullcaps) to show their support for the Jewish community. Last week,two young men wearing kippahs were attackedby a man shouting anti-Semitic abuse in Berlin. One rally was called off in the NeukÃ¶lln area of the capital on Wednesday after organisers said they were spat on and called terrorists. An Israeli flag was seized by a passerby. This video can not be played Footage of last week's attack in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin The decision to award Kollegah and Farid Bang the best rap album prize for their album JBG3 (Young, brutal, good looking 3) led to a succession of musicians handing back their Echo awards in protest. One of the tracks on their album, 0815, includes the line: ""My body is more defined than those of Auschwitz inmates."" Another includes the words: ""I'm doing another Holocaust, coming with the Molotov."" Germany's Jews urged not to wear skullcaps German fury at Holocaust memorial remark Germany country profile Berlin-based conductor Daniel Barenboim said he was returning his prizesin protest at the rappers' lyrics which he condemned as ""clearly anti-Semitic, misogynist, homophobic and contemptuous of human dignity"". Rock singer Marius MÃ¼ller-Westernhagen said he would be handing back the seven Echos he had won since the 1990s. Others include pianist Igor Levit and renowned musician and record producer Klaus Voormann, who designed the Beatles' Revolver album cover. Germany's Tageszeitung urged readers to attend Wednesday's rallies with the headline ""Have you got your kippah?"" But the most searing criticism came on the night of the awards when the lead singer of Die Toten Hosen spoke out on stage after winning the rock award. It was one thing to be provocative, but using misogynist, homophobic, far-right or anti-Semitic content was crossing a line, said Campino. Kollegah, a Muslim convert, has apologised for his Auschwitz lyric. He said on the night he did not want to engage in political debate. ""We are here to party"" he said. The duo's record company, BMG, which has sold more than 200,000 copies of the album, said it was utterly opposed to anti-Semitism and pledged to contribute to a campaign against anti-Semitism. The Echo classical and jazz prizes, due to be awarded at the end of May, will also be affected by the German industry's decision to scrap the brand. In its statementthe German music industry association (BVMI) said Germany had the third largest music market in the world,externaland still needed to recognise artists who crossed genres and generations.

"This video can not be played Corbyn on Amber Rudd: âIsnât it time she took responsibility and resigned?"" Jeremy Corbyn has called on Theresa May to review her ""cruel"" immigration policy and abandon ""bogus"" targets, in response to the Windrush scandal. He said the PM had been warned a 2014 law aimed at intensifying the ""hostile environment"" for illegal migrants would also affect those in the UK legally. Mrs May said the public wanted action on illegal immigration. She rejected Mr Corbyn's call for Home Secretary Amber Rudd to quit in clashes at Prime Minister's Questions. Home Affairs committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper also claimed that Commonwealth High Commissioners had warned the Foreign Office about Windrush case problems back in 2016. The BBC understands that the Home Office and No 10 were both told about the problem after the issue was raised in a letter to the Foreign Office sent by the Barbados government. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Corbyn: PM 'ignored Windrush warnings' Windrush cancer patient gets treatment date The Windrush generation - which includes anyone who moved to the UK from a Commonwealth Caribbean country between the 1940s and 1970s - are in the UK legally but some have been threatened with deportation if they did not have paperwork to prove it. The government has set up a task force to help them formalise their status. Clashing over the row in their weekly Prime Minister's Questions Commons session, Mr Corbyn said Mrs May, when she was home secretary, had been warned by ministers and officials that the 2014 Immigration Act - which required migrants to show paperwork to access services such as healthcare and housing - would have dangerous repercussions. ""These policies swept up British citizens and legal migrants causing them immense suffering, as she was warned,"" he told MPs. The PM said the public supported action to deter illegal migrants ""Can the PM send a clear message and tell us the hostile environment is over and that her bogus immigration targets that have driven this will be scrapped?"" He called for the 2014 Act and other related legislation - including curbs on legal aid - to be reviewed. Urging the home secretary to quit, Mr Corbyn said Ms Rudd had ""inherited a cruel policy"" when she succeeded Mrs May in 2016 and had made it even tougher. Mrs May rejected claims she was ""ignoring"" the plight of the families of Caribbean migrants who have had their residency rights questioned, repeating the government's promise they and others from Commonwealth nations who came between 1948 and 1973 would now be offered British citizenship free of charge and would be helped in clarifying their status. But she said a distinction should be drawn between those people who had settled in the UK legally and contributed to British life and those with no right to be in the UK. Mr Johnson first floated the idea of an amnesty when he was mayor of London. ""The Windrush generation are here legally but there are people who are in this country illegally,"" she said. ""What the leader of the opposition is talking about is illegal immigration and what people up and down the country will tell him is that we should deal with illegal immigration."" She cited a number of former shadow ministers, including Yvette Cooper, whom she said had backed action on illegal immigration but Ms Cooper, now Home Affairs committee chair, told the PM not to ""hide"" behind her but rather accept responsibility for government failings. ""Do not try to hide behind civil servants when she set the policies instilled in them under a culture of disbelief and when the High Commissioners told us this morning that they had warned the Foreign Office about the Windrush generation immigration problems in 2016,"" Ms Cooper told MPs.

During the PM questions session, Labour MP David Lammy said he had raised a Windrush case with then Home Office minister Damian Green in 2011 and said that seven years on the man, who came to the UK at the age of six in 1959, had still not had his status confirmed. The Prime Minister's Questions clashes came amid evidence of tensions within the government over policy - the BBC understands that at a recent cabinet meeting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urged Theresa May to introduce an amnesty for illegal migrants in the wake of the Windrush scandal. The foreign secretary was understood to have urged the prime minister to consider a ""broader"" amnesty for those migrants who may have been in the UK illegally but who have nevertheless played a ""constructive"" role in society. He suggested these would be illegal migrants who had been in the UK for between 10 and 15 years but had ""an impeccable record"", which would mean they had paid their taxes and did not have any criminal convictions.

He added that data scanned from any discarded VingCard could be used to mount the attack, even if the card's access privileges had long expired or had been used to open a garage or other parts of the targeted hotel rather than a bedroom. The hack can also be applied to access other areas of a hotel - including sending a lift to a VIP floor of a property - if it is protected by the same system.

"Amazon has released coloured versions of its Echo Dot speaker to accompany the new features Amazon's smart assistant Alexa can now be made to encourage children to say: ""Please,"" and: ""Thank you,"" when issuing it voice commands. The new function addresses some parents' concerns that use of the technology was teaching their offspring to sound officious or even rude. In addition, parents can now set time limits on when requests are responded to, and can block some services. The move has been welcomed by one of Alexa's critics. In January, the research company ChildWise published a report warning that youngsters that grew up accustomed to barking orders at Alexa, Google Assistant or some other virtual personality might become aggressive in later dealings with humans. ""This is a very positive development,"" research director Simon Leggett told the BBC. ""We had noticed that practically none of the children that we had talked to said they ever used the words 'please' or 'thank you' when talking to their devices. ""Younger children will enjoy having the added interactivity, but older children may be less likely to use it as they will be more aware it's a robot at the other end."" For now,the new facilities have been announced,externalonly in the US, where they will become available on 9 May via a software update. The politeness feature - which has been branded Magic Word - encourages children to say: ""Please,"" and: ""Thank you,"" by acknowledging use of the terms. So, for example, if the child asks: ""What will the weather be today please?"" Alexa will add to its response: ""Thanks for asking so nicely."" Likewise, once Alexa has completed a task, if the child says: ""Thank you,"" it will prompt one of several follow-ups, including ""No worries,"" and ""You're welcome."" Toymaker Mattel had previously considered going further, with its aborted smart-speaker, Aristotle. In 2017, it hadproposed a machine that would complete tasks,externalonly if the word ""please"" were included. Amazon, however, said it had been advised that this approach would backfire. ""We talked to third-party child development experts as we were building this feature,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""They said that if you are going to try and offer them guidance, then positive reinforcement is the best way to do that as it's not punitive. ""They had found that saying, 'You will not get this if you do not say please,' is not useful with kids and doesn't work."" Amazon patents 'voice-sniffing' algorithms Amazon Echo trial to help elderly and disabled people Amazon's race to make Alexa smarter She added that Amazon intended to see how parents and children reacted to the feature, and if it was welcomed would probably extend its capabilities. The good manners facility is part of a host of new child-centric tools unveiled for Alexa - some of which will require a subscription fee. A new Disney Stories skill and ad-free Disney Radio station are two of the features included with a premium FreeTime subscription The basic ""free"" FreeTime package includes the abilities to: set bedtime hours during which it will not accept commands switch off certain services, such as voice-purchasing or listening to news bulletins block songs with explicit lyrics A $2.99 (Â£2.15) monthly fee unlocks added functions, including: wake-up alarms featuring well-known cartoon characters access to several hundred child-focused audio books exclusive use of premium software - known as skills - from brands including Disney and National Geographic This offers a way for the company to make money from its Echo smart-speakers, which it sells for roughly the same price they cost to develop and manufacture. In addition, Alexa's voice-recognition software has been tweaked to account for the fact children have higher-pitched voices than adults, and will soon respond to ""Awexa"" to help those that cannot yet pronounce the letter L. ""It is commendable that Amazon is trying to get kids to say their please and thank yous, but for most parents it will be the content controls and other kid-centric features that will be the most appealing aspect of the new offering,"" said Ben Wood, a technology consultant at CCS Insight.

"Hank Azaria has also appeared in Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Hank Azaria says he is ""willing to step aside"" from his role voicing Simpsons character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. It follows a documentary made by Indian-American comic Hari Kondabolu that argued the Indian character is based on racial stereotypes. Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the actor said his ""eyes have been opened"" by the debate and that he never intended to cause offence. He also distanced himself fromthe show's controversial response. Shopkeeper Apu has been part of the long-running animation series since 1990, with Azaria adopting an Indian accent to voice him. The character is one of several voiced on The Simpsons by Azaria - he is also the voice of Chief Wiggum, Comic Book Guy and bartender Moe Szyslak. There has been a focus on the portrayal of Apu since Kondabolu's 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu. The director toldthe BBC last yearthat the character was problematic because he is defined by his job and how many children he has in his arranged marriage. Apu has been seen on The Simpsons since 1990 He added Apu was one of the only representations of South Asians on US television when he was growing up and that other children imitated the character to mock him. Azaria told Colbert: ""The idea that anyone young or old, past or present, being bullied based on Apu really makes me sad. ""It certainly was not my intention. I wanted to bring joy and laughter to people."" Simpsons addresses Apu stereotype criticism Word created by The Simpsons added to dictionary Simpsons predictions that could still come true When asked about the future of the character, Azaria said he was open to change and called for the South Asian community to be better represented in the industry. ""I've given this a lot of thought, and as I say my eyes have been opened,"" he said. ""I think the most important thing is to listen to Indian people and their experience with it. ""I really want to see Indian, South Asian writers in the writers roomâ¦ including how [Apu] is voiced or not voiced. ""I'm perfectly willing and happy to step aside, or help transition it into something new. ""It not only makes sense, it just feels like the right thing to do to me."" Following the interview, Mr Kondabolu took to Twitter to thank Azaria for his words. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Kim Wall was last seen in the conning tower of Peter Madsen's submarine on the evening of 10 August Kim Wall was an established, freelance journalist who had travelled the world from her home in Sweden. She had been chasing an interview with Danish inventor Peter Madsen for several months and had little hesitation in taking up his invitation for a trip on his homemade submarine off Copenhagen on a sunny evening last summer. It was 19:00 on 10 August when she boarded the UC3 Nautilus and in the final photos taken from a passing ship some 90 minutes later she was smiling and looked relaxed in the sub's conning tower. She was about to move to Beijing in China with her Danish partner, Ole, and this was to be her final story before leaving. The 40-tonne submarine that the inventor had built in 2008 was, after all, not far from Ole's flat in Refshaleoen, a harbour area of the capital. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far Peter Madsen was a ""semi-celebrity"" in Denmark. And it was not his submarine that Ms Wall was interested in, but his ambition to build a rocket to launch into space. Kim Wall, 30, had previously reported from North Korea, the South Pacific, Uganda and Haiti, writing for the New York Times, the Guardian, Vice and the South China Morning Post. This would be a relatively straightforward piece, even if it did mean missing the couple's going-away party. ""I'm still alive btw,"" she texted her partner. ""But I'm going down now. I love you! He brought coffee and cookies tho."" It was the last message she sent from the vessel. Ole repeatedly texted back and raised the alarm after midnight. Her mutilated torso was discovered on a beach by a passing cyclist on 21 August. Her head, legs and clothing were found by police divers on 6 October. What happened that night in the Oresund strait between Denmark and Sweden became an international cause celebre, with Peter Madsen ultimately going on trial and being convicted of premeditated murder and aggravated sexual assault. Although his sub was sighted by a merchant ship to the north-west of the Oresund bridge at about midnight, it had no satellite tracking and authorities were unable to contact Peter Madsen until the morning. Who is DIY submariner and killer Peter Madsen? Kim Wall: An âexceptionalâ journalist remembered It was finally spotted from a lighthouse at 10:30 on 11 August. A rescue helicopter radioed Madsen and then looked on as the submarine sank within 30 seconds. Madsen was pulled to safety by four people out fishing and taken to the port of Dragor, where he was met by a group of reporters and described the final moments of the sub, blaming its sinking on the ballast tank. Police would later say ""the sinking of the submarine was allegedly a consequence of a deliberate act"". There was no sign of Kim Wall. It took almost a fortnight for the journalist's death to be confirmed. Police said a torso found by a cyclist on the shore of Klydesoen to the south of Copenhagen was hers and that her arms, legs and head had been ""removed as a result of deliberate cutting"". Several weeks later, police divers found the rest of her remains about 1km (0.6 miles) from where her torso had been discovered, in Koge Bay. Police said they were in bags that had been weighed down with car pipes and metal pieces. It was on 11 August that Peter Madsen gave his first of three versions of what happened to her. It was these shifting and unconvincing explanations that helped convict him. This video can not be played Mr Madsen was filmed by a Danish TV crew as he was escorted by police after his rescue Madsen said he had dropped her off at about 22:30 the night before near the Halvandet restaurant on the northern tip of Refshaleoen and had not seen her since. Restaurant owner Bo Petersen said the area was well covered by CCTV and he handed the video footage to police. After a judicial hearing on 12 August, police revealed Peter Madsen had given them a new account of events, which finally emerged on 21 August. Madsen had told them there had been a ""terrible accident"" on board. Ms Wall had been accidentally hit on the head by the submarine's 70kg (150lb) hatch. He had then dumped her body somewhere in Koge Bay, about 50km (30 miles) south of Copenhagen. Ms Wall's blood was found in the submarine Peter Madsen has been in police custody ever since 12 August. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark said at the time that her client was relieved to have been able to shed more light on what had happened but it was not an admission of wrongdoing. Danish inventor 'had decapitation videos' Then, on 30 October, police said the inventor had changed his story and told them she died on board of carbon monoxide poisoning while he was up on deck. He also admitted dismembering her body, which he had previously denied. This was similar to the account he gave his trial in March 2018. The air pressure on board the submarine had suddenly plummeted while he was on the deck, he explained, and Kim Wall was in the engine room. The sub had filled with exhaust fumes and he had been unable to get back in. ""When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,"" he said. After trying for almost an hour to push her body out of the submarine, he said he mutilated her. Peter Madsen, drawn here in a court sketch, has maintained that Kim Wall died in an accident on board the submarine Peter Madsen always denied murder and aggravated sexual assault, but admitted dismembering Kim Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. He told his trial he had hidden the truth out of respect for the victim's family. Inventor admits dismembering Kim Wall Prosecutors rejected Peter Madsen's account, describing it as a lie aimed at saving his skin. His defence lawyer argued their story was not backed up by real evidence. This is the last known picture of the sub taken before Kim Wall's disappearance at 20:30 on 10 August The prosecution painted a picture of a man who enjoyed watching videos of women being killed or tortured which were found on his workshop computer. Peter Madsen had watched a beheading video shortly before he had taken Kim Wall out in the submarine, they said. It had been found by police on a back-up profile of his iPhone. During the trial, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said it was unclear how Kim Wall had died, but it was clearly intentional and with a sexual motive. Madsen had already asked other women to join him on the sub that week but no-one else had come, it was said. The prosecution argued that a screwdriver, a saw, and metal piping were taken on board the submarine by Madsen for the first time on 10 August as part of a premeditated murder plan to stab his victim, mutilate her and then dispose of her body. A scientist from the Danish Technological Institute told the court that Peter Madsen's argument that Kim Wall died of exhaust fumes was possible, but only if the temperature on board had risen very high. A police witness told the court there had been no sign of exhaust fumes. Madsen was given a life sentence and told by the judge that Kim Wall's murder was cynical and planned.

"This video can not be played Madsen was filmed by a Danish TV crew escorted by police after his rescue Peter Madsen was once a kind of celebrity in Denmark and many seemed fascinated by the self-taught engineer who talked with enthusiasm about ocean exploration and space travel. The ""inventrepreneur"", as he described himself, was no stranger to being the focus of attention, with his life frequently featured in television and magazine reports. This media coverage helped build the image of a man who said his work was to ""challenge the ordinary"". His own crowd-funded submarine, the UC3 Nautilus - claimed by him to be the world's biggest privately-built submarine - catapulted Madsen to fame, and its 2008 launch in Copenhagen was the subject of much fanfare. That submarine is now a crime scene, and the once-feted Madsen is now in disgrace, convicted of murder and facing life in jail. He was arrested last August, in connection with the gruesome killing of Kim Wall, a respected 30-year-old freelance journalist whose body was found dismembered after she boarded the Nautilus to interview him. Born in 1971, Peter Madsen was six years old when his parents divorced. He went to live with his father - a man more than 30 years older than his mother who he described as authoritarian and violent. It was his father, however, that shared with him a fascination for wars and rockets. Madsen would devote his next decades to these interests. Kim Wall, seen on the Nautilus before her death He started studying engineering but reportedly abandoned the subject after he thought he had learned enough to build submarines and rockets. Friends described him to journalists as an eccentric person, who did not enjoy being contradicted and was uncompromising. His brother said he was ""his own greatest enemy"",externalwhile his wife, who reportedly divorced him earlier this year, has not talked to the media. Journalist Thomas Djursing, who in 2014 wrote a biography about Mr Madsen,told the Jyllands-Posten newspaper:,external""He is angry with God and everyone... He has a hard time getting along with other people - he has lofty ambitions and wants to do everything his way."" While building a submarine might seem challenging enough, after completing the 17m-long (56ft) Nautilus he moved on to a more lofty ambition: space exploration. An 'exceptional' journalist remembered What we know about macabre case He partnered with the architect Kristian von Bengtson, a former Nasa contractor, to form Copenhagen Suborbitals, a collective of amateur rocket-makers funded by donations and working with the aim of launching a manned rocket into space. But their co-operation fell apart in 2014 due to disagreements, blamed largely on Peter Madsen's behaviour. He went on to create Rocket Madsens Space Laboratory, competing with his former partners. ""My passion is finding ways to travel to worlds beyond the well-known,"" he wrote on the organisation's website. In 2015, after another dispute, this time with the group of volunteers maintaining the Nautilus, Peter Madsen said: ""You may think that a curse is lying on the Nautilus. That curse is me,""according to a statement on the website (in Danish).,external He added: ""There will not be peace on Nautilus for as long as I exist."" After months spent chasing Peter Madsen, Kim Wall took up his invitation for a trip on the Nautilus on 10 August 2017. She was never seen again, and her mutilated torso was discovered on a beach by a passing cyclist on 21 August. Her head, legs and clothing were found by police divers on 6 Octoberin bags weighed down with pieces of metal. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far Peter Madsen was rescued the morning after the trip as his vessel was sinking, and has, since then, given three versions of what happened. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. Then he said the submarine's 70kg (150lb) hatch fell on Ms Wall's head after a ""terrible accident"" on board, and that he dumped her body somewhere in Koge Bay, about 50km (30 miles) south of Copenhagen. Finally, he told police that the journalist had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He had initially denied cutting up her body but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. But he denied killing her. Court drawing shows Peter Madsen (L) on the first day of the trial in Copenhagen Madsen now faces a life sentence in jail, seen as unusual under the Danish criminal justice system. During the opening session of his trial last month, prosecutors said there was a suspicion that he had ""psychopathic tendencies"". Films found on his computer showed women being tortured and mutilated, they added, trying to make the case that the murder was premeditated. His defence, however, argued that there is no physical evidence against him.

"This video can not be played Five times Macron ripped up Trump agenda French President Emmanuel Macron has used his speech to the joint houses of the US Congress to denounce nationalism and isolationism. Mr Macron said such policies were a threat to global prosperity. The speech was widely interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on President Donald Trump's America First agenda. Mr Macron also raised differences on global trade, Iran and the environment, seemingly in contrast to the warm bonhomie of his visit so far. The French president was given a three-minute standing ovation as he took his place in the chamber for his speech.

Analysis by BBC North America editor Jon Sopel Macron has provided a masterclass to other world leaders on how to handle Donald Trump - you cuddle up close, you flatter where necessary - but you use that to allow you to pack a big punch. He also spoke about the very special relationship between France and the US, a move that might have had some in Downing Street choking on their tea. In a cleverly crafted speech, he started with the entente between himself and the US president that some said was just too cordial. But then came the punches - and they were hard-hitting jabs, taking direct aim at Donald Trump's policy agenda. On free trade, on the importance of science, on inequality - and Mr Trump's America First policies. Then he audaciously borrowed Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan to talk about the environment, and the importance of the climate change agreement the US has said it will withdraw from. He said it was time to make the Earth great again. The speech was punctuated by applause and cheering. This was an important moment in the US Congress. Emmanuel Macron has emerged as a world leader who offers a competing and sharply different world vision to the US president - while all the time maintaining a bonhomie with him. That's quite a political feat. On trade, Mr Macron said that ""commercial war is not the proper answer"", as it would ""destroy jobs and increase prices"", adding: ""We should negotiate through the World Trade Organization. We wrote these rules, we should follow them."" Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Mr Trump has in the past said that trade wars are good and easily won. He has taken on Europe and China with new tariffs, saying the US has suffered from unfair trade practices. This video can not be played Melania's big role during Macron visit On another issue of difference, Iran, Mr Macron said his country would not abandon a nuclear deal with Tehran that was agreed by world powers when President Barack Obama was in office but which Mr Trump has branded ""terrible"". Mr Macron said: ""This agreement may not address all concerns, and very important concerns. This is true. But we should not abandon it without having something more substantial instead."" Is the Iran nuclear deal about to collapse? What's in the Iran nuclear deal? But he added: ""Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. Not now. Not in five years. Not in 10 years. Never."" On the environment, he said by ""polluting the oceans, not mitigating CO2 emissions and destroying biodiversity we are killing our planet. Let us face it, there is no Planet B"". Donald Trump last year announced that he intended to withdraw the US from the Paris global climate accord, another landmark Obama achievement, saying it was a ""very bad deal for the US"". The accord, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to cut damaging emissions. What's in the Paris climate deal? Mr Macron's wide-ranging address highlighted numerous political and cultural links, citing American Revolutionary War officer Marquis de Lafayette, writer and feminist Simone de Beauvoir, Abraham Lincoln, author Ernest Hemingway, the founder of French romanticism FranÃ§ois-RenÃ© Chateaubriand and both Presidents Roosevelt. This video can not be played Macron on the environment: ""There is no Planet B"" His quoting of Franklin D's ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" drew one of his biggest applauses. Senior House Democrat Adam Schiff said Mr Macron had offered ""more of a direct contradiction of the president than I was expecting"", telling AFP: ""There were more than a few uncomfortable moments on the [Republican] side of the aisle."" Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte visited the Library of Congress Republican Senator Jeff Flake said the speech was ""very contrary to Trumpism, very much contrary to an America First agenda"". But Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy denied there was any rebuke. ""He said in there that he believes in free and fair trade. That's exactly what the president asked for,"" he said.

"Quyen Ngoc Nguyen had lived in the UK since 2010 Two killers who went on to torture and set fire to a Vietnamese woman have been given whole-life jail terms. Quyen Ngoc Nguyen's body was discovered in a burning car in Shiney Row, near Sunderland, in August 2017. Stephen Unwin, 40, of Houghton-le-Spring, was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court of her rape and murder. William McFall, 51, who is from Northern Ireland but lived in Blackpool, was found guilty of murder but cleared of rape. The pair first met in jail while serving life terms for separate murders and made contact again after being released. During their trial, the jury was told they held nail technician Ms Nguyen captive and tortured her into revealing her bank card PINs after luring her to Unwin's home. Burning car killer 'beyond rehabilitation' Shiney Row burning car death accused had 'killed before' A Home Office pathologist said he could not say ""with certainty"" whether the 28-year-old mother of two was alive when they put her in the car, but the fire was the ""most likely the cause of death"". Stephen Unwin (left) and William McFall were described as ""evil"" by their victim's sister Mr Justice Morris described Unwin as a ""calculating, manipulating and ruthless killer"" and branded McFall ""an extremely violent man capable of monstrous behaviour"". Explaining his decision to sentence them to whole-life terms, he said they had murdered Ms Nguyen in a ""cold-blooded and callous manner"" having deliberately lulled her ""into a trap"". He added: ""She suffered an unimaginable ordeal. ""Both during and after that ordeal, the two of you casually went about your everyday task, chillingly devoid of human empathy."" The court heard the pair ate curry as Ms Nguyen lay injured and motionless on the floor before they dumped her in the burning car by allotments. The pair took Â£1,000 from her bank accounts. Ms Nguyen had arrived in the UK in 2010 from Vietnam to help her sister Quynh run a nail salon in Gateshead and the pair lived together in Killingworth, North Tyneside. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Quynh said: ""She did not deserve to die in this horrific manner. ""They did not act like human beings. They are evil."" CCTV showed Unwin at a Co-op store with Miss Nguyen's bank card Unwin had been released on licence in December 2012 having battered a pensioner to death during a break-in on Christmas Day 1998 in Houghton-le-Spring. The fire he started to cover his tracks meant the victim could only be identified by his medical records. McFall was released on licence in October 2010 after killing a pensioner with a hammer when she disturbed him breaking into her home in Greenisland, Northern Ireland, in May 1996.

"This video can not be played The video published by OK Diario shows Ms Cifuentes with a supermarket security guard The head of Spain's Madrid region has stepped down amid shoplifting allegations, weeks after being accused of faking a master's degree. Cristina Cifuentes condemned as a personal attack the publication of a video from 2011 showing her handing items to a supermarket security guard. It is claimed she had taken two pots of anti-ageing cream worth â¬40 (Â£35; $50). Ms Cifuentes, 53, gave up her master's last week when it emerged that two signatures on the document were forged. A prominent figure in Spain's ruling centre-right PP (Partido Popular), Ms Cifuentes had already come under pressure from political opponents to resign because of the degree affair. She told a press conference on Wednesday that she had planned to announce her resignation next week but had brought it forward in response to the latest allegations. Her resignation is a blow to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose party has faced a succession of corruption scandals. By stepping down she averted a motion of no confidence which she said would have brought Madrid under the control of the left-wing socialist and Podemos parties. Uni official suspended over fake degrees Mariano Rajoy: The patient man of Spanish politics Mr Rajoy said the president of Madrid's regional government had done the right thing in stepping down. Cristina Cifuentes has come under pressure to step down from her political opponents Ms Cifuentes condemned the video that appeared on the OK Diario website on Wednesday as part of a ""campaign of harassment aimed at bringing me down"". At the time the video was recorded, she was number two in the Madrid assembly. However, she went on to admit the recording was genuine. ""It was an involuntary mistake and it's being used to go beyond political issues, it's personal,"" she said. ""I was already the target of blackmail two years ago for that video, but this time I tell you a red line has been crossed."" The erupting scandal surrounding Ms Cifuentes has also hit King Juan Carlos University, from which she received the fake master's degree. The head of its law institute has been suspended after initially supporting the Madrid region's president. The institute's deputy director earlier had resigned in protest at her signature being forged. The region of Madrid is home to 6.5m people and Spain's capital city.

"This video can not be played Rose McGowan tells the Victoria Derbyshire show Harvey Weinstein has tried to contact her Actress Rose McGowan has told the BBC Harvey Weinstein has tried to contact her since she went public with her allegations that he raped her. She said she had received ""texts, things like that"", adding: ""I've got no idea how he got my number."" Ms McGowan also said the alleged assault by Mr Weinstein had been ""worse than I wrote about"". She is one of several women to accuse Mr Weinstein of rape. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. When asked whether she had been approached directly by the Hollywood producer, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Texts, things like that - I've got no idea how he got my number, but he also had former [Israeli intelligence agency] Mossad agents involved in my life so getting my personal phone number wasn't that hard."" How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers When asked how recently there had been contact, she replied: ""A month ago - somebody that worked with him, represented him, I don't know, on his behalf - I shook, it was like a bullet once again. ""It was basically just kind of this person is reaching out. And I don't even understand what the point was. I can't understand to what end. The cat's out of the bag."" Mr Weinstein, through a spokeswoman, says he âunequivocally denies allegations of non-consensual sex"". Asked what the purpose of the message had been, she said it had been suggesting that Mr Weinstein had wanted to get in touch or to talk to her. She said: ""It could have been some random person, but that would be a long shot."" Ms McGowan also said the response had been ""nothing short of cataclysmic"" since she had become one of the most prominent figures in the #MeToo movement after sharing her allegations. ""In some ways I feel it's an honour to almost be a receptacle for so many people's pain and voices, people who want to identify and reach out and say, 'Me too,'"" she said. ""I had hoped that by showing people that if you can cut off the head of power, that you can achieve an awful lot."" Ms McGowan claims she was raped by Mr Weinstein in a hotel room during a business meeting at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. She told Victoria Derbyshire: ""The reality of what happened in that hotel room is even worse than I wrote about [in her book]. I just thought, 'This is enough to really get my point across.' ""There's a strange thing that happens with becoming a survivor, that you feel like you are almost trapped in this weird relationship with this person that you can't get away from. ""It shocks me that I was touched by this person, and so many, I was just a thing to be eaten."" She added the alleged incident ""did a lot of damage, it still does"" as his name and face was everywhere. ""There's something really strange about having this abstract envy over a victim who doesn't need to see her perpetrator again,"" she said. Mr Weinstein's representatives have been contacted for a response to Ms McGowan's claims he has tried to contact her. In relation to her rape allegations, they said: ""Mr Weinstein has vigorously denied Ms McGowan's claims and an investigation of those claims and of Ms McGowan suggests in our judgment, that she has taken a consensual act of intimacy between her and Mr Weinstein and falsely attempted to turn it into an act of sexual assault."" On claims that Ms McGowan had been spied on by an intelligence agency made up of former Mossad spies called Black Cube, the company said it applied high moral standards to its work and operated in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

""It was an involuntary mistake and it's being used to go beyond political issues, it's personal,"" she said. ""I was already the target of blackmail two years ago for that video, but this time I tell you a red line has been crossed."" The erupting scandal surrounding Ms Cifuentes has also hit King Juan Carlos University, from which she received the fake master's degree. The head of its law institute has been suspended after initially supporting the Madrid region's president. The institute's deputy director earlier had resigned in protest at her signature being forged. The region of Madrid is home to 6.5m people and Spain's capital city.

"The BBC's director of news and current affairs has said there were ""strong reasons"" to name Sir Cliff Richard during a police inquiry into him. Fran Unsworth told the High Court that while the story would cause ""distress"" to Sir Cliff, it was ""in the public interest."" Sir Cliff is suing the BBC for naming him and broadcasting helicopter footage of police searching his home in 2014. He says broadcasting the images was a ""very serious invasion"" of privacy. Sir Cliff, 77, who denied an historic sexual assault allegation, was not arrested or charged as the result of the South Yorkshire Police investigation. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Ms Unsworth - who was then deputy director of BBC News -  told Mr Justice Mann: ""I was aware it would cause serious distress to Sir Cliff, but I had to weigh up the public interest consideration."" Sir Cliff's barrister, Justin Rushbrooke QC, asked about the consideration of the ""indelible stain"" such an allegation would leave on Sir Cliff's character. ""It certainly occurred (to me) this was a fairly momentous thing we were doing with a high profile person concerned, but there were strong reasons the BBC should do this,"" Ms Unsworth replied. She added that there were ""strong public interest arguments"" in naming suspects who were part of a police investigation. She told the court that defamation was the ""most significant legal issue"". ""We were concerned about privacy impact, but I thought that was an editorial matter as opposed to a legal matter,"" she added. Fran Unsworth was deputy director of BBC news at the time of the coverage Asked whether helicopter footage showing the inside of Sir Cliff's home was intrusive, Ms Unsworth said that Sir Cliff was not in the property and that ""shots were of policemen and quite blurred"". Ms Unsworth did not accept it was disproportionately intrusive, adding: ""It would be impossible to broadcast it without it being an enormous story. "" She did, however, say use of live footage ""was a mistake"". She told Judge Mann the justification of using a helicopter was ""the inability to record it pictorially effectively any other way"". Ms Unsworth said it was the first time the BBC had named an individual before arrest in connection with a minor. ""We understood he would have been arrested if at the property,"" she added. Questioned on the BBC's decision to report the investigation, Ms Unsworth said: ""We had firm information given to us by South Yorkshire Police... ""My instincts tell me that had it emerged that the BBC had chosen to ignore that story in full knowledge of it, the public audiences would have had questions about our role... it would have looked potentially as though we were not covering this story because Sir Cliff was a high profile individual."" She added: ""I thought it surprising South Yorkshire Police had given this level of access and I thought that was worth showing the public."" Ms Unsworth said the BBC did receive criticism for naming Sir Cliff after the coverage. Judge Mann also heard from another witness, Joanne Beattie, a former press officer for South Yorkshire Police. She confirmed she rang BBC News reporter Dan Johnson the day before the search, to tell him it was being carried out the following morning in Berkshire. Sir Cliff has saidthe coverage ""smeared"" his name. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations and says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. In 2014 South Yorkshire Police searched Sir Cliff's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire while investigating an allegation the singer sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. In June 2016 it was announced he would not face any charges. South Yorkshire Police has settled its own case with Sir Cliff by paying him Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". The case continues on Thursday.

"(L-R) Crew members James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin all died The director of a yacht management company has been cleared of the manslaughter of four men who died when their vessel capsized in the Atlantic. The crew of the Cheeki Rafiki died after the 40ft vessel lost its keel and capsized more than 700 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia in May 2014. Douglas Innes, 43, was cleared of four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence following a retrial at Winchester Crown Court. The crew's bodies were never found. The four men on board - skipper Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, James Male, 22, from Romsey in Hampshire, Steve Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Paul Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset - were travelling back to the UK when the vessel lost its keel. Mr Innes shut his eyes and silently mouthed the words ""thank you"" to the jury when the first not guilty verdict was read out. The director and his company Stormforce Coaching Limited will be sentenced on 11 Mayafter being convicted at the first trial of failing to operate the yacht in a safe mannercontrary to the Merchant Shipping Act. Douglas Innes, who ran Stormforce Coaching, was cleared of four counts of manslaughter The court had been told an ""urgent email"" had been sent by the crew warning Mr Innes their yacht on the boat - named after a character in the Lion King - was taking on water in bad weather. He replied advising the sailors to make sure the life raft was ready and later phoned the UK Coastguard, but the prosecution had argued he had not shown any urgency. The yacht was found overturned and empty on 17 May, two days after the email was sent, with its life raft still on board. But Mr Innes told the court there had been regular inspections and no evidence of keel damage. He said the yacht was taken out of the water for nearly five months in 2013 for the hull to be repainted. ""If the boat is out of the water for that period of time, I would have inspected it myself as well,"" he told the jury. Mr Innes also said he only became aware of the extent of damage caused by two previous groundings after the prosecution was launched. The overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki after it was discovered by a US Navy warship The Marine Accident Investigation Branch concluded that previous groundings and repairs might have caused weakening at the point where the keel was attached to the hull, causing it to fall off. It said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency had undertaken to work with the Royal Yachting Association and the marine industry to clarify safety and maintenance requirements. A note from the jury read out in court said it was ""deeply concerned"" about a maritime regulation guidance note and hoped it would be reviewed and tightened to help improve safety. The Cheeki Rafiki had been on its way to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week The US Coastguard's decision to ends its search and rescue operationafter two days resulted in criticism from the sailors' families. It resumed after an intervention by the British government, and the upturned yacht was discovered in the Atlantic Ocean about 1,000 miles (1,609km) east of Cape Cod in Massachusetts with its cabin completely flooded and its windows shattered. The boat was found without any sign of the missing men, and underwater photographs showed the life raft stowed in place.

"Sean Cox suffered a head injury A man left in a critical condition after he was attacked before Liverpool's Champions League semi-final against Roma has been named. Sean Cox, 53, of Dunboyne, County Meath in the Irish Republic is in hospital with a head injury. Liverpool FC said it was ""shocked and appalled"" by the incident. Two men from Rome, aged 20 and 29, have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Seven others are being held for various offences at Tuesday's match. The attack happened outside The Albert pub in Walton Breck Road, next to Anfield stadium, shortly before kick-off. Mr Cox has been described as a ""long-serving"" and ""popular"" member of the St Peter's Gaelic football club in Dunboyne. This video can not be played Rival Liverpool and Roma fans clashed just before the kick-off outside Anfield Club chairman Fergus McNulty said: ""We hope Sean is receiving all of the medical care he requires and that he makes a full and speedy recovery. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Sean and his family, and we hope that they get the privacy and space they need."" Liverpool footballer Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 24, also sent a message of support to Mr Cox and his family. Tweeting,externalabout the knee injury he sustained during Tuesday's match which rules him out of England's World Cup squad, the midfielder said: ""This all pales in comparison to how the family of the Liverpool fan badly hurt before last night's game must be feeling. ""My thoughts are with him and his loved ones."" Det Insp Paul Speight of Merseyside Police said witnesses reported Mr Cox was hit with a belt and then fell to the ground. ""His condition is currently described as critical and his next of kin have been informed,"" he said.

He witnessed one man carrying a hammer close to the ground. Student Ryan Ellis, 22, said: ""It was horrible to see, some had bats and others were swinging at people with belts with buckles out. ""They were beaten back by Liverpool fans and then the police on horseback charged."" Builder Mark Wilson, 39, said: ""There were about 20 Roma fans who charged and were hitting out at people with belts. ""Liverpool fans then threw bottles and cans at them and chased them off."" In a statement, the Italian club said it condemned in ""the strongest possible terms the abhorrent behaviour of a small minority of travelling fans who brought shame on the club and the vast majority of Roma's well-behaved supporters"". A club spokesman said there was ""no place for this type of vile behaviour in football"" and it was ""co-operating"" with authorities. European football's governing body, Uefa, condemned the events as ""vile"". ""The perpetrators of this ignominious attack have no place in and around football and we trust they will be dealt with utmost severity by the authorities,"" it said ""Uefa is waiting to receive full reports before deciding on potential disciplinary charges."" Forensics officers were called to the scene of the attack just yards from Anfield stadium Supporters waving flares before the match despite requests from the authorities not to bring them Ch Supt Dave Charnock said fans from both sides had been ""involved in isolated pockets of disorder"" and detectives were also investigating the use of flares outside Anfield stadium prior to the game.

"Site seized: The splash page that has replaced webstresser since the takedown A website blamed for launching more than four million cyber-attacks around the world, including attempts to crash banks in the UK, has been taken down in a major international investigation. The operation, which involved the UK's National Crime Agency, blocked Webstresser.org - which allows criminals to buy attacks on businesses. The site was used by a British suspect to attack high street banks last year, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage. Six suspected members of the gang behind the site have been arrested, with computers seized in the UK, Holland and elsewhere. Webstresser: Investigators say it posed as a legitimate business The site targeted in this week's operation was one of many operating openly on the web as a ""stresser"" business, offering to test a company's cyber-defences. Investigators say that the gang sold cyber-attacks for as little as $14.99 (almost Â£11) - meaning that anyone who wanted to attack a web service could do so with little chance of being traced. The history of cyber-crime forums Don't become a victim of cyber crime Major UK cyber attack warning Webstresser offered a form of cyber-attack known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), in which a target website is overwhelmed by requests for access. In practice, this means that the target, be they an online bank or a secondary school's portal for students, can seize up and crash, unless the attack is blocked. Stresses are also used to settle scores between business rivals, carry out industrial espionage or to hold businesses to ransom. Identifying how the attack is being launched and where it is coming from requires huge amounts of effort, as specialist online investigators must hunt for the source of the crippling data. Sliding scale of costs: Clients offered different levels of service Over the last two days, seven suspected members of the group behind webstresser.org were arrested or subject to searches in the Netherlands, Serbia, Croatia and Canada, with support from Police Scotland, Europol and US authorities. On Wednesday morning, Dutch police completed the operation by identifying the location of the website's servers and seizing them, replacing the site with a page announcing that law enforcement agencies had taken the service offline. Investigators from the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit searched an address in Bradford linked to a suspect who is believed to have used webstresser to attack seven of the UK's biggest banks in November last year. The BBC understands that the banking attack incident, which has never been publicly confirmed, cost some of the institutions hundreds of thousands of pounds as they were forced to shut down systems while experts worked around the clock to repel the attack. Jo Goodall, the lead investigator in the operation for the National Crime Agency, said: ""Cyber-crime by default is a threat that crosses borders. The arrests made over the past two days show that the internet does not provide bulletproof anonymity to offenders and we expect to identify further suspects linked to the site in the coming weeks and months. ""We have seen how cyber-attacks have real-world consequences resulting in actual physical harm, as well as causing reputational and financial damage to businesses of all sizes."" The UK government has justpublished its latest annual survey,externallooking at how businesses and - for the first time - charities are handling data breaches and attacks. The study is based on the responses of 1,519 companies and 569 charities to a telephone questionnaire carried out between October and December. The headline findings were: that 43% of the businesses and 19% of the charities had reported a breach or attack in the previous year that 74% of the businesses and 53% of the charities said that cyber-security was a high priority for senior management yet only 27% of the businesses and 21% of the charities said they had formal cyber-security policies the average cost incurred by a breach that resulted in a financial loss was Â£3,100 for businesses and Â£1,030 for charities the most common type of attack reported by those that had suffered a breach had involved their staff being targeted by a fraudulent emails or websites ""Given how many breaches UK businesses are facing, not training staff on why security is important invites trouble,"" commented Piers Wilson from cyber-security firm Huntsman.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry lays a wreath to mark Anzac Day Prince Charles and Prince Harry have marked Anzac Day by laying wreaths at separate services to pay tribute to Australia and New Zealand's war dead. The day also commemorates the first major battle involving Australian and New Zealand forces in World War One. The Prince of Wales attended a traditional dawn service at Villers-Bretonneux in France. Meanwhile, Prince Harry was joined by his fiancÃ©e Meghan Markle at Wellington Arch in London's Hyde Park Corner. Thousands of men of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzacs) died during the failed Gallipoli landings in Turkey in 1915, which aimed to take control of the Dardanelles waterway - a key route to the Black Sea and Russia. In pictures: Australia and New Zealand mark Anzac Day Anzac Day: Commemorate or celebrate? Prince Charles is attending the commemorations on behalf of the Queen. During the dawn service at the Australian National Memorial, the prince gave a reading to mark 100 years since a battle in which some 2,400 Australians were killed. In April 1918, troops alongside British personnel helped to recapture the French town from German forces in the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. He read a diary entry from Australian Private Frank Purnell which contained descriptions of life in the trenches and of other service personnel he had met. The Prince of Wales paid tribute to the fallen as he marked the centenary of the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux He also met an indigenous didgeridoo player More than 8,000 people, including Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, attended the service where traditional wartime music was performed, including music from an indigenous didgeridoo player. The prince later met members from 17 countries who fought on the Western Front and two Australian Football League players. He was given a personalised sports top with ""Wales 70"" written on it to mark his upcoming 70th birthday. Meanwhile in London, Prince Harry and Ms Markle were welcomed to a ceremony in Hyde Park with a traditional Maori greeting called a hongi - the pressing of noses and the sharing of one another's breath. In London, Prince Harry was joined by his fiancÃ©e Meghan Markle for the first time at an Anzac Day service Ms Markle was told about Maori traditions before the prince laid a floral tribute Prince Harry placed a wreath at the foot of the Australian memorial The service also included a performance of the Maori war cry - the haka - famously seen by New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team. Prince Harry, who spent a decade in the armed forces, left a handwritten note on his wreath to the fallen soldiers. It said: ""For all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of our freedom. Thank you. Harry"". He later laid another wreath at the Cenotaph, along with Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. He led tributes at the dawn service in Hyde Park Corner With a handwritten note, the prince paid his respects to those who had ""made the ultimate sacrifice"" Later, the pair were joined by the Duke of Cambridge at Westminster Abbey Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attended the wreath laying ceremony and parade at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London Schoolchildren read prayers and the Last Post was played before all took part in a minute's silence. Sir Jerry Mateparae, the high commissioner of New Zealand, said Ms Markle was ""very interested"" in the service. ""It's her first Anzac service so we were explaining what it meant to us and the Australian memorial,"" he said. The couple then attended a service at Westminster Abbey, where they were joined by the Duke of Cambridge. The princes went to the traditional Westminster Abbey service together Where the Last Post was played and wreaths were laid at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior Before the royals finished their part in the Anzac Day commemorations Speaking at the service the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster, called for a renewed commitment to global peace and justice on a day when countries remember ""one of the bloodiest battles"" of World War One. ""Australian and New Zealand forces joined together for the first time, and a new word entered the language: Anzac. ""Remembering that so many died, we honour the bravery and determination of the men at Gallipoli. The memory of what became known as The Great War is with us as a warning and an encouragement."" The first time Anzac Day was commemorated in the capital was when King George V attended a Westminster Abbey service in 1916, a year after the landings at Gallipoli.

"Quyen Ngoc Nguyen had lived in the UK since 2010 Two killers who went on to torture and set fire to a Vietnamese woman have been given whole-life jail terms. Quyen Ngoc Nguyen's body was discovered in a burning car in Shiney Row, near Sunderland, in August 2017. Stephen Unwin, 40, of Houghton-le-Spring, was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court of her rape and murder. William McFall, 51, who is from Northern Ireland but lived in Blackpool, was found guilty of murder but cleared of rape. The pair first met in jail while serving life terms for separate murders and made contact again after being released. During their trial, the jury was told they held nail technician Ms Nguyen captive and tortured her into revealing her bank card PINs after luring her to Unwin's home. Burning car killer 'beyond rehabilitation' Shiney Row burning car death accused had 'killed before' A Home Office pathologist said he could not say ""with certainty"" whether the 28-year-old mother of two was alive when they put her in the car, but the fire was the ""most likely the cause of death"". Stephen Unwin (left) and William McFall were described as ""evil"" by their victim's sister Mr Justice Morris described Unwin as a ""calculating, manipulating and ruthless killer"" and branded McFall ""an extremely violent man capable of monstrous behaviour"". Explaining his decision to sentence them to whole-life terms, he said they had murdered Ms Nguyen in a ""cold-blooded and callous manner"" having deliberately lulled her ""into a trap"". He added: ""She suffered an unimaginable ordeal. ""Both during and after that ordeal, the two of you casually went about your everyday task, chillingly devoid of human empathy."" The court heard the pair ate curry as Ms Nguyen lay injured and motionless on the floor before they dumped her in the burning car by allotments. The pair took Â£1,000 from her bank accounts. Ms Nguyen had arrived in the UK in 2010 from Vietnam to help her sister Quynh run a nail salon in Gateshead and the pair lived together in Killingworth, North Tyneside. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Quynh said: ""She did not deserve to die in this horrific manner. ""They did not act like human beings. They are evil."" CCTV showed Unwin at a Co-op store with Miss Nguyen's bank card Unwin had been released on licence in December 2012 having battered a pensioner to death during a break-in on Christmas Day 1998 in Houghton-le-Spring.

"Boggess said she would ""allow an opportunity to correct a wrong that has been done for years"" Broadway star Sierra Boggess has withdrawn from a concert performance of West Side Story at the BBC Proms after complaints about ""whitewashing"". Boggess, from Denver, Colorado, was due to have sung the role of Maria, who is Puerto Rican, at the show in August. But, she wrote on Facebook: ""After much reflection, I've realised that if I were to do this concert, it would once again deny Latinas the opportunity to sing this score, as well as deny the IMPORTANCE of seeing themselves represented onstage."" That would be a ""huge mistake"", she said. ""Since the announcement of this concert, I have had many conversations about why this is a crucial time, now more than ever, to not perpetuate the miscasting of this show. ""I apologise for not coming to this realisation sooner and as an artist, I must ask myself how I can best serve the world, and in this case my choice is clearer than ever: to step aside and allow an opportunity to correct a wrong that has been done for years with this show in particular. ""I have therefore withdrawn myself from this concert and I look forward to continuing to be a voice for change in our community and our world!"" Boggess earned an Olivier Award nomination for appearing in Love Never Dies in the West End in 2011 and has starred on Broadway in The Little Mermaid and School of Rock. Natalie Wood starred as Maria in the 1961 West Side Story film Boggess was due to play Maria in a concert version of West Side Story with the John Wilson Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in London to mark the centenary of composer Leonard Bernstein's birth. But Boggess faced a backlash after her casting was announced.One Twitter user wrote,external: ""You are a Caucasian woman and this character is Puerto Rican. It's not like you're hurting for job opportunities. Stop taking roles from actors of colour."" Another said,external: ""I love Sierra Boggess but Maria is seriously one of the only leading roles for Latina women in musical theatre so can we please cast one of the many talented Latina women out there who would KILL to play this role?"" A BBC statement said: ""We respect Sierra's decision to withdraw from West Side Story at the BBC Proms this year and will announce her replacement in due course."" The character of Maria was made famous by Natalie Wood, an American actress of Russian descent, in the 1961 film version - although Maria's singing voice was provided by Marni Nixon. Ayesha Casely-Hayford, an actor and chair of trustees of the charity Act for Change, said the situation was ""very telling of the times we're living in"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have an amazing ability now with social media to hear audience reaction immediately and it shows that we want more diversity on our stages, and not only that we want authenticity."" Casting directors should take ""a lot of the responsibility"" for bringing about change and equality, she added. ""West Side Story is set in a certain cultural background, and we're saying that when someone's personal characteristics are relevant, then use that."" The first Maria was Italian-American actressCarol Lawrenceon Broadway in 1957 In the 1961 film, Maria was played byNatalie Wood, an American actress of Russian descent. The only Puerto Rican in the cast,Rita Moreno, played her friend Anita Two actresses of Puerto Rican descent -Julia MigenesandJosie de Guzman- played Maria on Broadway in 1964 and 1980 respectively. The other major US revival, in 2009, starredJosefina Scaglione, from Argentina In 1984,Dame Kiri Te Kanawasang Maria on record oppositeJose Carreras' Tony. ""The only Spaniard in the cast is the one who must have the most American accent,"" Carreras quipped Another New Zealander,Hayley Westenra, sang on a recording for the show's 50th anniversary in 2007 In the West End, actresses to have played the role includeSofia Escobar, from Portugal, in 2009, and Spain'sElena Sancho Pereg, in 2013 Earlier this year, it was reported thatSteven Spielberghad put out a casting call, looking for a Latina actress to play the role in a film remake Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose parents are Puerto Rican, decided to write his first show, In the Heights, because Bernardo in West Side Story was virtually the only role available to Latino musical theatre performers. He went on to follow that with Hamilton - the biggest hit of the decade. But in 2017, an Australian production of In the Heightswas cancelled,externalafter criticism of the predominately white cast. Whitewashing has been a big issue elsewhere, both on stage and on the big screen. On Broadway,actor Mandy Patinkin withdrew,externalfrom the Tony-winning musical Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812 last year after being cast to replace Okieriete Onaodowan, who is black. In Hollywood, British actorEd Skrein turned downthe role of Major Ben Daimio in the new Hellboy film in 2017 because the character is of mixed Asian heritage. The topic had come to the fore after the choices of white stars like Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010's Prince of Persia; Johnny Depp as Tonto in The Lone Ranger in 2013; Emma Stone in Aloha in 2015; Tilda Swinton in 2016's Doctor Strange; and Scarlett Johansson in last year's Ghost in the Shell. There was also an outcry when Tom Hardy was rumoured to be playing Jafar in Guy Ritchie's new Aladdin. But that role eventually went to Dutch-Tunisian actor Marwan Kenzari.

"This video can not be played Sports correspondent Joe Wilson explains report into tennis integrity A ""tsunami"" of match-fixing is plaguing lower-level tennis events, according to an investigator in a long-awaited report into corruption in the sport. But the Independent Review Panel (IRP) found no evidence of a cover-up of these issues by governing bodies or the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU). The report also shows no evidence of top-level players being implicated. The two-year review - which BBC Sport understands cost close to Â£20m to fund - spoke to more than 100 players. It also surveyed more than 3,200 professionals. Of those surveyed, 464 said they had first-hand knowledge of match-fixing. Led by Adam Lewis QC, the panel was set up in January 2016 aftera BBC and BuzzFeed News investigationuncovered suspected illegal betting. It found a ""very significant"" corruption problem at ""lower and middle levels of the sport"" which Lewis described as a ""fertile breeding ground for breaches of integrity"". He also said that from 2009 to 2017, men's matches were responsible for 83% of alerts to suspicious matches. The report also shows ""evidence of some issues"" at higher levels, such as Grand Slams and Tour events, but the evidence does not reveal a ""widespread problem"" in elite professional tennis. Asked if tennis fans could believe what they are seeing at major tournaments this summer, Lewis replied: ""Yes, the data shows that there is very little incentive to breach integrity, therefore it's unlikely you are going to see match-fixing."" Other key findings and recommendations include: Report authors were told of a ""match-fixing 'season'"" from October until the end of the year with ""traces of up to two or three fixed matches per day"" in International Tennis Federation (ITF) tournaments investigations at Grand Slams were ""insufficient"", while the ATP, the organisational body of men's professional tennis, was guilty of ""failing to exhaust potential leads before ending investigations"" the sale of official live scoring data, at least at ITF and Pro Circuit levels, should be discontinued because it has increased the problem adopting a realistic approach to how many players can be considered professional. and a reorganisation and reform of the TIU, the sport's anti-corruption body. The report also proposes an end to betting sponsorship in tennis, especially tournaments. It draws on statements from more than 200 key stakeholders in professional tennis, including from governing bodies, tournament organisers and betting operators. In the course of its investigation, the panel was told by one betting operator that ""the situation in tennis was grimmer than grim"". But report author Lewis maintained that suspicious matches were more suited to lower levels of tennis where a blend of factors came together to create ""a fertile breeding ground"". Chief among them include the number of players struggling to make a living, few people watching the matches in person and the ITF's decision to sell official live scoring data in 2012, making betting on lower-ranked matches far easier to achieve. ""Only the top 250 females and 350 male players are making enough money to break even before coaching costs, yet there are 15,000 nominally professional players,"" Lewis said. ""It's a small step for a player who already intends to lose for other reasons to then bet or inform others of his or her intentions so as to make enough money to continue playing."" He also said the number of alerts to suspicious matches had risen from three in 2012 - the year the ITF sold live scoring data - to 240 in 2016. ""According to [European Sports Betting Integrity firm] ESSA, since 2015 tennis has been responsible for more suspicious betting than for any other sport in each and every quarter,"" Lewis said. The report added that since the data deal, 60,000 matches were available to the betting market in 2016, up from 40,000 in 2013. As well as recommending that the sale of scoring data should discontinue ""at least at ITF and Pro Circuit levels"", the report also said tennis should stop tournaments being sponsored by betting firms and governing bodies should introduce measures to deal with the ""intolerable levels of online abuse, often from disappointed bettors"". Although the TIU has been cleared of any cover-up of match-fixing, Lewis said its staff were made up of former law-enforcement offers and included no tennis or betting experts. And while the number of staff had increased from six to 17, he said there were ""too few staff to combat the problem"". The report also contained numerous examples of how the TIU - which is funded by the sport's major stakeholders - should reform, be more accountable and improve its independence, including a move away from its current home at Roehampton, the same west London site where the ITF resides. Other reforms could include: â¢ A new board, independent from governing bodies. â¢ More, and more diverse, staff to deal with the scale of the problem, and be more transparent, including an annual external audit. â¢ Make better use of betting data and match footage to support disciplinary proceedings, improve its processes for gathering and storing intelligence. â¢ Make the disciplinary process more streamlined and cost-effective, and make greater use of criminal law. The governing bodies of professional tennis - the ATP, WTA, ITF and Grand Slam Board - released a joint statement in response to the report, agreeing with its findings and confirming an ""agreement in principle"" to implement all the recommendations. They said they ""recognise"" the ""vulnerabilities"" in the sport, particularly at lower levels, and are ""committed to seizing the opportunity to address these concerns through firm and decisive action"". The statement also welcomes the IRP's finding that the panel has ""seen no evidence of any institutional corruption"" or a cover-up by tennis authorities and the TIU. But it does not directly address the report's judgement the ATP ""failed to exhaust potential leads before ending investigations"". Each body will conduct ""detailed exploration and analysis"" before responding to the 12 recommendations prior to publication of the final report. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller The panel found no evidence of a cover up, or corruption at the top level, but describes a system ill-equipped to deal with the substantial threat at lower levels. The TIU, according to the report, is ""overly conservative"" and should make greater use of betting data to bring about convictions. Many defence lawyers may argue this type of evidence is purely circumstantial. The panel says the problem of betting on lower level matches would be much reduced if the live scoring data sold by the ITF in 2012 in lucrative deal in was severely restricted. Sportradar, the data company with whom the ITF is in partnership, has already warned this appears unrealistic, potentially unlawful and will not prevent betting on these matches. So there will be much debate before the final report is published, and the governing bodies carry out their promise to implement the findings in full. There is also a call for national governments to introduce stricter criminal liability for sporting corruption, and a suggestion that appearance fees are capped and publicised in the interests of greater transparency. That will not go down well with those at the elite levels of the sport.

"Prof Alexis Jay chairs the inquiry A ""change in culture"" is needed within institutions and government if children are to be properly safeguarded, an interim report by the independent child sexual abuse inquiry has said. It said ""all too often"" organisations put the reputation of their leaders and staff before the welfare of children and tackling abuse. It called for society to have an ""open and frank"" conversation on the issue. Some 13 investigations, each a part of the inquiry, are still to be completed. The inquiry was set up in 2014 to investigate historical allegations of child abuse, as well as claims that authorities, including the police, failed to properly investigate these allegations. It has suffered delays and criticisms with several leaders standing down. The report said children and young people had told the inquiry that sexual abuse was ""rarely"" discussed and that they needed better practical advice on staying safe. Presenting 18 separate recommendations, it added that discussion was not enough and needed to be followed by action. The inquiry's chair, Prof Alexis Jay, said she expected to make ""substantial progress"" on the rest of the inquiry in the next two years. She said: ""We have much work still to do and evidence to hear - we will hold a further eight public hearings in the next 12 months alone - but we are making good progress. ""I indicated in December 2016 that I expected the inquiry to have made substantial progress by 2020.  I believe we are on target to do that.""

"US cable TV giant Comcast has made a formal Â£22bn bid for Sky that values the UK broadcaster at Â£12.50 a share. The move threatens Rupert Murdoch's attempts to take full control of the pay-TV group. The media mogul's 21st Century Fox has already agreed to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own - an offer worth about Â£19bn. Sky said it was withdrawing its recommendation for the Fox bid following Comcast's move. Sky shares closed 3.4% higher at Â£13.59 - more than Â£1 above Comcast's offer, suggesting a bidding war for control of Sky could erupt. Disney, which struck a$66bn deal with Foxin December to buy most of its entertainment assets, could also make a play for Sky. Comcast - the biggest US cable TV firm that also owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures - said its bid offered a premium of about 16% to Fox's Â£10.75 a share offer. Chief executive Brian Roberts said: ""We have long believed Sky is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast. Sky has a strong business, excellent customer loyalty, and a valued brand."" The gloves are officially off. The big winners here are the Sky shareholders who can now sit back and watch these two slug it out in a bidding war. Now there is a better offer formally on the table, the board of Sky has duly retracted its recommendation to shareholders that they accept the Fox offer. We now wait for the Murdoch response. The markets think there will be one as shares are trading Â£1 higher than the Comcast bid. The fight is already getting dirty, with teams of lawyers and PRs on both sides preparing briefing notes about each others previous misdemeanours, scandals and broken promises. The bottom lines are these. A US company - either Comcast or Disney - will end up owning Sky. Over decades of string-pulling and empire building, Rupert Murdoch has usually got what he wants. But as he tries to dismantle it (in the most financially advantageous way possible) - it's not all going his way. George Salmon, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst. ""Part of the reason the value of the deal is significantly higher than what Fox originally put forward is that Sky has since secured three more years of rights to Premier League football at a reduced cost. As far as the value of Sky goes, that's a game-changer,"" he said. ""Sky has proven the Premier League deals are well worth the outlay. The group looks on course to deliver operating profits of Â£1.5bn this year, double what it earned ten years ago."" Comcast owns the NBC network in the US Comcast said it would continue to engage with Sky's independent directors to win a recommendation for its deal. In February it said it intended to make an offer at the same level of Â£12.50 a share. Comcast added that it planned to agree several legally binding commitments with regard to Sky and in particular for Sky News, as well as keeping the group's Osterley headquarters in west London for at least five years. Mr Roberts added: ""With its 23 million retail customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy, and Germany, and its history of strong financial performance, we see significant opportunities for growth by combining our businesses."" He added: ""We also understand the role that Sky plays in UK society and in its customers' lives and we are determined to be responsible and trusted owners of Sky.""

"The BBC's director of news and current affairs has said there were ""strong reasons"" to name Sir Cliff Richard during a police inquiry into him. Fran Unsworth told the High Court that while the story would cause ""distress"" to Sir Cliff, it was ""in the public interest."" Sir Cliff is suing the BBC for naming him and broadcasting helicopter footage of police searching his home in 2014. He says broadcasting the images was a ""very serious invasion"" of privacy. Sir Cliff, 77, who denied an historic sexual assault allegation, was not arrested or charged as the result of the South Yorkshire Police investigation. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Ms Unsworth - who was then deputy director of BBC News -  told Mr Justice Mann: ""I was aware it would cause serious distress to Sir Cliff, but I had to weigh up the public interest consideration."" Sir Cliff's barrister, Justin Rushbrooke QC, asked about the consideration of the ""indelible stain"" such an allegation would leave on Sir Cliff's character. ""It certainly occurred (to me) this was a fairly momentous thing we were doing with a high profile person concerned, but there were strong reasons the BBC should do this,"" Ms Unsworth replied. She added that there were ""strong public interest arguments"" in naming suspects who were part of a police investigation. She told the court that defamation was the ""most significant legal issue"". ""We were concerned about privacy impact, but I thought that was an editorial matter as opposed to a legal matter,"" she added. Fran Unsworth was deputy director of BBC news at the time of the coverage Asked whether helicopter footage showing the inside of Sir Cliff's home was intrusive, Ms Unsworth said that Sir Cliff was not in the property and that ""shots were of policemen and quite blurred"". Ms Unsworth did not accept it was disproportionately intrusive, adding: ""It would be impossible to broadcast it without it being an enormous story. "" She did, however, say use of live footage ""was a mistake"". She told Judge Mann the justification of using a helicopter was ""the inability to record it pictorially effectively any other way"". Ms Unsworth said it was the first time the BBC had named an individual before arrest in connection with a minor. ""We understood he would have been arrested if at the property,"" she added. Questioned on the BBC's decision to report the investigation, Ms Unsworth said: ""We had firm information given to us by South Yorkshire Police... ""My instincts tell me that had it emerged that the BBC had chosen to ignore that story in full knowledge of it, the public audiences would have had questions about our role... it would have looked potentially as though we were not covering this story because Sir Cliff was a high profile individual."" She added: ""I thought it surprising South Yorkshire Police had given this level of access and I thought that was worth showing the public."" Ms Unsworth said the BBC did receive criticism for naming Sir Cliff after the coverage. Judge Mann also heard from another witness, Joanne Beattie, a former press officer for South Yorkshire Police. She confirmed she rang BBC News reporter Dan Johnson the day before the search, to tell him it was being carried out the following morning in Berkshire. Sir Cliff has saidthe coverage ""smeared"" his name. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations and says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. In 2014 South Yorkshire Police searched Sir Cliff's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire while investigating an allegation the singer sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. In June 2016 it was announced he would not face any charges. South Yorkshire Police has settled its own case with Sir Cliff by paying him Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". The case continues on Thursday.

"The BBC's director of news and current affairs has said there were ""strong reasons"" to name Sir Cliff Richard during a police inquiry into him. Fran Unsworth told the High Court that while the story would cause ""distress"" to Sir Cliff, it was ""in the public interest."" Sir Cliff is suing the BBC for naming him and broadcasting helicopter footage of police searching his home in 2014. He says broadcasting the images was a ""very serious invasion"" of privacy. Sir Cliff, 77, who denied an historic sexual assault allegation, was not arrested or charged as the result of the South Yorkshire Police investigation. Giving evidence on Wednesday, Ms Unsworth - who was then deputy director of BBC News -  told Mr Justice Mann: ""I was aware it would cause serious distress to Sir Cliff, but I had to weigh up the public interest consideration."" Sir Cliff's barrister, Justin Rushbrooke QC, asked about the consideration of the ""indelible stain"" such an allegation would leave on Sir Cliff's character. ""It certainly occurred (to me) this was a fairly momentous thing we were doing with a high profile person concerned, but there were strong reasons the BBC should do this,"" Ms Unsworth replied. She added that there were ""strong public interest arguments"" in naming suspects who were part of a police investigation. She told the court that defamation was the ""most significant legal issue"". ""We were concerned about privacy impact, but I thought that was an editorial matter as opposed to a legal matter,"" she added. Fran Unsworth was deputy director of BBC news at the time of the coverage Asked whether helicopter footage showing the inside of Sir Cliff's home was intrusive, Ms Unsworth said that Sir Cliff was not in the property and that ""shots were of policemen and quite blurred"". Ms Unsworth did not accept it was disproportionately intrusive, adding: ""It would be impossible to broadcast it without it being an enormous story. "" She did, however, say use of live footage ""was a mistake"". She told Judge Mann the justification of using a helicopter was ""the inability to record it pictorially effectively any other way"". Ms Unsworth said it was the first time the BBC had named an individual before arrest in connection with a minor. ""We understood he would have been arrested if at the property,"" she added. Questioned on the BBC's decision to report the investigation, Ms Unsworth said: ""We had firm information given to us by South Yorkshire Police... ""My instincts tell me that had it emerged that the BBC had chosen to ignore that story in full knowledge of it, the public audiences would have had questions about our role... it would have looked potentially as though we were not covering this story because Sir Cliff was a high profile individual."" She added: ""I thought it surprising South Yorkshire Police had given this level of access and I thought that was worth showing the public."" Ms Unsworth said the BBC did receive criticism for naming Sir Cliff after the coverage. Judge Mann also heard from another witness, Joanne Beattie, a former press officer for South Yorkshire Police. She confirmed she rang BBC News reporter Dan Johnson the day before the search, to tell him it was being carried out the following morning in Berkshire. Sir Cliff has saidthe coverage ""smeared"" his name. He is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. The BBC disputes his allegations and says the BBC report on the police inquiry was in the public interest. In 2014 South Yorkshire Police searched Sir Cliff's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire while investigating an allegation the singer sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. In June 2016 it was announced he would not face any charges. South Yorkshire Police has settled its own case with Sir Cliff by paying him Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". The case continues on Thursday.

"(L-R) Crew members James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin all died The director of a yacht management company has been cleared of the manslaughter of four men who died when their vessel capsized in the Atlantic. The crew of the Cheeki Rafiki died after the 40ft vessel lost its keel and capsized more than 700 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia in May 2014. Douglas Innes, 43, was cleared of four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence following a retrial at Winchester Crown Court. The crew's bodies were never found. The four men on board - skipper Andrew Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, James Male, 22, from Romsey in Hampshire, Steve Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Paul Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset - were travelling back to the UK when the vessel lost its keel. Mr Innes shut his eyes and silently mouthed the words ""thank you"" to the jury when the first not guilty verdict was read out. The director and his company Stormforce Coaching Limited will be sentenced on 11 Mayafter being convicted at the first trial of failing to operate the yacht in a safe mannercontrary to the Merchant Shipping Act. Douglas Innes, who ran Stormforce Coaching, was cleared of four counts of manslaughter The court had been told an ""urgent email"" had been sent by the crew warning Mr Innes their yacht on the boat - named after a character in the Lion King - was taking on water in bad weather. He replied advising the sailors to make sure the life raft was ready and later phoned the UK Coastguard, but the prosecution had argued he had not shown any urgency. The yacht was found overturned and empty on 17 May, two days after the email was sent, with its life raft still on board. But Mr Innes told the court there had been regular inspections and no evidence of keel damage. He said the yacht was taken out of the water for nearly five months in 2013 for the hull to be repainted. ""If the boat is out of the water for that period of time, I would have inspected it myself as well,"" he told the jury. Mr Innes also said he only became aware of the extent of damage caused by two previous groundings after the prosecution was launched. The overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki after it was discovered by a US Navy warship The Marine Accident Investigation Branch concluded that previous groundings and repairs might have caused weakening at the point where the keel was attached to the hull, causing it to fall off. It said the Maritime and Coastguard Agency had undertaken to work with the Royal Yachting Association and the marine industry to clarify safety and maintenance requirements. A note from the jury read out in court said it was ""deeply concerned"" about a maritime regulation guidance note and hoped it would be reviewed and tightened to help improve safety. The Cheeki Rafiki had been on its way to Southampton from Antigua Sailing Week The US Coastguard's decision to ends its search and rescue operationafter two days resulted in criticism from the sailors' families. It resumed after an intervention by the British government, and the upturned yacht was discovered in the Atlantic Ocean about 1,000 miles (1,609km) east of Cape Cod in Massachusetts with its cabin completely flooded and its windows shattered. The boat was found without any sign of the missing men, and underwater photographs showed the life raft stowed in place.

"This video can not be played Graham Turnock: ""We still think there is a win-win to be had here"" The UK is considering plans to launch a satellite-navigation system as a rival to the EU's Galileo project. The move comes after the UK was told it would be shut out of key elements of the programme after Brexit. The UK has spent 1.4bn euros (Â£1.2bn) on Galileo, which is meant to be Europe's answer to the US GPS system. Business Secretary Greg Clark is taking legal advice on whether the UK can reclaim the cash,according to the Financial Times.,external UK anger over EU threat to Galileo role He told BBC News: ""The UK's preference is to remain in Galileo as part of a strong security partnership with Europe. ""If Galileo no longer meets our security requirements and UK industry cannot compete on a fair basis, it is logical to look at alternatives."" The row centres around whether the UK can continue to be trusted with the EU's most sensitive security information after Brexit. The UK's armed forces were planning to use Galileo to supplement their use of the US GPS system, but press reports suggest they will now be blocked from doing so. The US retains the more accurate and robust GPS signals for its own armed forces. Graham Turnock, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said early feasibility work was under way into a UK system, which he said would cost a ""lot less"" than Galileo, thanks to work already done and ""British know-how and ingenuity"". Asked by the BBC's Science Correspondent Jonathan Amos if it could be as much as Â£5bn, he said ""tops"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And he warned that excluding the UK from Galileo could set the European programme back years and cost the EU billions more in development costs. ""We still think there is a 'win win' to be had here if the European Commission and the EU 27 change their minds. ""But at the moment they appear to be set on excluding the UK from industrial participation in the programme."" He said the UK had ""a lot of the capability that would be needed for a sat-nav system because we developed them as part of our role in Galileo"". ""We cannot launch yet, although obviously we are trying to address that, but this is something we think is in the realm of the credible,"" he added. The pan-European aerospace giant Airbus has been a major player in Galileo's development. And in the UK, Airbus currently controls the satellites in the sky - satellites that were also assembled by its subsidiary Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd in Guildford. While Airbus will be able to continue working on Galileo at its continental centres whatever the outcome of the present row, the company said its UK wing stood ready to assist in building a British sat-nav system if asked. ""If the UK opts for its own satellite-navigation system then Airbus's space operations in the UK has the skills and expertise to lead the development of it,"" Andrew Stroomer, a senior British executive in Airbus, told the BBC. Europe's Galileo system Artwork: Galileo satellites are now launching on Europe's premier rocket, the Ariane 5 A project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency 24 satellites constitute a full system but it will have six spares in orbit also 22 spacecraft are in orbit today; the figure of 30 is likely to be reached in 2021 Original budget was 3bn euros but will now cost more than three times that Spacecraft have been launched in batches of two, but now go up four at a time Will work alongside the US-owned GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises eventual real-time positioning down to a metre or less Greg Clark warned that the European Commission's actions could threaten defence and security co-operation with Britain after it has left the EU. He is understood to be preparing to block the procurement of the next batch of Galileo satellites at a meeting of the European Space Agency council in Berlin, as part of a fightback against the EU decision. ""We've been clear that we do not accept the Commission's position and have called for a three-month procurement freeze and a clear commitment from the Commission that UK industry continues to be eligible to apply for all Galileo contracts on a fair and open basis,"" said the business secretary.

"Hank Azaria has also appeared in Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Hank Azaria says he is ""willing to step aside"" from his role voicing Simpsons character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. It follows a documentary made by Indian-American comic Hari Kondabolu that argued the Indian character is based on racial stereotypes. Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the actor said his ""eyes have been opened"" by the debate and that he never intended to cause offence. He also distanced himself fromthe show's controversial response. Shopkeeper Apu has been part of the long-running animation series since 1990, with Azaria adopting an Indian accent to voice him. The character is one of several voiced on The Simpsons by Azaria - he is also the voice of Chief Wiggum, Comic Book Guy and bartender Moe Szyslak. There has been a focus on the portrayal of Apu since Kondabolu's 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu. The director toldthe BBC last yearthat the character was problematic because he is defined by his job and how many children he has in his arranged marriage. Apu has been seen on The Simpsons since 1990 He added Apu was one of the only representations of South Asians on US television when he was growing up and that other children imitated the character to mock him.

"This video can not be played ""There were no actions to go with the words,"" said Jonathan Arkush from the Board of Deputies of British Jews Labour is promising to settle the ""vast majority"" of the outstanding cases of alleged anti-Semitism within the party by the end of July. Jeremy Corbyn said dealing with complaints swiftly and fairly was a top priority for the new general secretary. The Labour leader met members of the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews on Tuesday. They said the talks were a ""disappointing, missed opportunity"" and did not agree a minimum plan of action. Mr Corbyn has apologised for anti-Semitism - prejudice against Jewish people - in his party and said he was ""absolutely committed"" to rooting it out. Sources close to the Labour leadership say Mr Corbyn agreed to speed up disciplinary procedures, but not to fixed timescales which might leave the party open to legal challenge. MPs escort Smeeth to anti-Semitism hearing Mr Corbyn said his meeting with the groups had been ""positive and constructive"", but Jonathan Arkush from the Board of Deputies disagreed and said ""there were no actions to go with the words"". Jonathan Goldstein, of the Jewish Leadership Council, said Mr Corbyn ""engages in conversation until you ask him to do something"". Mr Goldstein told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When you ask him to do something he has this habit of staring and just shrugging."" This video can not be played Goldstein says Corbyn must change 'anti-Semitism behaviour' in Labour He said Mr Corbyn seemed reluctant to ""call out"" people he knows and did not want to ""own the words"" around the anti-Semitism claims. Mr Goldstein said: ""Leadership starts from the top and we are asking Mr Corbyn to take behavioural change and leadership seriously. ""He could change the atmosphere in a moment."" Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade minister, told Today that Mr Corbyn had ""acknowledged and apologised for"" the time taken to address the issues. He said: ""It's actions that matter and actions are being taken by the party to make sure this is dealt with."" Mr Corbyn says he is ""absolutely committed"" to rooting out anti-Semitism Labour has been dogged by a series of incidents including criticism last month of Mr Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and the party's suspension of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. The Labour leader has been accused of not taking the issue seriously enough by Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, who took part in a protest in Parliament Square last month. On Thursday last week, MPsshared their own experiences of anti-Semitic threatsin the House of Commons. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent Accusations that anti-Semitism wasn't being taken seriously enough by Labour are proving politically toxic in two ways. First, they undermine Labour's ""brand"" - a party that stands for equal rights and anti-racism. And secondly, the effort to detoxify the issue has arguably diverted the party's leadership from the forthcoming local election contests. So it would have been helpful if the Jewish groups had suggested that progress had been made since their demonstration in Parliament Square, which some of Jeremy Corbyn's own MPs joined a month ago. While they did welcome Mr Corbyn's words on anti-Semitism - and his denunciation of those who said the problem had been invented or exaggerated - their verdict on action, or lack of it, means that the issue remains a potent force in the hands of the Labour leader's internal and external opponents. Perhaps the most positive interpretation is that there was a disagreement over detail and not a fundamental division in outlook. That's certainly how sources close to the Labour leadership would like it to be seen. Read more from Iain The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies wrote to Mr Corbyn following last month's demonstration to suggest ""areas of action"". After meeting for more than two hours, the organisations said in a statement: ""We are disappointed that Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of the minimum level of action which our letter suggested. Members of the Board of Deputies said Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of their suggestions ""Words in letters and newspaper articles will never be enough. We welcome the fact that Mr Corbyn's words have changed but it is action by which the Jewish community will judge him and the Labour Party."" They said the following suggested points of action were rejected: A fixed timetable to deal with anti-Semitism cases Expedite the long-standing cases involving Mr Livingstone and suspended party activist Jackie Walker No MP should share a platform with somebody expelled or suspended for anti-Semitism Adopt in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism Transparent oversight of the disciplinary process According to the MP Louise Ellman, who is president of the Jewish Labour Movement, there is a backlog of around 80 serious complaints of anti-Semitism. It is understood Mr Livingstone's case is among those which will be dealt with by July. But the Jewish groups accused Mr Corbyn of hiding behind process after they were told he had no power personally to expel Mr Livingstone. Jewish Voice for Labour, which has accused Mr Corbyn's opponents of using the issue to undermine the leader, said there had been too little focus in the media and Westminster on anti-Semitism on the right of politics. In an article for the group's website, academic and activist Justin Schlosberg said he had asked other Jewish groups to endorse a statement criticising what he said were the Conservatives' ""formal and informal links"" to European political groups with a history of anti-Semitism and they had all declined.

"Kim Wall ""never made a spectacle of the characters she reported on"" It is a ""black irony"" that Kim Wall - the journalist whose remains were found off Denmark - died while working in such a familiar and seemingly safe area, say friends and family. The 30-year-old freelance reporter had travelled the world in pursuit of her stories - from Uganda to Cuba to the Marshall Islands to Kenya to New York City. At one point she even ""slipped into"" North Korea. She specialised in stories about identity, gender or subcultures, often with social justice themes. ""Kim has worked as a journalist in many dangerous places, and we have often been worried about her,"" her parents wrote ina letter to Danish TV,externalwhile she was still missing. ""That something could happen to her in Copenhagen, just a few kilometres from the childhood home, we could not imagine at all."" Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Inventor says toxic fumes killed Kim Wall What we know Ms Wall was a formidable character and driven journalist, those who knew her say. She was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the ""Oxbridge of journalism"". Even within her cohort she was top of the class, winning honours in her year, her classmate and friend Anna Codrea-Rado told the BBC. ""What made her journalistic abilities so exceptional was that she looked for quirky stories but with a bigger narrative,"" she said. ""She reported them deeply - she never made a spectacle of the characters. Her reporting was rock-solid."" Her interest in people and stories made her a great party guest. ""She was one of the few people that could lift a room just by being in it,"" Ms Wall's friend Christopher Harress (left) told the BBC ""She was very bubbly and warm, the kind of person who had fantastic stories about the things she was working on - you could jump straight past the small talk. ""She was intellectual, so well-travelled and had such varied interests. She was interested in quirky and eccentric stories. If you were at a party you'd end up passing hours just chatting to her."" This admiration has been echoed by numerous friends. Ms Wall wrote ""about subcultures, about a globalised world in rapid change"", says Victoria Grevein Sweden's Expressen newspaper,external. ""About life in a huge shopping centre in Kampala's Chinatown, about Cuba's underground internet providers who download and disseminate new episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians to people from all walks of life in Havana. We made a report together about the wealthy women in New York who voted for Donald Trump."" The weekly package - How Cubans deliver culture without internet (Harpers),external Fairy Tale Romances, Real and Staged (The New York Times),external Naked in an island idyll: eccentric couple recall a life of rockets and dictators (Guardian),external The Magic Kingdom meets the Middle Kingdom in Shanghai Disneyland (Time),external But Ms Greve and others also highlight the effort and pluck needed to succeed at this genre of journalism in today's media. ""As news organisations grapple with shrinking budgets, they increasingly rely on freelancers, who cost less and are often willing to take on the attendant risks reporting in places they wouldn't send their staff to,"" writes Sruthi Gottipatiin the Guardian,external. ""Even against this backdrop, the competition is fierce to place stories and female freelancers work hard to ensure their gender isn't calculated as a liability. So they clam up about the dangers they face and sometimes report before being commissioned to do so."" Madsen and Ms Wall were photographed just before departing on 10 August This pressure to secure good material before there is even a formal commission could explain why no news organisation has confirmed it gave Ms Wall the assignment she died carrying out. A friend and fellow freelance journalist,May Jeong, wrote that US technology magazine Wired had been in touch with Ms Wall,externalabout Peter Madsen's do-it-yourself rocket and submarine projects. Ms Wall was staying in Copenhagen with her partner, Danish designer Ole Stobbe, when she began investigating the old harbour workshops where Madsen and other enthusiasts had built the submarine UC3 Nautilus. On 10 August 2017, she boarded the submarine to interview him and was never seen again - her mutilated body was found by a cyclist 11 days later. In April 2018 Madsen was convicted of murder and now faces life in jail. Kim Wall's grieving parents Ingrid and Joachim May Jeong said Ms Wall was used to being in ""uncomfortable"" situations as a reporter, and ""in stepping onto that submarine, Kim was doing what any reporter onto a good story would have done"". Friends and family have urged the world not to let the nature of her death overshadow her life. ""Please don't remember her as the murdered Swedish journalist who died in a grisly horror straight out of a crime drama,"" Ms Codrea-Radosaid on Twitter,external. ""Remember her work."" This month the Swedish Publicists' Association gave a posthumous 10,000-krona (Â£843; $1,177) scholarship to Ms Wall. Her parents Joachim and Ingrid donated it tothe Kim Wall Memorial Fund,external, which will award it ""to a young female journalist who wants to work in Kim's spirit"", the family said.

"Remain-backing MPs believe they will get a chance to send Theresa May back to the negotiating table if they don't like the final Brexit deal, after comments by David Davis. The Brexit secretary suggested MPs would be allowed to amend a motion on the deal in the autumn. Downing Street has said the vote will be a ""take it or leave it"" choice. But the Brexit secretary suggested that might not be the case in evidence to a select committee. Mr Davis restated the government's promises of a ""meaningful vote"" in the autumn, in evidence to the Exiting the EU committee. Commons Live: David Davis grilled by MPs Rees-Mogg: PM's customs plan cretinous UK will leave customs union, insists No 10 But he confirmed that MPs and peers were likely at that stage to be presented with ""a political declaration rather than a treaty draft"". Asked by the committee's Labour chairman Hillary Benn whether the motion would be amendable, the Brexit secretary replied: ""If you can tell me how to write an unamendable motion, I will take a tutorial."" Pressed on whether the government would regard the outcome of the vote as binding, Mr Davis said: ""The government is unlikely to put a vote to the House which it doesn't intend to take properly seriously. If the House rejects the proposed negotiation, that negotiation will fall."" Labour MP Stephen Kinnock asked Mr Davis what would happen if MPs amended the government motion on the deal and voted to send ministers back to Brussels to negotiate a different deal. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Mr Davis told the committee: ""I'm not going to speculate on amendments that have not even yet been laid, let alone been passed by the House."" Mr Kinnock replied: ""Surely you must appreciate the risk of us heading towards a constitutional crisis here? ""And surely it's the responsibility of the government to have scenarios in mind so that it is ready to respond when the House does vote?"" Mr Davis responded: ""I'm not going to give advice on how to create circumstances which may undermine the government's negotiating position. ""I'm not entirely sure how much force a government sent back with its tail between its legs by Parliament would have in such a negotiation."" Remain-supporting Labour MP Pat MacFadden, from the Open Britain campaign against a ""hard and destructive Brexit"", told the BBC Mr Davis's words gave hope to those campaigning for a referendum on the final deal, as Mr Davis had refused to ""repeat his previous assertion that that would be the end of the matter and we'd be leaving the EU with no deal in place"". He said it would allow MPs, for example, to demand more time or to delay the article Article 50 process of leaving. Mr Davis also told the committee he expects Parliament to ""uphold"" the government's policy of leaving the customs union. The Brexit secretary told MPs he always ""respected"" the wishes of Parliament, even when they defied ministers, but he believed they would not in this case. MPs will hold a non-binding vote on the issue on Thursday after the Lords voted for some form of future customs union. Hilary Benn pressed Mr Davis on the 'meaningful vote' promised to MPs With Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP, plus a handful of Tories, in favour of remaining in some form of customs union after the UK leaves, the government is at risk of potential defeat when the defining vote is held next month. While the UK would remain a ""de facto"" member of the customs union during a 20-month transition period after Brexit, Mr Davis told the Commons Brexit select committee that there were ""huge competitive advantages"" to leaving in terms of boosting the UK's share of global trade. He said he hoped to get off to a ""racing start"" by implementing new trade deals quickly with countries like Canada after December 2020 - when the transition period will end. Mr Davis also rejected reports that the EU had dismissed out of hand the UK's solutions for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It was suggested last week that EU officials believe neither free trade nor technological solutions are feasible and Northern Ireland will have to remain in full regulatory alignment in many areas with the Republic of Ireland - the so-called ""backstop option"". Mr Davis, who visited Northern Ireland last week, said this last outcome was ""unacceptable - because it starts a process of effectively breaking up the UK"". He said it was seen by all concerned as the ""least most desirable outcome"" - or what he described as a ""reserve parachute"" if all else failed - and far more preferable was to settle it through a comprehensive trade deal. Warning against ""artificial timetables"", he rejected claims the UK was running out of time, pointing out that Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar had said a workable deal by October was more important than any deal this summer. But speaking in the Irish Parliament, Mr Varadkar said he wanted to see ""sufficient or significant progress"" on the issue by the time EU leaders gather for their next summit in June.

"A meeting with Jeremy Corbyn to discuss anti-Semitism in the Labour Party was a ""disappointing, missed opportunity"", Jewish leaders have said. The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said the Labour leader did not agree to any of the concrete actions they asked for. They want disciplinary cases speeded up and Mr Corbyn to use his ""personal authority"" to drive cultural change. ""I am absolutely committed to rooting out anti-Semitism,"" Mr Corbyn said. The party has been dogged by a series of incidents including criticism last month over Mr Corbyn's comments on an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012 and the Labour Party suspension of former London Mayor Ken Livingstone over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. How widespread is anti-Semitism in the UK? Corbyn sorry over Labour anti-Semitism MPs applauded after anti-Semitism speeches The Labour leader had been accused of not taking the issue seriously enough by Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, who took part in a protest in Parliament Square last month. And on Thursday last week, MPsshared their own experiences of anti-Semitic threatsin the House of Commons. The Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies had written to Mr Corbyn following last month's demonstration to suggest ""areas of action"". After a meeting with Mr Corbyn, which lasted more than two hours, the organisations said in a statement: ""We are disappointed that Mr Corbyn's proposals fell short of the minimum level of action which our letter suggested. ""Words in letters and newspaper articles will never be enough. We welcome the fact that Mr Corbyn's words have changed but it is action by which the Jewish community will judge him and the Labour Party."" They said the following suggested points of action were rejected: A fixed timetable to deal with anti-Semitism cases Expedite the long-standing cases involving Mr Livingstone and suspended party activist Jackie Walker No MP should share a platform with somebody expelled or suspended for anti-Semitism Adopt in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism Transparent oversight of the disciplinary process The Jewish leaders also say the Labour leader has been slow to act on the recommendations of a2016 report by Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti,external, which called for action to address what it said was the ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"" in the party, but it has yet to be implemented in full. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent Accusations that anti-Semitism wasn't being taken seriously enough by Labour are proving politically toxic in two ways. First, they undermine Labour's ""brand"" - a party that stands for equal rights and anti-racism. And secondly, the effort to detoxify the issue has arguably diverted the party's leadership from the forthcoming local election contests. So it would have been helpful if the Jewish groups had suggested that progress had been made since their demonstration in Parliament Square, which some of Jeremy Corbyn's own MPs joined a month ago. While they did welcome Mr Corbyn's words on anti-Semitism - and his denunciation of those who said the problem had been invented or exaggerated - their verdict on action, or lack of it, means that the issue remains a potent force in the hands of the Labour leader's internal and external opponents. Perhaps the most positive interpretation is that there was a disagreement over detail and not a fundamental division in outlook. That's certainly how sources close to the Labour leadership would like it to be seen. Read more from Iain Mr Corbyn said it was a ""positive and constructive"" meeting and shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said it was ""full, thorough and frank"". ""I am absolutely committed to rooting out anti-Semitism from our party and our society,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""When members of Jewish communities express genuine anxieties, we must recognise them as we would those of any other community. ""I have charged our new general secretary Jennie Formby with improving our disciplinary procedures as her top priority to ensure all complaints are dealt with swiftly and fairly."" He said further steps would be laid out in the coming weeks. Responding to the statement from Jewish leaders, which said none of their action points were agreed to, Mr Gwynne said: ""That's not my understanding of what was agreed. ""Whilst there was a number of issues raised, actually many of those issues we agreed to either implement or we were already implementing or we agreed to do something in more detail... I'm not sure how they've interpreted the meeting."" He said they made it ""very clear"" that nobody should share a platform with any member found guilty of anti-Semitism, or someone who had been suspended. And the ""vast majority"" of cases involving anti-Semitism allegations will be dealt with by July, he added. In an article for the Evening Standard published ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbynsaid Labour was taking action,external, with more than 20 members suspended in the past fortnight, adding: ""But we have not done enough to get to grips with the problem, and the Jewish community and our Jewish members deserve an apology. ""My party and I are sorry for the hurt and distress caused."" A separate round table event organised by Mr Corbyn on Wednesday has been postponed. Jewish groups had said they would boycott it amid concerns about the inclusion of the pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour. The organisation has accused opponents of using the anti-Semitism claims to damage the Labour leader.

"A protest against anti-Semitism has been taking place at Westminster Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" in the Labour Party. But how widespread is it generally? On the eve of Passover, which begins this Friday evening, members of Britain's Jewish community are preparing Seder meals that will include four cups of wine, the eating of unleavened bread and a retelling of the story of the exodus of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The eight-day festival is known in Hebrew as Pesach (meaning ""to pass over"") because God passed over Jewish homes when killing the firstborn as the last of the 10 plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, as told in the book of Exodus. The Seder service is also when Jews sing the traditional song, Dayenu. The Hebrew word is translated as ""enough"". This week, that message is also being sent to Mr Corbyn. The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council have issued a letter saying there has been a ""repeated institutional failure"" to properly address anti-Semitism. It accuses Mr Corbyn of being ""ideologically fixed within a far-left world view that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities"". In a recent tweet, Labour MP Luciana Berger sought clarification from the leader's office on comments he made in 2012, in which he offered support for a mural which has been condemned for being anti-Semitic.

Mr Corbyn said he regretted not looking more closely at the image, which he called ""deeply disturbing"". In a letter to Jewish leaders, Mr Corbyn describes himself as a ""militant opponent of anti-Semitism"" and an ally in the fight against it. He has also apologised for the pain caused by ""pockets of anti-Semitism"" within his party. But how widespread a problem is it across the UK as a whole? The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that works with Jewish community organisations and police forces, recorded 1,382 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 - the highest total ever. Of these, 145 incidents were classed as ""assaults"" - up from 108 the year before. But the most common type of incident was ""verbal abuse directed at random Jewish people in public"" - being shouted at in the street. Meanwhile, almost one in five incidents involved the use of social media. One tweet sent to a Jewish charity appeared to show a rollercoaster above a concentration camp. Another social media user posted messages saying ""Hitler was right"". The CST said there had been three incidents involving damage to, or desecration of, a Jewish cemetery; eight involving stones or bricks being thrown; and eight involving eggs being thrown at property. The charity also cited improvements in the reporting of anti-Semitic incidents - but said it believed there was still ""significant under-reporting"". Earlier this month, the former Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks told the Jewish News newspaper: ""Any political party has to adopt a zero-tolerance to anti-Semitism.  If they fail to do so, they are a danger not only to themselves but to the country and all inhabitants."" Lord Sacks has previously said that anti-Semitism is an ancient hatred and a contemporary warning sign that community relations within a culture are endangered. It is why the Jewish community is inviting members of other faiths, and of none, to join in the chorus: ""Enough is Enough.""

"The press regulator has ruled the Times ""distorted"" its coverage of a five-year-old Christian girl who was placed with Muslim foster carers. The newspaper ran three front-page stories in August 2017 after the girl was removed from her mother's care by Tower Hamlets council in east London. It said foster carers stopped her eating bacon, confused her by speaking Arabic, and removed a crucifix. A Times executive acknowledged the story caused ""enormous offence"". The complaint was made by Tower Hamlets, which had taken the child into care. The council said a front-page headline, ""Judge rules child must leave Muslim foster home"", was misleading because it had sought to move the child to live with her grandmother - who herself had a Muslim background. The judge had already ruled thatthe girl had been given ""warm and appropriate"" careby two foster families. A council investigation,external- whose findings were agreed by all the parties in the case - found the allegations raised in the Times had been unsubstantiated. The Times mentions the Independent Press Standards Organisation ruling on the front page of Wednesday's paper and publishes the full adjudication on page two andonline,external. The Independent Press Standards Organisation ruled the paper should publish the adjudication on page six or more prominently, as well as on its website. On Tuesday, Ian Brunskill, the paper's assistant editor, addressed the Commons Home Affairs Committee investigation of the reporting of minorities. He said the paper's reporting had caused ""an enormous amount of trouble for us, for other people."" He added: ""It's caused enormous offence, it's caused enormous upset."" But he denied the paper had set out to cause offence. ""The suggestion that we might have set out to do that is frankly absurd,"" he said. The Times published three front-page stories on the case - this one is dated 30 August 2017. The chief executive of Tower Hamlets council, Will Tuckley, said it had complained because it wanted to defend its own foster carers. He said: ""From the start we had concerns about the validity of the allegations about the foster carers. ""For example one allegation was that they did not speak English, even though that is a prerequisite for any foster carer. ""The allegation that the foster placement was a bad choice by the council was also found by Ipso to be distorted information."" The Muslim Council of Britain said it was the first time a story relating to Islam had been corrected on the front page of a newspaper. Harun Khan, the organisation's secretary general, said: ""It is about time the Times was forced to apologise for promoting what was widely known to be an inaccurate, misleading and bigoted narrative about Muslims. ""We hope that this will mark a turning point in the tolerance the Times has shown for anti-Muslim bigotry in its coverage and commentary.""

"It will be up to youngsters and their parents to ensure the new age limit is respected Popular messaging service WhatsApp is banning under-16s from using its platform in the European Union. Users must currently be at least 13,but the firm is changing the rules,externalahead of the introduction of new EU data privacy regulations in May. The app, which is owned by Facebook, will ask users to confirm their age when prompted to agree new terms of service in the next few weeks. It has not said how the age limit will be enforced. At present, WhatsApp does not ask users their age when they join, nor does it cross-reference their Facebook or Instagram accounts to find out. About a third of all UK-based 12- to 15-year-olds active on social media use WhatsApp,according to a 2017 report,externalby the media regulator Ofcom. That made it the fifth most popular social network with the age group after Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube. The chief executive of Childnet International - a charity that is a member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board - said he thought the firm had more work to do to communicate the change. Will Gardner added that the parents and carers of 13-15 year olds had been put in a ""difficult position"" by the raised age limit. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May, will give people much more control over how companies use their information. It also includes specific rules to protect youngsters whose personal data is processed in order to provide them with online services. Such websites and appsare obliged to,external""make reasonable efforts to verify"" that a parent or guardian has given consent for their child's data to be handled. The law says this obligation applies to under-16s, although some countries - including the UK - have been allowed to set the cut-off limit lower, at 13. Under-age social media use 'on the rise' Reality Check: Who controls your data? Facebook cuts off billions from privacy law Are you ready for a data privacy shake-up? WhatsApp, which has faced scrutiny for its data sharing practices in the past, said its move would help it meet the ""new high standards of transparency"" in the EU. Effectively, it saves it the trouble of having to seek consent in those countries enforcing the 16-years-old age limit. However, the app plans to keep its age limit at 13 in the rest of the world.

"Site seized: The splash page that has replaced webstresser since the takedown A website blamed for launching more than four million cyber-attacks around the world, including attempts to crash banks in the UK, has been taken down in a major international investigation. The operation, which involved the UK's National Crime Agency, blocked Webstresser.org - which allows criminals to buy attacks on businesses. The site was used by a British suspect to attack high street banks last year, causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage. Six suspected members of the gang behind the site have been arrested, with computers seized in the UK, Holland and elsewhere. Webstresser: Investigators say it posed as a legitimate business The site targeted in this week's operation was one of many operating openly on the web as a ""stresser"" business, offering to test a company's cyber-defences. Investigators say that the gang sold cyber-attacks for as little as $14.99 (almost Â£11) - meaning that anyone who wanted to attack a web service could do so with little chance of being traced. The history of cyber-crime forums Don't become a victim of cyber crime Major UK cyber attack warning Webstresser offered a form of cyber-attack known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), in which a target website is overwhelmed by requests for access. In practice, this means that the target, be they an online bank or a secondary school's portal for students, can seize up and crash, unless the attack is blocked. Stresses are also used to settle scores between business rivals, carry out industrial espionage or to hold businesses to ransom. Identifying how the attack is being launched and where it is coming from requires huge amounts of effort, as specialist online investigators must hunt for the source of the crippling data. Sliding scale of costs: Clients offered different levels of service Over the last two days, seven suspected members of the group behind webstresser.org were arrested or subject to searches in the Netherlands, Serbia, Croatia and Canada, with support from Police Scotland, Europol and US authorities. On Wednesday morning, Dutch police completed the operation by identifying the location of the website's servers and seizing them, replacing the site with a page announcing that law enforcement agencies had taken the service offline. Investigators from the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit searched an address in Bradford linked to a suspect who is believed to have used webstresser to attack seven of the UK's biggest banks in November last year. The BBC understands that the banking attack incident, which has never been publicly confirmed, cost some of the institutions hundreds of thousands of pounds as they were forced to shut down systems while experts worked around the clock to repel the attack. Jo Goodall, the lead investigator in the operation for the National Crime Agency, said: ""Cyber-crime by default is a threat that crosses borders. The arrests made over the past two days show that the internet does not provide bulletproof anonymity to offenders and we expect to identify further suspects linked to the site in the coming weeks and months. ""We have seen how cyber-attacks have real-world consequences resulting in actual physical harm, as well as causing reputational and financial damage to businesses of all sizes."" The UK government has justpublished its latest annual survey,externallooking at how businesses and - for the first time - charities are handling data breaches and attacks. The study is based on the responses of 1,519 companies and 569 charities to a telephone questionnaire carried out between October and December. The headline findings were: that 43% of the businesses and 19% of the charities had reported a breach or attack in the previous year that 74% of the businesses and 53% of the charities said that cyber-security was a high priority for senior management yet only 27% of the businesses and 21% of the charities said they had formal cyber-security policies the average cost incurred by a breach that resulted in a financial loss was Â£3,100 for businesses and Â£1,030 for charities the most common type of attack reported by those that had suffered a breach had involved their staff being targeted by a fraudulent emails or websites ""Given how many breaches UK businesses are facing, not training staff on why security is important invites trouble,"" commented Piers Wilson from cyber-security firm Huntsman. ""Just as we don't let people drive without getting their licence, every untrained employee could pose a threat.""

"After six days of being locked out of their internet accounts, only half of TSB customers can now access them. The bank has admitted that its internet bank is operating at only 50% capacity, although its mobile app is at 90% capacity. The bank's upgrade to its banking systems has been causing chaos for customers since the weekend. Chief executive Paul Pester said ""our internet banking and mobile app isn't functioning as well as it should be"". He apologised and said no one would be left out of pocket. Earlier on Wednesday, he had tweeted: ""Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.""

The bank had hoped to restore services on Tuesday afternoon, having taken down its mobile app and online banking ""for a few hours"" earlier in the day after it received a huge backlash from annoyed customers. However, delays ensued because of the large volumes of people wanting to use it after the scheduled downtime. TSB customers still locked out of accounts TSB warned its users that it was carrying out upgrades at the weekend between 16:00 on Friday and 18:00 on Sunday. But a number of customers reported problems long after the scheduled restart time, with many worried about being able to pay bills or even get cash to pay for essentials. On Wednesday morning, some hours after the system had been back up and running for the second time, Martin Skipworth told the BBC: ""I actually managed to log in to TSB internet banking this morning, but once in, it is so slow and when you switch pages, it just hangs. ""I have tried again and can't access anything now,  It's a complete shambles."" Bruce McFee runs Environmental Services Pest Control in Paisley. He told the BBC: ""TSB isn't fixed! We're a small company of three and currently can't pay wages or suppliers. ""We can't get through on the bank's helpline, it takes more than half an hour. ""I spent an hour and a half to make one payment. I'm stuck in the office when I should be out working."" Others took to Twitter to express their anger or worry about charges. Allow Twitter content?

"US cable TV giant Comcast has made a formal Â£22bn bid for Sky that values the UK broadcaster at Â£12.50 a share. The move threatens Rupert Murdoch's attempts to take full control of the pay-TV group. The media mogul's 21st Century Fox has already agreed to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own - an offer worth about Â£19bn. Sky said it was withdrawing its recommendation for the Fox bid following Comcast's move. Sky shares closed 3.4% higher at Â£13.59 - more than Â£1 above Comcast's offer, suggesting a bidding war for control of Sky could erupt. Disney, which struck a$66bn deal with Foxin December to buy most of its entertainment assets, could also make a play for Sky. Comcast - the biggest US cable TV firm that also owns the NBC network and Universal Pictures - said its bid offered a premium of about 16% to Fox's Â£10.75 a share offer. Chief executive Brian Roberts said: ""We have long believed Sky is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast. Sky has a strong business, excellent customer loyalty, and a valued brand."" The gloves are officially off. The big winners here are the Sky shareholders who can now sit back and watch these two slug it out in a bidding war. Now there is a better offer formally on the table, the board of Sky has duly retracted its recommendation to shareholders that they accept the Fox offer. We now wait for the Murdoch response. The markets think there will be one as shares are trading Â£1 higher than the Comcast bid. The fight is already getting dirty, with teams of lawyers and PRs on both sides preparing briefing notes about each others previous misdemeanours, scandals and broken promises. The bottom lines are these. A US company - either Comcast or Disney - will end up owning Sky. Over decades of string-pulling and empire building, Rupert Murdoch has usually got what he wants. But as he tries to dismantle it (in the most financially advantageous way possible) - it's not all going his way. George Salmon, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst. ""Part of the reason the value of the deal is significantly higher than what Fox originally put forward is that Sky has since secured three more years of rights to Premier League football at a reduced cost. As far as the value of Sky goes, that's a game-changer,"" he said. ""Sky has proven the Premier League deals are well worth the outlay. The group looks on course to deliver operating profits of Â£1.5bn this year, double what it earned ten years ago."" Comcast owns the NBC network in the US Comcast said it would continue to engage with Sky's independent directors to win a recommendation for its deal. In February it said it intended to make an offer at the same level of Â£12.50 a share. Comcast added that it planned to agree several legally binding commitments with regard to Sky and in particular for Sky News, as well as keeping the group's Osterley headquarters in west London for at least five years. Mr Roberts added: ""With its 23 million retail customers, leading positions in the UK, Italy, and Germany, and its history of strong financial performance, we see significant opportunities for growth by combining our businesses."" He added: ""We also understand the role that Sky plays in UK society and in its customers' lives and we are determined to be responsible and trusted owners of Sky.""

"This video can not be played ""I have a gun in my pocket"" â the moment Alek Minassian was arrested. A van driver accused of killing 10 people in Toronto posted to Facebook minutes before the attack to praise a woman-hating mass shooter. Alek Minassian - charged on Tuesday with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder - also referred to the misogynistic ""incel"" Reddit group. Police say the 25-year-old intentionally drove a rental van into pedestrians on a busy pavement. The suspect was arrested several streets away after a tense standoff with police. The 10 dead and 14 wounded are ""predominantly"" women, ranging in age from their 20s to their 80s, police say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was a ""senseless attack and a horrific tragedy"". The suspect's Facebook post, which the social network has confirmed as real, praised Elliott Rodger, a 22-year-old from California who killed six people in a 2014shooting rampage through Isla Vista, California, before turning the gun on himself. It read: ""The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!"" The term ""incel"" refers to a now-banned group on the message site Reddit, used by Rodger, where young men discussed their lack of sexual activity, blaming women for the problem. ""Chads and Stacys"" refers to attractive men and women who are perceived as better than or unavailable to ""incels"", which is short for ""involuntary celibate"". Toronto van attack: What's an incel? He was brought to court on Tuesday to hear the charges against him.

"Alfie Evans was taken off life support on Monday evening The parents of seriously ill toddler Alfie Evans have launched a further appeal in a bid to take him abroad for treatment. A High Court judge said the 23-month-old may be allowed home from Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where his life support was withdrawn. But Mr Justice Hayden refused to allow Tom Evans and Kate James to move their son to a hospital in Rome. The Court of Appeal judges have retired to consider their decision. At the start of the hearing, three senior judges heard Alfie, whose life support was removed on Monday, was ""struggling"". Jason Coppel QC, representing Ms James, said she had told him her son needed ""immediate intervention"". Paul Diamond, acting for Mr Evans, told judges he had spoken to his client before the hearing, who had told him to ""save my boy"". ""He would leave no stone unturned... He is clutching at straws,"" he said. Mr Diamond argued that there had been a ""significant change of circumstances"" because Alfie was still breathing after life support treatment stopped on Monday evening. He said an ""alternative"" was available, and a military air ambulance was on standby ""at the request of the Pope"". Who is Alfie Evans and what is the row over his treatment? When are parents denied the final say? World's reaction to Alfie Evans case ""We submit there is a likelihood of Alfie having some pleasure in life,"" Mr Diamond said. But appeal judge Lady Justice King disagreed. She said evidence showed that, while Alfie was unlikely to feel pain, ""tragically everything that would allow him to have some appreciation of life, or even the mere touch of his mother, has been destroyed irrevocably"". Michael Mylonas QC, for Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said Mr Diamond had accepted ""categorically"" before the appeal court and before Mr Justice Hayden that ""there is no new medical evidence to contradict the evidence"" that was before the High Court in February. ""It was never suggested that death would be instantaneous."" He said Alfie has previously survived six to 10 days without a ventilator and it has ""never been said to [his] family that Alfie would die immediately or before sundown"". Mr Mylonas said the ""tragedy"" for the parents was that Alfie looked like a normal child. Outside court, two people believed to be German air ambulance staff were escorted from Alder Hey by police. They were seen speaking to members of the Evans family. This video can not be played Tom Evans plans to lodge an appeal as Alfie ""is not struggling, he is fighting"". On Tuesday, his parents, backed by the Christian Legal Centre, brought a fresh application for Alfie to be moved from Liverpool to the Vatican-linked Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome. At a further hearing in Manchester, Mr Evans claimed his son had fared ""significantly better"" than expected after life support was withdrawn, suggesting his health had improved. But Mr Justice Hayden rejected this, saying: ""The sad truth is that it is not."" Instead, the judge said, Alfie's continued life was a ""shaft of light"" and a ""special opportunity"" for his parents to spend time with him - not the time for more legal manoeuvres. He also criticised the ""malign hand"" of one of the family's advisers, law student Pavel Stroilov, who had, the court heard, been party to Mr Evans lodging a private prosecution of Alder Hey Hospital doctors, allegedly for murder. This video can not be played BBC News went to meet the people calling themselves 'Alfie's Army' He said the hospital had provided ""world class"" care for the child. The best Alfie's parents could hope for, Mr Justice Hayden said, was to ""explore"" the options of removing him from intensive care either to a ward, a hospice or his home. Roger Kiska, from the Christian Legal Centre, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme the judge's comments were ""highly inappropriate"". Mr Kiska said the judge was speaking of ""a private prosecution of anyone who delivered medicine, drugs, which would hasten Alfie's death, which is de facto euthanasia and a crime in this country"". A doctor, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said for Alfie to be allowed home would require a ""sea change"" in attitude from the child's family. He told the court they feared that in the ""worst case"" they would try to take Alfie abroad. This video can not be played Tom Evans says Alfie has been breathing without support The toddler has been in Alder Hey since December 2016 with a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition. Medics have said Alfie's brain has been destroyed by his illness, and it is in his best interests to withdraw life support. In a statement released after the hearing, Alder Hey Children's Hospital said its ""top priority remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves to ensure his comfort, dignity and privacy are maintained throughout. ""This includes working closely with Kate and Tom as they spend this precious time together with him."" Mr Evans and Ms James had hoped Alfie could be taken to the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, which has links to the Vatican, where his care could continue. They have lost a series of legal challenges against a High Court ruling in February that Alder Hey could withdraw ventilation.

"It will be up to youngsters and their parents to ensure the new age limit is respected Popular messaging service WhatsApp is banning under-16s from using its platform in the European Union. Users must currently be at least 13,but the firm is changing the rules,externalahead of the introduction of new EU data privacy regulations in May. The app, which is owned by Facebook, will ask users to confirm their age when prompted to agree new terms of service in the next few weeks. It has not said how the age limit will be enforced. At present, WhatsApp does not ask users their age when they join, nor does it cross-reference their Facebook or Instagram accounts to find out. About a third of all UK-based 12- to 15-year-olds active on social media use WhatsApp,according to a 2017 report,externalby the media regulator Ofcom. That made it the fifth most popular social network with the age group after Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube. The chief executive of Childnet International - a charity that is a member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board - said he thought the firm had more work to do to communicate the change. Will Gardner added that the parents and carers of 13-15 year olds had been put in a ""difficult position"" by the raised age limit. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May, will give people much more control over how companies use their information. It also includes specific rules to protect youngsters whose personal data is processed in order to provide them with online services. Such websites and appsare obliged to,external""make reasonable efforts to verify"" that a parent or guardian has given consent for their child's data to be handled. The law says this obligation applies to under-16s, although some countries - including the UK - have been allowed to set the cut-off limit lower, at 13. Under-age social media use 'on the rise' Reality Check: Who controls your data? Facebook cuts off billions from privacy law Are you ready for a data privacy shake-up? WhatsApp, which has faced scrutiny for its data sharing practices in the past, said its move would help it meet the ""new high standards of transparency"" in the EU. Effectively, it saves it the trouble of having to seek consent in those countries enforcing the 16-years-old age limit. However, the app plans to keep its age limit at 13 in the rest of the world.

Most social media apps - including Snapchat, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Musical.ly and Reddit - are restricted to those aged 13 and over. This is in part because a US law -the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule,external(Coppa) - bans online services from collecting personal information about younger children. Facebook did, however, launch Messenger Kids, which is targeted at children as young as six, last December. It is an ad-free service designed to be compliant with Coppa. WhatsApp will also be allowing all users to download a report detailing the data it holds on them as part of its new terms of service. That could include the make and model of the device they use, their contacts and groups and any blocked numbers. Facebook, which has also been criticised for its handling of personal data, is taking a different approachto younger users on its main service. To comply with GDPR, the social network is asking those aged 13 to 15 to nominate a parent or guardian to give permission for them to share information on the platform. If they do not, they will not see a fully personalised version of the platform. In a related development, Facebook's Instagram service has alsolaunched a ""data download"" tool,externalthat provides a file containing the photos, comments, archived Stories, contacts and other personal data a user had posted to the service in the past.

The bank had hoped to restore services on Tuesday afternoon, having taken down its mobile app and online banking ""for a few hours"" earlier in the day after it received a huge backlash from annoyed customers. However, delays ensued because of the large volumes of people wanting to use it after the scheduled downtime. TSB customers still locked out of accounts TSB warned its users that it was carrying out upgrades at the weekend between 16:00 on Friday and 18:00 on Sunday. But a number of customers reported problems long after the scheduled restart time, with many worried about being able to pay bills or even get cash to pay for essentials. On Wednesday morning, some hours after the system had been back up and running for the second time, Martin Skipworth told the BBC: ""I actually managed to log in to TSB internet banking this morning, but once in, it is so slow and when you switch pages, it just hangs.

"Hundreds of buildings have been tested following the Grenfell Tower fire last June The standard UK fire safety test of building materials fails to properly assess risk, a study conducted after the Grenfell Tower blaze has suggested. Research for insurance industry experts says the simulations in the British Standards Institution (BSI) test does not factor in ""real world"" conditions. The government used the test to examine flammable cladding on buildings after the Grenfell disaster. Ministers said they were committed to seeing safety standards improved. The study was commissioned by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) and carried out by the Fire Protection Association (FPA). Both organisations are now calling for a review of the tests. Post-Grenfell fire safety 'must improve' Grenfell flat doors fail police fire test Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? In Depth: Grenfell Tower fire The ABI says the findings of its test have been given toDame Judith Hackitt's review into building regulations and fire safety,external, which was set up after the fire at the tower block in North Kensington, west London, last June. The research suggests real-life fires could burn hotter, spread faster and last longer than those in the safety checks. BSI test BS8414 involves using a wood fire to set light to an L-shaped section of wall and allows architects to show a design including cladding and insulation is safe. Researchers found replacing a fifth of the wood used to start the fire with plastic - which is involved in many blazes - increased the temperature by 100C. The FPA said the tests assume the cladding is used as the manufacturer intended, but they will often be pierced by vents or ducts. It added that real buildings have gaps in their facades either by design or because of poor workmanship. When this was simulated in the tests oxygen fuelled the flames, which eventually spread up the entire test rig. In one instance the flames were still increasing and they had to be extinguished because lab safety conditions were exceeded. Fire tests to simulate the impact of cladding on buildings have been carried out for insurers The study comes after apolice investigation on a door from Grenfell Towerdiscovered it could only withstand a blaze for 15 minutes - not the 30 for which it was designed. A total of 71 residents of the 24-storey block died in the fire on 14 June last year. Jonathan O'Neill, managing director of the FPA, said its tests ""confirm long-held concerns by many in the fire sector that the current cladding test standard requires urgent review"". Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said they were ""yet more evidence that fundamental reform is needed to keep our homes and commercial premises safe from fire"". He added: ""It is a matter of urgency that we create the right testing regime that properly replicates real-world conditions and keeps pace with building innovation and modern design."" A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We work closely with the British Standards Institution and they stand ready to present these findings to their expert technical committee who will review this accordingly.""

"This video can not be played ""I have a gun in my pocket"" â the moment Alek Minassian was arrested. A van driver accused of killing 10 people in Toronto posted to Facebook minutes before the attack to praise a woman-hating mass shooter. Alek Minassian - charged on Tuesday with 10 counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder - also referred to the misogynistic ""incel"" Reddit group. Police say the 25-year-old intentionally drove a rental van into pedestrians on a busy pavement. The suspect was arrested several streets away after a tense standoff with police. The 10 dead and 14 wounded are ""predominantly"" women, ranging in age from their 20s to their 80s, police say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was a ""senseless attack and a horrific tragedy"". The suspect's Facebook post, which the social network has confirmed as real, praised Elliott Rodger, a 22-year-old from California who killed six people in a 2014shooting rampage through Isla Vista, California, before turning the gun on himself. It read: ""The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!"" The term ""incel"" refers to a now-banned group on the message site Reddit, used by Rodger, where young men discussed their lack of sexual activity, blaming women for the problem. ""Chads and Stacys"" refers to attractive men and women who are perceived as better than or unavailable to ""incels"", which is short for ""involuntary celibate"". Toronto van attack: What's an incel? He was brought to court on Tuesday to hear the charges against him. His head shaved and wearing a white jumpsuit, he held his hands behind his back, showing little emotion throughout. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He will remain in custody and return to court on 10 May for a bail hearing. He was ordered to make no contact with surviving victims. A man believed to be his relative sat in the front row of the courtroom and wept. Asked by reporters if he had anything to say, the man replied, ""Sorry"". Yonge Street, where the attack took place, remained closed on Tuesday as police continued their investigation. While the authorities have not yet formally identified any of the dead, three have been named in the media. Anne Marie D'Amico was ""full of life"", her colleague said Anne-Marie D'Amicoworked for the US investment company Invesco, Canadian broadcaster CBC reports. The company's Canadian headquarters are on Yonge Street. Toronto van attack victim 'full of life' The Jordanian embassy in Ottawa has told the BBC that one of its citizens was among the victims. Jordanian media named him asMunir Abdo Habib al-Najjar.He was reportedly in Canada to visit his son. Toronto residentDorothy Sewell,80, has also been named by relatives as one of the victims. Dorothy Sewell was a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team Her grandson, Elwood Delaney, said she was the ""best grandma anyone could have asked for"". The South Korean embassy in Canada confirmed to the BBC that two of its citizens were among the dead and another was critically ill. Their names have not been disclosed. The 15 injured remain in hospitals throughout Toronto. This video can not be played People gather the day after the attack to remember the victims From the northern Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, he was not previously known to the authorities. There ""would appear to be no national security connections"", public safety minister Ralph Goodale said. He attended a school for students with special needs in north Toronto, former classmates say. He would be seen walking around Thornlea Secondary School with his head down and hands clasped tightly together making meowing noises, Shereen Chami told Reuters news agency. But she added that he had not been violent: ""He wasn't a social person, but from what I remember he was absolutely harmless."" He went on to attend Seneca College in the North York area of Toronto, where the van incident took place, CBC reports. The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has also confirmed he was a member for two months in late 2017 before asking to be voluntarily released.

"Farmers and herders now work together in the new mine Environmental changes have caused tensions between settled farmers and nomadic herders in Nigeria to flare into ethnic conflict. But could working together to serve the demands of modern consumers heal ancient ethnic rifts, asks BBC World Service correspondent Stephanie Hegarty. As the sun sets over the stony hills of Jos, long-horn cows climb awkwardly down into a rocky gorge. They shimmy their bony shoulders, navigating a path worn into the stone over decades of this same grazing ritual. In this picture-postcard of serenity it's hard to imagine that until recently this community in central Nigeria was at war with itself. It's one of the world's most ancient conflicts. Across the northern part of Africa the desert is creeping outwards, swallowing up fertile green land and pushing Fulani herdsmen into conflict with farmers over grazing rights. This video can not be played 'We didn't believe we could work together' ""My people would kill them,"" says Henry Botson, a man in his 30s from the Berom tribe. He lives in Barkin Ladi, Plateau state, where in 2011 a brutal conflict flared between his people and their neighbours. ""And if we passed into their own territory they would kill my people."" Mr Botson is short and stocky, wearing a green beret with a miniature AK-47 assault rifle on a silver chain around his neck. And this is part of the problem. Since the collapse of Libya, guns have flooded into West Africa, most of them ending up in Nigeria. Mass burials - like this in Dogo Nahaw - have been a common thing during the conflict In Barkin Ladi, 268km (167 miles) east of the capital Abuja, the period of more than five years in which thousands of people were killed in ethnic clashes is simply labelled ""the crisis"".  The death rate across central and southern Nigeria averaged more than 2,000 a year between 2011 and 2016,according to campaign group Crisis International,external. Dozens buried after Nigeria clashes Who are Nigeria's Fulani herdsmen? ""The Fulani man destroyed the Berom man's farm, and the Berom man killed the Fulani man's cattle and the children rearing the cattle,"" says Farouk Abubaker, a tall, well-built Fulani man in a dusty beige tunic. ""We saw them as very wicked people. We saw them as barbarians because they killed little children and women, even pregnant women. ""A lot of horrible things happened - but all that is now history."" Because two years ago, it stopped. Tin deposits were discovered nearby, just as global prices - driven by demand from electronic components manufacturers - were rising. Now Mr Abubaker and Mr Botson work together on the same mining shaft, digging for the metal along the same narrow gorge that Fulani herders and their cattle pass through every day. Dangerous work: Many people have died in shaft collapses It's a hole in the ground as much as 40ft (12m) deep and just wide enough for one man to crawl into. Using a bucket, shovels and a pulley system made from tree-trunks and a cable, these men plunge into the earth pulling out balefuls of dirt. It's dangerous work - many have died when mine shafts have collapsed - and they have to trust each other. ""I'm really surprised,"" Mr Botson says. ""I didn't believe that we could live together like this; work together, talk together and do something like this together."" A pulley system is made from tree-trunks and a cable Workers then pan for precious tin From dawn, the mine buzzes with the sound of hundreds of men, women and even children. Some of them crouch over shallow streams, sloshing the ochre-coloured dirt around in buckets until a dark grey metal appears. Others sell head torches, tools and batteries, or clear plastic bags of water and freshly cooked food. Everywhere on this mine Fulani and Berom are working together in small teams. But how? When a new governor was elected in Plateau state in 2015, he promised to bring an end to the crisis. When he hired Joseph Lengmang, 42, as head of the Plateau State Peace Building Agency, many doubted whether a man that young would have the authority to summon local elders to sit down together. ""This government inherited an almost anarchic environment,"" Mr Lengmang recalls. ""It took quite some time. When it started they were shouting at each other, it looked like there would be violence. But we got experienced mediators... in the end we had a peace accord"". The Plateau Peace Building Agency's work continues across the state Plateau state has been balancing on the precipice of a delicate peace ever since, with the ethnic conflict becoming a national crisis. Clashes occur across the country's Middle Belt almost every week, and six people were recently killed in Barkin Ladi. Many also blame local and national politicians for stoking the tension to rouse support as Nigeria enters an election year. It comes against a backdrop of three years of high inflation. While food prices have risen, so has the cost of fertilizers and fuel. And while many farmers rely on second jobs to subsidise meagre yields, unemployment has rocketed since 2013. Mr Lengmang believes operations like the one in Barkin Ladi have a part to play in keeping the peace. ""It's very, very important... a means of livelihood to many people"", he says. ""They've learnt also in the experience they've had... if there is chaos and instability and violence, everybody loses"". However, he adds that there can be tension even among those working together in the mines, if the proceeds of their labour are shared ""fairly"". Thomas Johji was one of a small group of Berom men who discovered this particular tin deposit a few months ago. As it was in the middle of a Fulani grazing area, it was crucial to get their neighbours' co-operation. So they invited Fulani people to mine with them. Mr Johji is in his 20s and doesn't remember how ""the crisis"" began. ""Now we can even sleep here in the bush with the Fulani; wake up together, play together,"" he says. ""The Fulani have forgotten about what happened, and we are trying to forget too."" It may not be that easy for most people. A deep sense of mistrust persists between the ethnic groups. One Berom woman working at an older tin deposit nearby says she feels uncomfortable around Fulani people. She finds it difficult to trust those she says killed many of her friends and relatives. ""Even now we are afraid - but it is up to God,"" she says, adding that she is here out of pure necessity. ""If you stay home, how will you eat?"" Mr Lengmang accepts Plateau state's uneasy peace is not yet sustainable. ""There are legitimate grievances that have not been addressed and a deep-seated sense of mistrust between ethnic groups,"" he says. ""The mining process has to be more inclusive."" When tin deposits become scarce, fighting is bound to erupt over resources. Mr Lengmang says miners have a role to play in peace-building. His agency is exploring whether they could lead training in conflict resolution, or encourage parties to sign peace accords before they start work on a deposit. But Mr Abubaker believes the industry is already doing something to foster peace. ""Mining promotes unity and understanding among the different tribes,"" he says, ""just as football does."" ""It makes us happy. I pray - and hope - that we are able to sustain it."" Crossing Divides: a week of stories about people creating connections in a polarised world.

"Armed only with food cooked by grieving mothers, Guadalupe Cruz enters the battle to prevent young people from dying on Chicago's streets. She's driving to the funeral of Jose de Jesus Aguilar, 14 - the third she's attended in six weeks. Jose entered a rival gang's territory in a stolen car with a friend. He was shot dead. ""I will pick up the chicken and bread on the way,"" says Guadalupe, better known as Lupe, braving the afternoon traffic. She needs to be at the funeral to try to persuade Jose's friends not to retaliate against the gang they believe shot him. She works forCure Violence, a public health programme,externalcreated in Chicago in 2000 to stop the spread of violence at source, the way you would treat a disease epidemic. Life and death on the lost streets of Chicago US gun culture: 10 charts Funerals are key moments for this. And food, traditionally served after Mexican burials, is essential, Lupe explains. She wants to prevent Jose's friends using eating as an excuse to go out on the street after paying their respects. Lupe is picking up food from her network of mothers who have cooked chicken, rice, salad and pastries. They began helping her after losing children to gang violence, and each greets the youth worker with a hug. Frances is accompanying her and helps load the trays into the car. Her 17-year-old son was killed some years ago, she says. ""When we talk about our children that are not here,duele- it hurts."" The Spanish word is the only one she says in her second language throughout the conversation, and it drips with her pain. They call at the home of another mother, Amy, who's cooked pasta. She also lost her son Gregory, 18, to violence. ""Closing that casket and never seeing his face again, not seeing him grow old, to see me grow old, or see him with his kids, that's the most painful thing in the world,"" she says. Too grief-stricken to get out of bed, Amy relied on Lupe to arrange the funeral. Now she will do ""whatever"" Lupe asks. ""She doesn't see rivals or gang members, she sees everybody as a community, as people. That's how we are supposed to be,"" says Amy. Jose's mother died when he was young and his father wasn't around. His death gets only a brief mention in the media, in a city where there were 650 killings in the last year - more than bigger cities like New York or Los Angeles. Lupe spends most of the day driving - hands-free set ensuring she doesn't miss a call - and fixing the final details of the funeral, far from the neighbourhoods of the two rival gangs. She talks to mothers and young people, flowing with ease between Spanish, English, formal and street. On arrival at the funeral home, Lupe and Frances carefully arrange the trays of food on a long table. Jose's friends trickle in, wearing hoodies bearing his photograph and the dates of his birth and death - so poignantly close. Some have brought their children. They huddle around the casket. They cry together and console each other. They play music for Jose. Lupe sits to talk. ""I tell them that what they're going through - going to the funeral of their 14-year-old friend - isn't normal. Because it's all been accepted and normalised. They have to carry themselves as if they were grown-ups, but they're still kids."" Lupe understands their sorrow. She grew up and works in the Little Village,La Villita, a predominantly Mexican West Side neighbourhood. She never knew her father, and her mother died when she was a child. As more young people arrive, her demeanour changes and the tension builds. ""Today is important as we could lose another life. When they get out of here, they will be carrying a lot of pain. Some of them are armed."" After the funeral, amid talk of retaliation, Lupe grabs the older, influential ones -los que los jalan(the ones who pull, lead them). She takes them for pizza, letting them spill out their emotions, and asks community leaders in both areas to take other young people away from hot spots where they usually hang out at night. The funeral is by no means the trickiest situation she has had to defuse. She tells of the time she had to go to a hospital to calm more than 50 young people who were outside. ""I talked to the hospital staff to see if I could get just one person in to find out if their friend was okay. These calls always happen at 3am."" This is typical of Cure Violence's methods. Epidemiologist Gary Slutkin, who for years battled Aids and tuberculosis in Africa, founded the organisation after concluding that violence mimics the path of these infectious diseases. The work includes detecting conflicts and cooling people down, identifying the highest risk and changing their behaviour, and changing the norms and expectations. ""Someone who's doing violence, whether they are a mass shooter or someone in a neighbourhood, has picked up that by contagion, by seeing others doing it,"" he argues, saying young people and gang members are ""miscategorised"" as bad people. ""Frankly, it's medieval - it's the way we used to look at people who had leprosy or the plague."" Lupe agrees: ""People have already put this tag on them. They're not bad people, they have a story, just like we all do. You take them out of the community and they love to go eat ice cream, they don't take advantage of you. It's the time that you give them that is important for them. We can sit for three hours and have a milkshake that will melt to water."" She knows better than to try to build bridges between gangs with long histories. Some of Chicago's biggest gangs were formed in the 1960s and 1970s and membership is inherited. Their territories - packed with foreclosed homes and boarded-up shops - are divided by long avenues, junctions and bridges. Instead, she creates links between young people who don't trust the adults they feel have failed them throughout their lives, and the adults who only read about youths in scattered press reports, or see them hanging out on corners. ""We organise activities like late night barbecues, daytime cookouts, peace festivals, vigils and marches, and other people see them cleaning, serving food, they start getting to know them. Many times they haven't even spoken to them. And they tell me 'wow, this kid's smart',"" says Lupe. Anna and Luis, a young couple with two kids, only secured their apartment after Lupe persuaded the landlord to give them a chance. ""A lot of people don't believe in us 'cause we're young"", says Anna. ""We have to show them different."" They struggle to stay on the ""right path"", Luis admits. ""It's real hard not going back to the things that I used to do 'cause I'm in the neighbourhood. I have bad times but Lupe always tells us just keep positive, doing what we're doing."" Lupe calls them daily, alerting them to stay inside whenever she hears of trouble. Luis tries to stay away from gang violence. For Luis, the key to leaving the streets was getting advice from Lupe, whom he trusted: ""You need someone who has gone through it and that's gonna go click in your mind."" Raul Gonzales, another member of the Cure Violence team, understands how youths feel. He belonged to one of the biggest gangs in the city and spent time in prison. ""[Violence is] all they know; that's how they grew. In this environment, if somebody jumps on you, you will go back and jump on them."" He takes them to a boxing club to get them off the street. If they will not listen, he thinks laterally. ""I try to talk to somebody else that I know they might listen to. Could be for example his uncle, who used to run with the group... But it's gotta be somebody credible."" ""Our programme ain't gonna stop all the conflict, but we stop a lot of problems. We do the job the police can't do, not because they don't want to do it, but because [the youths] don't want no policeman to talk to them."" It's hard to assess the impact of any programme in violence against a general backdrop of falling crime rates across the US. However, independent evaluations of the Cure Violence approach point to significant crime reductions in the communities it serves, when compared with similar areas without such programmes. In 2009, Chicago'sNorthwestern University research suggested an overall reduction,externalof between 41% and 73% across seven communities served by a combination of Cure Violence and other community efforts. It also said ""retaliation homicides"" were eradicated in five of the eight communities studied. A 2015John Jay College of Criminal Justice study,externalfound New York neighbourhoods served by Cure Violence had experienced an 18% decline in the average homicide rate between 2010 and 2013, while in comparison areas it had increased 69%. More independent studies were conducted in different cities, with similar results. The Chicago study also identified how Cure Violence workers dealt with underlying problems like unemployment, education, interpersonal relationships or more practical issues like getting identity documents. But as she sets out on her Sunday rounds, Lupe acknowledges: ""Many of these young people aren't ready for the change of life. They have to do their part."" Frankie, 17, is ready. ""I'm tired of this,"" he says. ""Tired of people getting killed every day. Watching your back."" His first step is to return to school, and Lupe gives him a letter so that they accept him the next day. She's also supporting Frankie's mother to arrange mentoring so she can help young people in her neighbourhood. ""They call her mama, and she has a lot of influence, so... she could try to guide them in the positive path,"" says Lupe. Lupe's weekend winds up at a bustling Chicago pizza restaurant where she meets Samantha, whom she mentored through high school and who is studying to become a paralegal. ""A lot of my friends were getting killed, and I just didn't want to end up like that,"" says Samantha. Over potato wedges and pizza, Lupe jokes about how tough Samantha was, recalling 2am trips to collect her from the police station. Samantha shows how she tattooed Guadalupe's name on her arm, though Lupe still isn't keen on the result. Samantha says life remains hard, describing how she and her daughter witnessed a shooting on their street corner. ""Every day someone's getting shot. Back-to-back, 10 years, I've been to, like, 10 funerals,"" she adds. Samantha pays for the meal using her own debit card, making Lupe glow with pride. As night falls, they remember when Lupe would buy pizza for Samantha and her friends every Friday - anything to keep them off the streets on a ""hot"" night. ""It's the little things, you know,"" says Lupe. ""These little things are big for them. People have failed them their whole lives. So I do this, no matter how tired I am.""

"Venezuela's political landscape is among the world's most bitterly divided. But can shared passions inspire opponents to put differences aside for the common good? If anything can unite two Venezuelans, it's the rhythm of salsa. The country is in the grip of an economic crisis and suffering severe food shortages. Last year more than 120 people were killed as anti-government protests led to violence, amid claims of police brutality and illegal detentions. So it might seem unthinkable that music could bring together aChavista- a member of a group named for their fervent support of the late President Hugo ChÃ¡vez - and an activist determined to oust the ex-president's socialist successors. But high in the capital, Caracas, political opponents Pedro GarcÃ­a and Leandro BuzÃ³n are dancing to the same beat in a bid to shape a better future. ""A drum opens your heart. It unites even enemies,"" says Mr Garcia. ""We're from the same country, and in its time of need we're going to reach out our hands and work together."" The ongoing economic crisis has deepened the problems in San AgustÃ­n Mr GarcÃ­a, a musician and former drug addict known asGuapachÃ¡(hot dancer), was born in the slum neighbourhood of San AgustÃ­n 57 years ago, and proudly states he has been ""clean"" for the past 30. The son of a Cuban musician, he grew up amid poverty and violence, and has six gunshot wounds to prove it. These days, through his percussion school, GuapachÃ¡ tries to steer youngsters away from trouble. ""Going through all that I have makes me understand these boys,"" he says. Like many slums in Caracas, the world's second most violent city, San AgustÃ­n has a history of gang violence. And the current crisis has deepened its problems. The relatives of some he works with have been involved in shootings. But GuapachÃ¡ points out: ""The kids are here."" US offers aid to fleeing Venezuelans What is behind the crisis in Venezuela? GuapachÃ¡ was inspired by the charismatic leadership of Mr ChÃ¡vez, who rode a wave of popular outrage at the traditional political elite to win power in 1998. Supporters revere his socialists for using oil riches to reduce inequality. It makes Mr BuzÃ³n an unlikely partner. He too grew up in abarrio. It is called January 23 - a traditional bastion of the left and a Chavista stronghold. But the 30-year-old sociologist and master of political science is no political ally. Anti-government demonstrations turned violent last year He campaigns for Primero Justicia, the opposition party led by Henrique Capriles - who was narrowly defeated in the bitterly contested election of 2013. Mr Capriles, who led calls for business to play a greater role and had demanded a presidential recall referendum, was seen as the opposition's best hope of gaining power. But he was banned from the electoral process last year over ""administrative irregularities"".His sidelining triggered street protests and claims of dictatorship. Despite this, GuapachÃ¡ says: ""Leandro is mypana(friend); it's like he's my son."" Mr BuzÃ³n founded the social organization Caracas MiConvive to work with victims of violence, promoting peace and driving change within communities. This shared motivation for improving the lives of ordinary Venezuelans prompted a mutual friend to introduce them five years ago. Mr BuzÃ³n had heard about GuapachÃ¡'s youth work and remembers telling the older man: ""Look, GuapachÃ¡, I like what you do. I do community work too, let's sit down and talk."" These days, five afternoons a week, they can be found together, concerning themselves solely with salsa. ""GuapachÃ¡ is still a romantic, he still believes in [ChÃ¡vez's] 'Revolution'â¦ but he is a man with the biggest heart,"" says Mr BuzÃ³n. Sitting alongside the boys tapping out a rhythm at the San AgustÃ­n percussion school, the men glance at each other and enjoy the effects of their work. Oraiker, 12, improvising with a classmate, shares their vision. ""I want to play music and help children who are on the street,"" he says. But his tutors' alliance was not initially welcomed. Mr BuzÃ³n says fellow activists labelled his new friend an infiltrator. ""People thought it was offensive when he went about wearing a shirt with the slogan: 'ChÃ¡vez, the heart of the people'."" GuapachÃ¡, who even today sports a shirt decorated with an image of Mr ChÃ¡vez's eyes, faced the same problem. ""They asked me, 'Are you going to work with theseEscuÃ¡lidos?',"" says the musician, using the slur Mr ChÃ¡vez's reserved for ""the squalid ones"" who challenged him. He remembers them being turned away from one community space where they wanted to perform. Hauling drums onto their shoulders, they had walked on to find somewhere else to teach the kids. But in this neighbourhood, with its steep streets and tin-roofed houses perched one on top of another, Chavistas and their opponents suffer the same problems. Their friendship came to be accepted. ""I could not have entered with the same strength, acceptance and affection in San AgustÃ­n, and GuapachÃ¡ could not have gone into other areas where I am well-accepted,"" says Mr Buzon. ""The story of Venezuela that some politicians try to tell us is only meant to divide us."" Through their work, the friends try to spread a message of unity to allow the country to move forward. As Mr Buzon puts it: ""There is no eastern or western salsa, there is only one salsa.""
