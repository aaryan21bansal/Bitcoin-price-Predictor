"Children are among tens of thousands of people who have fled Ethiopia's Tigray region to Sudan About 2.3 million children in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region are cut off from humanitarian assistance as violence continues, the UN has warned. ""Protecting these children, many of whom are refugees and internally displaced... must be a priority,"" said the UN's children's agency Unicef. Despite deals with the Ethiopian government, humanitarian agencies say they are being denied access to Tigray. Government forces have been battling Tigray fighters since 4 November. The government says it is in control of the region and the conflict is over. But the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) says it is still fighting on various fronts. Hundreds, even thousands, of people are thought to have been killed in the conflict, while about 50,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan.

"Ingrid Messenger's mother called her loss ""devastating and irreparable"" A speeding driver who killed a 13-year-old girl and seriously injured her sister and mother has been jailed for four-and-a-half years. Ingrid Messenger was in the rear seat of a Citroen C4 hit by Tony Packenham's Land Rover Defender near Carlisle on 18 February 2019. The 47-year-old was ""absolutely flying"" at almost 80mph (128kmh) prior to the crash, the city's crown court heard. At a previous hearing, he admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Witnesses said the Land Rover was speeding before the crash at a crossroads between Stoneraise and Ivegill on the C1036. Ingrid's mother, Catriona Messenger, suffered a broken pelvis, ruptured diaphragm and spinal fractures, and was unable to walk unaided for three months. Her eldest daughter - front-seat passenger Erikka, then aged 15 - suffered a broken shoulder blade and bleeding on the brain. Tony Packenham had been warned he faced prison at a previous hearing Prosecutor Brendan Burke told the court the crash at 14:30 GMT would have been averted had Packenham not been driving ""well over"" the 60mph speed limit and ""in disregard"" of the wet road surface, warning signs before the crossroads and hazards created by two other vehicles. Video footage from his dashcam captured the crash and police recovered a memory stick he had thrown into bushes. Packenham, of Station Hill, Wigton, also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and admitted his dangerous driving caused serious injury to Mrs Messenger and Erikka. In an impact statement, Mrs Messenger had spoken of the ""devastating and irreparable loss"" of her daughter and said her heart was ""forever broken"". The court was told Packenham had been ""in a hurry"" to get home and was remorseful having ""devastated"" the lives of the Messengers and his own family, with his elderly parents being unable to visit him in prison. Judge Nicholas Barker said Packenham's speeding had been ""excessive"" with ""catastrophic and tragic consequences"".

"This video can not be played Security camera footage showed figures with torches and tools smashing one of the cabinets German police have arrested one of the fugitive twin brothers wanted in connection with a dramatic heist that targeted one of Europe's largest treasure collections. Officials said 21-year-old Mohammed Remmo was arrested in Berlin. He is the fourth suspect to be detained over last year's heist at Dresden's Green Vault museum. The suspects are accused of stealing more than a dozen diamond-encrusted items. Officials said it was impossible to value the items, simply calling them ""priceless"". Saxony's ruler, Augustus the Strong, created the collection in 1723 in what is one of the world's oldest museums. Police said they arrested Mr Remmo in the German capital on Monday night, and that he was being brought to the eastern city of Dresden on Tuesday. The search for his twin brother, Abdul Majed Remmo, was continuing with ""high intensity"", they said. The brothers were being sought internationally after evading arrest ina major police operation last month that saw three other suspects detained. All five are accused of ""serious gang robbery and two counts of arson"", officials say. Jewellery thefts that shocked the world What I've learned about the Hatton Garden raid Police say the suspects are members of a notorious criminal family network based in Berlin. Earlier this year, members of the Remmo family were convicted over another heist -the theft of a 100kg (220lb) solid-gold coin from the German capital's Bode Museum in 2017. On 25 November last year, in the early hours of the morning, thieves removed part of an iron grille on a ground-floor window and then smashed the glass to enter the museum. They had earlier managed to partially cut power to the building, which may have disabled the alarm system, local media report. They are believed to have set a fire at a nearby electrical junction box. The Green Vault is a world-famous treasure collection Once in the building, one of the robbers broke into a display case with an axe, while another used various tools to gain access to another cabinet. Police suspect that a car found burning in Dresden later that day may have been the getaway vehicle used by the burglars. Three jewellery sets are believed to have been stolen from the Green Vault (GrÃ¼nes GewÃ¶lbe), reportedly including rubies, emeralds and sapphires. Other items that were stolen included a diamond-encrusted sword and a shoulder-piece containing a famous 49-carat Dresden white diamond. Investigators had offered a reward of up to â¬500,000 ($590,000; Â£450,000) for information leading to the suspects' arrest. The items stolen from the Green Vault have not been recovered. Experts fear they have been broken up and will never be found. The collection is housed in eight ornate rooms in the Residenzschloss - a former royal palace. Three rooms were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War Two, but after the war, the museum was restored to its previous glory. The Green Vault houses treasured items such as this 16th Century Indian mother-of-pearl box It is called the Green Vault because some rooms were decorated with malachite-green paint. The most valuable items are kept in the palace's historic section on the ground floor. The collection houses about 3,000 items of jewellery and other treasures decorated with gold, silver, ivory and pearl. They include a 648-carat sapphire - a royal gift from Russian Tsar Peter the Great. Augustus the Strong served as Elector of Saxony (a German prince entitled to take part in the election of the emperor) and later king of Poland. 'Priceless' diamond heist captured on CCTV.

"The LGBT-owned kilt producer pulled the yellow kilts from shelves in response to Proud Boys A Virginia kilt company is ""disgusted"" that their yellow kilts were worn by the far-right Proud Boys. Members of the group were seen sporting the bright garments at a pro-Trump rally this weekend in Washington DC. The Proud Boys are an all-male group of self-proclaimed ""Western chauvinists"" with a history of street violence. Verillas - the LGBT-owned brand - says the ""nightmare scenario"" has forced them to pull the kilts from the shelves. Extremist groups in the US often adopt or appropriate items of clothing as quasi-uniforms that indicate their allegiance and make them recognisable to others. Who are Proud Boys and antifa? Proud Boys becomes LGBT trend on social media Meet the people at America's political extremes Over the weekend, videos on social media showcased a row of Proud Boys in bright yellow Verillas kilts mooning the crowd gathered around them, with ""[expletive] antifa"" written on their bare bottoms. Antifa is a group of mostly far-left activists who have repeatedly clashed with the Proud Boys. Verillas owner Allister Greenbrier - a bisexual entrepreneur of Scottish descent - expressed shock and dismay that his brand was associated with the group. ""I was appalled, angry and frustrated because they are the opposite of everything our brand stands for,"" he told the BBC, noting that the men had initially claimed to be a metal band looking for kilts. ""I was quite angry. I had to calm down a bit, but we decided we really didn't want their money."" In a message on Twitter, Verillas announced a donation of $1,000 (Â£745) - a sum exceeding the Proud Boys' purchase - to the anti-racism organisation National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Aside from pulling the offending garment off its racks, the company is also offering free colour exchanges for anybody who had previously purchased its yellow kilts. Mr Greenbrier says his brand is going to attach charitable donations to their product lines moving forward. ""I can't control who buys my product, but if they're buying our product, they're putting their money towards a good cause and I think they won't be too happy when they find out they accidentally bought from a company that's really fighting for the opposite of what they believe in,"" he says. ""We want to turn hate into love,"" Mr Greenbrier added. ""The loud outpouring of support we've gotten has really turned around a nightmare scenario and shown that a lot of people support the same message we believe in."" It is not the first time the Proud Boys have caused trouble for a clothing brand.

"Aberdeen has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past week Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian will all move from level two to level three of thefive-tiered system,external. It means people will no longer be allowed to travel outside of their own council area unless it is essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to stop serving alcohol and must shut at 18:00. And indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close. All of the country's other 29 council areas will remain in their current levels, including Edinburgh - which had beenpushing to be downgradedfrom level three to level two. Nine cases of new Covid strain found in Scotland 'Rash' Christmas Covid rules 'will cost many lives' What level of restrictions is your council in? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? It means that 80% of Scotland's population - about 4.35 million people - across 21 local authorities will be living under the level three rules when the changes come into force at 18:00 on Friday. They include the 11 areas in western and central Scotland which weredowngraded from the highest level fourcategory last week. Only four - Angus, Argyll and Bute, Falkirk and Inverclyde - remain in level two. However, Argyll and Bute is likely to move down to level one next week - and people living on the outer Argyll islands such as Islay, Mull and Iona will be able to meet in houses in groups of up to six from two households from Friday of this week. The Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are all already in level one, with no councils currently in the lowest level zero tier. All of the levels will be reviewed again next Tuesday as a precaution ahead of the festive period. Case numbers in Aberdeen have increased from 76 cases per 100,000 to 122 over the past week, and in East Lothian from 69 per 100,000 people to 116. The increase in Aberdeenshire has not been quite as sharp, but cases there are also rising. Alexander Burnett, the Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the area had been moved to level three so close to Christmas, and called for extra financial support to be put in place by the Scottish government. He added: ""Our hospitality sector has been decimated by repeated closures and this is likely to hurt even more during what is supposed to be one of their busiest periods."" East Lothian Council said its move to level three was disappointing but understandable given the high infection rates in the area in recent weeks. Tory councillor Douglas Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said he was ""not too surprised"" by the decision to move the area up to level three, but questioned role of the hospitality sector in spreading the virus. And the Scottish Licensed Traders Association said continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" Speaking as she announced the changes, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that the level three restrictions would cause ""real and continued difficulties for many businesses"", particularly in the hospitality sector. But she insisted that the move was essential to bring the virus under control again. Nine cases of a new strain of the virus have now been detected in Scotland after emerging in the south of England Ms Sturgeon said Angus and Falkirk would both be monitored ""very carefully"" over the next week after a rise in cases in both areas, with a move to level three not being ruled out. Cases have also ""increased quite sharply"" in East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and Fife, she said, adding: ""While the changes in these areas do not warrant a move to level four at this stage, we will be monitoring the situation very closely over the next few days."" And she said it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" to ease restrictions in Edinburgh or neighbouring Midlothian as cases were rising sharply in both. The rate in Edinburgh has increased from 70 to 100 per 100,000 over the past week, and in Midlothian from 88 to 147 per 100,000, with test positivity rates also increasing in both areas. Ms Sturgeon took part in a four-nation call with leaders from around the UK later on Tuesday, which she told MSPs she had requested after a new strain of the virus was identified in England. Nine cases of the new strain have now beenconfirmed in the Greater Glasgow and Clydehealth board area, the first minister confirmed. The talks were aimed at examining whether changes should be made to the planned relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions across the UK over Christmas, which will allow eight people from three households to mix indoors between 23 and 27 December. They broke up with no decision being reached, although further discussions have been scheduled for Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further, in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting."" New Covid strain: How worried should we be? The first minister said she would prefer to come to an agreed position across the UK, but said the Scottish government would ""consider what we think is appropriate"" if this was not possible. The planned relaxation of the rules at Christmas has been described as a""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives""by the both the Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the rising number of cases across many parts of Scotland ahead of the festive break showed that the journals were right. He added: ""It is rather concerning that the first minister was unable to tell parliament what position she would be advocating on behalf of Scotland in intergovernmental discussions planned for this afternoon."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the Christmas plans. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

At 17:00 GMT on Tuesday, 17 ambulances were queued outside, although this had dropped to four by 20:45. By 22:30 the ambulance service said it was not experiencing any major problems. Amid the pressure, politicians were urged to urgently rethink loosening covid rules over Christmas. Northern Health Trust operations director Wendy Magowan said it was the first time she had witnessed such a situation at Antrim Hospital. Speaking on Tuesday evening, Dr Nigel Ruddle, medical director of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, said: ""All of the emergency departments in Northern Ireland are seeing ambulances queued outside to various degrees. ""We are seeing the pressures right across Northern Ireland."" Health minister Robin Swann confirmed he would bring new proposals about restrictions to Thursday's executive meeting. The meeting will see ministers look at options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. Afurther six Covid-19 related deaths were reported in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health,external, taking its total to 1,135. There have been 59,121 positive tests after another 486 were recorded. There are 87 outbreaks of the virus in NI care homes, while hospital occupancy levels are at 104%. The reproduction rate of the virus in Northern Ireland remains at or slightly above 1, according to health chiefs. Northern Trust executive Ms Magowan said: ""This has never happened in Antrim hospital before in my memory, never. ""We got to a situation last night that we had so many people waiting in ED to get into beds that we simply had no room left. ""We haven't got out of the second surge, in fact, our numbers are rising. We have the highest number of inpatients today that we've ever had with Covid. ""If this doubles, I don't know how we're going to make it through."" There were 17 ambulances queued at Antrim Hospital at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday Pat Cullen from the Royal College of Nursing told the BBC's Evening Extra programme that nurses were exhausted from working ""excessive hours"". She said hospital nurses were treating patients in the back of ambulances and along corridors as well as on the wards and in the emergency departments, while the district nurses were trying to cope with ""60% vacancies"" in their workforce. She said: ""Speaking to many of our nurses today, there's no doubt that this is the closest I've ever seen nurses to being totally burnt out. ""Exhausted isn't even a word to describe how the nurses feel. ""At this moment in time, a 12-hour shift almost seems a luxury to them - they're working well beyond that."" Pat Cullen said nurses were facing burnuot At a briefing on Tuesday, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young told journalists that numbers were not where they would like them to be. They also gave a stark warning that any third wave would come on top of already ""stubbornly high"" hospital in-patient numbers. Prof Young said: ""The position is very different to what it was first wave and second wave of this virus. ""At the beginning of the first wave we had no hospital in patients with Covid. ""At the beginning of the second wave the numbers about 20. ""If we see an increase in numbers again as a consequence of the current position, then it will be an increase of numbers on top of a baseline of 300-400 people in hospital. And the numbers will only rise from there."" I was at Antrim Area Hospital this morning until about midday and what I witnessed was a system that is clearly just hanging together. I saw staff clearly exhausted and anxious and they were the staff who were outside in the ambulance bay. The problem is that the ambulances had nowhere to go, they couldn't unload their patients inside, so I also watched as doctors stepped inside ambulances, wearing their PPE, triaging those patients inside the ambulances, making decisions about who should be taken in first. The picture was a really sorry one, a stark one and this is really at the start of what could become an incredibly busy period. Prof Young urged people to stick with the guidelines over the festive period and said anyone who was forming a Christmas bubble should not see anyone else for the next 10 days. Dr McBride revealed he would not be hosting family or friends this Christmas - having discussed the issue with elderly parents and children. He said now was the ""best time for the virus"" but worst time for the health service. Dr McBride said he will not be hosting family this Christmas Health minister Robin Swann told the assembly the two-week limited lockdown which ended on 10 December had seen a ""stabilisation"" of the virus but the figures were still too high. He said he would not pre-empt Thursday's executive meeting and provide details of suggestions he would put forward. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Sinn FÃ©in ""will support any proposals brought forward by the health minister to tackle the current situation."" She added: ""It is clear we are facing a very dangerous situation with the spread of Covid-19, the rise in hospitalisations and, sadly, people losing their lives."" Allow Twitter content?

It also emerged on Tuesday that vaccinators have been in all five health trusts. Mr Swann told the assembly the Covid-19 vaccine had now been delivered in up to 54 care homes, starting with those with the largest numbers of residents.

"Redbridge Council has asked schools to shut classrooms and move to online learning Redbridge Council has become the latest local authority in London to suggest schools move to online teaching amid a rise in coronavirus cases. It comes after Greenwich and Islington Council backed down from a similar decision when the government threatened legal action. Schools minister Nick Gibb has also written to Waltham Forest Council after it asked schools to close. He said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the councils' choices. BBC Newsnight's Lewis Goodall said 7,000 pupils in Redbridge were self-isolating as of Monday. Redbridge Council said it believed schools should now consider whether they could remain open for all pupils or move to remote learning if absences were high enough. A total of 32 schools in the borough will close on Wednesday and move online, the council said. Another 25 will stay open - 12 of which are taking an extra day to decide if they will close their classrooms. In a letter seen by the BBC, council leader Jas Athwal said: ""Unfortunately, cases of Covid-19 continue to rise across the borough, and as a result, some of our schools are struggling to continue to provide the high-quality in-person teaching our children deserve. ""It is not the role of the council to close schools, but today we want to be absolutely clear - we will support our local schools if they choose to move to online learning."" Greenwich Council was the first to ask all schools to move to online learning amid rising Covid cases London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into England's highest tier of Covid restrictions on Wednesday due to a rise in infections. Schools in England were told theycould close a day earlyfor Christmas last week to give staff a ""proper break"". In Basildon, where the country's third-highest Covid rate was recorded, schoolswere also allowed to close early, while London's mayor Sadiq Khan has called on secondary schools and colleges in the capital to follow suit. The Association of School and College Leaders said the government ""may find it has won a hollow victory in its squabble with Greenwich council"" Earlier the leader of Greenwich Council said he had ""no choice"" but to ask schools to remain open after threats of legal action from the government. The authoritywrote to head teachersasking for classes to move online from Tuesday amid rising Covid-19 cases, but Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered the council to keep all schools open until the end of term. On Tuesday morning two other local authorities - Islington and Waltham Forest Councils - advised schools to move to online learning for the last few days of term amid rising Covid-19 rates in other parts of the capital. But, by the evening Islington Council's leader Richard Watts had backtracked on this decision. He said: ""After discussion today with the Department for Education, we have now advised our schools to open as usual to pupils on Wednesday, and advised our schools that they are able to arrange an INSET day on Thursday. Friday was to be an INSET day already."" Schools Minister Mr Gibb had written to Islington and Waltham Forest asking them to reconsider their decisions to close schools and stating legal action would be considered if they did not. However, Waltham Forest Council's leader Clare Coghill said she had ""received no correspondence"" from Mr Gibb. The decision to remain open or closed was left to individual schools in Waltham Forest, she added. ""We are confident that schools in Waltham Forest have made their decisions on the basis of their own individual risk assessment and with pupil safety at their heart. ""It is disappointing that, during a year when teachers, pupils and parents have made extraordinary efforts to ensure education continues through a once-in-a-lifetime crisis, the Minister has chosen to write to our schools threatening them with potential legal action. ""We will continue to do all we can to support schools to make the decisions that will safeguard the health and safety of pupils, teachers and their families and ensure children continue to be educated.""

"Matt Hancock's letter was criticised by a Welsh Government deputy minister UK ministers have written to Mark Drakeford to offer ""mutual aid"" in England if Welsh hospitals become unable to treat non-Covid patients. It could see coronavirus patients being moved to hospitals in England to ease the pressure on hospitals in Wales. It comes as numbers of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 hit record levels. The first minister said Wales has supplied 11 million items of PPE to the English NHS during the pandemic. Two Welsh health boardshave suspended some non-urgent care in response to increased coronavirus cases. Wales isalready in breach of some key indicatorsused to determine future lockdowns, including current coronavirus case rates and the rate of positive tests. Concerns over hospital capacity is also a key indicators for Wales's new alert level four - which would introduce restrictions equivalent to a lockdown. Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Covid not out of control in Wales, FM insists England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart have written to the first minister to offer support for Welsh health boards and said the military would assist with logistical support. They wrote: ""We have seen that Covid-19 does not respect political or administrative boundaries. Instead it follows the human geographies that people follow, which we know is especially important for much of the Wales-England border. ""We are aware that health boards across Wales are considering postponing non-Covid treatments and appointments (including those classed as urgent) to deal with the immediate threat of the pandemic. ""We stand ready to support Welsh hospitals through mutual aid of patients across the border where this is needed due to undue strain on healthcare provision."" The letter said Covid ""does not respect political or administrative boundaries"" The letter also offers further use of the UK government's mass testing programme - in addition to current mass-testing programmes in Merthyr Tydfil and Cynon Valley. They added the military ""stand ready to assist with the Welsh Government with further logistical and other support where needed too"". The latest NHS Wales figures show 2,124 patients with Covid in hospital on Monday - this is 17% more than the week before and the highest number yet recorded. It has risen over the week in all areas apart from Betsi Cadwaladr, while Aneurin Bevan has the most patients, 584. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board has seen a 30% rise in Covid patients. Numbers include more than 600 patients in Welsh hospital beds who are still recovering from the effects of the virus. Covid-19 patients make up nearly 27% of all patients in hospital, a proportion which has been slowly rising in the last week. There were 91 patients in critical care or on invasive ventilation, which is the highest number since the first wave of pandemic in May - with 48 more patients in total than the usual capacity, Hospital admissions remain fairly steady with an average of 90 a day for the last week. Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport,said on social media,externalthe Welsh Government had ""provided repeated mutual aid to all other parts of the UK to stop them running out of PPE"". He accused Simon Hart of ""cheap posturing in a public health emergency... shame on you"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would reply to the letter ""once again endorsing the principle of mutual aid which has been there through coronavirus"". ""Wales has supplied 11 million items of PPE to the English NHS during the virus as part of our mutual aid,"" he said. ""The letter that I have received today restates that and I'm very happy, once again, to endorse it.""

"Big tech firms face yearly checks on how they are tackling illegal and harmful content under new rules unveiled by the European Commission. Fresh restrictions are also planned to govern their use of customers' data, and to prevent the firms ranking their own services above competitors' in search results and app stores. The measures are intended to overhaul,externalhow the EU regulates digital markets. Large fines and break-ups are threatened for non-compliance. It is proposed that if companies refuse to obey, they could be forced to hand over up to 10% of their European turnover. And ""recurrent infringers"" are warned that they could be made to divest ""certain businesses, where no other equally effective alternative measure is available to ensure compliance"". The two new laws involved - the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act - have yet to be passed, so would only come into force after the Brexit transition period has ended. The UK's own regulator - the Competition and Markets Authority -announced its own plans to place limits on the tech giants last week, and ministers have justdetailed how they plan to tackle online harms. The European Commission's press conference was scheduled for the afternoon to allow tech leaders on the US's West Coast to watch live, but began later than originally advised. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager introduced the press conference Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager described the two laws as ""milestones in our journey to make Europe fit for the digital age... we need to make rules that put order into chaos"". Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton added that the laws had been designed to be applied ""very quickly"" once they came into effect. The focus of the Digital Services Act is to create a single set of rules for the EU to keep users safe online, protect their freedom of expression and help both them and local authorities hold tech companies to account. It introduces a sliding scale, under which firms take on more obligations the larger and more influential they are. So, for example, all internet companies must provide users with a way of getting in touch and the means to see their terms and conditions. Commissioner Thierry Breton said the new laws would benefit online shoppers The operators of online platforms - such as social media apps and video-sharing sites of any size - must prioritise complaints raised by ""trusted flaggers"", who have a track record of highlighting valid problems. Likewise, all online stores must be able to trace traders selling goods via their platforms, in case they are offering counterfeit items or other illegal products. ""[It] will require online marketplaces to check their sellers' identity before they are allowed on the platform, which will make it so much more difficult for dodgy traders to do their business,"" commented Mr Breton. But the biggest players must also subject themselves to further scrutiny, including an annual independent audit to check they are following the rules. In addition, once a year they must publish a report into their handling of major risks, including users posting illegal content, disinformation that could sway elections, and the unjustified targeting of minority groups. Suggested counter-measures include preventing abusive users earning money from ads, and checking moderator guidelines is kept up-to-date. Furthermore, the law specifies that local officials can send cross-border orders to make tech firms remove content or provide access to information, wherever their EU headquarter is based. The law would give local officials a way to ask Airbnb and other apps to hand over information or remove listings A commission spokesman gave the example of Amsterdam's local government being able to ask a service like Airbnb, which is based in Dublin, to remove a listing of a non-registered apartment and share details about a host suspected of not paying taxes. The Digital Markets Act centres on the regulation of ""gatekeepers"" - those behind ""entrenched"" services that other businesses use to provide their own products. This covers the operators of search engines, social networks, chat apps, cloud computing services and operating systems, among others. They are likely to include Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. The idea is to prevent the firms gaining unfair advantages via their elevated positions. The new rules include obligations to: inform the regulator of any planned takeover of another service not treat their own service more favourably than rivals' when deciding which order to show them on screen not use data gathered via their main service to launch a product that will compete with other established businesses let users uninstall pre-installed apps on their platform and use different software The commission would be able to issue fines of up to 10% of a firm's annual turnover in Europe under the Digital Services Act, and 6% under the Digital Markets Act. Facebook was one of the first to respond, saying it thought the laws were ""on the right track to help preserve what is good about the internet"". But it also took the opportunity to call attention to one of the other US tech giants. ""We hope the Digital Markets Act will set boundaries for Apple,"" said a spokesman. ""Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook."" Apple declined to respond. Facebook took the opportunity to take a pot shot at its Silicon Valley neighbour Apple Google later sounded a more cautious note. ""We are concerned that [the laws] appear to specifically target a handful of companies and make it harder to develop new products to support small businesses in Europe,"" said Karan Bhatia, its vice president of government affairs. The DigitalEurope trade association also voiced concern about whether the commission had got the balance right between privacy and preventing harmful activities, but said it needed more time to read the details. The tech giants and digital rights campaigners are among those likely to try to influence their final shape of the two laws. But if passed, they should update current rules, which date back to 20 years ago when some of the tech firms affected did not exist. And they may influence other regulators - in the US and elsewhere - which are also planning to introduce new restrictions of their own. EU set to announce landmark digital rules US regulators open privacy probes into tech giants Amazon charged with abusing EU competition rules Apple faces two EU anti-competition probes Google starts appeal against Â£2bn shopping fine Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Non-essential businesses are closed under the new restrictions Germany has entered a hard lockdown, closing schools and non-essential businesses in an attempt to stop a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections. The measures will be in place until 10 January. Christmas will see a slight easing, with one household allowed to host up to four close family members. The country reported another 952 deaths and 27,728 cases on Wednesday. Meanwhile EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said the first Covid vaccine would be authorised for use within a week. Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - developed in Germany - would be rolled out for the bloc the same day, more than a week earlier than originally envisaged. The news came after the German government said it was pressuring the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to speed up approval of the vaccine. It has already been approved by regulators in the UK and the US. The EMA is due to discuss the rollout next Monday. Germans start holiday lockdown amid Covid surge What are the restrictions around Europe? Germany plans ventilation blow to coronavirus Other European countries have joined Germany in tightening restrictions ahead of Christmas, and France has introduced a night-time curfew. Only essential businesses such as supermarkets and banks will be allowed to remain open. Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have been shut since November and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close, while drinking alcohol in public places, such as popular mulled wine stalls, is forbidden. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. The 952 new fatalities announced on Wednesday are a new peak for Germany's pandemic, but may cover numbers that were not included in previous days. People were still out on the streets of Munich, Bavaria, on Tuesday Lothar Wieler, head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, which is overseeing the Covid-19 response, said the situation was ""more serious than it has ever been"". ""The number of cases is higher than ever and they keep rising. There is the danger that the situation will keep getting worse and it will get harder and harder to deal with the pandemic and its consequences,"" he said. Deutsche Welle reported that while cases in the younger population were falling, they were still rising among older people who were more likely to suffer more serious problems from the virus. Numbers in intensive care are said to have reached alarming levels. Announcing the new measures over the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the ""lockdown light"" begun in November had not done enough to bring the virus under control. The figures are particularly shocking, as during the early months of the pandemic Germany was more successful than many other European countries in its handling of the crisis. What's gone wrong for the country that came so successfully through the first wave of the pandemic? Some blame Germany's regional leaders who, until now, have dithered, bickered and resisted Chancellor Merkel's calls for a tougher nationwide response. And Prof Iris Pigeot, director of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, says that ""people do not follow all the regulations that they're told. We had to reduce our contacts by about 75% but I think that didn't work"". She's concerned. ""New Year's Eve and Christmas could be a complete nightmare with increasing numbers, increasing numbers of deaths.""

Bars and restaurants are to remain closed until at least 20 January. The number of people in France who have died from coronavirus infections rose by 790 on Tuesday to a total of 59,072. People in France are no longer required to print or download an official justification for leaving their homes during the day. TheNetherlandsis currently under a five-week lockdown, the strictest set of measures announced in the country since the pandemic began. Non-essential shops, cinemas, hairdressers and gyms closed on Tuesday, and schools have now followed suit. People have also been told to refrain from booking non-essential travel abroad until mid-March. But restrictions will be eased slightly for three days over Christmas, when Dutch households are allowed three guests instead of two.

Pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut. Meanwhile,Italy'sdaily death toll is still close to 500 and the government is considering a further tightening of measures over Christmas. The exact details are unclear, but a new lockdown could come into place between Christmas night and New Year. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the potential lockdown as a ""new squeeze"". Lithuaniahas gone into lockdown, with a ban on non-essential movement between towns. Contact between separate households is also banned. Austriais to set out its plans for Christmas, including an extension of the rules on mask-wearing indoors and limits on meetings between households.

"Usually busy shopping streets were left empty after a Dutch lockdown began on Tuesday A number of European countries have tightened coronavirus restrictions ahead of Christmas following a surge of infections in recent weeks. The Netherlands has entered a five-week lockdown, with non-essential shops, theatres and gyms all closing. Germany will enter a hard lockdown from Wednesday after the number of infections there hit record levels. Meanwhile, Europe's medicines regulator is set to meet sooner than planned to consider approving a vaccine. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) will now meet on 21 December to discuss whether the German-developed Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be rolled out around the bloc. That vaccine has already been approved by regulators in the UK and the US. The body was initially scheduled to meet on 29 December, but it brought forward that date following pressure from member states and a rise in cases. What are the restrictions around Europe? Defiant ski nations bid to save winter season Tracking the global coronavirus outbreak In recent weeks, governments around the continent have been wrestling with difficult questions about whether to ease restrictions in time for the holiday period. But the recent wave of infections in some nations has prompted governments to halt plans to loosen the rules. The five-week lockdown in theNetherlandsis the strictest set of measures announced in the country since the pandemic began. Non-essential shops, cinemas, hairdressers and gyms have all closed and schools will follow suit on Wednesday. People have also been told to refrain from booking non-essential travel abroad until mid-March. But restrictions will be eased slightly for three days over Christmas, when Dutch households are allowed three instead of two guests. BelgianPrime Minister Alexander De Croo warned on Tuesday that if people tried to cross the border from the Netherlands to go shopping or come for their holidays, then border measures could be taken. ""I hope it won't be necessary, I think the message is clear. In any case, [Dutch Prime Minister] Mark Rutte said so himself."" This video can not be played Most Christmas markets have been cancelled but one in Bavaria is offering a ""drive-thru"" experience Elsewhere, schools and non-essential shops will also close inGermanyfrom Wednesday. Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have already been shut there since November. The new German lockdown will run from 16 December to 10 January, but there will be a slight easing over Christmas when one household will be able to host a maximum of four close family members. Francehas lifted its national lockdown, but the government said the infection rate had not lowered sufficiently for a further easing. This means theatres and cinemas will remain shut as will bars and restaurants. A nationwide curfew will also be imposed from 20:00 to 06:00. The curfew will be lifted on Christmas Eve but not on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile,Italy'sdaily death toll is still close to 500 and the government is considering a further tightening of measures over Christmas. The exact details are unclear, but a new lockdown could come into place between Christmas night and New Year. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the potential lockdown as a ""new squeeze"". SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? JOBLESS TALES:'I'm just looking for whatever I can get' SUPERSPREADERS:What makes some events so risky? Spainhas also seen a rebound in infections, and top health official Fernando SimÃ³n has warned of a ""delicate"" situation ahead of Christmas. The Spanish government has approved a set of rules for the period between 23 December and 6 January. Travel between regions will be allowed, providing people are visiting friends and family, and social gatherings will be limited to 10 people. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, welcomed the decision to bring forward the EMA meeting on whether to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ""Every day counts,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""[It is] likely that the first Europeans will be vaccinated before the end of 2020."" German Health Minister Jens Spahn echoed Ms von der Leyen's view. ""The goal is to get approval before Christmas,"" he told a press conference in Berlin. ""We want to start vaccinating in Germany before the end of the year."" In a statement, the EMA said it would only approve the vaccine ""once the data on the quality, safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are sufficiently robust and complete"". It added that it would meet as planned on 12 January to make a decision on the separate Moderna vaccine. The Moderna vaccine requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a regular freezer. The Pfizer jab, meanwhile, requires temperatures closer to -75C which makes transport more difficult.

"A-level students in NI will take fewer exams next summer, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed. He insisted exams will not be cancelled, but said they would be ""underpinned by contingencies for all scenarios"". The content of many GCSE courses andthe number of GCSE exams has already been reduceddue to the pandemic. The number of A-level exam papers a pupil will have to take in each subject will also be reduced. Mr Weir told the assembly that students would have the opportunity to omit up to 60% of their AS or A-level assessments, meaning for a ""significant"" number of subjects, this would mean taking only one exam. ""At the centre of this reduction is choice - our schools and colleges will choose which unit or units of assessment their pupils will take,"" he said. ""Our young people will be assessed on topics and content in which they feel most confident and well prepared, allowing them to demonstrate their skills and knowledge to the highest possible level."" Mr Weir also reiterated that the examinations board in NI, CCEA,will delay the start of the summer exam seriesby one week to provide more time for preparation. He told the assembly that he had decided grading should ""carry forward the overall generosity and standards of 2020"", which saw students awarded teacher-predicted grades after examinations were cancelled. ""This will ensure the 2021 cohort are treated fairly, relative to their 2020 peers. Students will be awarded more generous grades, in line with last summer's significantly improved results,"" he added. Mr Weir has faced calls to cancel exams, but said approaches in other parts of the UK were ""confusing"". The Scottish government has decided to cancel Higher exams in 2021, meaning that pupils' final grades will be based on the judgement of their schools. In Wales,pupils will face exams in class in the springrather than the summer. Exams are also set to go ahead in England in 2021and measures like more generous grading and advance notice of topics have already been announced. ""I have also heard the quieter voices of those who are equally anxious that exams should go ahead, and have urged me to stand firm on this,"" said Mr Weir. ""Cancelling exams would undoubtedly lead to different sorts of anxieties for young people, and would put incredible additional pressures on schools."" Mr Weir said he was considering a Covid exam allowance for young people who miss a significant amount of school due to the pandemic The minister, who has already announced changes to 2021 GCSE exams, added that students taking GCSE Mathematics exams next year will be given ""additional support materials"". ""These support sheets will relieve candidates of the burden of memorising all of the information they would normally have to,"" he said. ""I hope they will feel more prepared and more confident as a result. This aligns with recent announcements in England."" Mr Weir said he recognised some young people had missed significant amounts of school while others had missed none, due to the pandemic. He said he wanted to reassure students who had to take time off that there would be special consideration for those candidates. ""I also will explore the possibility of a Covid allowance or tariff for young people who have missed a significant number of days face-to-face teaching due to self-isolating,"" he said. ""This would allow for specific account to be taken of the variations in disrupted learning since September,"" he added, stating it would be separate from the existing special consideration scheme. Mr Weir said his priority was to ensure students in NI were not at a disadvantage from other parts of the UK, and that ""fairness"" would continue to be his priority. Schools were closed to pupils from mid-March until the end of August 2020, although some online teaching took place. Some pupils have also missed time in class since schools reopened as they have had to self-isolate after being identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case.

"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says Dominic Cummings lockdown breach journey was the ""tipping point"" for a loss trust over Covid. Boris Johnson's former chief aide Dominic Cummings, who left No 10 last month after an internal power struggle, enjoyed a bumper pay rise earlier this year, new figures have revealed. His basic salary rose by about Â£45,000 to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. The PM stood by Mr Cummings this summer when he was embroiled in controversy over a trip to Durham during lockdown. Labour said the rise was an ""insult"" to millions of workers whose pay is being frozen due to the Covid crisis. Separately, it has emerged that Boris Johnson ignored the advice of the chief of the civil service in relation to a legal case brought by a special adviser sacked by Mr Cummings. Sir John Manzoni urged the PM to reach a negotiated settlement with Sonia Khan, who was led out of No 10 by police in August 2019 following a reported row with Mr Cummings. No reason was given for her sacking as an adviser to Chancellor Sajid Javid and before that Philip Hammond. In a letter to the PM,externalin March 2020, Sir John raised concerns about the cost to the taxpayer of fighting the case. Timeline: Did Dominic Cummings break the rules? Dominic Cummings leaves No 10 'to clear the air' Ex-Treasury adviser settles unfair dismissal claim He sought a written instruction known as a ""ministerial direction"" - a specific order sought by civil servants in instances where they have reservations over a particular course of action. In response,external, the PM said he fully understood concerns over the use of public money but he believed ""wider considerations"" took precedence in the case. He said he wanted to ""test in litigation"" his belief that individuals should not receive more compensation than they are entitled to under their contract. ""The legal position is clear that the prime minister can withdraw consent for the appointment of any special adviser,"" he wrote. ""That is the reason for the termination of employment."" Ms Khan settled her case last month, shortly before it was due to go before an employment tribunal. Sonia Khan worked for Philip Hammond in the Treasury and was kept on by his successor, Sajid Javid Mr Cummings is still on the government payroll but is working his notice at home, having left Downing Street in November following a bitter row over the running of Mr Johnson's office. Figures released by the Cabinet Office,externalshow his salary rose during 2020 from between Â£95,000-Â£99,999 to Â£140,000-Â£144,999, making him among the highest-earning special advisers in government. It is not clear when the increase, revealed in an annual report on the pay of special advisers, came into effect. While Mr Cummings was in the highest salary band when he was first taken on by Boris Johnson in July 2019, his pay was considerably lower at the time than other senior political advisers in Downing Street. The pay rise brought Mr Cummings, whose Brexit strategy was credited with helping Mr Johnson win a thumping victory in the 2019 election, into line with other key figures such as Sir Eddie Lister, Lee Cain and Munira Mirza. The most senior advisers to previous prime ministers, such as Theresa May and David Cameron, have typically also earned between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. The PM stood by Mr Cummings after he was accused of breaching coronavirus guidelines when he travelled 250 miles to stay on his parents' farm in County Durham in early April and later drove to Barnard Castle. Durham Police said Mr Cummingsmight have broken lockdown ruleswith his trip to Barnard Castle but it would not be taking any action. Mr Cummings said he had made the 50-mile round-trip to the beauty spot, with his wife and child, to test his eyesight before embarking on the longer journey back to London. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the pay increase was a slap in the face to the public. ""Dominic Cummings' bumper bonus is an insult to key workers denied the pay rise they deserve,"" she said. ""It's another example of how under this government it is one rule for the Tory Party and their friends and another for the rest of us."" The figures show that while the overall pay bill for special advisers remained the same at Â£9.6m, having risen sharply the year before, the number of advisers earning more than Â£100,000 doubled on the year before. Those earning six-figure salaries included Allegra Stratton, the PM's new press secretary and Dan Rosenfield, the newly appointed No 10 chief of staff.

"About half of proposed redundancies were in manufacturing, wholesale and retail More than 10,000 redundancies have been proposed by Northern Ireland firms since March, according to official statistics. That is the highest number ever recorded. Northern Ireland's unemployment rate is now 3.9% - 1.6% more than the same time last year and an increase of 0.9% over the quarter. Companies proposed 1,370 lay offs in November, which is an increase on the previous month. The total number of proposed redundancies for the last 12 months was 10,720 - more than double the number recorded in the previous 12 months. About half of proposed redundancies were in manufacturing, and wholesale and retail. Unemployment rate hits highest level in three years Which sectors are hiring at the moment? What are my rights if I am made redundant? The number of people claiming benefits primarily for the reason of being unemployed also increased to 59,900. Employee jobs fell to 775,020 in September, marking the third quarterly decrease in a row. The decline was driven by decreases within manufacturing, services and 'other' industry sectors. On Tuesday, Ulster Bank published its latest PMI; the monthly survey is generally viewed as a reliable indicator as to how the economy is performing. It said Covid-19 restrictions in November resulted in a decline in new orders and output, with the retail and services sectors hit hardest. Construction posted the fastest rate of output growth of all sectors Richard Ramsey, the bank's chief economist said both those sectors were particularly affected by Covid-19 restrictions and recorded rapid rates of decline in output, orders and employment. ""Once again construction posted the fastest rate of output growth of all the sectors, marginally ahead of manufacturing,"" he said. ""However, the rates of expansion were modest and represented a marked slowing from construction's recent spurt of activity. ""Local construction firms continue to experience the steepest rises in input costs and as a result are raising prices at their fastest pace since January 2019. ""While business conditions remain challenging, the latest survey highlighted that there is some optimism returning. ""Manufacturing firms are the most bullish about output growth in 12 months' time, followed by construction."" Unemployment rate hits highest level in three years Where are all the job vacancies?

"Test to Release, a new system meant to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England, has been beset with problems on its first day. Travellers are allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and get a negative result five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests. But some of the largest Covid test providers were not included and many on the list have hit problems. Airlines UK, the trade body for airlines, admitted there had been ""teething problems"", but said these would be resolved. ""Today is only the start - the end goal is the removal of quarantine altogether - but it's a positive beginning to what we hope will be the recovery of our sector,"" the group said. When the scheme launched on Tuesday morning, some test providers were overwhelmed with the sheer volume of demand from the public. One supplier has pulled out completely. SameDayDoctor asked to be withdrawn from the programme after being inundated with requests for tests. It posted a message on its website stating: ""Unfortunately we have been so overwhelmed with requests for Test to Release that we cannot answer any more emails nor take any more bookings."" Who can get a coronavirus test? More tier 3 areas to get mass testing from Monday Another approved provider, Axiom, said it couldn't take bookings but an update would be available ""soon"", while another, Medicspot, told visitors to its website to register their interest. Dr Laurence Gerlis, chief executive of SameDayDoctor, said he was initially delighted to have made the approved list. ""Getting on that list was the hardest thing I have ever done,"" he said. ""The paperwork was so thorough it took a full week. I was so proud to have been accredited and to be able to help. We went live at 7pm on Monday but were so overwhelmed it was clear we would struggle. ""Four hours later I emailed the government and asked to be taken off the list. We were inundated. ""I actually ended up in tears. We had to let so many people down. People had been relying on getting the test in order to come out of quarantine for all sorts of reasons. One of the most upsetting things I heard was a patient saying they needed the test because they knew this Christmas visit would be the last one they would be able to spend with their mother."" This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Collinson, which has had testing set up at Heathrow and Manchester Airport for months, was not put on the list until later on Tuesday. The firm had initially told the BBC it was ""surprised and disappointed"" not be on the government's list of private providers. The Department for Transport later confirmed that Collinson was now on the list. The company's joint chief executive David Evans said Test to Release ""is a significant positive step forward that will help the aviation sector open up travel safely"". People arriving in the UK from destinations on the government's travel corridors list are exempt from the 10-day self isolation requirement. The Test to Release programme was designed to benefit people arriving from other locations. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, told the PA news agency: ""It's a chaotic start for a system that was flagged as a solution to recovery in the travel sector, but it's been weeks in planning and has taken minutes to fall apart. ""I think most people just won't pay for a test because they can't guarantee they're going to get the results quickly, so they may as well just opt to spend two or three more days in quarantine and save the money."" Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce, said: ""It defies belief that the Government's long-awaited aviation Test To Release scheme has, within hours, proved to be unworkable."" ""The return of international business travel and tourism is critical to London and the UK's economic recovery. This requires competent and proven testing companies. The Prime Minister's official spokesman told the Press Association: ""We have made this option available to international travellers and we are working to approve more test providers.""

The most senior advisers to previous prime ministers, such as Theresa May and David Cameron, have typically also earned between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. The PM stood by Mr Cummings after he was accused of breaching coronavirus guidelines when he travelled 250 miles to stay on his parents' farm in County Durham in early April and later drove to Barnard Castle. Durham Police said Mr Cummingsmight have broken lockdown ruleswith his trip to Barnard Castle but it would not be taking any action. Mr Cummings said he had made the 50-mile round-trip to the beauty spot, with his wife and child, to test his eyesight before embarking on the longer journey back to London. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the pay increase was a slap in the face to the public. ""Dominic Cummings' bumper bonus is an insult to key workers denied the pay rise they deserve,"" she said. ""It's another example of how under this government it is one rule for the Tory Party and their friends and another for the rest of us."" The figures show that while the overall pay bill for special advisers remained the same at Â£9.6m, having risen sharply the year before, the number of advisers earning more than Â£100,000 doubled on the year before. Those earning six-figure salaries included Allegra Stratton, the PM's new press secretary and Dan Rosenfield, the newly appointed No 10 chief of staff.

"Test to Release, a new system meant to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England, has been beset with problems on its first day. Travellers are allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and get a negative result five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests. But some of the largest Covid test providers were not included and many on the list have hit problems. Airlines UK, the trade body for airlines, admitted there had been ""teething problems"", but said these would be resolved. ""Today is only the start - the end goal is the removal of quarantine altogether - but it's a positive beginning to what we hope will be the recovery of our sector,"" the group said. When the scheme launched on Tuesday morning, some test providers were overwhelmed with the sheer volume of demand from the public. One supplier has pulled out completely. SameDayDoctor asked to be withdrawn from the programme after being inundated with requests for tests. It posted a message on its website stating: ""Unfortunately we have been so overwhelmed with requests for Test to Release that we cannot answer any more emails nor take any more bookings."" Who can get a coronavirus test? More tier 3 areas to get mass testing from Monday Another approved provider, Axiom, said it couldn't take bookings but an update would be available ""soon"", while another, Medicspot, told visitors to its website to register their interest. Dr Laurence Gerlis, chief executive of SameDayDoctor, said he was initially delighted to have made the approved list. ""Getting on that list was the hardest thing I have ever done,"" he said. ""The paperwork was so thorough it took a full week. I was so proud to have been accredited and to be able to help. We went live at 7pm on Monday but were so overwhelmed it was clear we would struggle. ""Four hours later I emailed the government and asked to be taken off the list. We were inundated. ""I actually ended up in tears. We had to let so many people down. People had been relying on getting the test in order to come out of quarantine for all sorts of reasons. One of the most upsetting things I heard was a patient saying they needed the test because they knew this Christmas visit would be the last one they would be able to spend with their mother."" This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? Collinson, which has had testing set up at Heathrow and Manchester Airport for months, was not put on the list until later on Tuesday. The firm had initially told the BBC it was ""surprised and disappointed"" not be on the government's list of private providers. The Department for Transport later confirmed that Collinson was now on the list. The company's joint chief executive David Evans said Test to Release ""is a significant positive step forward that will help the aviation sector open up travel safely"". People arriving in the UK from destinations on the government's travel corridors list are exempt from the 10-day self isolation requirement. The Test to Release programme was designed to benefit people arriving from other locations. Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, told the PA news agency: ""It's a chaotic start for a system that was flagged as a solution to recovery in the travel sector, but it's been weeks in planning and has taken minutes to fall apart. ""I think most people just won't pay for a test because they can't guarantee they're going to get the results quickly, so they may as well just opt to spend two or three more days in quarantine and save the money."" Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce, said: ""It defies belief that the Government's long-awaited aviation Test To Release scheme has, within hours, proved to be unworkable."" ""The return of international business travel and tourism is critical to London and the UK's economic recovery. This requires competent and proven testing companies. The Prime Minister's official spokesman told the Press Association: ""We have made this option available to international travellers and we are working to approve more test providers.""

"Mass Covid testing of secondary-school pupils in England is to be greatly increased in January, in an attempt to reduce the numbers being sent home. Any students who have been in contact with a positive case will be offered seven days of daily testing, the Department for Education has announced. Teachers can have weekly Covid tests. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said this ""huge expansion"" of testing would be a ""milestone moment"" in keeping schools open. Hamid Patel, head of an academy trust that had piloted such testing, said it had been a ""game-changer"". The announcement comes as attendance figures showmore pupils out of school because of Covid outbreaks- with 15% missing last week on average across England and 23% in the West Midlands. Absences have been higher in secondary school, with 20% of pupils missing school last week. School attendance plummeted after half term Secondary school pupils in Covid hotspots urged to get tests First results of mass testing of students finds few positive cases Will there be mass testing at your child's school? As infection rates have risen many schools have struggled to keep going with so many pupils and staff having to isolate - and mass testing is an attempt to break this cycle. But the National Education Union said it was ""ridiculous"" for schools to be told to prepare for testing in the last few days of term with ""almost zero notice"". This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe Instead union co-leader Kevin Courtney called for the first week of next term to be moved online - allowing schools time to prepare for testing. The announcement by the education secretary will make rapid Covid testing available to all secondary schools and colleges in England from the first week in January. It will be used to test pupils who have been near a positive case and where otherwise a whole bubble, class or year group might have been sent home. Secondary school teachers will be offered a test each week - and daily tests if they have had a case in their class, in a bid to reduce the disruption from staff having to isolate. The tests will be optional and require the consent of parents - and testing in primary schools could begin later in the term, said the Department for Education. The aim is to improve attendance and to reduce the numbers having to go home, by identifying and isolating those who are infected, and allowing those who do not have the virus to stay in school. Although 15% of pupils were out of school last week, the latest figures show 0.2% of pupils were confirmed Covid cases. University students had mass Covid testing ahead of the Christmas break Mass testing is also designed to stop the virus being spread by those who are infected but have no symptoms. But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said providing testing kits without trained staff to use them meant the government was in ""danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory"". He said expecting school staff to run the tests would be ""deeply flawed"". There have been pilots for school Covid testing - including schools run by the Star academies trust - and the trust's chief executive Hamid Patel said ""the benefits have been tremendous"". ""Attendance has improved as fewer close contacts have been required to self-isolate. Parents who may have been wavering have gained confidence to send their children to school, and staff have been reassured by the availability of testing,"" said Mr Patel.

Realising his sport was in danger with little funding and no travel, he bought a van and toured the US, filming his flights in remote locations. Wolfgang noticed a huge reaction to his videos, with people who were in lockdown saying that it allowed them to momentarily leave their homes and experience the sport. He hopes to return to competitions and instructing in 2021, but for now, he's continuing to promote the sport. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There are no plans to change regulations covering Christmas in England, the BBC understands. Talks with devolved administrations - that have been taking place this evening - will continue tomorrow and it's still hoped a common approach can be agreed. There is likely to be tougher guidance in the coming days to reflect the current situation. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have said they will co-ordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. They pledged to rapidly share information on how vaccination was proceeding, Reuters reports, quoting a joint statement by the countries' health ministries. In Germany, there is growing impatience that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - developed by German scientists and currently being rolled out in the UK and US - has yet to be approved for use in the European Union, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. It was reported earlier thatEurope's medicines regulator EMA will meet sooner than had been planned to consider approving a vaccine. Vaccination programmes are under way in the UK with the Pfizer vaccine, but the approval of a second jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is eagerly awaited. The UK has ordered 100m doses and regulators are assessing its safety and efficacy - how well it works. It is in the last stage of assessment by MHRAafter the government asked it to analyse a final set of data on 27 November.

So we've been hearing tonight about the call between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on what to do about Christmas. The joint plans to ease Covid restrictions for a few days over the festive period have been discussed. No decisions were made tonight, and further talks on the possible easing of rules around meeting up in the UK will take place on Wednesday. A government source said there was ""recognition a commitment has been made to people"" in the existing plans, but also that there's a need to be ""stronger and clearer in guidance and messaging"". Travel was discussed, the source added. Read more here. Turkey has recorded 235 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours - the highest number since the outbreak began.

The source said there were discussions on travel over the Christmas period, but no decisions were made. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to authorise Moderna's vaccine sometime this week, US media report. This means that by Monday, there could be two Covid vaccines available for Americans. The Moderna vaccine can be shipped at -20C, while the jab from Pfizer/BioNTech must be kept at a trickier -70C. The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. The vaccines will be provided at no cost to Americans. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The country is also expecting 200,000 more Pfizer vaccines by next week. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab and 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech version. Also on Tuesday, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for the US' first fully at-home Covid-19 test. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the tests can be sold in chemists and patients will be able to get results ""in as little as 20 minutes"".

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts who identified thenew variant of Covid that appears to be spreading fast in some parts of Englandsay the infection is probably home-grown rather than imported. Prof Nick Loman, an expert in microbiology from the University of Birmingham and part of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (CoG), says it seems to have appeared spontaneously ""out of nowhere"" in late September. The small number of cases soon grew to many more and got the experts concerned. So far, 1,000 confirmed cases have been discovered in the UK. They are predominantly in the south of England, but cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, including parts of Scotland and Wales. Prof Loman says as well as the ""striking growth"" on a wide geographical scale the ""sheer number of mutations"" - 17 in total - that made up the variant was more than they expected to see and set alarm bells ringing. While ""none of those things are smoking guns"", he says there is ""sufficient circumstantial evidence to think this is something that urgently needs following up"". The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid. In that space of time, there's also a chance the new variant could burn itself out and disappear as quickly as it arrived. A majority of people think ministers should abandon plans to relax the coronavirus rules over Christmas, an opinion poll suggests. In a survey of 3,856 adults in Great Britain by YouGov, 57% said the current restrictions should be maintained, with 31% supporting the plan to relax the rules. Older people appeared to be more strongly in favour of tighter restrictions, with 70% of over-65s saying the temporary relaxation should be scrapped, and 61% among those aged between 50 and 65. It comes as urgent talks are taking place between the leaders of the devolved administrations and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove - to discuss the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over Christmas. BBC Radio 5 Live Elizabeth has enjoyed getting ""glammed up"" for date nights All day, on BBC Radio 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid.

""When coronavirus first hit the UK, it was pandemonium,"" she said. ""The phone was going constantly, you didn't get a break between calls. ""But as people got used to the 'new normal', the calls decreased quite a bit and it almost seemed that people were scared to call for an ambulance because they didn't want to go anywhere near where they thought coronavirus would be."" To make up for missing her honeymoon, Elizabeth and her husband have been having ""date nights"" to cheer themselves up. âI get myself all glammed up, he puts on nice clothes and we have a date night in the house,"" she said.

'Tis the season to go shopping... or maybe not As we mentioned earlier, the Netherlands has started a strict five-week lockdown, with schools, non-essential shops and public venues closing. It has left its neighbour Belgium a bit nervous - with towns near the border expecting a possible rush of Dutch shoppers scrambling to get their Christmas shopping done. Belgian leader Alexander De Croo spoke to Dutch PM Mark Rutte on Tuesday, stressing that recreational shopping is âforbiddenâ in his country,Brussels Times reports,external. The Netherlands has also reminded its citizens not to cross the border unless absolutely necessary.

"Aberdeen has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past week Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian will all move from level two to level three of thefive-tiered system,external. It means people will no longer be allowed to travel outside of their own council area unless it is essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to stop serving alcohol and must shut at 18:00. And indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close. All of the country's other 29 council areas will remain in their current levels, including Edinburgh - which had beenpushing to be downgradedfrom level three to level two. Nine cases of new Covid strain found in Scotland 'Rash' Christmas Covid rules 'will cost many lives' What level of restrictions is your council in? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? It means that 80% of Scotland's population - about 4.35 million people - across 21 local authorities will be living under the level three rules when the changes come into force at 18:00 on Friday. They include the 11 areas in western and central Scotland which weredowngraded from the highest level fourcategory last week. Only four - Angus, Argyll and Bute, Falkirk and Inverclyde - remain in level two. However, Argyll and Bute is likely to move down to level one next week - and people living on the outer Argyll islands such as Islay, Mull and Iona will be able to meet in houses in groups of up to six from two households from Friday of this week. The Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are all already in level one, with no councils currently in the lowest level zero tier. All of the levels will be reviewed again next Tuesday as a precaution ahead of the festive period. Case numbers in Aberdeen have increased from 76 cases per 100,000 to 122 over the past week, and in East Lothian from 69 per 100,000 people to 116. The increase in Aberdeenshire has not been quite as sharp, but cases there are also rising. Alexander Burnett, the Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the area had been moved to level three so close to Christmas, and called for extra financial support to be put in place by the Scottish government. He added: ""Our hospitality sector has been decimated by repeated closures and this is likely to hurt even more during what is supposed to be one of their busiest periods."" East Lothian Council said its move to level three was disappointing but understandable given the high infection rates in the area in recent weeks. Tory councillor Douglas Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said he was ""not too surprised"" by the decision to move the area up to level three, but questioned role of the hospitality sector in spreading the virus. And the Scottish Licensed Traders Association said continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" Speaking as she announced the changes, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that the level three restrictions would cause ""real and continued difficulties for many businesses"", particularly in the hospitality sector. But she insisted that the move was essential to bring the virus under control again. Nine cases of a new strain of the virus have now been detected in Scotland after emerging in the south of England Ms Sturgeon said Angus and Falkirk would both be monitored ""very carefully"" over the next week after a rise in cases in both areas, with a move to level three not being ruled out. Cases have also ""increased quite sharply"" in East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and Fife, she said, adding: ""While the changes in these areas do not warrant a move to level four at this stage, we will be monitoring the situation very closely over the next few days."" And she said it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" to ease restrictions in Edinburgh or neighbouring Midlothian as cases were rising sharply in both. The rate in Edinburgh has increased from 70 to 100 per 100,000 over the past week, and in Midlothian from 88 to 147 per 100,000, with test positivity rates also increasing in both areas. Ms Sturgeon took part in a four-nation call with leaders from around the UK later on Tuesday, which she told MSPs she had requested after a new strain of the virus was identified in England. Nine cases of the new strain have now beenconfirmed in the Greater Glasgow and Clydehealth board area, the first minister confirmed. The talks were aimed at examining whether changes should be made to the planned relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions across the UK over Christmas, which will allow eight people from three households to mix indoors between 23 and 27 December. They broke up with no decision being reached, although further discussions have been scheduled for Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further, in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting."" New Covid strain: How worried should we be? The first minister said she would prefer to come to an agreed position across the UK, but said the Scottish government would ""consider what we think is appropriate"" if this was not possible. The planned relaxation of the rules at Christmas has been described as a""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives""by the both the Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the rising number of cases across many parts of Scotland ahead of the festive break showed that the journals were right. He added: ""It is rather concerning that the first minister was unable to tell parliament what position she would be advocating on behalf of Scotland in intergovernmental discussions planned for this afternoon."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the Christmas plans. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Realising his sport was in danger with little funding and no travel, he bought a van and toured the US, filming his flights in remote locations. Wolfgang noticed a huge reaction to his videos, with people who were in lockdown saying that it allowed them to momentarily leave their homes and experience the sport. He hopes to return to competitions and instructing in 2021, but for now, he's continuing to promote the sport. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There are no plans to change regulations covering Christmas in England, the BBC understands. Talks with devolved administrations - that have been taking place this evening - will continue tomorrow and it's still hoped a common approach can be agreed. There is likely to be tougher guidance in the coming days to reflect the current situation. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have said they will co-ordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. They pledged to rapidly share information on how vaccination was proceeding, Reuters reports, quoting a joint statement by the countries' health ministries. In Germany, there is growing impatience that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - developed by German scientists and currently being rolled out in the UK and US - has yet to be approved for use in the European Union, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. It was reported earlier thatEurope's medicines regulator EMA will meet sooner than had been planned to consider approving a vaccine. Vaccination programmes are under way in the UK with the Pfizer vaccine, but the approval of a second jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is eagerly awaited. The UK has ordered 100m doses and regulators are assessing its safety and efficacy - how well it works. It is in the last stage of assessment by MHRAafter the government asked it to analyse a final set of data on 27 November. Prof Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the vaccine, has said the chances it will be given to people before the end of the year are ""pretty high"".

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to authorise Moderna's vaccine sometime this week, US media report. This means that by Monday, there could be two Covid vaccines available for Americans. The Moderna vaccine can be shipped at -20C, while the jab from Pfizer/BioNTech must be kept at a trickier -70C. The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. The vaccines will be provided at no cost to Americans. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The country is also expecting 200,000 more Pfizer vaccines by next week. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab and 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech version.

Testing companies have faced problems meeting demand from travellers The new testing system intended to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England has facedproblems on its first day, with one company asking to withdraw from the programme. Travellers are now allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests, but a number have hit problems. One company, SameDayDoctor, has asked to be withdrawn from the programme. It posted a message on its website saying it has been ""so overwhelmed"" with requests for test-to-release that it cannot answer any more emails or take any more bookings. Downing Street says it is working to approve more test providers. BBC Radio 5 Live All day on 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Mike Jones is the violence reduction lead for South Western Ambulance Service, where there has been a sharp increase in assaults on paramedics.

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts who identified thenew variant of Covid that appears to be spreading fast in some parts of Englandsay the infection is probably home-grown rather than imported. Prof Nick Loman, an expert in microbiology from the University of Birmingham and part of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (CoG), says it seems to have appeared spontaneously ""out of nowhere"" in late September. The small number of cases soon grew to many more and got the experts concerned. So far, 1,000 confirmed cases have been discovered in the UK. They are predominantly in the south of England, but cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, including parts of Scotland and Wales. Prof Loman says as well as the ""striking growth"" on a wide geographical scale the ""sheer number of mutations"" - 17 in total - that made up the variant was more than they expected to see and set alarm bells ringing. While ""none of those things are smoking guns"", he says there is ""sufficient circumstantial evidence to think this is something that urgently needs following up"". The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid. In that space of time, there's also a chance the new variant could burn itself out and disappear as quickly as it arrived. A majority of people think ministers should abandon plans to relax the coronavirus rules over Christmas, an opinion poll suggests. In a survey of 3,856 adults in Great Britain by YouGov, 57% said the current restrictions should be maintained, with 31% supporting the plan to relax the rules. Older people appeared to be more strongly in favour of tighter restrictions, with 70% of over-65s saying the temporary relaxation should be scrapped, and 61% among those aged between 50 and 65. It comes as urgent talks are taking place between the leaders of the devolved administrations and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove - to discuss the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over Christmas. BBC Radio 5 Live Elizabeth has enjoyed getting ""glammed up"" for date nights All day, on BBC Radio 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Elizabeth Blythe is 29 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent. She and her husband are 999 call assessors at West Midlands Ambulance Service. She has had a tough year. As well as grieving for her dad who died last November, she had to postpone her honeymoon to New York because of Covid. Work has been challenging too. ""When coronavirus first hit the UK, it was pandemonium,"" she said. ""The phone was going constantly, you didn't get a break between calls. ""But as people got used to the 'new normal', the calls decreased quite a bit and it almost seemed that people were scared to call for an ambulance because they didn't want to go anywhere near where they thought coronavirus would be."" To make up for missing her honeymoon, Elizabeth and her husband have been having ""date nights"" to cheer themselves up. âI get myself all glammed up, he puts on nice clothes and we have a date night in the house,"" she said.

'Tis the season to go shopping... or maybe not As we mentioned earlier, the Netherlands has started a strict five-week lockdown, with schools, non-essential shops and public venues closing. It has left its neighbour Belgium a bit nervous - with towns near the border expecting a possible rush of Dutch shoppers scrambling to get their Christmas shopping done. Belgian leader Alexander De Croo spoke to Dutch PM Mark Rutte on Tuesday, stressing that recreational shopping is âforbiddenâ in his country,Brussels Times reports,external. The Netherlands has also reminded its citizens not to cross the border unless absolutely necessary. There are reports,externalthat the coastal town Knokke-Heist could close streets to reduce tourists' access.

Dr Fauci is a member of the US Covid taskforce Healthy Americans without underlying conditions could get the vaccine by the end of March or in early April, according to US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci. Dr Fauci, who has become the face of the US response to the pandemic,told MSNBC,externalhe hopes the country will have herd immunity by spring or early summer, but that depends on the ""efficiency of the rollout"". ""By the time we get to the fall, we can start approaching some degree of relief where the level of infection will be so low in society we can start essentially approaching some form of normality,"" Dr Fauci said. He also added that as soon as it's his turn to get the vaccine, he'll do so publicly, ""so that people can see that I feel strongly that this is something we should do"".

"This video can not be played Top Republican Mitch McConnell congratulated Joe Biden - but White House press secretary referred to ""ongoing litigation"" A top member of US President Donald Trump's Republican Party, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has congratulated Joe Biden on winning the presidential election last month. Senator McConnell spoke after the electoral college formally confirmed Mr Biden's victory over Mr Trump. The Democrat won 306 electoral college votes to Mr Trump's 232. President Trump still refuses to concede, making unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud. The people who ultimately pick the US president What Biden's victory means for rest of world 'Let's work together!' World reacts to Biden win Relations with the Senate, currently controlled by the Republicans, will be crucial to Mr Biden's presidency. This video can not be played The president of the United States is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college He visited Atlanta, Georgia, to campaign for the Democrats in next month's Senate run-off elections. Two seats will be decided on 5 January and could determine whether or not his party takes control of the chamber. Democrats already control the House of Representatives. After Monday's confirmation of Mr Biden's victory, three world leaders whose refusal to congratulate the president-elect had been commented widely, did so on Tuesday: Russia's Vladimir Putin, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and Mexico's AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. Putin offers Biden late congratulation on poll win Speaking on the Senate floor, Mr McConnell said he had hoped for a ""different result"" from the 3 November election but the electoral college had spoken. ""So today I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden,"" he said. Also congratulating Mr Biden's running-mate, Kamala Harris, he added: ""All Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice president-elect for the very first time."" Mr Biden said later he had phoned Mr McConnell to thank him for the congratulations and the two had agreed to ""get together sooner than later"". In an interview to ABC News, Ms Harris said she welcomed Mr McConnell's comments. ""It would have been better if it were earlierbut it happened, and that's what's most important,external. Let's move forward. And where we can find common purpose and common ground, let's do that."" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged Mr Trump to ""end his term with a modicum of grace and dignity"". ""For the sake of our democracy, for the sake of peaceful transition of power, he should stop the shenanigans, stop the misrepresentations and acknowledge that Joe Biden will be our next president,"" he said. President Trump does not appear to be changing his stance. Tweeting on Tuesday, he said without offering evidence that""tremendous evidence"" of voter fraud,externalwas ""pouring in"". When asked if Mr Trump recognised Mr Biden as president-elect, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany merely said the president was still involved in ongoing litigation related to the election. It took more than a month, but Mitch McConnell is now acknowledging the obvious - that Joe Biden will be the next US president. Upon Donald Trump's departure from the White House, the Senate majority leader will become the senior-most Republican officeholder in the US, so his congratulations to the Democratic president-elect are meaningful. They will give cover to other members of Congress who may have been holding their tongues lest they draw Donald Trump's ire. It may allow the presidential transition process to unroll in a more traditional manner - at least where relations between Congress and the incoming administration are concerned. With Mr McConnell now accepting Joe Biden's victory, President Trump's final play - challenging his election loss in Congress on 6 January - also becomes more pointless. Not only will it be blocked by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, it seems unlikely to find any traction in the Senate. Now the waiting for the Trump response begins. Will he shrug off Mr McConnell's words or add him to the growing list of enemies within his own party that must be confronted and condemned? The president's next words and actions could reveal the depth of the political turmoil facing the party in the days ahead. When Mr Biden takes over the White House on 20 January, he will be looking for the support of both chambers of Congress to carry out his election promises. Republicans have 52 of the 100 Senate seats. But this could change after the two separate run-offs in Georgia. In both races, a Republican incumbent faces a Democratic newcomer: Senator David Perdue, 70, will compete against Jon Ossoff, 33, a documentary filmmaker, while Senator Kelly Loeffler, 50, is up against Rev Raphael Warnock, 51, a senior pastor at an Atlanta Baptist church. Mr Biden addressed a drive-in rally at Pullman Yard in Atlanta Speaking at a drive-in rally in Atlanta, Mr Biden thanked voters for having faith and ""standing strong"", saying: ""Your voice was heard, your votes were counted, and counted and counted again. I'm starting to feel like I won Georgia three times."" But he emphasised that to get things done, he needed two Democratic senators, ""not two senators who are just going to get in the way"". ""Send me these two men and we'll control the Senate and we'll change the lives of people in Georgia,"" Mr Biden said, adding that the Senate should have passed a Covid relief package ""months ago"" but was doing ""nothing"". Recent polls suggest Mr Warnock is pulling ahead of Ms Loeffler, while the Perdue-Ossoff race is a dead heat. If the Democrats win both seats, the Senate will be evenly divided - but it will still be a win for the Democrats. US vice-presidents have the power to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate, meaning that with Vice-President-elect Harris on board, Democrats would effectively control both chambers. Georgia starts voting in pivotal senate battle Trump campaigns in crucial Senate battleground Meanwhile, Mr Biden nominated Pete Buttigieg as his transport secretary. If successful, Mr Buttigieg would be the first openly gay member of an American cabinet.

"Gabrielle Friel was found guilty of possessing weapons for purposes connected to an act of terrorism A man has been found guilty under the Terrorism Act of possessing weapons including a crossbow, 15 crossbow arrows and a machete. However, Gabrielle Friel was cleared of another charge alleging he wanted to carry out a ""spree killing"". A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found the charge that he was motivated by incel (involuntary celibate) ideology was not proven. The 22-year-old had denied both charges. Friel was accused of having the weapons and a bulletproof vest at various locations including his home, a community justice social work centre and the Royal Edinburgh Hospital between 1 June and 16 August last year. The charge stated that he had the weapons in circumstances ""giving rise to the reasonable suspicion"" that it was connected to the ""commission, preparation or instigation"" of an act of terror. A jury found him guilty by majority verdict. A crossbow, arrows, a scope, a machete and a ballistic vest were among the weapons on Friel's possession A second allegation that he prepared for terrorist acts by conducting online research in relation to spree killings during this time, particularly those connected with incels, was not proven. As part of this charge, Friel was accused of having ""expressed affinity with and sympathy for one incel-motivated mass murderer"" and to have expressed ""a desire to carry out a spree killing mass murder"" Judge Lord Beckett deferred sentencing until 12 January but told members of the jury it was likely to be a ""substantial prison sentence"". Friel, a prisoner at Polmont young offenders' institution, denied both charges andgave evidence in his own defence during the trial. He told the jury mass shooting was a ""fantasy"" for him and he had empathy for incel mass murder Elliot Rodger. But he said he was not an incel and described killers as evil. He said he bought the weapons in summer 2019 as he wanted to provoke police to shoot him. The court heard Friel had previously been sentenced to 300 hours of community service after pleading guilty to stabbing a police officer at Edinburgh College's Granton campus in 2017. Mr Friel claimed his motivation for taking knives into the college and stabbing the officer was that he wanted police to kill him. Assistant Chief Constable Patrick Campbell, of Police Scotland, welcomed the verdict in the ""extremely complex"" case. He described Friel as a ""dangerous, socially isolated and disaffected individual"" and said the consequences of his actions could have been ""catastrophic"". ""I sincerely thank the health and social care professionals and the Police Scotland officers involved in what was an extremely complex and challenging investigation,"" he added. ""Their actions contributed to an early intervention and, undoubtedly prevented him undertaking an act that threatened the safety of our communities."" Elliot Rodgers murdered six people in 2014 Shorthand for involuntary celibacy, incel is an online subculture which, at its extreme, spreads violent misogyny and blames women for depriving men of sex and relationships. Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, senior lecturer in media and digital culture, said the movement tends to attract individuals who are actively seeking companionship to deal with their loneliness. They are almost always men in their late teens to late 20s who are socially inadequate and have often been bullied. Dr Regehr told BBC Scotland: ""Incel is an online community of people who perceive that they have an inability to enter romantic relationships and come to the digital space to voice feelings of loneliness, anger and, at times, desire for revenge. ""This anger tends to be directed at woman and so-called attractive people that are able to find sex and love."" The Kent University academic said they typically employ ""dark, edgy humour"" and ""deify"" those who have carried out atrocities, most notablyCalifornian spree killer Elliott Rodgerwho murdered six people in 2014.

"Nine cases of a new variant of Covid-19 first identified in England have been reported in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The cases were all detected in the Greater Glasgow area, and date back to the end of November. The World Health Organisation has been notified about the new strain of the virus, with detailed studies ongoing. Ms Sturgeon said there is nothing to suggest it causes a more severe illness in people, but it may spread faster. She said people should not ""prematurely overreact"" to the development. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? 'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England Tougher coronavirus rules for three Scottish areas UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed on Monday that the new variant of coronavirus had been recorded in at least 60 different local authority areas. These cases were found predominantly in Kent, but it has now been confirmed that they have spread as far as Glasgow. Nine cases have been identified in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, dating back to the end of November - although almost 15,000 new cases of coronavirus have been reported in Scotland overall across that period. There is, as yet, ""nothing to suggest"" that the new strain causes more severe illness, or that it could prove resistant to vaccines. Ms Sturgeon was briefed by the chief medical officer on Monday, and will take part in a four-nation call with other UK leaders later on Tuesday. She told MSPs: ""It is important to stress there is no evidence at this stage that this new variant is likely to cause more serious illness in people. ""And while the initial analysis of it suggests that it may be more transmissible, with a faster growth rate than existing variants, that is not yet certain. ""It may instead be the case that it has been identified in areas where the virus is already spreading more rapidly."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said the new strain was ""a cause of great concern"", asking what was being done ""to assess the virulence of the strain"" and its transmission rate. Ms Sturgeon said analysis was being undertaken by Public Health England, but said people should not ""prematurely overreact"". She added: ""It is important to say that none of what is currently known about this yet is absolutely certain.""

"The plan to ease Covid rules over Christmas in the UK is a ""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives"", two leading medical journals have said. The Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal said people might see the lifting of restrictions ""as permission to drop their guard"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove has held talks on the issue with leaders in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. NI said scientific advisers would be consulted ahead of any decision. It comes after Labour called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. Earlier, No 10 said the rules were ""under constant review"" but it still intended to allow families to meet up. The prime minister's spokesman said the government had been clear that people needed to ""remain cautious and vigilant"" duringthe five days of relaxed rules from 23 to 27 December. The BBC's Nick Eardley said,externalone possible change being discussed was a limit on how far people can travel, but he stressed that no decisions had been taken. It comes as millions of people in London and parts of Hertfordshire and Essex prepare to move into England's toughest tier of coronavirus rules at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday. Meanwhile, another 18,450 cases and 506 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday,government figures,externalshowed. How many people can get together at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In a joint editorial criticising the UK's Christmas rules,the editors of HSJ and BMJ wrote,external: ""We believe the government is about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives. ""If our political leaders fail to take swift and decisive action, they can no longer claim to be 'protecting the NHS'."" They stressed that demand on the NHS was increasing, and added that a new strain of coronavirus ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene an emergency Cobra meeting to review the Christmas rules. In a letter,external, he acknowledged that people ""want to spend time with their families after this awful year"", but said ""the situation has clearly taken a turn for the worse since the decision about Christmas was taken"". This video can not be played The government needs to ""review"" and ""toughen up"" the planned Christmas virus restrictions, says Sir Keir Starmer. At the end of November, the leaders of the four UK nationsagreed to allow some coronavirus rules to be temporarily relaxedover the festive period. Travel restrictions will be eased to allow up to three households to form a bubble and stay overnight at each other's homes. Ahead of the latest talks, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""a case"" for tightening planned rules over the Christmas period - ""both in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting"". She said coming to a four nations agreement ""would be preferable"", but added: ""If that is not possible then of course we will consider within the Scottish government what we think is appropriate."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said hewould not ""lightly"" put aside the agreementthe four nations have reached, while Northern Ireland's health ministerwould not speculate on potential rule changes ahead of the call. According to a YouGov poll, a majority of people (57%) in Great Britain believe the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions over Christmas should be scrapped. Some 31% said the easing should go ahead as planned, while 12% said they were unsure. When the government announced the relaxation of rules for Christmas, it was hoped cases would be falling right up to the festive period. It was mid-lockdown and with the new tougher system of regional tiers in the pipeline, the hope was that the virus could be contained. That has not turned out to be the case - hence the moving of London and some of the surrounding areas into tier three. As always, the bottom line is the risk to the NHS - so it's worth pointing out that for all the pressure at the moment hospitals still have more beds free than this time last year. The full impact of the festive relaxation is, of course, impossible to predict. The UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has called it a ""modest"" relaxation - after all, in tier three areas hospitality will still be closed for all but takeaways. The judgement that has been made is that the benefits outweigh the costs. Allowing families to come together will be an important boost after such a difficult year, the government believes. What is more, there was a fear the public would just ignore pleas not to mix. But it clearly comes with risks - that's why the public is being asked to exercise caution. This video can not be played What can I do under tier 3 restrictions in England? If the UK's Christmas plans are not changed, BMJ editor in chief Fiona Godlee said ""we will have people sitting in ambulances, we will have people in corridors"" as hospitals become overwhelmed with a surge in Covid patients. Speaking to BBC News, she said: ""On the current trend, if nothing is done, by New Year's Day there will be as many people in hospital with Covid-19 as there were at the peak of the first phase in April. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Tier 3 restrictions 'worst-case scenario' for town ""That's even without the Christmas relaxation - so if you add that on top, and then on top of that the winter pressures that we always see in the NHS at winter, you will see a worrying scenario of people not being able to get the care they need."" She also said England's tiered system is ""not succeeding in what it set out to do"", as case numbers have continued to increase in some areas in the top tiers. This video can not be played Londoners on tier three restrictions and Christmas A review of which areas of England are in which tier is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. It has already been announced that some 10.8 million people across London, Essex and Hertfordshire will join tier three on Wednesday, bringing the total number of people living under the toughest restrictions to 34 million people - or 61% of England's population. Under tier three - very high alert - rules, pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut.

"Advice around celebrating Christmas safely across the UK is expected to be significantly strengthened in the coming days, the BBC has been told. People are likely to be urged to think carefully about travelling and to stay local where possible. However, it is unlikely the agreed rules - allowing up to three households to mix for five days - will change. Officials from all four nations held talks on Tuesday - and more are scheduled to take place on Wednesday. It comes amid concern that relaxing the restrictions will fuel a further surge in Covid-19 case numbers. Two leading medical journalsdescribed the current rules as ""rash"". A source said no final decisions had been taken but people are likely to be told that the relaxations are limits not targets and that they should be cautious when forming household bubbles. It is still hoped a common approach can be agreed across the four nations. Under the agreed Christmas rules, travel restrictions will be eased from 23 to 27 December to allow up to three households to form a bubble and stay overnight at each other's homes. How many people can get together at Christmas? New Covid strain: How worried should we be? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live A spokeswoman for Northern Ireland's government said scientific advisers would be consulted ahead of any decision, while a Welsh government spokesman said talks on Wednesday would ""confirm the position"". Ahead of the talks, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued there was a ""case"" for tightening the planned freedoms to combat a rise in infections and indicated she could break with the four-nations approach. Meanwhile, another 18,450 cases and 506 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday,government figures,externalshowed. The four nations have been taking very different approaches to restrictions in the last few months, so agreeing a common approach to Christmas was no small ask. But there are big questions now about what changes should be made given the rising number of Covid cases in many areas. I understand there are no plans to make changes to the restrictions in England; meaning it's unlikely the legal rules will change. However, we can expect firmer guidance in the next few days. One source on the call with the four nations told me there was an acceptance tougher messaging was needed. There has been discussion about travel. Some are particularly worried about people moving from areas where the virus is spreading fast, to areas where it's fairly rare, and taking the virus with them. The new guidance could cover that - as well as reminding people the rules are a maximum, not a target. It's not impossible that different parts of the UK will take different decisions. But there is still hope they can agree when talks reconvene on Wednesday morning. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. Earlier, No 10 said the rules were ""under constant review"" but it still intended to allow families to meet up.

"People are being warned to watch out for parcel delivery scams during the Christmas postal rush. Criminals are looking to defraud consumers by posing as well-known delivery companies, the banking trade body UK Finance has warned. Fraudsters have been sending emails saying they have not been able to deliver goods, and then ask for a fee to rearrange the delivery. They then try to extract financial details which are used to commit fraud. Customers are typically tricked into clicking on links to seemingly genuine websites requesting personal and financial information such as their address, date of birth, mobile number or bank details. In some cases, victims receive a call from the criminal later pretending to be from their bank's fraud team, trying to persuade them to move their money to a safe account or reveal their pass codes. UK Finance says the public should also be aware of an increased risk of scam phone calls and fake delivery notices posted through letterboxes. Fraudsters send links to seemingly genuine websites These notices will ask for advance payment or for customers to provide information that is later used to defraud them. Fraudsters 'targeting Christmas online shoppers' ""Unscrupulous criminals will stop at nothing to commit fraud and that includes exploiting the festive season to target their victims,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance. ""We are urging people not to give a gift to fraudsters this Christmas and to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign. Always take a moment to stop and think before parting with your information or money and avoid clicking on links in an email or text message in case it's a scam."" One IT worker, who didn't want to give his name, told the BBC he received an email earlier this month purporting to be from the delivery firm DPD. It asked him to pay Â£2 for re-delivery. He entered his bank details, but when he checked his account balance two days later he discovered a new purchase from Apple UK for Â£409. ""I fell for it without thinking as I have a lot of deliveries at the moment,"" the IT worker said. The man's bank refunded the full amount and promised to investigate the fraud. But not all victims will be so lucky. Some banks refuse to refund money that's been lost when victims volunteer information such as bank details, even though they've been duped. UK Finance says people should watch out for mis-spelled names, or cards and communication without your name specifically on them. If you are asked to contact the delivery firm, copy and paste any web address into a new browser, rather than clicking straight onto a link and phone numbers should be checked against the company's own listed numbers. TheTake Five to Stop Fraud,externalcampaign is urging people to: Stop: Taking a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information could keep you safe Challenge: Could it be fake?

"The higher numbers of deaths seen in the UK recent weeks may be starting to fall, figures suggest. In the week ending 4 December there were 13,956 deaths - 15% above the five-year average. But that is down on the previous week when deaths were 20% higher. Just over 3,100 of the deaths involved Covid - down by 200 on the week before. It brings the total excess deaths seen since the pandemic started close to 80,000. These are a measure of all deaths above what would normally be expected. It is a different way of measuring the death toll from the pandemic from the daily figures, which look at the numbers of people dying 28 days after a positive Covid test. People dying from Covid in this period are likely to have caught the infection in the first half of November after cases peaked. Since then cases continued to drop, before starting to climb again over the last week or so, particularly in the south east, which prompted the government to move London and some surrounding areas into tier three. That suggests the next few weeks could see Covid deaths going down and then up again in the coming weeks.

"This video can not be played Abdulhadi Abubaka describes how he managed to the mass kidnapping in Nigeria's Katsina school. Nigeria-based Islamist militant group Boko Haram has said it was behind last week's kidnapping of hundreds of schoolboys in the north-western Nigerian state of Katsina. More than 300 pupils are unaccounted for, but others managed to escape. The authorities had previously blamed ""bandits"" for the attack. Boko Haram has been notorious over the last decade for school kidnappings, including in Chibok in 2014, but these have taken place in the north-east. In an audio message about the abductions, its leader Abubakar Shekau said ""what happened in Katsina was our responsibility"" and that his group opposed Western education. Africa Live: Other stories from the continent 'How I escaped my Katsina kidnappers' Who are Boko Haram? This year hundreds of people in Nigeria's north-west region have been killed in attacks by what authorities have called criminal gangs, but until now it has been unclear whether they had links with Boko Haram. The militant group has waged a brutal insurgency since 2009, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria. Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced from their homes. A BBC team visited the deserted boarding school on Monday Activists have criticised President Muhammadu Buhari, whose home state is Katsina, of mishandling the security operation against the militants. Some have accused him of not showing empathy to the victims and families there after a video shared online on Tuesday showed him visiting his farm. ""It's absolute incompetence and an uncaring, indifferent ruling class that does not understand what it means to govern,"" former Nigerian Education Minister Oby Ezekwesili told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""Here we are as a country just completely showing ourselves as completely unserious when it comes to the matter of human life especially that of our children, "" she said, accusing the government of rebranding ""terrorism as banditry"". Boko Haram said it targeted the school because it opposed Western education Residents living near Government Science Secondary School in Kankara told the BBC they heard gunfire at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) last week on Friday, and that the attack lasted for more than an hour. Security personnel at the school managed to repel some of the attackers before police reinforcements arrived, officials said. Police said that during an exchange of fire, some of the gunmen were forced to retreat. Students were able to scale the fence of the school and run to safety, they said. About 800 students were at the school when the attack happened and more than 300 are still missing - but it is not clear if all of them are being held by the kidnappers. A 17-year-old boy who managed to escape the abductors told the BBC Hausa servicehow he crawled for several miles through the forest to freedom. President Buhari who is currently in Katsina on a private visit was being briefed hourly on efforts to rescue the children, his spokesman Garba Shehu said. President Buhari (L) was briefed about the operation by Katsina Governor Masari The children believe that 10 of their schoolmates were taken by the bandits, but this still needed to be verified, Mr Shehu told the BBC. He tweeted on Tuesday saying that Katsina Governor Aminu Bello Masari had met and briefed President Buhari about the operation to free the kidnapped students. Many parents said they had withdrawn their children from the school, Governor Massari also ordered the immediate closure of all boarding schools in the state. Analysis by Ishaq Khalid, BBC News Abuja Shekau's statement has sparked mixed reactions in Nigeria, with the authorities who blamed ""bandits"" for the attack now saying they were uncertain. Months before last week's attack Boko Haram claimed that it had a presence in the north-west region, so if it is proved that they are indeed behind the school raid, it's a worrying development. Some sceptics however say that Shekau may just be claiming responsibility as a propaganda strategy - to  attract more attention to his group - which is competing for dominance and relevance with a splinter faction known as Islamic State West Africa Province But as officials work on finding out who was behind the attack, it's yet another incident that has brought great anxiety to parents in the north-west region about the safety of their children in schools.

"Ingrid Messenger's mother called her loss ""devastating and irreparable"" A speeding driver who killed a 13-year-old girl and seriously injured her sister and mother has been jailed for four-and-a-half years. Ingrid Messenger was in the rear seat of a Citroen C4 hit by Tony Packenham's Land Rover Defender near Carlisle on 18 February 2019. The 47-year-old was ""absolutely flying"" at almost 80mph (128kmh) prior to the crash, the city's crown court heard. At a previous hearing, he admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Witnesses said the Land Rover was speeding before the crash at a crossroads between Stoneraise and Ivegill on the C1036. Ingrid's mother, Catriona Messenger, suffered a broken pelvis, ruptured diaphragm and spinal fractures, and was unable to walk unaided for three months. Her eldest daughter - front-seat passenger Erikka, then aged 15 - suffered a broken shoulder blade and bleeding on the brain. Tony Packenham had been warned he faced prison at a previous hearing Prosecutor Brendan Burke told the court the crash at 14:30 GMT would have been averted had Packenham not been driving ""well over"" the 60mph speed limit and ""in disregard"" of the wet road surface, warning signs before the crossroads and hazards created by two other vehicles. Video footage from his dashcam captured the crash and police recovered a memory stick he had thrown into bushes. Packenham, of Station Hill, Wigton, also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and admitted his dangerous driving caused serious injury to Mrs Messenger and Erikka. In an impact statement, Mrs Messenger had spoken of the ""devastating and irreparable loss"" of her daughter and said her heart was ""forever broken"". The court was told Packenham had been ""in a hurry"" to get home and was remorseful having ""devastated"" the lives of the Messengers and his own family, with his elderly parents being unable to visit him in prison. Judge Nicholas Barker said Packenham's speeding had been ""excessive"" with ""catastrophic and tragic consequences"".

"Barclays has been fined Â£26m for the way it treated customers who fell into debt or experienced financial problems. Among those poorly treated were bereaved people whose financial issues should have been better assessed. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said Barclays' poor treatment of its customers ""risked making these difficulties worse"". The bank has compensated those affected, paying over Â£273m to 1.53 million customer accounts since 2017. The FCA said Barclays knew about many of the shortcomings in its systems and controls as early as 2013, but failed to adequately resolve them until late 2018. ""Firms must treat consumer credit customers fairly, including when they find themselves in arrears,"" said Mark Steward, of the FCA. ""We will take action against unfair treatment, or where firm systems expose customers to the risk of unfairness. While this case predates the pandemic, this message is especially important as the impact of coronavirus continues to affect household incomes and budgets."" The problems affected individual current account holders and small business customers between April 2014 and December 2018. The regulator found these people had been poorly treated when they fell behind on credit repayments. They included people whose loved ones had died, who were not given sustainable or affordable debt repayment plans. Banks can re-start dividend payments Putin associate âmoved millionsâ through Barclays The bank failed to contact people quickly enough, leading to more debt charges. Staff did not have appropriate conversations with people in order to understand why they were facing financial problems. Then, when they put repayment plans in place, they were delayed, included errors, had mistakes with payments, and charged interest or fees during a breathing space hold on payments, the FCA said. The bank also missed signs that some of these customers were in a vulnerable situation ""in a significant number of cases"". A Barclays spokeswoman said: ""Barclays is a responsible lender and we strive to achieve good outcomes for our customers. ""We would like to apologise to those customers for not providing the level of service we should have."" She added that the bank had made changes to its systems, processes, and training to correct the issues and that ""the vast majority of customers who were impacted have already been contacted"". Any firm offering credit should properly understand customers' financial difficulties and show forbearance to those in arrears or in financial trouble. Otherwise, they could end up trying to pay their debt to the bank instead of a priority debt, such as a mortgage, council tax, child support and utility bills.

"Mass Covid testing of secondary-school pupils in England is to be greatly increased in January, in an attempt to reduce the numbers being sent home. Any students who have been in contact with a positive case will be offered seven days of daily testing, the Department for Education has announced. Teachers can have weekly Covid tests. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said this ""huge expansion"" of testing would be a ""milestone moment"" in keeping schools open. Hamid Patel, head of an academy trust that had piloted such testing, said it had been a ""game-changer"". The announcement comes as attendance figures showmore pupils out of school because of Covid outbreaks- with 15% missing last week on average across England and 23% in the West Midlands. Absences have been higher in secondary school, with 20% of pupils missing school last week. School attendance plummeted after half term Secondary school pupils in Covid hotspots urged to get tests First results of mass testing of students finds few positive cases Will there be mass testing at your child's school? As infection rates have risen many schools have struggled to keep going with so many pupils and staff having to isolate - and mass testing is an attempt to break this cycle. But the National Education Union said it was ""ridiculous"" for schools to be told to prepare for testing in the last few days of term with ""almost zero notice"". This video can not be played BBC Health Correspondent Laura Foster explains what schools are doing to keep pupils safe Instead union co-leader Kevin Courtney called for the first week of next term to be moved online - allowing schools time to prepare for testing. The announcement by the education secretary will make rapid Covid testing available to all secondary schools and colleges in England from the first week in January. It will be used to test pupils who have been near a positive case and where otherwise a whole bubble, class or year group might have been sent home. Secondary school teachers will be offered a test each week - and daily tests if they have had a case in their class, in a bid to reduce the disruption from staff having to isolate. The tests will be optional and require the consent of parents - and testing in primary schools could begin later in the term, said the Department for Education. The aim is to improve attendance and to reduce the numbers having to go home, by identifying and isolating those who are infected, and allowing those who do not have the virus to stay in school. Although 15% of pupils were out of school last week, the latest figures show 0.2% of pupils were confirmed Covid cases. University students had mass Covid testing ahead of the Christmas break Mass testing is also designed to stop the virus being spread by those who are infected but have no symptoms. But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said providing testing kits without trained staff to use them meant the government was in ""danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory"". He said expecting school staff to run the tests would be ""deeply flawed"". There have been pilots for school Covid testing - including schools run by the Star academies trust - and the trust's chief executive Hamid Patel said ""the benefits have been tremendous"". ""Attendance has improved as fewer close contacts have been required to self-isolate. Parents who may have been wavering have gained confidence to send their children to school, and staff have been reassured by the availability of testing,"" said Mr Patel.

"The new law aims to protect children and adults using the internet UK watchdog Ofcom is set to gain the power to block access to online services that fail to do enough to protect children and other users. The regulator would also be able to fine Facebook and other tech giants billions of pounds, and require them to publish an audit of efforts to tackle posts that are harmful but not illegal. The government is to include the measures in its Online Harms Bill. The proposed law would not introduce criminal prosecutions, however. Nor would it target online scams and other types of internet fraud. This will disappoint campaigners, who had called for the inclusion of both. It will, however, allow Ofcom to demand tech firms take action against child abuse imagery shared via encrypted messages, even if the apps in question are designed to stop their makers from being able to peer within. Secretary of State Oliver Dowden laid out his vision for the bill in parliament Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden told parliament the legislation represented ""decisive action"" to protect both children and adults online. ""A 13-year-old should no longer be able to access pornographic images on Twitter, YouTube will not be allowed to recommend videos promoting terrorist ideologies and anti-Semitic hate crimes will need to be removed without delay."" And he said that the government would introduce secondary legislation to introduce criminal sanctions for senior managers"", if those changes did not come about. Mr Dowden made a commitment to bring the bill before parliament in 2021, but it might not be until 2022 or later before it comes into force. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said there were signs that new laws would  have ""teeth"", including strong sanctions for companies found to be in breach of their duties. She welcomed the requirement on messaging apps to use technology to identify child abuse and exploitation material when directed to by the regulator. ""However, much will rest on the detail behind these announcements, which we will be looking at closely,"" she added. The TechUK trade association said ""significant clarity"" was needed about how the proposals would work in practice, adding that the ""prospect of harsh sanctions"" risked discouraging investment in the sector. The Online Harms Bill concentrates its fire on the very real dangers posed by child sexual exploitation, terrorism, bullying and abuse, but also addresses ""fake news"" on social media. There have been calls to tackle disinformation for years, especially after the issue was highlighted during the 2016 US presidential election and Brexit referendum campaigns. This year alone, misleading content about Covid-19, vaccines and 5G mobile technology has resulted in real-life harm - mobile phone masts have been torched as a result of conspiracy theories, and some people around the world were convinced that Covid-19 posed no real threat, leading to illness and death. The government's consultation says that social media companies' response to disinformation has been too patchy, exposing users to potentially dangerous content. But the government itself has been criticised for what was described as ""unacceptable"" delays in publishing the Online Harms Bill, and now it's unlikely to come into effect before 2022. When it does, content that could cause harm to public health or safety will fall under Ofcom's powers. With potentially harmful anti-vaccine posts spreading online, could both social media companies and the authorities have acted earlier?  The government claims the new rules will set ""the global standard"" for online safety. Plans to introduce the law were spurred on by the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing online images of self-harm. In 2019, her father Ian Russell accused Instagram of being partly to blame, leading ministers to demand social media companies take more responsibility for harmful online content. ""For 15 years or so, the platforms have been self-regulating and that patently hasn't worked because harmful content is all too easy to find,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. He added that unless top executives could be held criminally liable for their products' actions then he did not believe they would change their behaviour. In his parliamentary statement, Mr Dowden said he has asked the Law Commission ""to examine how the criminal law will address"" this sensitive area. ""We do need to take careful steps to make sure we don't inadvertently punish vulnerable people, but we do need to act now to prevent future tragedies,"" he said. The death of Molly Russell prompted calls for tougher rules to be imposed on online services used by teenagers Under the proposals, Ofcom would be able to fine companies up to 10% of their annual global turnover or Â£18m - whichever is greater - if they refused to remove illegal content and/or potentially failed to satisfy its concerns about posts that were legal but still harmful. Examples of the latter might include pornography that is visible to youngsters, bullying and dangerous disinformation, such as misleading claims about the safety of vaccinations. In addition, Ofcom could compel internet service providers to block devices from connecting to offending services. The regulator would be given ultimate say over where to draw the line and what offences would warrant its toughest sanctions. But in theory, it could fine Instagram's parent company Facebook $7.1bn and YouTube's owner Google $16.1bn based on their most recent earnings. The new regulations would apply to any company hosting user-generated content accessible to UK viewers, with certain exceptions including news publishers' comments sections and small business's product review slots. So, chat apps, dating services, online marketplaces and even video games and search engines would all be covered. However, the bigger companies would have added responsibilities. including having to publish regular transparency reports about steps taken to tackle online harms, and being required to clearly define what types of ""legal but harmful"" content they deem permissible. In response, Facebook's head of UK public policy Rebecca Stimson said that it has ""long called for new rules to set high standards"", adding that regulations were needed ""so that private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone"". The child protection charity NSPCC had wanted the law to go further by threatening criminal sanctions against senior managers. While it is planned for the bill to mention the possibility, it would only be as a provision that would require further legislation. ""We set out six tests for robust regulation - including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions,"" said the NSPCC's chief executive Peter Wanless. ""We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests."" A spokesman for the government said ministers wanted to see how well the initial set of powers worked before pursuing criminal action. MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis and the Mental Health Policy Institutehave also campaigned for the law to give the watchdog new powers,externalto crack down on scammers.

But the government suggested that it made sense to keep the regulations ""clear and manageable"" by leaving this to other laws. Well, it's taken a while. For at least the past four years, British and American governments have talked up their plans to regulate the data giants. Way back in the distant era of April 2019, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid, and then Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright pledged tough new rules to reduce online harms - years after a White Paper was first mooted. Brexit has taken up a lot of government bandwidth, of course. And then a pandemic did the same. But there is another reason for the delay. Regulating technology is very hard. Technology companies are global, exceptionally innovative, and spend huge sums on lobbying. Regulation is national, slow, and complicated. These new rules come just a fortnight after the announcement of aDigital Markets Unit to curb the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech. In both the economic and social sphere, a new compact between democracy and the data giants is - hesitantly - emerging. The government is keen, however, to avoid the law curtailing freedom of expression, So, it has promised safeguards to ensure users can still engage in ""robust debate"". The law would require WhatsApp to tackle child abuse imagery in encrypted chats These would include requiring companies to let users appeal against any content takedowns. Companies would also be told to consider what impact automated censorship systems might have when applied to chat apps or closed groups, where users expect to have more privacy. But the law would also let Ofcom demand that firms monitor, identify and remove illegal child sexual abuse and exploitation materials wherever they appear. And it could demand this of end-to-end encrypted chat apps including WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage and Google's Messages, even though their use of digital scrambling is intended to prevent the providers being able to monitor content. A government spokesman said the intention was for this to be a ""last resort"" measure used to tackle ""persistent offences"" when alternative approaches had failed. Even so, privacy campaigners are likely to push for further details about how this would be possible without compromising security.

"Moderna's vaccine is safe and 94% effective, regulators say, clearing the way for US emergency authorisation. The analysis by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) means it could become the second coronavirus vaccine to be allowed in the US. It comes one day after Americans across the country began receiving jabs of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The news comes as the US coronavirus death toll passes 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Endorsement of the Moderna vaccine by FDA scientists was announced on Tuesday, two days before the vaccine panel meets to discuss emergency approval. The54-page document said,externalthere were ""no specific safety concerns"" and that serious adverse reactions were rare. If approved by the team of experts later this week, and by the FDA's vaccine chief, shipments could begin within 24 hours. The FDA found a 94.1% efficacy rate out of a trial of 30,000 people, according to the document they released. Covid: When can I get vaccinated in the US? What you need to know about vaccine safety The most common side effects included fever, headaches, and muscle and joint pain. Last week,the FDA released similar data from Pfizerbefore voting to issue approval. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered Moderna was founded in 2010 and so far has never had a product approved by the FDA. The company's stocks have seen a nearly 700% increase so far this year. The Moderna vaccine requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a regular freezer. The Pfizer jab requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. How will we keep the vaccine cold enough? Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second jab comes 28 days after the first. The company is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has said that if approved, the ""vast majority"" of its vaccine would be manufactured there. Pfizer's drug is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium. Approval of a second Covid vaccine in the US would be a big deal. The country is the worst-hit in the world according to the recorded death toll from the pandemic virus and urgently needs more ammunition to fight the virus. The US has several million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine that was authorised for emergency use a few days ago by regulators. Although mass vaccination has begun with these, getting access to the Moderna jab in the near future, in addition to more stock of the Pfizer one, would mean many millions more people could be inoculated in the coming months. The Food and Drug Administration is yet to give the green light for the Moderna vaccine, but if it does, the US could start to receive some of the 200m doses it has pre-ordered. The first lot of 20m could be delivered by the end of December. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March - part of a total 56m doses. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab. The European Union last month announced a contract to purchase of 80m doses - with up to 80m more - once the vaccine is deemed safe and effective. Japan has signed up for 50m Moderna doses, South Korea for 20m, and Switzerland has ordered 7.5m, according to data compiled bythe Duke University Global Health Innovation Center,external.

"There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, official figures show. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail, according to the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. While there have been significant job losses in other sectors such as aviation and manufacturing, hospitality has been the most affected by coronavirus restrictions this year. Bars and restaurants had to close for months during the first lockdown, and have faced strict compliance rules and further shutdowns since then. Thousands remain closed in areas covered by tier 3 restrictions and the industry will suffer even more when London - a hive of hospitality firms - enters the highest alert level on Wednesday. ""It you look at the number of people losing their jobs, the number of people on furlough and the vacancies available for people looking for jobs in the hospitality sector, all that adds up to a very difficult time for that industry,"" the ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, told the BBC's Today programme. Industry body UK Hospitality called the move to place London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire into tier 3 ""illogical"", despite the recent surge in infections. ""The spread is being predominantly driven through schools... yet, once again, it is hospitality that will take the hit,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""So many pubs, restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels, having invested so much to make their venues safe, are only just clinging on by the skin of their teeth."" Ana Grillo is looking for work in marketing and publishing Ana Grillo graduated in September but has been unable to find work since, despite having made applying for roles her ""full time job"". ""It's extremely overwhelming, especially in a pandemic as there's not as many people to turn to for support,"" she told the BBC. She is looking for work in marketing or publishing but says the competition is intense - so much so she tries to submit applications within an hour of an advert being published. ""Some employers make us very aware that they are overwhelmed so they are just going to take the first bunch,"" she said. Having largely supported herself through university, living back at home with her parents has made her feel a ""bit of burden"". ""I've been independent for three years and now I feel completely helpless. But I have no choice."" Redundancies hit a record 370,000 in the three months to October, according to the ONS, although this began to ease towards the end of the period. But the figures pre-date the November lockdown and unemployment is excepted to continue to rise, peaking at a rate of 9.7% this year, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The latest data confirms that coronavirus continues to weigh heavily on the UK labour market. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""While the furlough scheme will help safeguard many jobs over the winter months, with businesses facing the prospect of further restrictions and a messy end to the Brexit transition period, major job losses remain probable in the near term."" The jobs numbers are again grim over the course of the pandemic with 819,000 fewer employees on payrolls since February. But without extension of the furlough scheme to March they would have been even more concerning. The official headline unemployment rate is up only a little at 4.9%. But for most of October it was above 5%. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? These numbers reflect mainly the period before the second national lockdown. And for the first time they are broken down by industry. Well over half of the lost employees during the pandemic have been in hospitality and retail, 456,837 out of 819,000. Health and social care have seen an extra 74,342 jobs. While some optimism has emerged from the prospect of a functioning vaccine, the next few months are likely to remain very challenging, with unemployment continuing to rise. Those rises continue to be contained by the furlough scheme. Many companies began to cut jobs in anticipation of the end of the furlough wage support scheme, which was originally meant to finish on 31 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the scheme until March as the second England lockdown began last month, but some argue he should have moved sooner. Commenting on the latest figures, Mr Sunak said the government had provided Â£280bn of support, including protecting more than nine million jobs through the furlough scheme and offering loans, grants and tax cuts to business. He added: ""But we know that, sadly, many people are already facing unemployment. That's why our Plan for Jobs is also helping to create new jobs, including through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme and expanded apprenticeships and traineeships."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the chancellor's ""irresponsible decisions"" had cost jobs and left the UK with the ""worst recession of any major economy"". ""It's no coincidence that redundancies rocketed to record levels when the clock was ticking down to the chancellor's furlough cliff edge and rising employer contributions were putting businesses under pressure. ""Employers can't afford to wait until the last minute again for this chancellor to decide what happens to the furlough scheme at the end of January. They need clarity now.""

"Edinburgh remains in level three despite lower levels of positive Covid tests than nearby areas The latest review of Scotland's Covid-19 restriction levels will be announced at Holyrood later. All 32 local authority areas will have their situation assessed by politicians and public health officials. It could be the last review before the five-day Christmas easing of restrictions begins on 23 December. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said levels for all areas including Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire would be considered. Ms Sturgeon said last week she expected it to be the last review until 5 January although a parliamentary update on levels is scheduled for next week. The first minister said she wanted to provide consistency and stability over the Christmas period but would not rule out action if a particular area saw a surge in cases. Edinburgh is currently in level three, which means tough restrictions on hospitality and limits travel into and out of the local authority area. The decision to keep Edinburgh in level three last week was controversial because positive Covid rates in the city were lower than surrounding areas. But at the daily coronavirus briefing on Monday, the first minister said a 33% spike in cases in the past week showed it was the right one. Ms Sturgeon said moving the capital to level two would have been like ""pouring petrol on smouldering embers."" Aberdeen has the second highest weekly rate of positive tests of all local authorities in level two and cases have continued to rise since the last weekly review. Any changes agreed will come at the same time as the government is advising people tocut down on contacts before Christmas. At Monday's briefing, the first minister said people in Scotland should ""think really carefully"" about gathering indoors, adding that the ""best Christmas gift we can give family and friends"" is to ""keep our distance and keep them safe"". Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? In last week's review, it was announced that 11 council areas that were subject to the highest tier of restrictions would move down to lower levels. The toughest restrictions were imposed to bring down case numbers in Scotland's Covid hotspots - but they came at a cost, with hospitality and non-essential shops required to close, among other measures. Speaking on BBC Scotland'sCoronavirus Updateprogramme, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called on all the evidence behind the Scottish government's decisions on restriction levels to be made available, following the row over Edinburgh remaining in level three. The Scottish Conservative leader reiterated the call for people to be sensible over the Christmas period, but said the government must be honest with the public about the science behind its decisions. Vaccinations for care home staff and residents have started in Scotland Ms Sturgeon told MSPs last week that she considered moving Edinburgh down to level two - but the closeness to the Christmas period meant that this did not happen. On Friday, Scotland's highest civil court ruled the decision to keep Edinburgh under level three Covid restrictions was lawful, with the judge deciding the Scottish government had a right to consider factors other than data. The court heard there was ""no simple algorithm"" to determine levels and the indicators used ""may change over time"". The judge highlighted that in level two people could travel around Scotland freely - except for entering level three or four areas - whereas those in level three could not leave the local authority area, limiting the potential for viral spread in the capital city. The assessment of restriction levels for each area come as vaccinations are rolled out for frontline health workers and care home residents. Vaccinations for health staff began last week, and the first vaccines for care home residents, who are considered the most vulnerable to Covid-19, were administered on Tuesday.

"More than 1,200 people in Scotland died of drug misuse last year, new figures show. The much-delayed figures show a record number of deaths for the sixth year in a row and the highest total since records began in 1996. The figure of 1,264 is a 6% increase on 2018 and more than double the number of deaths in 2014. It is the worst rate recorded in Europe and about three and a half times the rate for England and Wales. TheNational Records of Scotland,externalstatistics are six months late after a huge backlog in processing toxicology results and delays due to Covid-19. They show that two-thirds of those who died were aged 35 to 54. Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis The report said the median average age of drug-related deaths had gone up from 28 to 42 over the past two decades. However, there was also an increase in deaths among 15 to 24 year olds - from 64 in 2018 to 76 in 2019. Three-quarters of the deaths occurred in five health board areas. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had 404 deaths, Lanarkshire 163, Lothian 155, Tayside 118 and Ayrshire and Arran 108. Here we are again. For the sixth year running, Scotland has seen a record total of drug deaths. We are once again the worst in Europe. It shouldn't come as a surprise. While the UK and Scottish governments organised competing summits to showcase their vision of how to tackle the problem, frontline workers warned that the death rate was accelerating. This year, the mountain of toxicology reports into drug deaths needed Â£300,000 of extra funding to be cleared and, still, the figures were five months late. Much of the focus of this issue has been on the Misuse of Drugs Act, which is reserved to Westminster. The Scottish government argues that it needs more control over the law to trial initiatives such as safer injecting facilities; the UK government argues the opposite, and that instead there needs to be more investment in rehab beds. Those in the sector say these arguments only serve to simplify an issue that is so intractable, so huge. Already identified as issues to tackle are punitive regimes that saw users kicked off methadone prescriptions for missing appointments. Those hoping for methadone were, in some cases, waiting up to five weeks for a prescription. While the death toll climbed, funding to frontline services was cut by the Scottish government. In 2016, treatment was only reaching 40% of those who needed it. The drug-taking trends are also shifting under our feet - as older heroin users die, a younger generation have taken to injecting cocaine, supercharging an HIV epidemic in Scotland's largest city. Meanwhile, so-called street Valium - or etizolam - has a grip on the drug-using population. Scotland's Drug Death Task Force is trying to turn the tide. They have encouraged same-day prescribing and the expansion medical assisted treatment, along with programmes to distributed the life-saving drug Naloxone. Even with these efforts though, this problem will take years to stabilise. Scotland's ""polydrug"" habit - mixing dangerous street drugs with alcohol and prescription pills - caused many of the deaths. The report said 94% of all drug-related deaths were of people who took more than one substance. Heroin and morphine were implicated in more deaths than in any previous year - more than half of the total. ""Street"" benzodiazepines (such as etizolam) were named in almost two-thirds of deaths, more than in any previous year. There was also a big rise in cocaine being reported as taken by people who died (365) as well as gabapentin and pregabalin, which are used to treat nerve pain. In September, a report from theEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,externalsaid Scotland had the highest recorded drug death rate in Europe, far ahead of Sweden in second place. It highlighted the problem of benzos, saying: ""In Scotland, criminal groups are known to be involved in the large-scale illicit manufacture and distribution of fake benzodiazepine medicines."" The fake Valium - that sells for as little as 50p - is many times stronger than prescription drugs. The new breed of benzodiazepines are often taken alongside other drugs such as heroin. Scottish Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said the Scottish government was doing ""everything in its powers to tackle rising drug deaths"". Mr FitzPatrick said the Drug Deaths Taskforce, which was established after a public health emergency was declared last year, was continuing its ""urgent work"" and there was a new sub-group looking at the issue of benzodiazepines. He said: ""These deaths stem from a longstanding and complex set of challenges, and there is no shortcut that will suddenly solve this."" Scottish Conservative health spokesman Donald Cameron said the statistics were ""dreadful and heart-breaking in equal measure"". ""It is appalling that drug deaths have doubled in a decade, and there's no doubt that this government's cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes have a large part to play in this awful trend,"" he said. ""The Scottish Conservatives have backed calls from rehab organisations - including Favor Scotland, Jericho House and Phoenix Futures - for a Â£20m Scottish Recovery Fund. ""We need to start helping people to get off drugs and get well, we can't simply try to manage addictions and leave it there."" Scottish Labour's Monica Lennon called on Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick to resign over the record levels of drug deaths. She said: ""Time and time again, the Scottish government was warned by dozens of organisations to properly fund treatment and recovery services, but instead we got real terms cuts. ""Calls for bold and urgent action have not been acted on. ""The public needs to have confidence in the public health minister to lead us out of this human rights tragedy - these shocking statistics and his woeful response give us none."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said lives were being lost on an ""unprecedented and unparalleled scale"". He said: ""Too often services simply aren't there, either through a lack of resources or a lack of political will."" Mr Cole-Hamilton called for more funding for drug services and sending people to treatment instead of prison. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie accused both the Scottish and UK governments of ""a shameful failure of leadership"". He said criminalisation of drugs had caused more harm than it has prevented. ""Addiction is better tackled by trained medical professionals than the strong arm of the law,"" he said. However, decriminalisation has been ruled out by the UK government, which controls drugs law. David Liddell, the chief executive of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said the number of preventable deaths was ""a national tragedy and disgrace"". ""We need people to be in high quality treatment that protects them from overdose and death,"" he said. â¯He said the Drug Taskforce's plans for treatment standards, which would mean people gained quick access to drug services and have a choice of medication that best suits them, were a step forward. He also called for drug consumption rooms, heroin-assisted treatment and assertive outreach.â¯â¯ Mr Liddell said there needed to be an end to ""the alienation, marginalisation and stigmatisation of people with a drug problem"". ""As part of this approach, we should decriminalise the possession of all drugs and extend the current recorded police warning for cannabis possession to apply to all other drugs,"" he said.

"Aberdeen has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past week Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and East Lothian will all move from level two to level three of thefive-tiered system,external. It means people will no longer be allowed to travel outside of their own council area unless it is essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to stop serving alcohol and must shut at 18:00. And indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close. All of the country's other 29 council areas will remain in their current levels, including Edinburgh - which had beenpushing to be downgradedfrom level three to level two. Nine cases of new Covid strain found in Scotland 'Rash' Christmas Covid rules 'will cost many lives' What level of restrictions is your council in? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? It means that 80% of Scotland's population - about 4.35 million people - across 21 local authorities will be living under the level three rules when the changes come into force at 18:00 on Friday. They include the 11 areas in western and central Scotland which weredowngraded from the highest level fourcategory last week. Only four - Angus, Argyll and Bute, Falkirk and Inverclyde - remain in level two. However, Argyll and Bute is likely to move down to level one next week - and people living on the outer Argyll islands such as Islay, Mull and Iona will be able to meet in houses in groups of up to six from two households from Friday of this week. The Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are all already in level one, with no councils currently in the lowest level zero tier. All of the levels will be reviewed again next Tuesday as a precaution ahead of the festive period. Case numbers in Aberdeen have increased from 76 cases per 100,000 to 122 over the past week, and in East Lothian from 69 per 100,000 people to 116. The increase in Aberdeenshire has not been quite as sharp, but cases there are also rising. Alexander Burnett, the Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the area had been moved to level three so close to Christmas, and called for extra financial support to be put in place by the Scottish government. He added: ""Our hospitality sector has been decimated by repeated closures and this is likely to hurt even more during what is supposed to be one of their busiest periods."" East Lothian Council said its move to level three was disappointing but understandable given the high infection rates in the area in recent weeks. Tory councillor Douglas Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said he was ""not too surprised"" by the decision to move the area up to level three, but questioned role of the hospitality sector in spreading the virus. And the Scottish Licensed Traders Association said continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" Speaking as she announced the changes, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that the level three restrictions would cause ""real and continued difficulties for many businesses"", particularly in the hospitality sector. But she insisted that the move was essential to bring the virus under control again. Nine cases of a new strain of the virus have now been detected in Scotland after emerging in the south of England Ms Sturgeon said Angus and Falkirk would both be monitored ""very carefully"" over the next week after a rise in cases in both areas, with a move to level three not being ruled out. Cases have also ""increased quite sharply"" in East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and Fife, she said, adding: ""While the changes in these areas do not warrant a move to level four at this stage, we will be monitoring the situation very closely over the next few days."" And she said it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" to ease restrictions in Edinburgh or neighbouring Midlothian as cases were rising sharply in both. The rate in Edinburgh has increased from 70 to 100 per 100,000 over the past week, and in Midlothian from 88 to 147 per 100,000, with test positivity rates also increasing in both areas. Ms Sturgeon took part in a four-nation call with leaders from around the UK later on Tuesday, which she told MSPs she had requested after a new strain of the virus was identified in England. Nine cases of the new strain have now beenconfirmed in the Greater Glasgow and Clydehealth board area, the first minister confirmed. The talks were aimed at examining whether changes should be made to the planned relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions across the UK over Christmas, which will allow eight people from three households to mix indoors between 23 and 27 December. They broke up with no decision being reached, although further discussions have been scheduled for Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further, in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting."" New Covid strain: How worried should we be? The first minister said she would prefer to come to an agreed position across the UK, but said the Scottish government would ""consider what we think is appropriate"" if this was not possible. The planned relaxation of the rules at Christmas has been described as a""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives""by the both the Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the rising number of cases across many parts of Scotland ahead of the festive break showed that the journals were right. He added: ""It is rather concerning that the first minister was unable to tell parliament what position she would be advocating on behalf of Scotland in intergovernmental discussions planned for this afternoon.""

"The new law aims to protect children and adults using the internet UK watchdog Ofcom is set to gain the power to block access to online services that fail to do enough to protect children and other users. The regulator would also be able to fine Facebook and other tech giants billions of pounds, and require them to publish an audit of efforts to tackle posts that are harmful but not illegal. The government is to include the measures in its Online Harms Bill. The proposed law would not introduce criminal prosecutions, however. Nor would it target online scams and other types of internet fraud. This will disappoint campaigners, who had called for the inclusion of both. It will, however, allow Ofcom to demand tech firms take action against child abuse imagery shared via encrypted messages, even if the apps in question are designed to stop their makers from being able to peer within. Secretary of State Oliver Dowden laid out his vision for the bill in parliament Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden told parliament the legislation represented ""decisive action"" to protect both children and adults online. ""A 13-year-old should no longer be able to access pornographic images on Twitter, YouTube will not be allowed to recommend videos promoting terrorist ideologies and anti-Semitic hate crimes will need to be removed without delay."" And he said that the government would introduce secondary legislation to introduce criminal sanctions for senior managers"", if those changes did not come about. Mr Dowden made a commitment to bring the bill before parliament in 2021, but it might not be until 2022 or later before it comes into force. The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said there were signs that new laws would  have ""teeth"", including strong sanctions for companies found to be in breach of their duties. She welcomed the requirement on messaging apps to use technology to identify child abuse and exploitation material when directed to by the regulator. ""However, much will rest on the detail behind these announcements, which we will be looking at closely,"" she added. The TechUK trade association said ""significant clarity"" was needed about how the proposals would work in practice, adding that the ""prospect of harsh sanctions"" risked discouraging investment in the sector. The Online Harms Bill concentrates its fire on the very real dangers posed by child sexual exploitation, terrorism, bullying and abuse, but also addresses ""fake news"" on social media. There have been calls to tackle disinformation for years, especially after the issue was highlighted during the 2016 US presidential election and Brexit referendum campaigns. This year alone, misleading content about Covid-19, vaccines and 5G mobile technology has resulted in real-life harm - mobile phone masts have been torched as a result of conspiracy theories, and some people around the world were convinced that Covid-19 posed no real threat, leading to illness and death. The government's consultation says that social media companies' response to disinformation has been too patchy, exposing users to potentially dangerous content. But the government itself has been criticised for what was described as ""unacceptable"" delays in publishing the Online Harms Bill, and now it's unlikely to come into effect before 2022. When it does, content that could cause harm to public health or safety will fall under Ofcom's powers. With potentially harmful anti-vaccine posts spreading online, could both social media companies and the authorities have acted earlier?  The government claims the new rules will set ""the global standard"" for online safety. Plans to introduce the law were spurred on by the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing online images of self-harm. In 2019, her father Ian Russell accused Instagram of being partly to blame, leading ministers to demand social media companies take more responsibility for harmful online content. ""For 15 years or so, the platforms have been self-regulating and that patently hasn't worked because harmful content is all too easy to find,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. He added that unless top executives could be held criminally liable for their products' actions then he did not believe they would change their behaviour. In his parliamentary statement, Mr Dowden said he has asked the Law Commission ""to examine how the criminal law will address"" this sensitive area. ""We do need to take careful steps to make sure we don't inadvertently punish vulnerable people, but we do need to act now to prevent future tragedies,"" he said. The death of Molly Russell prompted calls for tougher rules to be imposed on online services used by teenagers Under the proposals, Ofcom would be able to fine companies up to 10% of their annual global turnover or Â£18m - whichever is greater - if they refused to remove illegal content and/or potentially failed to satisfy its concerns about posts that were legal but still harmful. Examples of the latter might include pornography that is visible to youngsters, bullying and dangerous disinformation, such as misleading claims about the safety of vaccinations. In addition, Ofcom could compel internet service providers to block devices from connecting to offending services. The regulator would be given ultimate say over where to draw the line and what offences would warrant its toughest sanctions. But in theory, it could fine Instagram's parent company Facebook $7.1bn and YouTube's owner Google $16.1bn based on their most recent earnings. The new regulations would apply to any company hosting user-generated content accessible to UK viewers, with certain exceptions including news publishers' comments sections and small business's product review slots. So, chat apps, dating services, online marketplaces and even video games and search engines would all be covered. However, the bigger companies would have added responsibilities. including having to publish regular transparency reports about steps taken to tackle online harms, and being required to clearly define what types of ""legal but harmful"" content they deem permissible. In response, Facebook's head of UK public policy Rebecca Stimson said that it has ""long called for new rules to set high standards"", adding that regulations were needed ""so that private companies aren't making so many important decisions alone"". The child protection charity NSPCC had wanted the law to go further by threatening criminal sanctions against senior managers. While it is planned for the bill to mention the possibility, it would only be as a provision that would require further legislation. ""We set out six tests for robust regulation - including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions,"" said the NSPCC's chief executive Peter Wanless. ""We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests."" A spokesman for the government said ministers wanted to see how well the initial set of powers worked before pursuing criminal action. MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis and the Mental Health Policy Institutehave also campaigned for the law to give the watchdog new powers,externalto crack down on scammers.

But the government suggested that it made sense to keep the regulations ""clear and manageable"" by leaving this to other laws. Well, it's taken a while. For at least the past four years, British and American governments have talked up their plans to regulate the data giants. Way back in the distant era of April 2019, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid, and then Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright pledged tough new rules to reduce online harms - years after a White Paper was first mooted. Brexit has taken up a lot of government bandwidth, of course. And then a pandemic did the same. But there is another reason for the delay. Regulating technology is very hard. Technology companies are global, exceptionally innovative, and spend huge sums on lobbying. Regulation is national, slow, and complicated. These new rules come just a fortnight after the announcement of aDigital Markets Unit to curb the monopolistic tendencies of Big Tech. In both the economic and social sphere, a new compact between democracy and the data giants is - hesitantly - emerging. The government is keen, however, to avoid the law curtailing freedom of expression, So, it has promised safeguards to ensure users can still engage in ""robust debate"". The law would require WhatsApp to tackle child abuse imagery in encrypted chats These would include requiring companies to let users appeal against any content takedowns. Companies would also be told to consider what impact automated censorship systems might have when applied to chat apps or closed groups, where users expect to have more privacy. But the law would also let Ofcom demand that firms monitor, identify and remove illegal child sexual abuse and exploitation materials wherever they appear. And it could demand this of end-to-end encrypted chat apps including WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage and Google's Messages, even though their use of digital scrambling is intended to prevent the providers being able to monitor content. A government spokesman said the intention was for this to be a ""last resort"" measure used to tackle ""persistent offences"" when alternative approaches had failed. Even so, privacy campaigners are likely to push for further details about how this would be possible without compromising security.

"Life has changed dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There has been an enormous human and financial cost - and its impact has also been felt in many other ways. Four of our correspondents look at the impact of the pandemic in numbers - from cancelled operations to school days lost and a rises in benefit claimants. The most obvious wayto measure the impact of coronavirusis to see how many people have died - and look at how much that figure is above the usual annual total. Between March and the end of November, there were more than 79,000 excess deaths above the five-year average, which were almost exclusively driven by Covid. Not every death linked to Covid is a death that was directly caused by it. But Office for National Statistics analysis shows close to nine in 10 cases in England and Wales have been. And deaths among younger age groups have been relatively rare - the majority of people who have died have been among older age groups. The average age of death is over 80. How deadly is the coronavirus? Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? Neither have deaths been evenly distributed across the country. London saw a surge in cases first, followed by the north of England, with leaders there suggesting that the first lockdown was lifted too early for them. Now, there are signs the south of England's second wave is growing as the North's recedes. But slice this data up even further and distinct patterns emerge.People from poorer backgrounds,externaland thosefrom ethnic minorities are both,externalat a significantly higher risk of death. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Deprived areas hit twice as hard by coronavirus Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? There are several complex factors at play, with people from these communities more likely to: Work in jobs where they see the public Live in densely-populated housing Have poorer health, with conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and respiratory problems all more common Covid hasalso disrupted other NHS services,with warnings about people not getting treatment or diagnosis for other conditions. Routine work, including knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the spring, leading to a growing backlog and more people facing long waits. Cancer services were severely disrupted and activity levels have only recently returned to normal.Macmillan Cancer Support estimates,externalthere may be as many as 50,000 missing diagnoses. And visits to A&E have also fallen by a third since March, compared with the same time last year. Doctors say people were worried about the Covid risk and felt they should not bother the health service. But among those not coming forward were people with the symptoms of heart attacks and minor strokes. A year ago, nobody would have thought police would be telling people sunbathing it is against the law, or that ""mingling"" could be punished with an immediate fine of Â£200. But one of Covid's greatest costs has been the unprecedented restrictions on civil liberties in peacetime. Across the four nations, in the rush to enforce lockdowns and other restrictions, more than 20 pieces of law have come into force that have criminalised otherwise normal behaviour. Most of them were not even debated or voted on by elected politicians. The 27,000 fines, mostly for gatherings, are not evenly spread geographically. Leicester has been under the longest-standing restrictions - yet it has a far lower rate of fines than north-west England which has faced similar challenges. Some of that is down to local policing decisions - not least because many officers are very wary of the long-term impact on community relations if they continually dish out fines. The backlog in the courts is enormous. So much so that there are people now waiting for trial in England, for alleged offences committed in 2018, who may not face a jury until 2022. When the pandemic hit, jury trials were stopped because the courts could not guarantee safe distancing to prevent the risk of the virus spreading. Crest, a crime and justice consultancy,estimates that unless capacity doubles,the backlog of crown court cases, the most serious ones, will be near 200,000 by 2024. The Lord Chief Justice hopesto have 300 crown courts sitting by the new year,external- but that will still be less than the maximum possible. But these enormous delays to justice - affecting defendants, victims and witnesses - are not just down to Covid. England and Wales already had an enormous case backlog because the government had cut the number of days judges could sit. The Ministry of Justice says it is funding 40 additional court rooms - dubbed Nightingale Courts - to help tackle the impact of Covid to family, civil and criminal cases. Schools act as a place of safety and routine for children, providing a structure and certainty to their lives. That has been turned upside down in 2020, with schooling closed then repeatedly interrupted by self-isolation in the autumn term. The headline national figures for secondary attendance have declined, but they don't capture the huge geographical variations in England. In mid-October it fell to 61% in Knowsley on Merseyside, and in early December in Kent's Medway towns, only 42% of pupils were learning in the classroom at one point. The loss of learning and confidence is hard to capture, but will ripple through the education system for many years. Good mental health is vital for children and young people to flourish, butNHS research suggests that during the pandemic,externalit has worsened in England. Both boys and girls were affected, suggesting the uncertainty, loneliness and disruption of this year have taken their toll. The pressure on families worried about their finances, forced to spend time together in lockdown appear to be a factor. Teenage girls reporting mental health difficulties are more likely to have seen an argument at home. More thanhalf a million additional households,externalwith children are claiming universal credit than at the pandemic's start, which is a marker of increased child poverty risks. Schools are reporting a big increase in parents seeking free school meals for their children, although official statistics will not be available until next year. Food poverty and the corrosive impact on children's lives has galvanised schools to organise food banks and grocery deliveries for families in their communities. The shame and stigma around children's hunger has been softened by the high-profile campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford. The concern led to government support in the form of extending holiday free school meals, extra payments to families living in poverty, or money to local authorities. Who will get free school meals? How many children need free meals? Thewelfare system has seen unprecedented demands,externalthis year, and 5.7 million people are now receiving the main benefit, universal credit. This figure has almost doubled since March. It has coped admirably with the surge in claimants, including handling 1.5 million applications over a four-week period to 9 April. What is universal credit and what else can I claim? Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? It hasn't just processed those claims, it has also increased the speed and accuracy of payments to claimants, and there is understandable pride within the Department for Work and Pensions at what they've achieved. In total, around 6.3% of people in the UK are claiming unemployment welfare, with fears that this will increase moving forward. The largest proportion of people on unemployment benefits remain in areas like the north of England, south Wales and central Scotland. But the pandemic has forced people elsewhere who had never previously needed benefits, to turn to the welfare state. The largest increase in claimants has been in the south of England, which is partly explained by so few claiming unemployment welfare before, making any increases particularly noticeable. When large-scale working from home started. the cleaners, coffee shops, tailors, and dry cleaners used by London's office workers had no work and needed help, through welfare or the furlough scheme. The collapse of the aviation sector saw Gatwick's workforce lose jobs and money.  Add in towns with a strong retail economy, like Guildford, and you can see how coronavirus has wreaked economic havoc in the region. As with children, studies have shown that mental health amongst adults has worsened considerably during 2020,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external Production, data and visualisations by Ben Butcher.

"Aberdeen has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past week Three Scottish council areas are to have tougher coronavirus restrictions imposed from Friday in a bid to reverse rising numbers of cases.

It means people will no longer be allowed to travel outside of their own council area unless it is essential. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will have to stop serving alcohol and must shut at 18:00. And indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas, bingo halls and amusement arcades will also have to close. All of the country's other 29 council areas will remain in their current levels, including Edinburgh - which had beenpushing to be downgradedfrom level three to level two. Nine cases of new Covid strain found in Scotland 'Rash' Christmas Covid rules 'will cost many lives' What level of restrictions is your council in? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? It means that 80% of Scotland's population - about 4.35 million people - across 21 local authorities will be living under the level three rules when the changes come into force at 18:00 on Friday. They include the 11 areas in western and central Scotland which weredowngraded from the highest level fourcategory last week. Only four - Angus, Argyll and Bute, Falkirk and Inverclyde - remain in level two. However, Argyll and Bute is likely to move down to level one next week - and people living on the outer Argyll islands such as Islay, Mull and Iona will be able to meet in houses in groups of up to six from two households from Friday of this week. The Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are all already in level one, with no councils currently in the lowest level zero tier. All of the levels will be reviewed again next Tuesday as a precaution ahead of the festive period. Case numbers in Aberdeen have increased from 76 cases per 100,000 to 122 over the past week, and in East Lothian from 69 per 100,000 people to 116. The increase in Aberdeenshire has not been quite as sharp, but cases there are also rising. Alexander Burnett, the Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that the area had been moved to level three so close to Christmas, and called for extra financial support to be put in place by the Scottish government. He added: ""Our hospitality sector has been decimated by repeated closures and this is likely to hurt even more during what is supposed to be one of their busiest periods."" East Lothian Council said its move to level three was disappointing but understandable given the high infection rates in the area in recent weeks. Tory councillor Douglas Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said he was ""not too surprised"" by the decision to move the area up to level three, but questioned role of the hospitality sector in spreading the virus. And the Scottish Licensed Traders Association said continual uncertainty over the levels was ""hugely unfair"" on businesses which were being expected to ""switch on and off like a tap"". It added: ""It's not just a case of opening the doors - premises have to order supplies and organise staff rotas. Many have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 because of this uncertainty."" Speaking as she announced the changes, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged that the level three restrictions would cause ""real and continued difficulties for many businesses"", particularly in the hospitality sector. But she insisted that the move was essential to bring the virus under control again. Nine cases of a new strain of the virus have now been detected in Scotland after emerging in the south of England Ms Sturgeon said Angus and Falkirk would both be monitored ""very carefully"" over the next week after a rise in cases in both areas, with a move to level three not being ruled out.

Nine cases of a new strain of the virus have now been detected in Scotland after emerging in the south of England Ms Sturgeon said Angus and Falkirk would both be monitored ""very carefully"" over the next week after a rise in cases in both areas, with a move to level three not being ruled out. Cases have also ""increased quite sharply"" in East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and Fife, she said, adding: ""While the changes in these areas do not warrant a move to level four at this stage, we will be monitoring the situation very closely over the next few days."" And she said it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" to ease restrictions in Edinburgh or neighbouring Midlothian as cases were rising sharply in both. The rate in Edinburgh has increased from 70 to 100 per 100,000 over the past week, and in Midlothian from 88 to 147 per 100,000, with test positivity rates also increasing in both areas. Ms Sturgeon took part in a four-nation call with leaders from around the UK later on Tuesday, which she told MSPs she had requested after a new strain of the virus was identified in England. Nine cases of the new strain have now beenconfirmed in the Greater Glasgow and Clydehealth board area, the first minister confirmed. The talks were aimed at examining whether changes should be made to the planned relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions across the UK over Christmas, which will allow eight people from three households to mix indoors between 23 and 27 December. They broke up with no decision being reached, although further discussions have been scheduled for Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further, in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting."" New Covid strain: How worried should we be? The first minister said she would prefer to come to an agreed position across the UK, but said the Scottish government would ""consider what we think is appropriate"" if this was not possible. The planned relaxation of the rules at Christmas has been described as a""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives""by the both the Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the rising number of cases across many parts of Scotland ahead of the festive break showed that the journals were right. He added: ""It is rather concerning that the first minister was unable to tell parliament what position she would be advocating on behalf of Scotland in intergovernmental discussions planned for this afternoon."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the Christmas plans. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Life has changed dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There has been an enormous human and financial cost - and its impact has also been felt in many other ways. Four of our correspondents look at the impact of the pandemic in numbers - from cancelled operations to school days lost and a rises in benefit claimants. The most obvious wayto measure the impact of coronavirusis to see how many people have died - and look at how much that figure is above the usual annual total. Between March and the end of November, there were more than 79,000 excess deaths above the five-year average, which were almost exclusively driven by Covid. Not every death linked to Covid is a death that was directly caused by it. But Office for National Statistics analysis shows close to nine in 10 cases in England and Wales have been. And deaths among younger age groups have been relatively rare - the majority of people who have died have been among older age groups. The average age of death is over 80. How deadly is the coronavirus? Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? Neither have deaths been evenly distributed across the country. London saw a surge in cases first, followed by the north of England, with leaders there suggesting that the first lockdown was lifted too early for them. Now, there are signs the south of England's second wave is growing as the North's recedes. But slice this data up even further and distinct patterns emerge.People from poorer backgrounds,externaland thosefrom ethnic minorities are both,externalat a significantly higher risk of death. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Deprived areas hit twice as hard by coronavirus Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? There are several complex factors at play, with people from these communities more likely to: Work in jobs where they see the public Live in densely-populated housing Have poorer health, with conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and respiratory problems all more common Covid hasalso disrupted other NHS services,with warnings about people not getting treatment or diagnosis for other conditions. Routine work, including knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the spring, leading to a growing backlog and more people facing long waits. Cancer services were severely disrupted and activity levels have only recently returned to normal.Macmillan Cancer Support estimates,externalthere may be as many as 50,000 missing diagnoses. And visits to A&E have also fallen by a third since March, compared with the same time last year. Doctors say people were worried about the Covid risk and felt they should not bother the health service. But among those not coming forward were people with the symptoms of heart attacks and minor strokes. A year ago, nobody would have thought police would be telling people sunbathing it is against the law, or that ""mingling"" could be punished with an immediate fine of Â£200. But one of Covid's greatest costs has been the unprecedented restrictions on civil liberties in peacetime. Across the four nations, in the rush to enforce lockdowns and other restrictions, more than 20 pieces of law have come into force that have criminalised otherwise normal behaviour. Most of them were not even debated or voted on by elected politicians. The 27,000 fines, mostly for gatherings, are not evenly spread geographically. Leicester has been under the longest-standing restrictions - yet it has a far lower rate of fines than north-west England which has faced similar challenges. Some of that is down to local policing decisions - not least because many officers are very wary of the long-term impact on community relations if they continually dish out fines. The backlog in the courts is enormous. So much so that there are people now waiting for trial in England, for alleged offences committed in 2018, who may not face a jury until 2022. When the pandemic hit, jury trials were stopped because the courts could not guarantee safe distancing to prevent the risk of the virus spreading. Crest, a crime and justice consultancy,estimates that unless capacity doubles,the backlog of crown court cases, the most serious ones, will be near 200,000 by 2024. The Lord Chief Justice hopesto have 300 crown courts sitting by the new year,external- but that will still be less than the maximum possible. But these enormous delays to justice - affecting defendants, victims and witnesses - are not just down to Covid. England and Wales already had an enormous case backlog because the government had cut the number of days judges could sit. The Ministry of Justice says it is funding 40 additional court rooms - dubbed Nightingale Courts - to help tackle the impact of Covid to family, civil and criminal cases. Schools act as a place of safety and routine for children, providing a structure and certainty to their lives. That has been turned upside down in 2020, with schooling closed then repeatedly interrupted by self-isolation in the autumn term. The headline national figures for secondary attendance have declined, but they don't capture the huge geographical variations in England. In mid-October it fell to 61% in Knowsley on Merseyside, and in early December in Kent's Medway towns, only 42% of pupils were learning in the classroom at one point. The loss of learning and confidence is hard to capture, but will ripple through the education system for many years. Good mental health is vital for children and young people to flourish, butNHS research suggests that during the pandemic,externalit has worsened in England. Both boys and girls were affected, suggesting the uncertainty, loneliness and disruption of this year have taken their toll. The pressure on families worried about their finances, forced to spend time together in lockdown appear to be a factor. Teenage girls reporting mental health difficulties are more likely to have seen an argument at home. More thanhalf a million additional households,externalwith children are claiming universal credit than at the pandemic's start, which is a marker of increased child poverty risks. Schools are reporting a big increase in parents seeking free school meals for their children, although official statistics will not be available until next year. Food poverty and the corrosive impact on children's lives has galvanised schools to organise food banks and grocery deliveries for families in their communities. The shame and stigma around children's hunger has been softened by the high-profile campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford. The concern led to government support in the form of extending holiday free school meals, extra payments to families living in poverty, or money to local authorities. Who will get free school meals? How many children need free meals? Thewelfare system has seen unprecedented demands,externalthis year, and 5.7 million people are now receiving the main benefit, universal credit. This figure has almost doubled since March. It has coped admirably with the surge in claimants, including handling 1.5 million applications over a four-week period to 9 April. What is universal credit and what else can I claim? Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? It hasn't just processed those claims, it has also increased the speed and accuracy of payments to claimants, and there is understandable pride within the Department for Work and Pensions at what they've achieved. In total, around 6.3% of people in the UK are claiming unemployment welfare, with fears that this will increase moving forward. The largest proportion of people on unemployment benefits remain in areas like the north of England, south Wales and central Scotland. But the pandemic has forced people elsewhere who had never previously needed benefits, to turn to the welfare state. The largest increase in claimants has been in the south of England, which is partly explained by so few claiming unemployment welfare before, making any increases particularly noticeable. When large-scale working from home started. the cleaners, coffee shops, tailors, and dry cleaners used by London's office workers had no work and needed help, through welfare or the furlough scheme. The collapse of the aviation sector saw Gatwick's workforce lose jobs and money.  Add in towns with a strong retail economy, like Guildford, and you can see how coronavirus has wreaked economic havoc in the region. As with children, studies have shown that mental health amongst adults has worsened considerably during 2020,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external Production, data and visualisations by Ben Butcher.

"A court sketch of Ghislaine Maxwell appearing at her arraignment hearing in July Ghislaine Maxwell has asked a US judge to release her under a proposed $28.5m (Â£21.4m) bail package as she awaits trial on sex crime charges. The British socialite is accused of helping the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein groom young girls. A court filing released on Monday said Ms Maxwell ""vehemently maintains her innocence"" and asked to be freed from jail until her trial. She wants instead to be confined to her home and protected by armed guards. Judge Alison Nathan could rule on this latest bail request in New York by the end of the year. Ms Maxwell's previous request for bailwhen she was arrested in July was denied. Ms Maxwell was in a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s. The financier died in a prison cell in August last year as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, more than a decade after he was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Four of the charges against Ms Maxwell relate to the years between 1994 and 1997, when prosecutors say she helped Epstein groom girls as young as 14. The other two charges are allegations of perjury in 2016. She faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted in her trial, which is scheduled to begin next July. This video can not be played New York attorney: Ghislaine Maxwell ""helped exploit girls as young as 14-years-old"" The court filing released on Monday said that Ms Maxwell's husband would post a bond to support her bail application. Financial documents within the filing said they had been married since 2016, but do not name her partner. Her lawyers said the multi-million dollar bail proposal represents all of their joint assets, including three homes. ""Ms Maxwell wants to stay in New York and have her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family,"" the filing reportedly said, adding that the 58-year-old was ""not the person the media has portrayed her to be"". Officials denied her initial request for bail when she was first arrested in July. At the time the court deemed she was a flight risk, despite her defence team denying this and alleging that she was at ""serious risk"" of contracting Covid-19 during her detention. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York in 2005 She was quarantined at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn last month after a staff member tested positive for the virus. Prison officials say she is treated like other inmates and that she remains in good health, despite her defence team saying she has suffered hair and weight loss. The daughter of a late British media mogul, Ms Maxwell was in a relationship with Epstein. She allegedly introduced him to wealthy and powerful figures.

"Greenwich Council has asked all schools to move to online learning amid rising Covid cases The leader of Greenwich Council has said he has ""no choice"" but to ask schools to remain open after threats of legal action from the government. The authoritywrote to head teachersasking for classes to move online from Tuesday amid rising Covid-19 cases. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered the council to keep all schools open until the end of term. Council leader Danny Thorpe said he could not justify using public funds to fight the decision in the courts. In a statement, the Labour councillor said he did not agree that it was right to keep schools open but he had ""no choice but to ask our schools to keep their doors open to all students, rather than just continuing with online learning"". Covid: Will schools close early for Christmas? Will there be mass testing at your child's school? New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Parents told the BBC it was an odd and confusing time for schools and families in the borough. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into England's highest tier of Covid restrictions on Wednesday due to a rise in infections. Schools in England were told theycould close a day earlyfor Christmas last week to give staff a ""proper break"" from identifying potential coronavirus cases. In Basildon, where the third-highest Covid rate was recorded, schoolswere also allowed to close early, while London's mayor Sadiq Khan has called on secondary schools and colleges in the capital to follow suit. Imagine how baffling it's been for parents in Greenwich and other London boroughs caught up in this end-of-term playground power struggle - which has become a microcosm of the uncertainty about whether children should be in school this week. On Sunday night Greenwich council told parents schools were moving online - and then on Monday, the Department for Education issued legal threats saying they would have to stay open. And now on Tuesday, the council has backed down and says schools will have to stay open for Wednesday and Thursday. It's added confusion to an already worrying time. Although parents will still be wondering what to believe when they're also being told to stay apart because of London's surge in Covid cases. It might appear an unnecessary tussle about a couple of days in school. But it's been about who is in control and the government's determination not to see its biggest red line crumbling away - and that's keeping schools open. Leaders at two other Labour-run local authorities - Waltham Forest and Islington - have also advised schools to move to online learning for the last few days of term amid rising Covid-19 rates in the capital. Both councils told BBC London they were sticking by their decisions. Schools Minister Nick Gibb has written to Islington and Waltham Forest asking them to reconsider. The BBC understands no legal action has been taken against the local authorities. Mr Thorpe said on Friday there were 3,670 children self-isolating and 314 teaching staff, then on Monday an additional 580 children had to self-isolate. This ""exponential growth"" in Covid-19 cases was the basis of his decision to ask schools to move to online teaching, he said. ""We are in a situation where the virus has been spreading quicker in Greenwich than it has done in other parts of London,"" he said. ""We had to make this call based on the data available to us. I find it regrettable the Secretary of State has pursued a legal route, as fundamentally my decision has been based solely on what is based for families here in Greenwich and not a courtroom battle. ""It shows the government think you can manage the pandemic response entirely from Whitehall and what we are saying is that we have different parts of London and different parts of the country that are experiencing difficult challenges."" Mr Thorpe said he made the decision ""in the best interests of the people of Greenwich"" but recognised the disruption that had been caused. One mother, who has two children at Halstow Primary School in Greenwich, said: ""I really, really feel for schools because they've all worked so hard since September to have schools open to maintain education and that normality for kids. ""I don't know what the school is going to do now, whether they're going to say pupils need to go in or leave it for parents to make the decision. It's another day of poor schools making lots of decisions rather than focusing on our kids."" A father, whose children attend a different school in the borough, added: ""It seems so odd that remote learning suddenly is no longer acceptable. ""I understand that some families will really struggle if parents cannot work from home. In Greenwich, we have never had numbers as bad as they are right now - I don't understand why relatively low impact options, such as online learning, are being taken off the table by the government."" Head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman described it as a ""really difficult situation"" in which people were ""weighing up short-term concerns about health risks and long-term concerns about children's education"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's so easy to call for closures and forget the long-term price which children pay which our visits show so clearly. ""We've had children yo-yoing in and out of school through the autumn and really suffering as a result. We need clarity, consistency, not last minute decisions."" The Association of School and College Leaders said the government ""may find it has won a hollow victory in its squabble with Greenwich council"" Mr Thorpe added that the Department of Health & Social Care had agreed that any resident could access a Covid-19 test, whether they were showing symptoms or not. ""This is a real step change from the current position and one that will benefit all of us locally,"" he added. A head teacher's union has said many parents could still keep their children at home this week despite the government's stance. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""The government may find it has won a hollow victory in its squabble with Greenwich council over end-of-term arrangements. ""It has compelled direct classroom teaching for the last few days of term, but we would not be surprised if many parents simply keep their children at home given the evident concern over Covid infection rates. ""It has been an unseemly end to a gruelling and exhausting term when schools at the very least deserved some flexibility over their end-of-term arrangements in the best interests of their pupils and staff, but instead have been met with legal threats from the government.""

"Moderna's vaccine is safe and 94% effective, regulators say, clearing the way for US emergency authorisation. The analysis by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) means it could become the second coronavirus vaccine to be allowed in the US. It comes one day after Americans across the country began receiving jabs of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The news comes as the US coronavirus death toll passes 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Endorsement of the Moderna vaccine by FDA scientists was announced on Tuesday, two days before the vaccine panel meets to discuss emergency approval. The54-page document said,externalthere were ""no specific safety concerns"" and that serious adverse reactions were rare. If approved by the team of experts later this week, and by the FDA's vaccine chief, shipments could begin within 24 hours. The FDA found a 94.1% efficacy rate out of a trial of 30,000 people, according to the document they released. Covid: When can I get vaccinated in the US? What you need to know about vaccine safety The most common side effects included fever, headaches, and muscle and joint pain. Last week,the FDA released similar data from Pfizerbefore voting to issue approval. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered Moderna was founded in 2010 and so far has never had a product approved by the FDA. The company's stocks have seen a nearly 700% increase so far this year. The Moderna vaccine requires temperatures of around -20C for shipping - similar to a regular freezer. The Pfizer jab requires temperatures closer to -75C, making transport logistics much more difficult. How will we keep the vaccine cold enough? Like the Pfizer jab, the Moderna vaccine also requires a second booster shot. Moderna's second jab comes 28 days after the first. The company is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has said that if approved, the ""vast majority"" of its vaccine would be manufactured there. Pfizer's drug is being manufactured in several countries, including Germany and Belgium. Approval of a second Covid vaccine in the US would be a big deal. The country is the worst-hit in the world according to the recorded death toll from the pandemic virus and urgently needs more ammunition to fight the virus. The US has several million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine that was authorised for emergency use a few days ago by regulators. Although mass vaccination has begun with these, getting access to the Moderna jab in the near future, in addition to more stock of the Pfizer one, would mean many millions more people could be inoculated in the coming months. The Food and Drug Administration is yet to give the green light for the Moderna vaccine, but if it does, the US could start to receive some of the 200m doses it has pre-ordered. The first lot of 20m could be delivered by the end of December. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March - part of a total 56m doses. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab. The European Union last month announced a contract to purchase of 80m doses - with up to 80m more - once the vaccine is deemed safe and effective. Japan has signed up for 50m Moderna doses, South Korea for 20m, and Switzerland has ordered 7.5m, according to data compiled bythe Duke University Global Health Innovation Center,external.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Jack Grealish driving offences England footballer Jack Grealish has been banned from driving and fined more than Â£80,000 for two motoring offences. The Aston Villa captain, 25,previously admitted two counts of careless drivingat Birmingham Magistrates' Court. The offences relate to a crash in Dickens Heath, near Solihull, on 29 March, and a second incident near Villa's training ground on 18 October. Prior to the convictions, Grealish already had six points on his licence for a speeding offence in 2018. He has been banned from driving for nine months. Grealish arrived at court on foot while another man driving his car temporarily distracted the media's attention before emerging to hand out Cadbury's Milk Tray chocolate. Jack Grealish arrives at court During a hearing last month, which the midfielder did not attend, the court was told he was spotted in October driving carelessly on Bodymoor Heath Road in north Warwickshire, and tailgating other vehicles on the M42. On the same day he was also clocked driving his Range Rover at 98 mph by police observing him in an unmarked vehicle.

"Takahiro Shiraishi after his arrest in 2017 A man who murdered nine people after contacting them on Twitter has been sentenced to death, in a high-profile case that has shocked Japan. Takahiro Shiraishi, dubbed the ""Twitter killer"", was arrested in 2017 after body parts were found in his flat. The 30-year-old had admitted to murdering and dismembering his victims - almost all of whom were young women he met on the social media platform. The serial killings triggered debate over how suicide is discussed online. More than 400 people turned up to watch the verdict on Tuesday, despite the court only having 16 seats available for the public, reported local media. Public support for the death penalty remains high in Japan, one of the few developed nations to retain capital punishment. Shiraishi used Twitter to lure suicidal women to his home, saying he could help them die and, in some cases, claimed he would kill himself alongside them. He strangled and dismembered eight women and one man aged 15 to 26 between August and October 2017, said Japan's Kyodo news agency, citing the indictment. Japan to act on suicide websites Why does Japan have such a high suicide rate? How many countries still have the death penalty? The serial killings first came to light on Halloween that year when police found dismembered body parts in Shiraishi's flat in the Japanese city of Zama, near Tokyo, while they were searching for a missing 23-year-old woman, who turned out to be one of the victims. After she had gone missing, her brother accessed her Twitter account and alerted police to a suspicious handle, leading them to Shiraishi's residence on the morning of 31 October in 2017. Japanese media called it the ""house of horrors"" after investigators discovered nine heads along with a large number of arm and leg bones stashed in coolers and tool boxes. While prosecutors sought the death penalty for Shiraishi, his lawyers argued he was guilty of the lesser charge of ""murder with consent"", claiming his victims had given their permission to be killed. Many victims came from the Tokyo area Shiraishi later disputed his own defence team's version of events, and said he killed without their consent. On Tuesday, Judge Naokuni Yano, who delivered the verdict, called the crimes ""cunning and cruel"", and found the defendant ""fully responsible"" for his actions. ""None of the nine victims consented to be killed, including silent consent,"" public broadcaster NHK quoted the judge as saying. ""It is extremely grave that the lives of nine young people were taken away. The dignity of the victims was trampled upon."" Shiraishi told the court last month that he did not plan to appeal against his sentence if found guilty. It was not immediately clear if that remained his plan. The death penalty is carried out by hanging in Japan, which has more than 100 prisoners on death row. Death row inmates are not told when they will be put to death until the day of their execution. Years usually pass between sentencing and an execution being carried out. The names of those Shiraishi murdered were withheld to protect their privacy. The father of one victim, aged 25, told the court last month that he would ""never forgive Shiraishi even if he dies"", according to Japanese broadcaster NHK ""Even now, when I see a woman of my daughter's age, I mistake her for my daughter. This pain will never go away. Give her back to me,"" he had said. On Tuesday, the father of another victim, who was 17, told NHK the death sentence was ""appropriate"". ""I feel like I want to get revenge, but bereaved families can't do anything. I don't know how to vent my anger,"" he said. The brother of a 25-year-old victim said his ""heart died"" when he heard Shiraishi's testimony. ""It didn't sound at all like he regretted it... It felt like I was being hurt with a sharp knife over and over again."" The man Shiraishi killed was a male friend of one of his female victims,external, who was seeking her whereabouts. The killings stunned Japan, triggering fresh debate about suicide and how to help those considering it, as well as about websites where suicide is discussed. The government has indicated it may introduce new regulations. Summing up, the judge said the case had ""provoked great anxiety in society, because social networks are so commonly used"". The murders also prompted a change by Twitter, which amended its rules to state users should not ""promote or encourage suicide or self-harm"". Twitter's chief executiveJack Dorsey called the case ""extremely sad"". Japan has long battled one of the highest suicide rates in the industrialised world. Figures have dropped since preventative measures were introduced more than a decade ago but there have been signs that rates have been rising again during the coronavirus pandemic.

"This video can not be played Joe Biden, speaking earlier in December after his election victory was confirmed Joe Biden has said it is ""time to turn the page"" after his presidential election victory was confirmed by the US electoral college. In a speech after the announcement, he said US democracy had been ""pushed, tested and threatened"" and ""proved to be resilient, true and strong"". He condemned President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the result. Later Russian President Vladimir Putin became one of the last world leaders to congratulate Mr Biden on his victory. Moscow had said it would wait for the official results before doing so. Most other national leaders contacted Mr Biden days after the vote on 3 November. Confirmation by the electoral college was one of the steps required for Mr Biden to take office. Under the US system, voters actually cast their ballots for ""electors"", who in turn formally vote for candidates after the election. Democrat Joe Biden won November's contest with 306 electoral college votes to Republican Donald Trump's 232. The people who ultimately pick the US president Can Trump still challenge the result? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? President Trump, who shows few signs of conceding, has not commented. Shortly after the electoral college's vote,he announced on Twitter the departure of Attorney General William Barr,who had said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election, despite the president's claims. Speaking in Delaware, Mr Biden praised ""ordinary men and women"" who had refused to be bullied, referring to the president's efforts to question and overturn the results, involving legal challenges which have been rejected by courts across the country. He described the efforts as ""a position so extreme we've never seen it before"". ""Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even when we find those results hard to accept,"" he said. ""The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago,"" he added. ""And we know that nothing not even a pandemic or an abuse of power can extinguish that flame."" Mr Biden said it was time to ""turn the page, as we've done throughout our history, to unite, to heal"". But he warned that, with the coronavirus pandemic continuing to ravage the US, there would be difficult months ahead. ""There is urgent work in front of us,"" he said. ""Getting this pandemic under control and getting the nation vaccinated against this virus."" He stressed the importance of immediate economic help that was ""so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today"" and rebuilding the economy to be ""better than it ever was"". He was speaking as the Covid death toll in the US - the country worst affected by the virus - rose above 300,000. Normally the electors do not get that much attention but this year, after uncertainty generated by a raft of challenges to results in Democrat-won states by the Trump campaign, the state-by-state vote was in the spotlight. Solidly Democrat California, with its 55 electors, was one of the last states to voteon Monday and took Mr Biden across the 270-vote threshold required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Electoral college affirms Joe Biden as president-elect Heightened security had been put in place in some states, including Michigan and Georgia, ahead of voting, which took place in state capitals and Washington DC. In Michigan - a key swing state Mr Biden won - legislative offices in the state capital Lansing were closed due to ""credible"" threats of violence. The vote at the capitol building went ahead peacefully although a group of Republicans tried to enter the building to hold their own vote and were turned away. This video can not be played The president of the United States is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college In his speech, Mr Biden described the harassment of officials following the election as ""unconscionable"" and said: ""It's my sincere hope we never again see anyone subjected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this election."" He also noted that he had the same number of electoral college votes that Mr Trump said was a ""landslide"" when he won in 2016. Mr Biden emphasised that he had also won the popular vote, something Mr Trump failed to clinch four years ago. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander said: ""The presidential election is over.,externalStates have certified the votes. Courts have resolved disputes. The electors have voted. I hope that President Trump will put the country first, take pride in his considerable accomplishments, and help president-elect Biden get off to a good start."" This video can not be played Can you explain the electoral college in 10 seconds? The quadrennial meeting of the US electoral college is usually a formality along the way to a presidential inauguration - a vestigial political event that long ago lost its power and relevance. Donald Trump's scorched-earth strategy of contesting the results of the 2020 election, however, gave the proceedings new attention. His legal team has had little success in challenging the results in multiple battleground states and the official recording of the electoral college ballots effectively lowered the curtain on these long-shot judicial manoeuvres. That does not mean the Trump team is giving up, of course. They will continue with futile court challenges and, eventually, ask Congress to overturn the election results. It is an alternative reality that Donald Trump's supporters may find more comforting than the one where Joe Biden is president-elect. Given that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, the official electoral college tally has been duly certified by the states and federal law is on Mr Biden's side, Mr Trump's chances of success in the real world, however, sit squarely at zero. The results of the voting process will be sent to Washington DC and formally counted in a joint session of Congress on 6 January presided over by Vice-President Mike Pence. That will pave the way for Joe Biden to be sworn in as president on 20 January. Last month, President Trump said he would leave office in January if Mr Biden were affirmed as the election winner by the electoral college. Nevertheless, he has continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Most Republicans have stood behind Mr Trump in his efforts to overturn the result, but some have broken ranks in recent weeks. One Michigan congressman, Paul Mitchell, announced he was leaving the party weeks before his retirement in protest over what he said was its failure to accept that the election process was over.

"I have one simple rule for making sense of ""new variant"" or ""new strain"" coronavirus stories. Ask: ""Has the virus's behaviour changed?"" A mutated virus sounds instinctively scary, but to mutate and change is what viruses do. Most of the time it is either a meaningless tweak or the virus alters itself in such a way that it gets worse at infecting us and the new variant just dies out. Occasionally it hits on a new winning formula. There is no clear-cut evidence the new variant of coronavirus -which has been detected in south-east England- is able to transmit more easily, cause more serious symptoms or render the vaccine useless. However, there are two reasons scientists are keeping a close eye on it. 'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine story The first is that levels of the variant are higher in places where cases are higher. It is a warning sign, although it can be interpreted in two ways. The virus could have mutated to spread more easily and is causing more infections. But variants can also get a lucky break by infecting the right people at the right time. One explanation for the spread of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was simply people catching it on holiday and then bringing it home. It will take experiments in the laboratory to figure out if this variant really is a better spreader than all the others. The other issue that is raising scientific eyebrows is how the virus has mutated. ""It has a surprisingly large number of mutations, more than we would expect, and a few look interesting,"" Prof Nick Loman from the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium told me. There are two notable sets of mutation - and I apologise for their hideous names. Both are found in the crucial spike protein, which is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells in order to hijack them. The mutation N501 (I did warn you) alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. Mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunised The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. The concern was that antibodies from the blood of survivors was less effective at attacking that variant of virus. Again, it is going to take more laboratory studies to really understand what is going on. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""We know there's a variant, we know nothing about what that means biologically. ""It is far too early to make any inference on how important this may or may not be."" Mutations to the spike protein lead to questions about the vaccine because the three leading jabs - Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford - all train the immune system to attack the spike. However, the body learns to attack multiple parts of the spike. That is why health officials remain convinced the vaccine will work against this variant. This is a virus that evolved in animals and made the jump to infecting people around a year ago. Since then it has been picking up around two mutations a month - take a sample today and compare it to the first ones from Wuhan in China and there would be around 25 mutations separating them. Coronavirus is still trying out different combinations of mutations to properly nail infecting humans. We have seen this happen before: The emergence and global dominance of another variant (G614) isseen by many as the virus getting better at spreading,external. But soon mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunized. If this does drive the evolution of the virus, we may have to regularly update the vaccines, as we do for flu, to keep up.

"Rosalyn applied for universal credit for the first time in April ""I had this feeling of guilt, thinking about people out there that might need it more than me... I felt as though I didn't deserve to be claiming benefits at this age,"" says 23-year old Rosalyn. She had been working as a freelance actor, doing shifts front-of-house in a theatre and also working for an events company to make ends meet. But when lockdown hit, shifts dried up. ""I started using my savings to pay my rent, my bills... everything I'd managed to build up over a couple of years was completely gone in two months."" She wasn't eligible to be furloughed at any of the part-time jobs. In late April, she applied for universal credit for the first time. Rosalyn is now one of the 344,000 young women who are claiming unemployment benefits. According to BBC analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics, that number more than doubled between March and November - with the second biggest percentage rise among any age group. Men aged 30-39 saw the largest increase at 117%. Although there has been a widespread increase in the number of people claiming universal credit or jobseeker's allowance since the start of the pandemic, women under 30 have been particularly hard-hit. Universal credit, the benefit for people out of work or on a low income, has replaced six others, merging them into one payment. It has proved controversial because it can be difficult to work out what you will receive and it usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving your first payment. Rosalyn, for example, received her first payment after nine weeks, due to problems verifying her identity. After accounting for rent and bills for her London flat-share, she has about Â£100 left each month. ""I usually get the bus to a cheaper supermarket, and try to make sure my food shop per week is Â£15 or less. ""Right now, it's enough to pay my rent and bills, but it's not really enough to live,"" she says. ""It's been tough."" One study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies,externalalso found that young women are disproportionately likely to work in pubs and restaurants, retail and the arts, which have been worst affected by coronavirus lockdowns. ""If I was allowed to work, this is my busiest time of year where I do actually make good money because of the hours that you have to put in,"" says 23-year-old Beth. She quit her university studies in business earlier this year after teaching moved online, and decided to take on more hours at her part-time hospitality job in Newcastle instead. She considered the job ""one of the safest out there"". But as pubs, bars and restaurants shut under England's second national lockdown, Beth was placed on furlough for the second time in 2020. Beth submitted a claim for universal credit after being furloughed for the second time ""I knew how much money I'd been earning from last lockdown, and I realised I was in a bit of trouble."" She moved back into the family home to save on expenses and submitted a universal credit claim in October. Two-thirds of young women claiming benefits this year did so for the very first time, according torecent polling of 4,000 under-30s by the Young Women's Trust charity.,external Beth describes the application process as ""a bit confusing, because it's something that I've never really had to do"". As the local JobCentre at the end of her road was closed, she wasn't sure who to turn to for help. Check if you're eligible: You're not likely to be eligible if your household has more than Â£16,000 in savings, if you're under 18 or in full-time education, but there are some exceptions. It can also affect other benefit payments. Apply as soon as possible: You have to wait five weeks from the date you apply for your first payment. If you will struggle during this time, you can apply for an advance loan to help. Get your documents ready: You'll need information on your income, savings, housing situation - like your tenancy agreement - and any childcare costs. You'll also need to submit your bank account details. Set aside some time: Most people apply for universal credit online, but you can apply by telephone. A typical claim can take 40 minutes to an hour. Be aware of your claimant commitment: There are sometimes job-seeking requirements for people on Universal Credit, but it depends on your circumstances. Tasks could include writing a CV or setting up job alerts. Source: Citizens Advice Citizens Advice told the BBC it had given more than 31,000 young women advice on universal credit since 23 March. ""Some seven in 10 seeking our support on benefits had never come to us before, showing the scale of this crisis,"" said the charity's interim chief executive, Alistair Cromwell. ""That includes thousands of young people, many of whom saw their jobs in retail and hospitality vanish practically overnight, but still had to make the rent and pay their bills."" Danielle Owen navigated the system with a bit more ease, thanks to her experience in HR. The 27-year-old from Swindon was furloughed from her recruitment job at an international company, and was eventually made redundant in July. Danielle applied for more than 300 jobs, having been made redundant in July ""I didn't have a huge amount of savings behind me. Given the current situation, I decided that it was probably best to look into it straight away."" She receives Â£408 per month in universal credit, which leaves her with Â£7 spare after paying her mortgage. She is paying for bills and food using her redundancy pay-out, until she starts in a new role next year - after more than 300 job applications. But Danielle questioned whether she should put in a claim, although the pandemic gave her little choice: ""There is definitely a stigma around claiming benefits. ""I've always worked and the only time I hadn't, I was in education - basically to get the job that I had. ""I was so proud of the career I had built up, and I just had to let that pride go,"" she says. Recent research from poverty charity Turn2Us foundthat the stigma around claiming benefits has become more pronounced. One in four people surveyed in April said they believed claimants should be ashamed, up from one in 10 of those asked in 2012. ""I've had a lot of friends make comments, telling me that at my age I should be working,"" says Beth. ""But I never thought I would be in the position where I had to claim benefits. It was the stereotype growing up, and I always wanted to achieve something."" What is universal credit - and what other benefits are available? 'I didn't want to tell anyone I was claiming benefits' With unemployment set to rise further, growing numbers of young women who are accessing benefits for the first time are likely to continue to feel worried for the future. ""We know people have been impacted in different ways during this pandemic and our 'Plan for Jobs' offers a wide range of support that can be individually tailored,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said. They also pointed towards the Kickstart scheme, which offers work placements to 16-24 year olds on universal credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. But for those in immediate need, Rosalyn urges them to put aside negative thoughts and comments. ""There comes a point when you have to put yourself first, which is something that women don't always do. ""Put yourself, your shelter and your food first.""

Beth submitted a claim for universal credit after being furloughed for the second time ""I knew how much money I'd been earning from last lockdown, and I realised I was in a bit of trouble."" She moved back into the family home to save on expenses and submitted a universal credit claim in October. Two-thirds of young women claiming benefits this year did so for the very first time, according torecent polling of 4,000 under-30s by the Young Women's Trust charity.,external Beth describes the application process as ""a bit confusing, because it's something that I've never really had to do"". As the local JobCentre at the end of her road was closed, she wasn't sure who to turn to for help. Check if you're eligible: You're not likely to be eligible if your household has more than Â£16,000 in savings, if you're under 18 or in full-time education, but there are some exceptions. It can also affect other benefit payments. Apply as soon as possible: You have to wait five weeks from the date you apply for your first payment. If you will struggle during this time, you can apply for an advance loan to help. Get your documents ready: You'll need information on your income, savings, housing situation - like your tenancy agreement - and any childcare costs. You'll also need to submit your bank account details. Set aside some time: Most people apply for universal credit online, but you can apply by telephone. A typical claim can take 40 minutes to an hour. Be aware of your claimant commitment: There are sometimes job-seeking requirements for people on Universal Credit, but it depends on your circumstances. Tasks could include writing a CV or setting up job alerts. Source: Citizens Advice Citizens Advice told the BBC it had given more than 31,000 young women advice on universal credit since 23 March. ""Some seven in 10 seeking our support on benefits had never come to us before, showing the scale of this crisis,"" said the charity's interim chief executive, Alistair Cromwell. ""That includes thousands of young people, many of whom saw their jobs in retail and hospitality vanish practically overnight, but still had to make the rent and pay their bills."" Danielle Owen navigated the system with a bit more ease, thanks to her experience in HR. The 27-year-old from Swindon was furloughed from her recruitment job at an international company, and was eventually made redundant in July. Danielle applied for more than 300 jobs, having been made redundant in July ""I didn't have a huge amount of savings behind me. Given the current situation, I decided that it was probably best to look into it straight away."" She receives Â£408 per month in universal credit, which leaves her with Â£7 spare after paying her mortgage. She is paying for bills and food using her redundancy pay-out, until she starts in a new role next year - after more than 300 job applications. But Danielle questioned whether she should put in a claim, although the pandemic gave her little choice: ""There is definitely a stigma around claiming benefits. ""I've always worked and the only time I hadn't, I was in education - basically to get the job that I had. ""I was so proud of the career I had built up, and I just had to let that pride go,"" she says. Recent research from poverty charity Turn2Us foundthat the stigma around claiming benefits has become more pronounced. One in four people surveyed in April said they believed claimants should be ashamed, up from one in 10 of those asked in 2012. ""I've had a lot of friends make comments, telling me that at my age I should be working,"" says Beth. ""But I never thought I would be in the position where I had to claim benefits. It was the stereotype growing up, and I always wanted to achieve something."" What is universal credit - and what other benefits are available? 'I didn't want to tell anyone I was claiming benefits' With unemployment set to rise further, growing numbers of young women who are accessing benefits for the first time are likely to continue to feel worried for the future. ""We know people have been impacted in different ways during this pandemic and our 'Plan for Jobs' offers a wide range of support that can be individually tailored,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said. They also pointed towards the Kickstart scheme, which offers work placements to 16-24 year olds on universal credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. But for those in immediate need, Rosalyn urges them to put aside negative thoughts and comments. ""There comes a point when you have to put yourself first, which is something that women don't always do. ""Put yourself, your shelter and your food first.""

"More than 1,200 people in Scotland died of drug misuse last year, new figures show. The much-delayed figures show a record number of deaths for the sixth year in a row and the highest total since records began in 1996. The figure of 1,264 is a 6% increase on 2018 and more than double the number of deaths in 2014. It is the worst rate recorded in Europe and about three and a half times the rate for England and Wales. TheNational Records of Scotland,externalstatistics are six months late after a huge backlog in processing toxicology results and delays due to Covid-19. They show that two-thirds of those who died were aged 35 to 54. Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts Five ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis The report said the median average age of drug-related deaths had gone up from 28 to 42 over the past two decades. However, there was also an increase in deaths among 15 to 24 year olds - from 64 in 2018 to 76 in 2019. Three-quarters of the deaths occurred in five health board areas. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had 404 deaths, Lanarkshire 163, Lothian 155, Tayside 118 and Ayrshire and Arran 108. Here we are again. For the sixth year running, Scotland has seen a record total of drug deaths. We are once again the worst in Europe. It shouldn't come as a surprise. While the UK and Scottish governments organised competing summits to showcase their vision of how to tackle the problem, frontline workers warned that the death rate was accelerating. This year, the mountain of toxicology reports into drug deaths needed Â£300,000 of extra funding to be cleared and, still, the figures were five months late. Much of the focus of this issue has been on the Misuse of Drugs Act, which is reserved to Westminster. The Scottish government argues that it needs more control over the law to trial initiatives such as safer injecting facilities; the UK government argues the opposite, and that instead there needs to be more investment in rehab beds. Those in the sector say these arguments only serve to simplify an issue that is so intractable, so huge. Already identified as issues to tackle are punitive regimes that saw users kicked off methadone prescriptions for missing appointments. Those hoping for methadone were, in some cases, waiting up to five weeks for a prescription. While the death toll climbed, funding to frontline services was cut by the Scottish government. In 2016, treatment was only reaching 40% of those who needed it. The drug-taking trends are also shifting under our feet - as older heroin users die, a younger generation have taken to injecting cocaine, supercharging an HIV epidemic in Scotland's largest city. Meanwhile, so-called street Valium - or etizolam - has a grip on the drug-using population. Scotland's Drug Death Task Force is trying to turn the tide. They have encouraged same-day prescribing and the expansion medical assisted treatment, along with programmes to distributed the life-saving drug Naloxone. Even with these efforts though, this problem will take years to stabilise. Scotland's ""polydrug"" habit - mixing dangerous street drugs with alcohol and prescription pills - caused many of the deaths. The report said 94% of all drug-related deaths were of people who took more than one substance. Heroin and morphine were implicated in more deaths than in any previous year - more than half of the total. ""Street"" benzodiazepines (such as etizolam) were named in almost two-thirds of deaths, more than in any previous year. There was also a big rise in cocaine being reported as taken by people who died (365) as well as gabapentin and pregabalin, which are used to treat nerve pain. In September, a report from theEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,externalsaid Scotland had the highest recorded drug death rate in Europe, far ahead of Sweden in second place. It highlighted the problem of benzos, saying: ""In Scotland, criminal groups are known to be involved in the large-scale illicit manufacture and distribution of fake benzodiazepine medicines."" The fake Valium - that sells for as little as 50p - is many times stronger than prescription drugs. The new breed of benzodiazepines are often taken alongside other drugs such as heroin. Scottish Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said the Scottish government was doing ""everything in its powers to tackle rising drug deaths"". Mr FitzPatrick said the Drug Deaths Taskforce, which was established after a public health emergency was declared last year, was continuing its ""urgent work"" and there was a new sub-group looking at the issue of benzodiazepines. He said: ""These deaths stem from a longstanding and complex set of challenges, and there is no shortcut that will suddenly solve this."" Scottish Conservative health spokesman Donald Cameron said the statistics were ""dreadful and heart-breaking in equal measure"". ""It is appalling that drug deaths have doubled in a decade, and there's no doubt that this government's cuts to drug rehab and addiction programmes have a large part to play in this awful trend,"" he said. ""The Scottish Conservatives have backed calls from rehab organisations - including Favor Scotland, Jericho House and Phoenix Futures - for a Â£20m Scottish Recovery Fund. ""We need to start helping people to get off drugs and get well, we can't simply try to manage addictions and leave it there."" Scottish Labour's Monica Lennon called on Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick to resign over the record levels of drug deaths. She said: ""Time and time again, the Scottish government was warned by dozens of organisations to properly fund treatment and recovery services, but instead we got real terms cuts. ""Calls for bold and urgent action have not been acted on. ""The public needs to have confidence in the public health minister to lead us out of this human rights tragedy - these shocking statistics and his woeful response give us none."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said lives were being lost on an ""unprecedented and unparalleled scale"". He said: ""Too often services simply aren't there, either through a lack of resources or a lack of political will."" Mr Cole-Hamilton called for more funding for drug services and sending people to treatment instead of prison. Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie accused both the Scottish and UK governments of ""a shameful failure of leadership"". He said criminalisation of drugs had caused more harm than it has prevented. ""Addiction is better tackled by trained medical professionals than the strong arm of the law,"" he said. However, decriminalisation has been ruled out by the UK government, which controls drugs law. David Liddell, the chief executive of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said the number of preventable deaths was ""a national tragedy and disgrace"". ""We need people to be in high quality treatment that protects them from overdose and death,"" he said. â¯He said the Drug Taskforce's plans for treatment standards, which would mean people gained quick access to drug services and have a choice of medication that best suits them, were a step forward. He also called for drug consumption rooms, heroin-assisted treatment and assertive outreach.â¯â¯ Mr Liddell said there needed to be an end to ""the alienation, marginalisation and stigmatisation of people with a drug problem"". ""As part of this approach, we should decriminalise the possession of all drugs and extend the current recorded police warning for cannabis possession to apply to all other drugs,"" he said.

"Caerphilly county saw the most Covid hospital deaths across the Aneurin Bevan health board There were 207 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales in the latest weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Both Aneurin Bevan and Swansea Bay health boards saw the highest numbers of weekly deaths since the end of April, at the peak of the first wave of the pandemic. Overall, Covid deaths fell for the second successive week from 218 deaths. But deaths from all causes are again above the five-year average. There were 54 deaths involving Covid in the Swansea Bay health board area, including 39 in hospital and 15 in care homes, in the week ending 4 December. The hospital deaths involved 21 residents from Neath Port Talbot and 18 from Swansea. A similar pattern can be seen in Aneurin Bevan health board, with 53 deaths registered involving Covid-19 - including 38 in hospital and 13 in care homes - again the highest there since the end of April. The hospital deaths include 15 patients from Caerphilly county. Cwm Taf Morgannwg saw deaths fall from 62 to 42, while there were 18 deaths in the Hywel Dda health board area. There were 24 deaths in Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales, 14 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in Cardiff and Vale, and two in Powys. Meanwhile, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board hasreported another 17 deaths linked to hospital infections,externalat three of its hospitals. It takes the total number of deaths in the outbreaks to 236. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, were 157 more than the 2015-2019 average in the week ending.

The proportion of excess deaths for this week in Wales was 23.1% higher than average, compared to the 14.6% higher in England. But so far this year, the proportion of excess deaths in England (13.6%) is higher than in Wales (10% higher than average). The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 4 December was 3,892 deaths. When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 3,983 deaths occurring up to 4 December. So far in the pandemic, Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) has seen the most deaths in Wales - 559, while its rate of deaths is the second highest across England and Wales for its population size. Registered deaths involving Covid-19 are where the virus is suspected or confirmed and where doctors consider it a factor in a death, although in around 90% of cases it is the underlying cause. The deaths occur in hospitals, care homes, hospices and people's own homes. Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

"Matt Hancock's letter was criticised by a Welsh Government deputy minister UK ministers have written to Mark Drakeford to offer ""mutual aid"" in England if Welsh hospitals become unable to treat non-Covid patients. It could see coronavirus patients being moved to hospitals in England to ease the pressure on hospitals in Wales. It comes as numbers of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 hit record levels. The first minister said Wales has supplied 11 million items of PPE to the English NHS during the pandemic. Two Welsh health boardshave suspended some non-urgent care in response to increased coronavirus cases. Wales isalready in breach of some key indicatorsused to determine future lockdowns, including current coronavirus case rates and the rate of positive tests. Concerns over hospital capacity is also a key indicators for Wales's new alert level four - which would introduce restrictions equivalent to a lockdown. Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Covid not out of control in Wales, FM insists England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Welsh Secretary Simon Hart have written to the first minister to offer support for Welsh health boards and said the military would assist with logistical support. They wrote: ""We have seen that Covid-19 does not respect political or administrative boundaries. Instead it follows the human geographies that people follow, which we know is especially important for much of the Wales-England border. ""We are aware that health boards across Wales are considering postponing non-Covid treatments and appointments (including those classed as urgent) to deal with the immediate threat of the pandemic. ""We stand ready to support Welsh hospitals through mutual aid of patients across the border where this is needed due to undue strain on healthcare provision."" The letter said Covid ""does not respect political or administrative boundaries"" The letter also offers further use of the UK government's mass testing programme - in addition to current mass-testing programmes in Merthyr Tydfil and Cynon Valley. They added the military ""stand ready to assist with the Welsh Government with further logistical and other support where needed too"". The latest NHS Wales figures show 2,124 patients with Covid in hospital on Monday - this is 17% more than the week before and the highest number yet recorded. It has risen over the week in all areas apart from Betsi Cadwaladr, while Aneurin Bevan has the most patients, 584. Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board has seen a 30% rise in Covid patients. Numbers include more than 600 patients in Welsh hospital beds who are still recovering from the effects of the virus. Covid-19 patients make up nearly 27% of all patients in hospital, a proportion which has been slowly rising in the last week. There were 91 patients in critical care or on invasive ventilation, which is the highest number since the first wave of pandemic in May - with 48 more patients in total than the usual capacity, Hospital admissions remain fairly steady with an average of 90 a day for the last week. Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport,said on social media,externalthe Welsh Government had ""provided repeated mutual aid to all other parts of the UK to stop them running out of PPE"". He accused Simon Hart of ""cheap posturing in a public health emergency... shame on you"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would reply to the letter ""once again endorsing the principle of mutual aid which has been there through coronavirus"". ""Wales has supplied 11 million items of PPE to the English NHS during the virus as part of our mutual aid,"" he said. ""The letter that I have received today restates that and I'm very happy, once again, to endorse it.""

"Across the UK there are now 1,692,000 people unemployed Wales experienced the steepest rise in unemployment between August and October of any nation or region of the UK. The rate of unemployment is now 4.6% in Wales and 4.9% across the UK as a whole, according to the latest official figures.  Unemployment in Wales rose by 22,000 compared with the previous three months. The Office for National Statistics' UK payroll data showed thehospitality sector had been the most severely affected, followed by wholesale and retail and manufacturing. The rate of people not available for work is now at 24% - these are working age people who may be full-time carers or students, on long-term sick or have taken early retirement. This is compared with 20.8% for the UK. That means there were 459,000 ""economically inactive"" people in Wales, 8,000 more than in July, and 22,000 more than the same time last year. Before the pandemic, Wales had seen low levels of unemployment. Across the UK there are now 1,692,000 unemployed, which is 411,000 more than the same period a year ago. Hospitality and food has been the most severely affected sector The Office for National Statistics said the latest figures for the numbers of people paying tax in the UK showed there were 800,000 fewer on the payroll in November than in February, and one third of those people had been working in the hospitality sector. This is the first time there has been a sector breakdown for the number of people on company payrolls. Furloughed workers are counted as employed in the statistics. This latest set of labour market figures are for August to October, during which the UK government's Covid-19 pandemic furlough scheme was reducing the amount given to employers to pay workers. UK loses 819,000 paid jobs since start of pandemic Young people hit as unemployment rate rises Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (JRS) - known as furlough - was brought in on 20 March to help employers keep on staff during lockdown. The scheme meant the Treasury originally paid 80% of an employee's wages while they were not working, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per person per month. The scheme was due to be replaced by the Job Support Scheme on 1 November. On 31 October the chancellor announced the JRS was instead being extended to 31 March and made more generous again, with the UK government paying 80% of employee wages, but with the employer covering pension and National Insurance contributions. Firms made more workers redundant in anticipation of the end of the furlough scheme, which was originally supposed to finish at the end of October. The Treasury said the number of jobs furloughed in Wales reached a peak in July of 378,400 - roughly 29% of eligible jobs. From 1 July, employers could apply for flexible furlough, meaning an employee could be furloughed for part of their time employed. By the end of August, more than 130,000 were on some form of furlough. That represented around 10% of eligible Welsh employees, according to the latest Treasury statistics. These latest figures make grim reading and are a reminder of the extent to which Covid-19 has hit families' living standards. While some may be relieved the unemployment rate in Wales is still lower than for the UK as a whole, it is concerning that in the three months to October unemployment grew more steeply here than any other nation or region of the UK - in other words a greater proportion of people living in Wales lost their jobs. When comparing areas it is important that we look at proportions not absolute numbers because they have different-sized populations. It is interesting the latest figures from the ONS show that of the 819,000 jobs lost across the UK since February, one third of them have been in accommodation and hospitality. These sectors, along with their suppliers, are very important to the Welsh economy. It is also important to remember that the furlough scheme has been highly effective in terms of keeping people on the payroll and it is still in operation. Even after that scheme ends it will take several months before we know the full extent of job losses across Wales.

"At least 10 cases of the new variant have been identified in Wales A new strain of coronavirus which was found to be circulating in England is already present in Wales, the Welsh Government has confirmed. On Monday,the UK government said the variant ""may be associated""with a faster spread in south east England. The Welsh Government said there were at least 10 confirmed cases in Wales and more were expected to be identified. An expert who helps track mutations of the virus said he was ""not especially concerned"" and urged calm. More than 1,000 cases have been recorded across 60 English council areas. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Are coronavirus mutations making it more infectious? Matt Hancock, the UK government minister in charge of the NHS in England, said there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Announcing tougher restrictions inLondon and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire, he said: ""We've currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant predominantly in the south of England, although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas. ""We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant, but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out."" He said the World Health Organization had been notified of the new variant and UK scientists were doing detailed studies. Prof Thomas Connor helps track mutations of the virus Cardiff University Professor Tom Connor, bioinformatics lead at Public Health Wales, said: ""We see numerous numbers of variants accumulating in the population. ""The virus is continually introducing these changes as it progresses."" Most mutations to the genetic code of the virus will have no impact on its risk to the public, he explained, but said it was important to monitor because an increase in the prevalence of a variant could be for a ""biological reason"" such as increased transmissibility. Prof Connor said the new variant - called N501Y - could plausibly reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine because the mutations ""fall within the spike proteins"". ""That's the protein on the outside of the virus that helps it get into cells and actually cause the infection,"" he explained. Wales has seen a rise in cases ahead of Christmas Both the Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech vaccines rely on spike proteins, Prof Connor said. He urged people not to be alarmed and to carry on following advice to observe social distancing, wash your hands and wear a face covering. He added: ""We are potentially moving towards the point where we go from this being a pandemic to an endemic - so a disease which is circulating in the human population and we vaccinate against it every year, for example like we do with influenza."" The Welsh Government reiterated it was ""natural for the virus to mutate"", adding that further sequencing and tracking was taking place. Dr Gill Richardson, who is senior responsible officer for the Covid-19 vaccine in Wales, said: ""Viruses are living beings that change and adapt, and we know that since the original Wuhan virus there [have] actually been 25 mutations. ""It's important to say that at the moment it is not thought to affect the behaviour of the virus at all, and it's not thought to affect the effectiveness of the vaccine."" There is a simple rule for understanding all ""new strain"" or ""new variants"": Ask whether the behaviour of the virus has changed. This is crucial as viruses mutate all the time, it's just what they do. And so far we've been given the ""scare"" but not the ""answer"". Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in the south-east of England. This is not the same as saying it ""is causing"" the rise and Mr Hancock did not say this virus has evolved to spread from person-to-person more readily. New strains can become more common for reasons that have nothing to do with the virus. One explanation for the emergence of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was tourism. So at the moment there are scary headlines everywhere, but still no scientific detail to know how significant this is. The news of the new variant comes as cases continue to rise in Wales. On Monday it was revealedWales was already breaching some of the key indicators used to determine if the country goes into lockdown. First Minister Mark Drakeford said a lockdowncould be introduced after Christmasif rates do not begin to fall. Public Health Wales figures on Monday showed Merthyr Tydfil had the highest case rate in the UK, with 870.3 cases per 100,000 people over the most recent seven days. Eight Welsh counties were among the 10 areas with the highest case rates in the UK.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There are no plans to change regulations covering Christmas in England, the BBC understands. Talks with devolved administrations - that have been taking place this evening - will continue tomorrow and it's still hoped a common approach can be agreed. There is likely to be tougher guidance in the coming days to reflect the current situation. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have said they will co-ordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. They pledged to rapidly share information on how vaccination was proceeding, Reuters reports, quoting a joint statement by the countries' health ministries. In Germany, there is growing impatience that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - developed by German scientists and currently being rolled out in the UK and US - has yet to be approved for use in the European Union, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. It was reported earlier thatEurope's medicines regulator EMA will meet sooner than had been planned to consider approving a vaccine. Vaccination programmes are under way in the UK with the Pfizer vaccine, but the approval of a second jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is eagerly awaited. The UK has ordered 100m doses and regulators are assessing its safety and efficacy - how well it works. It is in the last stage of assessment by MHRAafter the government asked it to analyse a final set of data on 27 November.

So we've been hearing tonight about the call between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on what to do about Christmas. The joint plans to ease Covid restrictions for a few days over the festive period have been discussed. No decisions were made tonight, and further talks on the possible easing of rules around meeting up in the UK will take place on Wednesday. A government source said there was ""recognition a commitment has been made to people"" in the existing plans, but also that there's a need to be ""stronger and clearer in guidance and messaging"".

The source said there were discussions on travel over the Christmas period, but no decisions were made. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to authorise Moderna's vaccine sometime this week, US media report. This means that by Monday, there could be two Covid vaccines available for Americans. The Moderna vaccine can be shipped at -20C, while the jab from Pfizer/BioNTech must be kept at a trickier -70C. The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. The vaccines will be provided at no cost to Americans. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The country is also expecting 200,000 more Pfizer vaccines by next week. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab and 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech version. Also on Tuesday, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for the US' first fully at-home Covid-19 test. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the tests can be sold in chemists and patients will be able to get results ""in as little as 20 minutes"".

Testing companies have faced problems meeting demand from travellers The new testing system intended to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England has facedproblems on its first day, with one company asking to withdraw from the programme. Travellers are now allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests, but a number have hit problems. One company, SameDayDoctor, has asked to be withdrawn from the programme. It posted a message on its website saying it has been ""so overwhelmed"" with requests for test-to-release that it cannot answer any more emails or take any more bookings. Downing Street says it is working to approve more test providers. BBC Radio 5 Live All day on 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Mike Jones is the violence reduction lead for South Western Ambulance Service, where there has been a sharp increase in assaults on paramedics.

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts who identified thenew variant of Covid that appears to be spreading fast in some parts of Englandsay the infection is probably home-grown rather than imported. Prof Nick Loman, an expert in microbiology from the University of Birmingham and part of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (CoG), says it seems to have appeared spontaneously ""out of nowhere"" in late September. The small number of cases soon grew to many more and got the experts concerned. So far, 1,000 confirmed cases have been discovered in the UK. They are predominantly in the south of England, but cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, including parts of Scotland and Wales. Prof Loman says as well as the ""striking growth"" on a wide geographical scale the ""sheer number of mutations"" - 17 in total - that made up the variant was more than they expected to see and set alarm bells ringing. While ""none of those things are smoking guns"", he says there is ""sufficient circumstantial evidence to think this is something that urgently needs following up"". The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid. In that space of time, there's also a chance the new variant could burn itself out and disappear as quickly as it arrived. A majority of people think ministers should abandon plans to relax the coronavirus rules over Christmas, an opinion poll suggests. In a survey of 3,856 adults in Great Britain by YouGov, 57% said the current restrictions should be maintained, with 31% supporting the plan to relax the rules. Older people appeared to be more strongly in favour of tighter restrictions, with 70% of over-65s saying the temporary relaxation should be scrapped, and 61% among those aged between 50 and 65. It comes as urgent talks are taking place between the leaders of the devolved administrations and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove - to discuss the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over Christmas. BBC Radio 5 Live Elizabeth has enjoyed getting ""glammed up"" for date nights All day, on BBC Radio 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Elizabeth Blythe is 29 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent. She and her husband are 999 call assessors at West Midlands Ambulance Service. She has had a tough year. As well as grieving for her dad who died last November, she had to postpone her honeymoon to New York because of Covid. Work has been challenging too. ""When coronavirus first hit the UK, it was pandemonium,"" she said. ""The phone was going constantly, you didn't get a break between calls. ""But as people got used to the 'new normal', the calls decreased quite a bit and it almost seemed that people were scared to call for an ambulance because they didn't want to go anywhere near where they thought coronavirus would be."" To make up for missing her honeymoon, Elizabeth and her husband have been having ""date nights"" to cheer themselves up. âI get myself all glammed up, he puts on nice clothes and we have a date night in the house,"" she said.

'Tis the season to go shopping... or maybe not As we mentioned earlier, the Netherlands has started a strict five-week lockdown, with schools, non-essential shops and public venues closing. It has left its neighbour Belgium a bit nervous - with towns near the border expecting a possible rush of Dutch shoppers scrambling to get their Christmas shopping done. Belgian leader Alexander De Croo spoke to Dutch PM Mark Rutte on Tuesday, stressing that recreational shopping is âforbiddenâ in his country,Brussels Times reports,external. The Netherlands has also reminded its citizens not to cross the border unless absolutely necessary. There are reports,externalthat the coastal town Knokke-Heist could close streets to reduce tourists' access. By contrast,the mayor of Essen,externalhas stressed that the authorities ""should not forbid"" visitors from shopping - but should make sure they follow local virus prevention rules. Dr Fauci is a member of the US Covid taskforce Healthy Americans without underlying conditions could get the vaccine by the end of March or in early April, according to US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci. Dr Fauci, who has become the face of the US response to the pandemic,told MSNBC,externalhe hopes the country will have herd immunity by spring or early summer, but that depends on the ""efficiency of the rollout"". ""By the time we get to the fall, we can start approaching some degree of relief where the level of infection will be so low in society we can start essentially approaching some form of normality,"" Dr Fauci said. He also added that as soon as it's his turn to get the vaccine, he'll do so publicly, ""so that people can see that I feel strongly that this is something we should do"".

"There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, official figures show. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail, according to the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. While there have been significant job losses in other sectors such as aviation and manufacturing, hospitality has been the most affected by coronavirus restrictions this year. Bars and restaurants had to close for months during the first lockdown, and have faced strict compliance rules and further shutdowns since then. Thousands remain closed in areas covered by tier 3 restrictions and the industry will suffer even more when London - a hive of hospitality firms - enters the highest alert level on Wednesday. ""It you look at the number of people losing their jobs, the number of people on furlough and the vacancies available for people looking for jobs in the hospitality sector, all that adds up to a very difficult time for that industry,"" the ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, told the BBC's Today programme. Industry body UK Hospitality called the move to place London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire into tier 3 ""illogical"", despite the recent surge in infections. ""The spread is being predominantly driven through schools... yet, once again, it is hospitality that will take the hit,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""So many pubs, restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels, having invested so much to make their venues safe, are only just clinging on by the skin of their teeth."" Ana Grillo is looking for work in marketing and publishing Ana Grillo graduated in September but has been unable to find work since, despite having made applying for roles her ""full time job"". ""It's extremely overwhelming, especially in a pandemic as there's not as many people to turn to for support,"" she told the BBC. She is looking for work in marketing or publishing but says the competition is intense - so much so she tries to submit applications within an hour of an advert being published. ""Some employers make us very aware that they are overwhelmed so they are just going to take the first bunch,"" she said. Having largely supported herself through university, living back at home with her parents has made her feel a ""bit of burden"". ""I've been independent for three years and now I feel completely helpless. But I have no choice."" Redundancies hit a record 370,000 in the three months to October, according to the ONS, although this began to ease towards the end of the period. But the figures pre-date the November lockdown and unemployment is excepted to continue to rise, peaking at a rate of 9.7% this year, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The latest data confirms that coronavirus continues to weigh heavily on the UK labour market. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""While the furlough scheme will help safeguard many jobs over the winter months, with businesses facing the prospect of further restrictions and a messy end to the Brexit transition period, major job losses remain probable in the near term."" The jobs numbers are again grim over the course of the pandemic with 819,000 fewer employees on payrolls since February. But without extension of the furlough scheme to March they would have been even more concerning. The official headline unemployment rate is up only a little at 4.9%. But for most of October it was above 5%. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? These numbers reflect mainly the period before the second national lockdown. And for the first time they are broken down by industry. Well over half of the lost employees during the pandemic have been in hospitality and retail, 456,837 out of 819,000. Health and social care have seen an extra 74,342 jobs. While some optimism has emerged from the prospect of a functioning vaccine, the next few months are likely to remain very challenging, with unemployment continuing to rise. Those rises continue to be contained by the furlough scheme. Many companies began to cut jobs in anticipation of the end of the furlough wage support scheme, which was originally meant to finish on 31 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the scheme until March as the second England lockdown began last month, but some argue he should have moved sooner. Commenting on the latest figures, Mr Sunak said the government had provided Â£280bn of support, including protecting more than nine million jobs through the furlough scheme and offering loans, grants and tax cuts to business. He added: ""But we know that, sadly, many people are already facing unemployment. That's why our Plan for Jobs is also helping to create new jobs, including through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme and expanded apprenticeships and traineeships."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the chancellor's ""irresponsible decisions"" had cost jobs and left the UK with the ""worst recession of any major economy"". ""It's no coincidence that redundancies rocketed to record levels when the clock was ticking down to the chancellor's furlough cliff edge and rising employer contributions were putting businesses under pressure. ""Employers can't afford to wait until the last minute again for this chancellor to decide what happens to the furlough scheme at the end of January. They need clarity now.""

The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid. In that space of time, there's also a chance the new variant could burn itself out and disappear as quickly as it arrived. A majority of people think ministers should abandon plans to relax the coronavirus rules over Christmas, an opinion poll suggests. In a survey of 3,856 adults in Great Britain by YouGov, 57% said the current restrictions should be maintained, with 31% supporting the plan to relax the rules. Older people appeared to be more strongly in favour of tighter restrictions, with 70% of over-65s saying the temporary relaxation should be scrapped, and 61% among those aged between 50 and 65. It comes as urgent talks are taking place between the leaders of the devolved administrations and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove - to discuss the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over Christmas. BBC Radio 5 Live Elizabeth has enjoyed getting ""glammed up"" for date nights All day, on BBC Radio 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Elizabeth Blythe is 29 and lives in Stoke-on-Trent. She and her husband are 999 call assessors at West Midlands Ambulance Service. She has had a tough year. As well as grieving for her dad who died last November, she had to postpone her honeymoon to New York because of Covid. Work has been challenging too. ""When coronavirus first hit the UK, it was pandemonium,"" she said. ""The phone was going constantly, you didn't get a break between calls. ""But as people got used to the 'new normal', the calls decreased quite a bit and it almost seemed that people were scared to call for an ambulance because they didn't want to go anywhere near where they thought coronavirus would be."" To make up for missing her honeymoon, Elizabeth and her husband have been having ""date nights"" to cheer themselves up. âI get myself all glammed up, he puts on nice clothes and we have a date night in the house,"" she said.

'Tis the season to go shopping... or maybe not As we mentioned earlier, the Netherlands has started a strict five-week lockdown, with schools, non-essential shops and public venues closing. It has left its neighbour Belgium a bit nervous - with towns near the border expecting a possible rush of Dutch shoppers scrambling to get their Christmas shopping done. Belgian leader Alexander De Croo spoke to Dutch PM Mark Rutte on Tuesday, stressing that recreational shopping is âforbiddenâ in his country,Brussels Times reports,external. The Netherlands has also reminded its citizens not to cross the border unless absolutely necessary. There are reports,externalthat the coastal town Knokke-Heist could close streets to reduce tourists' access. By contrast,the mayor of Essen,externalhas stressed that the authorities ""should not forbid"" visitors from shopping - but should make sure they follow local virus prevention rules. Dr Fauci is a member of the US Covid taskforce Healthy Americans without underlying conditions could get the vaccine by the end of March or in early April, according to US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci. Dr Fauci, who has become the face of the US response to the pandemic,told MSNBC,externalhe hopes the country will have herd immunity by spring or early summer, but that depends on the ""efficiency of the rollout"". ""By the time we get to the fall, we can start approaching some degree of relief where the level of infection will be so low in society we can start essentially approaching some form of normality,"" Dr Fauci said. He also added that as soon as it's his turn to get the vaccine, he'll do so publicly, ""so that people can see that I feel strongly that this is something we should do"".

"There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, official figures show. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail, according to the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. While there have been significant job losses in other sectors such as aviation and manufacturing, hospitality has been the most affected by coronavirus restrictions this year. Bars and restaurants had to close for months during the first lockdown, and have faced strict compliance rules and further shutdowns since then. Thousands remain closed in areas covered by tier 3 restrictions and the industry will suffer even more when London - a hive of hospitality firms - enters the highest alert level on Wednesday. ""It you look at the number of people losing their jobs, the number of people on furlough and the vacancies available for people looking for jobs in the hospitality sector, all that adds up to a very difficult time for that industry,"" the ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, told the BBC's Today programme. Industry body UK Hospitality called the move to place London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire into tier 3 ""illogical"", despite the recent surge in infections. ""The spread is being predominantly driven through schools... yet, once again, it is hospitality that will take the hit,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""So many pubs, restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels, having invested so much to make their venues safe, are only just clinging on by the skin of their teeth."" Ana Grillo is looking for work in marketing and publishing Ana Grillo graduated in September but has been unable to find work since, despite having made applying for roles her ""full time job"". ""It's extremely overwhelming, especially in a pandemic as there's not as many people to turn to for support,"" she told the BBC. She is looking for work in marketing or publishing but says the competition is intense - so much so she tries to submit applications within an hour of an advert being published. ""Some employers make us very aware that they are overwhelmed so they are just going to take the first bunch,"" she said. Having largely supported herself through university, living back at home with her parents has made her feel a ""bit of burden"". ""I've been independent for three years and now I feel completely helpless. But I have no choice."" Redundancies hit a record 370,000 in the three months to October, according to the ONS, although this began to ease towards the end of the period. But the figures pre-date the November lockdown and unemployment is excepted to continue to rise, peaking at a rate of 9.7% this year, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The latest data confirms that coronavirus continues to weigh heavily on the UK labour market. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""While the furlough scheme will help safeguard many jobs over the winter months, with businesses facing the prospect of further restrictions and a messy end to the Brexit transition period, major job losses remain probable in the near term."" The jobs numbers are again grim over the course of the pandemic with 819,000 fewer employees on payrolls since February. But without extension of the furlough scheme to March they would have been even more concerning. The official headline unemployment rate is up only a little at 4.9%. But for most of October it was above 5%. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? These numbers reflect mainly the period before the second national lockdown. And for the first time they are broken down by industry. Well over half of the lost employees during the pandemic have been in hospitality and retail, 456,837 out of 819,000. Health and social care have seen an extra 74,342 jobs. While some optimism has emerged from the prospect of a functioning vaccine, the next few months are likely to remain very challenging, with unemployment continuing to rise. Those rises continue to be contained by the furlough scheme. Many companies began to cut jobs in anticipation of the end of the furlough wage support scheme, which was originally meant to finish on 31 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the scheme until March as the second England lockdown began last month, but some argue he should have moved sooner. Commenting on the latest figures, Mr Sunak said the government had provided Â£280bn of support, including protecting more than nine million jobs through the furlough scheme and offering loans, grants and tax cuts to business. He added: ""But we know that, sadly, many people are already facing unemployment. That's why our Plan for Jobs is also helping to create new jobs, including through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme and expanded apprenticeships and traineeships."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the chancellor's ""irresponsible decisions"" had cost jobs and left the UK with the ""worst recession of any major economy"". ""It's no coincidence that redundancies rocketed to record levels when the clock was ticking down to the chancellor's furlough cliff edge and rising employer contributions were putting businesses under pressure. ""Employers can't afford to wait until the last minute again for this chancellor to decide what happens to the furlough scheme at the end of January. They need clarity now.""

Realising his sport was in danger with little funding and no travel, he bought a van and toured the US, filming his flights in remote locations. Wolfgang noticed a huge reaction to his videos, with people who were in lockdown saying that it allowed them to momentarily leave their homes and experience the sport. He hopes to return to competitions and instructing in 2021, but for now, he's continuing to promote the sport. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There are no plans to change regulations covering Christmas in England, the BBC understands. Talks with devolved administrations - that have been taking place this evening - will continue tomorrow and it's still hoped a common approach can be agreed. There is likely to be tougher guidance in the coming days to reflect the current situation. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have said they will co-ordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. They pledged to rapidly share information on how vaccination was proceeding, Reuters reports, quoting a joint statement by the countries' health ministries. In Germany, there is growing impatience that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - developed by German scientists and currently being rolled out in the UK and US - has yet to be approved for use in the European Union, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. It was reported earlier thatEurope's medicines regulator EMA will meet sooner than had been planned to consider approving a vaccine. Vaccination programmes are under way in the UK with the Pfizer vaccine, but the approval of a second jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is eagerly awaited. The UK has ordered 100m doses and regulators are assessing its safety and efficacy - how well it works. It is in the last stage of assessment by MHRAafter the government asked it to analyse a final set of data on 27 November.

So we've been hearing tonight about the call between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on what to do about Christmas. The joint plans to ease Covid restrictions for a few days over the festive period have been discussed. No decisions were made tonight, and further talks on the possible easing of rules around meeting up in the UK will take place on Wednesday. A government source said there was ""recognition a commitment has been made to people"" in the existing plans, but also that there's a need to be ""stronger and clearer in guidance and messaging"". Travel was discussed, the source added. Read more here. Turkey has recorded 235 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours - the highest number since the outbreak began.

The source said there were discussions on travel over the Christmas period, but no decisions were made. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to authorise Moderna's vaccine sometime this week, US media report. This means that by Monday, there could be two Covid vaccines available for Americans. The Moderna vaccine can be shipped at -20C, while the jab from Pfizer/BioNTech must be kept at a trickier -70C. The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. The vaccines will be provided at no cost to Americans. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The country is also expecting 200,000 more Pfizer vaccines by next week. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab and 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech version. Also on Tuesday, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for the US' first fully at-home Covid-19 test. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the tests can be sold in chemists and patients will be able to get results ""in as little as 20 minutes"".

Testing companies have faced problems meeting demand from travellers The new testing system intended to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England has facedproblems on its first day, with one company asking to withdraw from the programme. Travellers are now allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests, but a number have hit problems. One company, SameDayDoctor, has asked to be withdrawn from the programme. It posted a message on its website saying it has been ""so overwhelmed"" with requests for test-to-release that it cannot answer any more emails or take any more bookings. Downing Street says it is working to approve more test providers. BBC Radio 5 Live All day on 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Mike Jones is the violence reduction lead for South Western Ambulance Service, where there has been a sharp increase in assaults on paramedics.

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts who identified thenew variant of Covid that appears to be spreading fast in some parts of Englandsay the infection is probably home-grown rather than imported. Prof Nick Loman, an expert in microbiology from the University of Birmingham and part of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (CoG), says it seems to have appeared spontaneously ""out of nowhere"" in late September. The small number of cases soon grew to many more and got the experts concerned. So far, 1,000 confirmed cases have been discovered in the UK. They are predominantly in the south of England, but cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, including parts of Scotland and Wales. Prof Loman says as well as the ""striking growth"" on a wide geographical scale the ""sheer number of mutations"" - 17 in total - that made up the variant was more than they expected to see and set alarm bells ringing. While ""none of those things are smoking guns"", he says there is ""sufficient circumstantial evidence to think this is something that urgently needs following up"". The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid.

"Greenwich Council has asked all schools to move to online learning amid rising Covid cases The leader of Greenwich Council has said he has ""no choice"" but to ask schools to remain open after threats of legal action from the government. The authoritywrote to head teachersasking for classes to move online from Tuesday amid rising Covid-19 cases. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ordered the council to keep all schools open until the end of term. Council leader Danny Thorpe said he could not justify using public funds to fight the decision in the courts. In a statement, the Labour councillor said he did not agree that it was right to keep schools open but he had ""no choice but to ask our schools to keep their doors open to all students, rather than just continuing with online learning"". Covid: Will schools close early for Christmas? Will there be mass testing at your child's school? New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Parents told the BBC it was an odd and confusing time for schools and families in the borough. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire will move into England's highest tier of Covid restrictions on Wednesday due to a rise in infections. Schools in England were told theycould close a day earlyfor Christmas last week to give staff a ""proper break"" from identifying potential coronavirus cases. In Basildon, where the third-highest Covid rate was recorded, schoolswere also allowed to close early, while London's mayor Sadiq Khan has called on secondary schools and colleges in the capital to follow suit. Imagine how baffling it's been for parents in Greenwich and other London boroughs caught up in this end-of-term playground power struggle - which has become a microcosm of the uncertainty about whether children should be in school this week. On Sunday night Greenwich council told parents schools were moving online - and then on Monday, the Department for Education issued legal threats saying they would have to stay open. And now on Tuesday, the council has backed down and says schools will have to stay open for Wednesday and Thursday. It's added confusion to an already worrying time. Although parents will still be wondering what to believe when they're also being told to stay apart because of London's surge in Covid cases. It might appear an unnecessary tussle about a couple of days in school. But it's been about who is in control and the government's determination not to see its biggest red line crumbling away - and that's keeping schools open. Leaders at two other Labour-run local authorities - Waltham Forest and Islington - have also advised schools to move to online learning for the last few days of term amid rising Covid-19 rates in the capital. Both councils told BBC London they were sticking by their decisions. Schools Minister Nick Gibb has written to Islington and Waltham Forest asking them to reconsider. The BBC understands no legal action has been taken against the local authorities. Mr Thorpe said on Friday there were 3,670 children self-isolating and 314 teaching staff, then on Monday an additional 580 children had to self-isolate. This ""exponential growth"" in Covid-19 cases was the basis of his decision to ask schools to move to online teaching, he said. ""We are in a situation where the virus has been spreading quicker in Greenwich than it has done in other parts of London,"" he said. ""We had to make this call based on the data available to us. I find it regrettable the Secretary of State has pursued a legal route, as fundamentally my decision has been based solely on what is based for families here in Greenwich and not a courtroom battle. ""It shows the government think you can manage the pandemic response entirely from Whitehall and what we are saying is that we have different parts of London and different parts of the country that are experiencing difficult challenges."" Mr Thorpe said he made the decision ""in the best interests of the people of Greenwich"" but recognised the disruption that had been caused. One mother, who has two children at Halstow Primary School in Greenwich, said: ""I really, really feel for schools because they've all worked so hard since September to have schools open to maintain education and that normality for kids. ""I don't know what the school is going to do now, whether they're going to say pupils need to go in or leave it for parents to make the decision. It's another day of poor schools making lots of decisions rather than focusing on our kids."" A father, whose children attend a different school in the borough, added: ""It seems so odd that remote learning suddenly is no longer acceptable. ""I understand that some families will really struggle if parents cannot work from home. In Greenwich, we have never had numbers as bad as they are right now - I don't understand why relatively low impact options, such as online learning, are being taken off the table by the government."" Head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman described it as a ""really difficult situation"" in which people were ""weighing up short-term concerns about health risks and long-term concerns about children's education"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's so easy to call for closures and forget the long-term price which children pay which our visits show so clearly. ""We've had children yo-yoing in and out of school through the autumn and really suffering as a result. We need clarity, consistency, not last minute decisions."" The Association of School and College Leaders said the government ""may find it has won a hollow victory in its squabble with Greenwich council"" Mr Thorpe added that the Department of Health & Social Care had agreed that any resident could access a Covid-19 test, whether they were showing symptoms or not. ""This is a real step change from the current position and one that will benefit all of us locally,"" he added. A head teacher's union has said many parents could still keep their children at home this week despite the government's stance. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: ""The government may find it has won a hollow victory in its squabble with Greenwich council over end-of-term arrangements. ""It has compelled direct classroom teaching for the last few days of term, but we would not be surprised if many parents simply keep their children at home given the evident concern over Covid infection rates. ""It has been an unseemly end to a gruelling and exhausting term when schools at the very least deserved some flexibility over their end-of-term arrangements in the best interests of their pupils and staff, but instead have been met with legal threats from the government.""

"A gay man who went through months of electric shock ""therapy"" in a university psychology department 50 years ago has demanded an apology. Chris - not his real name - went to his GP for advice in the 1970s, when he became aware of his sexuality in his mid-20s. The doctor said he knew someone who could ""cure"" him. He was referred to a clinical psychologist at the University of Birmingham. Believing it would help, Chris underwent the painful and distressing sessions many times a week for several months. This, he says, has led to more than 40 years of ""extreme"" post traumatic stress disorder and poor mental health. Homosexuality had only been de-criminalised in 1967, and mainstream society was still deeply disapproving of it in the 1970s. Chris, now 74, remembers being told that ""even having a sex change"" would be better for him than continuing to live as a gay man, and so he committed to the prescribed treatment which he had been guaranteed would work. Recalling the sessions, Chris said: ""I would be sat in a room, with a projector screen and photographs to look through. An electrode was attached to my ankle and wrist. ""A photo of a man would pop up, and if you weren't quick enough to flick to the next picture, you would get a hefty electric shock. Then photos of women would pop up, with no consequence at all."" PM pledges ban on 'gay conversion therapy' What happened when a proud gay man met a âgay conversion therapistâ The idea of the treatment was to associate homosexual desire with pain and unpleasant feelings. After Chris had finished all of the sessions, the researchers encouraged him to start romantic relationships with women. ""I met Ruth [not her real name] on a blind date and explained everything to her. We went to see the people at the university together, and it didn't scare her off. We were told that I would be perfectly 'normal' on the other side of the treatment."" However, this was not the case. The treatment did not ""cure him"" or alter his sexuality. Nevertheless, the couple married, and are still together today. Chris says he couldn't have found a ""better friend"". But 42 years on, they have still not consummated their marriage. Even though Chris was not detained, or forced to go through the treatment, he says he ""lost everything"" as a result of it. Chris had a successful career as a teacher, until his school found out where he was going during his afternoons off. ""I was a school master, I taught art and I was a head of year. When I had to have two afternoons a week off to attend the 'therapy', I was not entirely honest with the school. I said I was being treated for depression."" He believes that one of the researchers ""outed"" him as gay to his school. ""My head teacher was a very religious man. I was definitely terminated because he thought I was gay. I was advised to leave teaching and I had to find an entirely new career, but nowhere would even interview me."" Therapists and medical professionals have tried to support Chris over the years, but he stresses that nothing has completely alleviated his suffering. Three years ago, Chris began looking for ""closure"". He tracked down one of the post-graduate students who was working in the psychology department at the time of his ""treatment"". He provided Chris with evidence of the electric shock therapy. ""Even with undeniable proof, I was met with an absolute wall of silence by the university. They tried to deny that this ever happened,"" he said. The University of Birmingham says the electro-shock therapy was one researcher's private project Correspondence seen by the BBC shows that the University of Birmingham did initially deny that Chris' electric shock therapy ever took place. Staff claimed that they do not keep records for more than 25 years, and therefore they had ""no record"" of it. However, Chris persisted and their response changed. ""They eventually blamed the researcher, saying it was just his private project, and nothing to do with the university."" But Chris contends that all meetings took place in the University of Birmingham's department of psychology, with university staff, university students and university equipment. ""I don't want to sue the university into oblivion, I just want an apology for the years of pain they have put me through. I just want closure."" The University of Birmingham spokesman said: ""While we are unable to find any evidence that this was a university sanctioned research project, we are aware that during the late 1960s and 1970s there may have been some isolated activity of this nature. ""We believe that this was wholly inappropriate and deeply regret that such potentially harmful activity may have taken place; we have engaged with the individual on a number of occasions to highlight our regret."" It added that as an institution it believed all conversion therapies are ""unethical, degrading and potentially harmful"" and that it was committed to promoting equality, diversity and fairness irrespective of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2018, the UK government announced that ""gay conversion therapies"" were to be banned, as part of a plan to improve the lives of gay and transgender people. Campaigners are still waiting for action, even after the Prime Ministerpromised it again this summer. The term ""conversion therapy"" refers to any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to change a person's sexual orientation, or to suppress a person's gender identity. While some violent practices which may be classed as conversion therapy, such as ""corrective rape"", are already covered by existing criminal offences, many religious practices, such as ""group prayer"",  are not. Instagram to block posts promoting LGBT 'conversion therapies' Nancy Kelley, chief executive of LGBT rights charity Stonewall, said the government needs to ""stop dragging its feet"" and bring forward a ban. ""It's now been two-and-a-half years since the government promised to end conversion therapy against LGBT people"" she added. ""All forms of so-called therapy that attempt to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity are cruel, degrading and unethical. This video can not be played Gareth went to gay conversion therapy for four years and says it made him 'feel broken' ""You cannot cure being LGBT, you cannot erase us from society. Major UK health organisations like the NHS, psychotherapy and counselling bodies have rightly condemned these practices."" Chris is also calling for the government to ""fix this mess."" ""In this country it is illegal to train a dog using electric shocks, but it is not illegal to use electric shocks on a gay man,"" he said. ""I have had over 40 years of pain, and an immensely frustrating life. Why has the government still not banned conversion therapy?""

"The higher numbers of deaths seen in the UK recent weeks may be starting to fall, figures suggest. In the week ending 4 December there were 13,956 deaths - 15% above the five-year average. But that is down on the previous week when deaths were 20% higher. Just over 3,100 of the deaths involved Covid - down by 200 on the week before. It brings the total excess deaths seen since the pandemic started close to 80,000. These are a measure of all deaths above what would normally be expected. It is a different way of measuring the death toll from the pandemic from the daily figures, which look at the numbers of people dying 28 days after a positive Covid test. People dying from Covid in this period are likely to have caught the infection in the first half of November after cases peaked. Since then cases continued to drop, before starting to climb again over the last week or so, particularly in the south east, which prompted the government to move London and some surrounding areas into tier three. That suggests the next few weeks could see Covid deaths going down and then up again in the coming weeks.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There are no plans to change regulations covering Christmas in England, the BBC understands. Talks with devolved administrations - that have been taking place this evening - will continue tomorrow and it's still hoped a common approach can be agreed. There is likely to be tougher guidance in the coming days to reflect the current situation. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have said they will co-ordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. They pledged to rapidly share information on how vaccination was proceeding, Reuters reports, quoting a joint statement by the countries' health ministries. In Germany, there is growing impatience that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - developed by German scientists and currently being rolled out in the UK and US - has yet to be approved for use in the European Union, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. It was reported earlier thatEurope's medicines regulator EMA will meet sooner than had been planned to consider approving a vaccine. Vaccination programmes are under way in the UK with the Pfizer vaccine, but the approval of a second jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is eagerly awaited. The UK has ordered 100m doses and regulators are assessing its safety and efficacy - how well it works. It is in the last stage of assessment by MHRAafter the government asked it to analyse a final set of data on 27 November.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to authorise Moderna's vaccine sometime this week, US media report. This means that by Monday, there could be two Covid vaccines available for Americans. The Moderna vaccine can be shipped at -20C, while the jab from Pfizer/BioNTech must be kept at a trickier -70C. The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. The vaccines will be provided at no cost to Americans. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The country is also expecting 200,000 more Pfizer vaccines by next week. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab and 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech version. Also on Tuesday, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for the US' first fully at-home Covid-19 test. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the tests can be sold in chemists and patients will be able to get results ""in as little as 20 minutes"".

Testing companies have faced problems meeting demand from travellers The new testing system intended to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England has facedproblems on its first day, with one company asking to withdraw from the programme. Travellers are now allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests, but a number have hit problems. One company, SameDayDoctor, has asked to be withdrawn from the programme. It posted a message on its website saying it has been ""so overwhelmed"" with requests for test-to-release that it cannot answer any more emails or take any more bookings. Downing Street says it is working to approve more test providers. BBC Radio 5 Live All day on 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Mike Jones is the violence reduction lead for South Western Ambulance Service, where there has been a sharp increase in assaults on paramedics.

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts who identified thenew variant of Covid that appears to be spreading fast in some parts of Englandsay the infection is probably home-grown rather than imported. Prof Nick Loman, an expert in microbiology from the University of Birmingham and part of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (CoG), says it seems to have appeared spontaneously ""out of nowhere"" in late September. The small number of cases soon grew to many more and got the experts concerned. So far, 1,000 confirmed cases have been discovered in the UK. They are predominantly in the south of England, but cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, including parts of Scotland and Wales. Prof Loman says as well as the ""striking growth"" on a wide geographical scale the ""sheer number of mutations"" - 17 in total - that made up the variant was more than they expected to see and set alarm bells ringing. While ""none of those things are smoking guns"", he says there is ""sufficient circumstantial evidence to think this is something that urgently needs following up"". The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid. In that space of time, there's also a chance the new variant could burn itself out and disappear as quickly as it arrived. A majority of people think ministers should abandon plans to relax the coronavirus rules over Christmas, an opinion poll suggests. In a survey of 3,856 adults in Great Britain by YouGov, 57% said the current restrictions should be maintained, with 31% supporting the plan to relax the rules. Older people appeared to be more strongly in favour of tighter restrictions, with 70% of over-65s saying the temporary relaxation should be scrapped, and 61% among those aged between 50 and 65. It comes as urgent talks are taking place between the leaders of the devolved administrations and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove - to discuss the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over Christmas.

"The deluge has led to rising floodwaters across parts of northern New South Wales Australian authorities have issued evacuation warnings for low-lying towns in northern New South Wales (NSW) as storms batter the nation's east coast. On Tuesday, emergency officials said they had fielded about 150 calls for help in the past 24 hours. Huge swells pummelled the coasts of NSW and south-east Queensland on Monday, causing major erosion. An already depleted beach at Byron Bay - a popular holiday spot - had all but disappeared, locals said. Authorities said the storm had moved south on Tuesday, bringing the threat of flooding to inland NSW. Byron Bay beach âall but goneâ in Australia storms They told communities around the Tweed River to evacuate on Tuesday, after it burst its banks. Some electricity, internet and other utility networks were also disrupted. Meteorologists say the system has already released an amount of rain similar to a cyclone - about 1,000mm over four days. Australia is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during the nation's summer. Heavy rain affected a 1,000km (620 miles) stretch of Australia's east coast - including Brisbane and the Gold Coast - but was expected to ease late on Tuesday. In one area, Upper Springbook in Queensland, close to a metre of rain had fallen since Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The NSW State Emergency Service said it had carried out 12 flood rescues so far, warning people to stay indoors and avoid driving through floodwaters. Some roads in the area between Tweed Heads and Taree were forced to close due to floods. Heavy rain across northern New South Wales has led to floods and road closures On Monday, authorities in Queensland warned that they had seen ""abnormally high"" tides up to 30cm higher than normal. All beaches in the area have been closed. Officials also recorded 8m-high swells and gale force winds exceeding 104km/h (64 mph) at Byron Bay. About 2,500 calls for emergency assistance have been made across the two states since Thursday, mostly for water damage to homes and for fallen trees and power poles. There have been no confirmed reports of injuries or deaths, but authorities said they were investigating a man's death in a car crash on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. This video can not be played A dog is rescued from under a sea of foam at Byron Bay A La NiÃ±a season is historically associated with increased rainfall and floods in Australia. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events, and floods have been recorded in 12 of the 18 events since 1900. Typically, La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia, says the Bureau of Meteorology. However scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian - whose state was worst-hit in last summer's bushfires - said experts were expecting conditions to be ""worse than what we have seen in quite a number of years"". ""I am hoping what we have seen over the last few days won't be repeated frequently over summer but it could,"" she said on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played Prof Catriona Matheson is the chair of Scotland's drug deaths taskforce Society is guilty of ignoring and neglecting addicts, the head of Scotland's drug deaths taskforce has said. Prof Catriona Matheson was appointed to chair the taskforce last year after a record number of drug misuse deaths in Scotland acted as a ""wake-up"" call. The much-delayed figures for 2019 are due to be published on Tuesday. They are expected to be even higher than those for 2018, which showed 1,187 drug deaths - the highest in Europe. The Scottish death rate per million of the population was more than three times the rate for England and Wales. At the weekend, Scottish Lib Dem health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said the latest figures were likely to be ""horrifying"". Prof Matheson's taskforce began its work in September 2019 and was designed to gather evidence and provide solutions to the drugs emergency. She said some good work had already been done but it would take a lot of effort and at least three years to stabilise the crisis. Prof Matheson told BBC Scotland everyone needed to help to tackle the problem. ""As a society we have been ignoring an under-served part of the population who we have really just neglected,"" she said. ""I think it is time we all woke up to that and got behind the effort to be a bit more humane, show a bit more compassion, because people are losing their loved ones unnecessarily. ""It is avoidable deaths and I think it is time that Scotland as a whole got behind the effort."" Prof Matheson said her taskforce had concentrated on three main areas: keeping people alive, reducing risk for drug users and removing stigma. Naloxone can be administered by syringe or nasal spray to counter the effects of a drug overdose Much of the work on emergency drug treatment has centred on the provision of naloxone, which reverses the effects of an opiate drug overdose if administered in time. Police to carry emergency drug overdose spray Last month, a pilot scheme began for police to carry naloxone and there is also work for the ambulance service to distribute take-home kits to people when they attend an overdose. There is also a new scheme of ""peer to peer"" distribution of naloxone so its distribution can reach further into the community. Diamorphine is prepared in the pharmacy as part of Glasgow's Enhanced Drug Treatment Service Prof Matheson said that getting more people into treatment was also important in reducing drug deaths. She said it was estimated that only about 40% of people who needed drug misuse treatment were getting it. ""If people think the services aren't adequate or aren't meeting their needs, they are not going to go,"" she said. ""If they have to wait a long time and go through lots of hoops, and checks and reassessments, it puts them off going."" The drugs taskforce is implementing a new set of standards for treatment to try to ensure people can access services quickly and stay in them as long as they need. Prof Matheson also said there needed to be more choices in addition to methadone. ""There are other options now that we really need to get to grips with,"" she said. The Buvidal injection is given once a month While there are no miracle cures anywhere in the world, Prof Matheson said Scotland had not been good at pushing options such as Buprenorphine, which is now available as an injection that gives a long-lasting effect. It means users no longer need to visit chemists to pick up methadone prescriptions every day. It is hoped this will allow patients to focus on improving their lives and overall health rather than managing their dependence. 'Game-changer' drug to tackle addiction Prof Matheson said there was also support for the heroin assisted treatment project in Glasgow,which gives drug addicts pharmaceutical grade heroin -  diamorphine. It is hoped the facility will help reduce street drug use, overdose deaths and the spread of HIV in the city. Prof Matheson said the range of options for drug users had been too narrow but was now ""branching out"". Scotland's drug taskforce chief says stigma around drug use needs to be reduced Although it might not immediately seem like it has an impact on drug-related deaths, Prof Matheson said she was convinced stigma played a huge role and needed to be tackled. ""Stigma affects people because they don't want to go for treatment,"" she said. ""They don't want to go to their GP if they have health problems, they feel stigmatised if they have a criminal record and they are stigmatised about getting work. ""This is keeping people excluded from the help and the care they need."" Prof Matheson said, as a result, older drug users - who have a range of respiratory, cardiac, liver and kidney issues - were not seeking treatment and were physically more vulnerable to an overdose. Street Valium is also known as Street Blues Prof Matheson said Scotland had many areas where deprivation was entrenched and there had been shown to be a link between this and drug use. Much of this was linked to trauma and mental health problems suffered by people in these areas. In addition, many of Scotland's problems stem from an ""interesting relationship"" with drug use that developed in the 1980s when cheap heroin flooded into the country and took hold. Over the years patterns of drug use have changed, with people now taking illegal benzodiazepines - street Valium - as well as opiates. There is also a growing problem of younger users injecting cocaine. ""That quite risky pattern of using several substances at once seems to be a Scottish feature,"" Prof Matheson said. According to the taskforce chair, Scotland's drug problem is a ""mature"" one in that it has been known about for many years. However, she said the debate around what to do has not been as mature as the problem. She said she hoped her taskforce would provide the ""clarity"" over what fits best for Scotland.

"I have one simple rule for making sense of ""new variant"" or ""new strain"" coronavirus stories. Ask: ""Has the virus's behaviour changed?"" A mutated virus sounds instinctively scary, but to mutate and change is what viruses do. Most of the time it is either a meaningless tweak or the virus alters itself in such a way that it gets worse at infecting us and the new variant just dies out. Occasionally it hits on a new winning formula. There is no clear-cut evidence the new variant of coronavirus -which has been detected in south-east England- is able to transmit more easily, cause more serious symptoms or render the vaccine useless. However, there are two reasons scientists are keeping a close eye on it. 'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine story The first is that levels of the variant are higher in places where cases are higher. It is a warning sign, although it can be interpreted in two ways. The virus could have mutated to spread more easily and is causing more infections. But variants can also get a lucky break by infecting the right people at the right time. One explanation for the spread of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was simply people catching it on holiday and then bringing it home. It will take experiments in the laboratory to figure out if this variant really is a better spreader than all the others. The other issue that is raising scientific eyebrows is how the virus has mutated. ""It has a surprisingly large number of mutations, more than we would expect, and a few look interesting,"" Prof Nick Loman from the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium told me. There are two notable sets of mutation - and I apologise for their hideous names. Both are found in the crucial spike protein, which is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells in order to hijack them. The mutation N501 (I did warn you) alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. Mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunised The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. The concern was that antibodies from the blood of survivors was less effective at attacking that variant of virus. Again, it is going to take more laboratory studies to really understand what is going on. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""We know there's a variant, we know nothing about what that means biologically. ""It is far too early to make any inference on how important this may or may not be."" Mutations to the spike protein lead to questions about the vaccine because the three leading jabs - Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford - all train the immune system to attack the spike. However, the body learns to attack multiple parts of the spike. That is why health officials remain convinced the vaccine will work against this variant. This is a virus that evolved in animals and made the jump to infecting people around a year ago. Since then it has been picking up around two mutations a month - take a sample today and compare it to the first ones from Wuhan in China and there would be around 25 mutations separating them. Coronavirus is still trying out different combinations of mutations to properly nail infecting humans. We have seen this happen before: The emergence and global dominance of another variant (G614) isseen by many as the virus getting better at spreading,external. But soon mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunized. If this does drive the evolution of the virus, we may have to regularly update the vaccines, as we do for flu, to keep up.

"A cross-party group of MPs has accused the UK government of the almost ""wholesale rejection"" of moves to tackle Scotland's record drug deaths. It comes after theScottish Affairs Committee published a report in Novembercalling for a radical re-think of current drugs policy. Their recommendations included decriminalising drugs for personal use and backing consumption rooms. However, the UK government has rejected most of the recommendations. They include calls to declare Scotland's record drug deaths - 1,187 in 2018 - a public health emergency. MPs call for decriminalisation of personal use drugs Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? The UK government also said a recommendation to reform the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act and decriminalise drugs for personal use would not ""eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence"". They added: ""There is a strong link between drugs and crime, which is why we reject the assertion that the Department for Health and Social Care should lead on drug misuse. We know that people who regularly use heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine are estimated to commit around 45% of all acquisitive crime."" Since 2008 the Scottish government has treated drug misuse as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue. Peter Krykant said he hoped the drug consumption van would cut down on overdoses On the idea of consumption rooms, the UK government responded that: ""We want to do all we can to stop people having access to drugs that could ultimately kill them. No illegal drug-taking can be assumed to be safe and there is no safe way to take them."" They added: ""Our approach on drugs remains clear - we must prevent drug use in our communities, support people through treatment and recovery, and tackle the supply of illegal drugs."" Glasgow City Council has proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city, but the idea has been blocked by the Home Office. Sometimes dubbed ""fix rooms"", the aim would be to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It was hoped the scheme would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. Last week, a recovering heroin addictlaunched a drug consumption van in Glasgow despite warnings it could break the law. Peter Krykant said he hoped it would prevent overdoses and blood-borne viruses among drug users. The committee called for Scotland's drugs crisis to be tackled as a public health issue The cross-party committee currently comprises chairman, SNP MP Pete Wishart, and includes five Conservatives, two Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs. Mr Wishart said this report, which was worked on by the committee when its membership was made up of MPs from the last parliament, was based on one of the most ""extensive drugs inquiries in Scotland ever conducted"". Following the government's response to the report, he said: ""We are surprised and disappointed by the government's almost wholesale rejection of recommendations by a Westminster Select Committee after collecting a substantial body of evidence from people with lived experience, charities and academics, as well as legal, criminal justice and health professionalsâ¦few of these will find comfort in this response."" He also accused the government of providing little evidence to support its stance and called for what evidence there was to be made available following of a drug summit in February. He added: ""What is evident is there's little change in the government's drugs strategy despite the death rate in Scotland from problem drug use remaining stubbornly higher than any country in Europe. ""This fact itself should demonstrate that the current approach isn't working. This is undoubtedly a public health emergency."" All UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was committed to preventing drug use, supporting people through treatment and recovery and tackling the supply of illegal drugs. ""We have no plans to introduce drug consumption rooms or decriminalise drugs. Illegal drugs devastate lives and communities, and dealers should face the full consequences of the law,"" he added. ""We are committed to tackling drug misuse and held aUK-wide drugs summit in Glasgowearlier this year to discuss the most effect ways to tackle drug misuse and their terrible impact across Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland."" The Scottish government has said it welcomes support for the introduction of a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow as part of efforts to reduce deaths there. A spokeswoman said when the report was published in November: ""The outdated Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 should be amended to allow us to implement a range of public health focused responses, including the introduction of safe consumption facilities in Glasgow. ""We call on the incoming UK government to amend the Act or to devolve those powers to Scotland.""

"The Welsh Government has some taxation powers, including over income tax The first minister has not ruled out tax rises during the next Senedd term if Welsh Labour is in power. Mark Drakeford said he would focus on jobs rather than increasing taxes in the early period after the 2021 Senedd election. But he told ITV Wales that beyond that period ""everybody is entitled to make their decisions based on the facts at the time"". The Welsh Government gained powers tovary income taxrates in April 2019. Ministers have stuck to Welsh Labour's 2016 manifesto commitment not to change the tax rates during the five year term. Counsel General Jeremy Miles told Welsh Labour's spring conference in April 2019 that the party shouldcampaign ""unashamedly""to use its income tax varying powers in the next assembly elections. Taxes are expected to be a more prominent issue in next May's election than in the past Speaking on ITV Wales' Sharp End programme, Welsh Labour Leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford set out his stall: ""I don't think increasing taxes in a recession is good economic policy and my anticipation would be that the Labour party will not be proposing that here in Wales. ""In a buoyant economy there are a different set of arguments but at a time when there isn't money in people's pockets, taking money out of those pockets does not make good economic sense. ""We will go in to the [2021 Senedd] election at a very difficult time for the economy and the focus of the Labour manifesto will be on jobs here in Wales. ""Securing jobs that people already have and bringing new jobs for people who would have lost them during the recession. That will be our focus."" ""Tax rises, I do not think will be part of our prescription in that period. Beyond that, I think everybody is entitled to make their decisions based on the facts at the time,"" he added. Welsh income tax powers to take effect Income tax rise for Wales 'not ruled out' In a recent blog onthe Gwydir website,external, Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Nick Ramsay said: ""With the challenges of Covid far from over, and the economic damage yet unknown, it is far too early to make detailed tax and spend commitments for a Welsh Conservative Government."" ""Our long term aim will be to reduce income tax when it is prudent to do so,"" he added. Plaid Cymru told BBC Wales in July it was considering which taxes to raise to pay for some of the policies in their2021 election manifesto. The party is proposing the introduction of free childcare and a weekly Â£35 support payment for children, as well as a national health and care service. Party leader Adam Price said: ""It's important that we're open and honest with the people of Wales."" Brexit Party leader Mark Reckless said: ""Since Wales never had the promised referendum on these [tax raising] powers, I look forward to Mark Drakeford sending them back to Westminster.""

"This video can not be played 'Kids need to understand the harshness of reality', says Tatum Price A mother who lost her 13-year-old son to drugs he bought off Snapchat has welcomed a new safety campaign on the social media app. Carson Price, of Hengoed, Caerphilly county, bought high-strength ecstasy for a few pounds in April last year. He died in hospital after beingfound ""in and out of consciousness, pale and shaking""in a park. His mother, Tatum, said the new ""Fearless"" campaign was a ""positive"" move but more still needed to be done. The video adverts are based on real stories reported to Crimestoppers, around drug use, exploitation and ""county lines"" drugs gangs. Teen died from 'violent reaction' to illegal drug Viral app Yolo raises abuse concerns Snapchat hits nearly 250m daily users They also make it clear how concerns about illegal activity can be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers. ""I think going through social media will target kids better as they're addicted to their phones,"" Tatum Price said. ""If adverts are on TV or a billboard, I don't think they'd take notice - they're just gonna walk past."" But she said more would need to be done on the app to keep children safe. Snapchat has a predominantly young audience Since the coronavirus pandemic outbreak in March, Crimestoppers Wales has engaged with 60,000 young people through Snapchat alone. Last year, it reached 32,000 children on a face-to-face basis in schools and youth groups. Ella Rabaiotti, the national manager for Crimestoppers in Wales, said the adverts on the app have seen more people come forward. ""What we find is when we put those messages out on Snapchat, we will then see an increase in reports to us,"" she said. ""So it's about reminding them that if they have information and they are fearful or worried about coming forward, they can use our anonymous service."" Tatum Price believes anonymous reporting will help more young people come forward Anonymity is something welcomed by Ms Price. She added: ""I think probably the majority of Carson's friends if they knew they could report something anonymously then I think they would. ""They know how Carson's death has affected them, along with the community."" Snapchat has 250 million daily users and its internal figures suggest it is reaching more than 90% of the ""Generation Z"" population in the US, aged 13 to 24, and more than 60% of 13-34-year olds in the UK, France, Canada and Australia. One of its main features is pictures and messages usually being available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. It said in a statement: ""Our guidelines prohibit anyone from using Snapchat to buy or sell illegal drugs. ""We encourage anyone who sees illegal content to use our in-app reporting tools to report it quickly and confidentially. ""We will continue to invest in ways to further improve our response to this activity."" Another service which supports young adults in Wales has also turned digital due to the pandemic. Vibe Youth based in Swansea has been supporting those who may be hard to reach or at risk of social isolation. One of its creators, Karen Carswell, said: ""Young people are particularly suffering at the moment, they're at the risk of isolation, and we've tried our best to be there for them through the lockdown."" Fellow creator Jake Henry said digital has been an important area to focus on. ""I think if we weren't doing what we're doing online and Crimestoppers doing their work too, then you'd have a lot more exploitation and more young people being coerced into doing things which aren't necessarily healthy for them,"" he said. ""It can lead them down a path where criminal justice is involved, so I think it's important even though we're in the middle of a pandemic that we're still there for young people.""

"""Unconscious bias training"" is being scrapped for civil servants in England, with ministers saying it does not work. The training, intended to tackle patterns of discrimination and prejudice, is used in many workplaces. The government says there is no evidence it changes attitudes - and is urging other public sector employers to end this type of training. But race equality campaigner Halima Begum said the government ""mustn't backtrack on anti-racism training"". Lucille Thirlby, assistant general secretary of the FDA civil servants' union, called on ministers to say ""what are you going to replace it with"". ""How will they ensure people are not discriminated against? It's easier to attack something than do something positive about it,"" she said. Prince Harry warns of unconscious bias MPs refuse to take unconscious bias training Implicit bias: Is everyone racist? Unconscious bias training is an attempt to challenge prejudiced ways of thinking that could unfairly influence decisions - such as who might get a job or a promotion. It can be prejudiced behaviour, based on assumptions about others, that people are not aware of themselves. But the government says there is no proof that such training changes behaviour - and that it can ""backfire"" and create a negative response. A written ministerial statement from Cabinet Office minister Julia Lopez will announce ""unconscious bias training does not achieve its intended aims. It will therefore be phased out in the civil service"". ""We encourage other public sector employers to do likewise,"" she says, urging the end to training which has been widely used to address bias in race, gender and sexuality. But it has also been caught up in ""culture war"" arguments and accusations over ""political correctness"". The government says it is ""determined to eliminate discrimination in the workplace"", but unconscious bias training is the wrong approach. The Government Equalities Office says there has been ""no evidence"" that the training improved workplace equality. Among the researchers cited is psychologist Patrick Forscher, who examined more than 400 studies on unconscious bias. He said that few studies measured changes over time, and among ""the most robust of those that did"", the findings suggested ""changes in implicit bias don't last"". Dr Forscher said such training had too often been used by employers as a ""catch all"", which failed to really tackle the specific barriers for different groups. Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, said unconscious bias training is not always effective - and recognised the dangers of a corporate ""diversity industry"" wanting to have ""off the shelf"" training. But she warned the government would have to replace it with something better and further reaching - which addressed bias and ""ingrained views"" at a more ""fundamental level"". Ms Begum said there needed to be structural changes about fair pay, progression and work practices, rather than courses which ""make your boss feel better, but is not going to change the system"". The value of such training was defended by Jane Farrell, chief executive of the EW Group, a diversity and inclusion consultancy. ""There is a misconception that unconscious bias training is guilt inducing and tells people off for who or what they are, which is simply not true,"" she said. ""Great unconscious bias training provides a positive and supportive environment to think through how to ensure we recruit the best staff rather than inadvertently clone ourselves,"" said Ms Farrell. Psychologist and author Stuart Ritchie said even though many staff might be required to take such unconscious bias training there was ""nowhere near robust evidence"" that it was able to change minds or behaviour. Dr Ritchie said firms might use this training to ""placate worries"", but there was a lack of evidence that it would really reduce prejudice. Jonny Gifford, who has worked with firms on diversity and inclusion, said unconscious bias had to be recognised as a ""massive problem"". But Mr Gifford, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned the shortcomings of unconscious bias training should not be used to stop trying to ""make the workplace more inclusive and to reduce barriers to inequality"". ""To dismiss this as political correctness or being 'woke' is a very shaky place to be,"" said Mr Gifford.

"The plan to ease Covid rules over Christmas in the UK is a ""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives"", two leading medical journals have said. The Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal said people might see the lifting of restrictions ""as permission to drop their guard"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove has held talks on the issue with leaders in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. NI said scientific advisers would be consulted ahead of any decision. It comes after Labour called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. Earlier, No 10 said the rules were ""under constant review"" but it still intended to allow families to meet up. The prime minister's spokesman said the government had been clear that people needed to ""remain cautious and vigilant"" duringthe five days of relaxed rules from 23 to 27 December. The BBC's Nick Eardley said,externalone possible change being discussed was a limit on how far people can travel, but he stressed that no decisions had been taken. It comes as millions of people in London and parts of Hertfordshire and Essex prepare to move into England's toughest tier of coronavirus rules at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday. Meanwhile, another 18,450 cases and 506 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK on Tuesday,government figures,externalshowed. How many people can get together at Christmas?

They stressed that demand on the NHS was increasing, and added that a new strain of coronavirus ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene an emergency Cobra meeting to review the Christmas rules. In a letter,external, he acknowledged that people ""want to spend time with their families after this awful year"", but said ""the situation has clearly taken a turn for the worse since the decision about Christmas was taken"". This video can not be played The government needs to ""review"" and ""toughen up"" the planned Christmas virus restrictions, says Sir Keir Starmer. At the end of November, the leaders of the four UK nationsagreed to allow some coronavirus rules to be temporarily relaxedover the festive period. Travel restrictions will be eased to allow up to three households to form a bubble and stay overnight at each other's homes. Ahead of the latest talks, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""a case"" for tightening planned rules over the Christmas period - ""both in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting"". She said coming to a four nations agreement ""would be preferable"", but added: ""If that is not possible then of course we will consider within the Scottish government what we think is appropriate."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said hewould not ""lightly"" put aside the agreementthe four nations have reached, while Northern Ireland's health ministerwould not speculate on potential rule changes ahead of the call. According to a YouGov poll, a majority of people (57%) in Great Britain believe the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions over Christmas should be scrapped. Some 31% said the easing should go ahead as planned, while 12% said they were unsure. When the government announced the relaxation of rules for Christmas, it was hoped cases would be falling right up to the festive period. It was mid-lockdown and with the new tougher system of regional tiers in the pipeline, the hope was that the virus could be contained. That has not turned out to be the case - hence the moving of London and some of the surrounding areas into tier three. As always, the bottom line is the risk to the NHS - so it's worth pointing out that for all the pressure at the moment hospitals still have more beds free than this time last year. The full impact of the festive relaxation is, of course, impossible to predict. The UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has called it a ""modest"" relaxation - after all, in tier three areas hospitality will still be closed for all but takeaways. The judgement that has been made is that the benefits outweigh the costs. Allowing families to come together will be an important boost after such a difficult year, the government believes. What is more, there was a fear the public would just ignore pleas not to mix. But it clearly comes with risks - that's why the public is being asked to exercise caution. This video can not be played What can I do under tier 3 restrictions in England? If the UK's Christmas plans are not changed, BMJ editor in chief Fiona Godlee said ""we will have people sitting in ambulances, we will have people in corridors"" as hospitals become overwhelmed with a surge in Covid patients. Speaking to BBC News, she said: ""On the current trend, if nothing is done, by New Year's Day there will be as many people in hospital with Covid-19 as there were at the peak of the first phase in April. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Tier 3 restrictions 'worst-case scenario' for town ""That's even without the Christmas relaxation - so if you add that on top, and then on top of that the winter pressures that we always see in the NHS at winter, you will see a worrying scenario of people not being able to get the care they need."" She also said England's tiered system is ""not succeeding in what it set out to do"", as case numbers have continued to increase in some areas in the top tiers.

It has already been announced that some 10.8 million people across London, Essex and Hertfordshire will join tier three on Wednesday, bringing the total number of people living under the toughest restrictions to 34 million people - or 61% of England's population. Under tier three - very high alert - rules, pubs and restaurants must close, except for takeaway and delivery, and indoor entertainment venues such as theatres, bowling alleys and cinemas must remain shut.

"The deluge has led to rising floodwaters across parts of northern New South Wales Australian authorities have issued evacuation warnings for low-lying towns in northern New South Wales (NSW) as storms batter the nation's east coast. On Tuesday, emergency officials said they had fielded about 150 calls for help in the past 24 hours. Huge swells pummelled the coasts of NSW and south-east Queensland on Monday, causing major erosion. An already depleted beach at Byron Bay - a popular holiday spot - had all but disappeared, locals said. Authorities said the storm had moved south on Tuesday, bringing the threat of flooding to inland NSW. Byron Bay beach âall but goneâ in Australia storms They told communities around the Tweed River to evacuate on Tuesday, after it burst its banks. Some electricity, internet and other utility networks were also disrupted. Meteorologists say the system has already released an amount of rain similar to a cyclone - about 1,000mm over four days. Australia is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during the nation's summer. Heavy rain affected a 1,000km (620 miles) stretch of Australia's east coast - including Brisbane and the Gold Coast - but was expected to ease late on Tuesday. In one area, Upper Springbook in Queensland, close to a metre of rain had fallen since Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The NSW State Emergency Service said it had carried out 12 flood rescues so far, warning people to stay indoors and avoid driving through floodwaters. Some roads in the area between Tweed Heads and Taree were forced to close due to floods. Heavy rain across northern New South Wales has led to floods and road closures On Monday, authorities in Queensland warned that they had seen ""abnormally high"" tides up to 30cm higher than normal. All beaches in the area have been closed. Officials also recorded 8m-high swells and gale force winds exceeding 104km/h (64 mph) at Byron Bay. About 2,500 calls for emergency assistance have been made across the two states since Thursday, mostly for water damage to homes and for fallen trees and power poles. There have been no confirmed reports of injuries or deaths, but authorities said they were investigating a man's death in a car crash on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. This video can not be played A dog is rescued from under a sea of foam at Byron Bay A La NiÃ±a season is historically associated with increased rainfall and floods in Australia. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events, and floods have been recorded in 12 of the 18 events since 1900. Typically, La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia, says the Bureau of Meteorology. However scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian - whose state was worst-hit in last summer's bushfires - said experts were expecting conditions to be ""worse than what we have seen in quite a number of years"". ""I am hoping what we have seen over the last few days won't be repeated frequently over summer but it could,"" she said on Tuesday. ""I know for many residents in northern NSW, they are used to flooding conditions, but what the bushfire season taught us last year is to expect the unexpected.""

"Life has changed dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There has been an enormous human and financial cost - and its impact has also been felt in many other ways. Four of our correspondents look at the impact of the pandemic in numbers - from cancelled operations to school days lost and a rises in benefit claimants. The most obvious wayto measure the impact of coronavirusis to see how many people have died - and look at how much that figure is above the usual annual total. Between March and the end of November, there were more than 79,000 excess deaths above the five-year average, which were almost exclusively driven by Covid. Not every death linked to Covid is a death that was directly caused by it. But Office for National Statistics analysis shows close to nine in 10 cases in England and Wales have been. And deaths among younger age groups have been relatively rare - the majority of people who have died have been among older age groups. The average age of death is over 80. How deadly is the coronavirus? Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50? Neither have deaths been evenly distributed across the country. London saw a surge in cases first, followed by the north of England, with leaders there suggesting that the first lockdown was lifted too early for them. Now, there are signs the south of England's second wave is growing as the North's recedes. But slice this data up even further and distinct patterns emerge.People from poorer backgrounds,externaland thosefrom ethnic minorities are both,externalat a significantly higher risk of death. Why are more BAME people dying from coronavirus? Deprived areas hit twice as hard by coronavirus Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? There are several complex factors at play, with people from these communities more likely to: Work in jobs where they see the public Live in densely-populated housing Have poorer health, with conditions like diabetes, heart disease, obesity and respiratory problems all more common Covid hasalso disrupted other NHS services,with warnings about people not getting treatment or diagnosis for other conditions. Routine work, including knee and hip replacements, was cancelled in the spring, leading to a growing backlog and more people facing long waits. Cancer services were severely disrupted and activity levels have only recently returned to normal.Macmillan Cancer Support estimates,externalthere may be as many as 50,000 missing diagnoses. And visits to A&E have also fallen by a third since March, compared with the same time last year. Doctors say people were worried about the Covid risk and felt they should not bother the health service. But among those not coming forward were people with the symptoms of heart attacks and minor strokes. A year ago, nobody would have thought police would be telling people sunbathing it is against the law, or that ""mingling"" could be punished with an immediate fine of Â£200. But one of Covid's greatest costs has been the unprecedented restrictions on civil liberties in peacetime. Across the four nations, in the rush to enforce lockdowns and other restrictions, more than 20 pieces of law have come into force that have criminalised otherwise normal behaviour. Most of them were not even debated or voted on by elected politicians. The 27,000 fines, mostly for gatherings, are not evenly spread geographically. Leicester has been under the longest-standing restrictions - yet it has a far lower rate of fines than north-west England which has faced similar challenges. Some of that is down to local policing decisions - not least because many officers are very wary of the long-term impact on community relations if they continually dish out fines. The backlog in the courts is enormous. So much so that there are people now waiting for trial in England, for alleged offences committed in 2018, who may not face a jury until 2022. When the pandemic hit, jury trials were stopped because the courts could not guarantee safe distancing to prevent the risk of the virus spreading. Crest, a crime and justice consultancy,estimates that unless capacity doubles,the backlog of crown court cases, the most serious ones, will be near 200,000 by 2024. The Lord Chief Justice hopesto have 300 crown courts sitting by the new year,external- but that will still be less than the maximum possible. But these enormous delays to justice - affecting defendants, victims and witnesses - are not just down to Covid. England and Wales already had an enormous case backlog because the government had cut the number of days judges could sit. The Ministry of Justice says it is funding 40 additional court rooms - dubbed Nightingale Courts - to help tackle the impact of Covid to family, civil and criminal cases. Schools act as a place of safety and routine for children, providing a structure and certainty to their lives. That has been turned upside down in 2020, with schooling closed then repeatedly interrupted by self-isolation in the autumn term. The headline national figures for secondary attendance have declined, but they don't capture the huge geographical variations in England. In mid-October it fell to 61% in Knowsley on Merseyside, and in early December in Kent's Medway towns, only 42% of pupils were learning in the classroom at one point. The loss of learning and confidence is hard to capture, but will ripple through the education system for many years. Good mental health is vital for children and young people to flourish, butNHS research suggests that during the pandemic,externalit has worsened in England. Both boys and girls were affected, suggesting the uncertainty, loneliness and disruption of this year have taken their toll. The pressure on families worried about their finances, forced to spend time together in lockdown appear to be a factor. Teenage girls reporting mental health difficulties are more likely to have seen an argument at home. More thanhalf a million additional households,externalwith children are claiming universal credit than at the pandemic's start, which is a marker of increased child poverty risks. Schools are reporting a big increase in parents seeking free school meals for their children, although official statistics will not be available until next year. Food poverty and the corrosive impact on children's lives has galvanised schools to organise food banks and grocery deliveries for families in their communities. The shame and stigma around children's hunger has been softened by the high-profile campaigning by footballer Marcus Rashford. The concern led to government support in the form of extending holiday free school meals, extra payments to families living in poverty, or money to local authorities. Who will get free school meals? How many children need free meals? Thewelfare system has seen unprecedented demands,externalthis year, and 5.7 million people are now receiving the main benefit, universal credit. This figure has almost doubled since March. It has coped admirably with the surge in claimants, including handling 1.5 million applications over a four-week period to 9 April. What is universal credit and what else can I claim? Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? It hasn't just processed those claims, it has also increased the speed and accuracy of payments to claimants, and there is understandable pride within the Department for Work and Pensions at what they've achieved. In total, around 6.3% of people in the UK are claiming unemployment welfare, with fears that this will increase moving forward. The largest proportion of people on unemployment benefits remain in areas like the north of England, south Wales and central Scotland. But the pandemic has forced people elsewhere who had never previously needed benefits, to turn to the welfare state. The largest increase in claimants has been in the south of England, which is partly explained by so few claiming unemployment welfare before, making any increases particularly noticeable. When large-scale working from home started. the cleaners, coffee shops, tailors, and dry cleaners used by London's office workers had no work and needed help, through welfare or the furlough scheme. The collapse of the aviation sector saw Gatwick's workforce lose jobs and money.  Add in towns with a strong retail economy, like Guildford, and you can see how coronavirus has wreaked economic havoc in the region. As with children, studies have shown that mental health amongst adults has worsened considerably during 2020,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external Production, data and visualisations by Ben Butcher.

"Having to isolate because of Covid-19 is having a detrimental effect on children's education and well-being, particularly the most vulnerable, warns England's chief inspector of schools. Amanda Spielman says periods of repeated isolation have ""chipped away"" at progress since September's return. She also warns that those arriving at secure children's homes have in effect been put in ""solitary confinement"". Ministers say it a ""national priority"" to keep schools and colleges open. In a set of reports looking at the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on children, the Ofsted boss said: ""Remote education is better than nothing, but it's no substitute for the classroom. Schooling 'completely disrupted' in some areas Lockdown children forget how to use knife and fork Return to school in children's interests - Ofsted ""The problem that schools are continuing to grapple with is how to provide meaningful remote education under two distinct circumstances: bubble isolation and individual isolation. ""Many schools are making real progress with remote provision for bubbles - including live or recorded online lessons - but individuals who are isolating for a fortnight at a time often have a poorer experience. ""Whole bubbles can make some progress through the planned curriculum while they work from home, but many isolated individuals are provided with work that consolidates previous lessons, rather than new material. ""For these children, the loss of learning they experienced in the summer is being repeated."" Ms Spielman says many children are at least six months behind where they should be Ms Spielman said many children are thought to be ""at least six months behind where they should be"". ""And for a significant number of pupils, repeated periods of self-isolation have chipped away at the progress they have been able to make since September."" Ofsted also found that the number of children being home schooled has risen again, with almost three-fifths of schools telling inspectors they had at least one pupil whose parents had removed them from school to be home educated. The watchdog also warns that children with  special educational needs and disability often struggled with the restrictions placed upon them, with many not attending school full-time. ""Remote education was a challenge for some of these children, particularly if their parents were unable to support them,"" said Ms Spielman. ""And when vulnerable children are not at school and are out of sight, they may be at risk of abuse or neglect."" Ms Spielman said youngsters who live in secure children's homes have had a difficult year, as they are ""vulnerable and many are at risk of self-harm"". ""The guidance on Covid security has added another layer of pressure to an already pressurised system. Children arriving at the homes were put into isolation for 14 days. ""In effect, this created a form of solitary confinement - and we learned that this removal from contact had resulted in greater anxiety, an increase in self-harm and, in some cases, physical attacks on staff."" The chief inspector said that while homes were working hard, the use of temporary workers to cover staff having to self-isolate meant there was ""not always the consistency of support that these children need"". A Department for Education spokeswoman said it remained a ""national priority"" to keep schools and colleges open for all. ""Schools and colleges have gone above and beyond to make high-quality remote education available for those times when self-isolation is unavoidable and we remain on course to deliver, by Christmas, half a million devices to schools and councils. ""We have also allocated Â£1bn to schools to support all children to catch up and are offering high-quality tuition - proven to help catch up on three to five months' lost learning - to those who need it most through the National Tutoring Programme."" Ofsted says remote education is no substitute for the classroom Ms Spielman said that while ""there is real optimism that the end is finally in sight for the sort of restrictions that we currently live under"",  there is a long way to go before education and social care return to normal. She added: ""Faced with all of these pressures, the education and social care sectors are showing considerable resilience and creativity to provide children and learners with the best experience they can. ""And all of this is being done against the most challenging backdrop for staff in recent times. ""I would like to record my appreciation for everyone working in education and social care - from child-minders and social workers to teachers and college tutors.""

"At least 10 cases of the new variant have been identified in Wales A new strain of coronavirus which was found to be circulating in England is already present in Wales, the Welsh Government has confirmed. On Monday,the UK government said the variant ""may be associated""with a faster spread in south east England. The Welsh Government said there were at least 10 confirmed cases in Wales and more were expected to be identified. An expert who helps track mutations of the virus said he was ""not especially concerned"" and urged calm. More than 1,000 cases have been recorded across 60 English council areas. New Covid strain: How worried should we be? Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Are coronavirus mutations making it more infectious? Matt Hancock, the UK government minister in charge of the NHS in England, said there was ""nothing to suggest"" it caused worse disease or that vaccines would no longer work. Announcing tougher restrictions inLondon and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire, he said: ""We've currently identified over 1,000 cases with this variant predominantly in the south of England, although cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas. ""We do not know the extent to which this is because of the new variant, but no matter its cause we have to take swift and decisive action which unfortunately is absolutely essential to control this deadly disease while the vaccine is rolled out."" He said the World Health Organization had been notified of the new variant and UK scientists were doing detailed studies. Prof Thomas Connor helps track mutations of the virus Cardiff University Professor Tom Connor, bioinformatics lead at Public Health Wales, said: ""We see numerous numbers of variants accumulating in the population. ""The virus is continually introducing these changes as it progresses."" Most mutations to the genetic code of the virus will have no impact on its risk to the public, he explained, but said it was important to monitor because an increase in the prevalence of a variant could be for a ""biological reason"" such as increased transmissibility. Prof Connor said the new variant - called N501Y - could plausibly reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine because the mutations ""fall within the spike proteins"". ""That's the protein on the outside of the virus that helps it get into cells and actually cause the infection,"" he explained. Wales has seen a rise in cases ahead of Christmas Both the Moderna and Pfizer/Biontech vaccines rely on spike proteins, Prof Connor said. He urged people not to be alarmed and to carry on following advice to observe social distancing, wash your hands and wear a face covering. He added: ""We are potentially moving towards the point where we go from this being a pandemic to an endemic - so a disease which is circulating in the human population and we vaccinate against it every year, for example like we do with influenza."" The Welsh Government reiterated it was ""natural for the virus to mutate"", adding that further sequencing and tracking was taking place. Dr Gill Richardson, who is senior responsible officer for the Covid-19 vaccine in Wales, said: ""Viruses are living beings that change and adapt, and we know that since the original Wuhan virus there [have] actually been 25 mutations. ""It's important to say that at the moment it is not thought to affect the behaviour of the virus at all, and it's not thought to affect the effectiveness of the vaccine."" There is a simple rule for understanding all ""new strain"" or ""new variants"": Ask whether the behaviour of the virus has changed. This is crucial as viruses mutate all the time, it's just what they do. And so far we've been given the ""scare"" but not the ""answer"". Matt Hancock said the new variant of coronavirus ""may be associated"" with the faster spread in the south-east of England. This is not the same as saying it ""is causing"" the rise and Mr Hancock did not say this virus has evolved to spread from person-to-person more readily. New strains can become more common for reasons that have nothing to do with the virus. One explanation for the emergence of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was tourism. So at the moment there are scary headlines everywhere, but still no scientific detail to know how significant this is. The news of the new variant comes as cases continue to rise in Wales. On Monday it was revealedWales was already breaching some of the key indicators used to determine if the country goes into lockdown. First Minister Mark Drakeford said a lockdowncould be introduced after Christmasif rates do not begin to fall. Public Health Wales figures on Monday showed Merthyr Tydfil had the highest case rate in the UK, with 870.3 cases per 100,000 people over the most recent seven days. Eight Welsh counties were among the 10 areas with the highest case rates in the UK.

"Rosalyn applied for universal credit for the first time in April ""I had this feeling of guilt, thinking about people out there that might need it more than me... I felt as though I didn't deserve to be claiming benefits at this age,"" says 23-year old Rosalyn. She had been working as a freelance actor, doing shifts front-of-house in a theatre and also working for an events company to make ends meet. But when lockdown hit, shifts dried up. ""I started using my savings to pay my rent, my bills... everything I'd managed to build up over a couple of years was completely gone in two months."" She wasn't eligible to be furloughed at any of the part-time jobs. In late April, she applied for universal credit for the first time. Rosalyn is now one of the 344,000 young women who are claiming unemployment benefits. According to BBC analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics, that number more than doubled between March and November - with the second biggest percentage rise among any age group. Men aged 30-39 saw the largest increase at 117%. Although there has been a widespread increase in the number of people claiming universal credit or jobseeker's allowance since the start of the pandemic, women under 30 have been particularly hard-hit. Universal credit, the benefit for people out of work or on a low income, has replaced six others, merging them into one payment. It has proved controversial because it can be difficult to work out what you will receive and it usually takes five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving your first payment. Rosalyn, for example, received her first payment after nine weeks, due to problems verifying her identity. After accounting for rent and bills for her London flat-share, she has about Â£100 left each month. ""I usually get the bus to a cheaper supermarket, and try to make sure my food shop per week is Â£15 or less. ""Right now, it's enough to pay my rent and bills, but it's not really enough to live,"" she says. ""It's been tough."" One study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies,externalalso found that young women are disproportionately likely to work in pubs and restaurants, retail and the arts, which have been worst affected by coronavirus lockdowns. ""If I was allowed to work, this is my busiest time of year where I do actually make good money because of the hours that you have to put in,"" says 23-year-old Beth. She quit her university studies in business earlier this year after teaching moved online, and decided to take on more hours at her part-time hospitality job in Newcastle instead. She considered the job ""one of the safest out there"". But as pubs, bars and restaurants shut under England's second national lockdown, Beth was placed on furlough for the second time in 2020. Beth submitted a claim for universal credit after being furloughed for the second time ""I knew how much money I'd been earning from last lockdown, and I realised I was in a bit of trouble."" She moved back into the family home to save on expenses and submitted a universal credit claim in October. Two-thirds of young women claiming benefits this year did so for the very first time, according torecent polling of 4,000 under-30s by the Young Women's Trust charity.,external Beth describes the application process as ""a bit confusing, because it's something that I've never really had to do"". As the local JobCentre at the end of her road was closed, she wasn't sure who to turn to for help. Check if you're eligible: You're not likely to be eligible if your household has more than Â£16,000 in savings, if you're under 18 or in full-time education, but there are some exceptions. It can also affect other benefit payments. Apply as soon as possible: You have to wait five weeks from the date you apply for your first payment. If you will struggle during this time, you can apply for an advance loan to help. Get your documents ready: You'll need information on your income, savings, housing situation - like your tenancy agreement - and any childcare costs. You'll also need to submit your bank account details. Set aside some time: Most people apply for universal credit online, but you can apply by telephone. A typical claim can take 40 minutes to an hour. Be aware of your claimant commitment: There are sometimes job-seeking requirements for people on Universal Credit, but it depends on your circumstances. Tasks could include writing a CV or setting up job alerts. Source: Citizens Advice Citizens Advice told the BBC it had given more than 31,000 young women advice on universal credit since 23 March. ""Some seven in 10 seeking our support on benefits had never come to us before, showing the scale of this crisis,"" said the charity's interim chief executive, Alistair Cromwell. ""That includes thousands of young people, many of whom saw their jobs in retail and hospitality vanish practically overnight, but still had to make the rent and pay their bills."" Danielle Owen navigated the system with a bit more ease, thanks to her experience in HR. The 27-year-old from Swindon was furloughed from her recruitment job at an international company, and was eventually made redundant in July. Danielle applied for more than 300 jobs, having been made redundant in July ""I didn't have a huge amount of savings behind me. Given the current situation, I decided that it was probably best to look into it straight away."" She receives Â£408 per month in universal credit, which leaves her with Â£7 spare after paying her mortgage. She is paying for bills and food using her redundancy pay-out, until she starts in a new role next year - after more than 300 job applications. But Danielle questioned whether she should put in a claim, although the pandemic gave her little choice: ""There is definitely a stigma around claiming benefits. ""I've always worked and the only time I hadn't, I was in education - basically to get the job that I had. ""I was so proud of the career I had built up, and I just had to let that pride go,"" she says. Recent research from poverty charity Turn2Us foundthat the stigma around claiming benefits has become more pronounced. One in four people surveyed in April said they believed claimants should be ashamed, up from one in 10 of those asked in 2012. ""I've had a lot of friends make comments, telling me that at my age I should be working,"" says Beth. ""But I never thought I would be in the position where I had to claim benefits. It was the stereotype growing up, and I always wanted to achieve something."" What is universal credit - and what other benefits are available? 'I didn't want to tell anyone I was claiming benefits' With unemployment set to rise further, growing numbers of young women who are accessing benefits for the first time are likely to continue to feel worried for the future. ""We know people have been impacted in different ways during this pandemic and our 'Plan for Jobs' offers a wide range of support that can be individually tailored,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said. They also pointed towards the Kickstart scheme, which offers work placements to 16-24 year olds on universal credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. But for those in immediate need, Rosalyn urges them to put aside negative thoughts and comments. ""There comes a point when you have to put yourself first, which is something that women don't always do. ""Put yourself, your shelter and your food first.""

"There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, official figures show. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail, according to the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. While there have been significant job losses in other sectors such as aviation and manufacturing, hospitality has been the most affected by coronavirus restrictions this year. Bars and restaurants had to close for months during the first lockdown, and have faced strict compliance rules and further shutdowns since then. Thousands remain closed in areas covered by tier 3 restrictions and the industry will suffer even more when London - a hive of hospitality firms - enters the highest alert level on Wednesday. ""It you look at the number of people losing their jobs, the number of people on furlough and the vacancies available for people looking for jobs in the hospitality sector, all that adds up to a very difficult time for that industry,"" the ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, told the BBC's Today programme. Industry body UK Hospitality called the move to place London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire into tier 3 ""illogical"", despite the recent surge in infections. ""The spread is being predominantly driven through schools... yet, once again, it is hospitality that will take the hit,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""So many pubs, restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels, having invested so much to make their venues safe, are only just clinging on by the skin of their teeth."" Ana Grillo is looking for work in marketing and publishing Ana Grillo graduated in September but has been unable to find work since, despite having made applying for roles her ""full time job"". ""It's extremely overwhelming, especially in a pandemic as there's not as many people to turn to for support,"" she told the BBC. She is looking for work in marketing or publishing but says the competition is intense - so much so she tries to submit applications within an hour of an advert being published. ""Some employers make us very aware that they are overwhelmed so they are just going to take the first bunch,"" she said. Having largely supported herself through university, living back at home with her parents has made her feel a ""bit of burden"". ""I've been independent for three years and now I feel completely helpless. But I have no choice."" Redundancies hit a record 370,000 in the three months to October, according to the ONS, although this began to ease towards the end of the period. But the figures pre-date the November lockdown and unemployment is excepted to continue to rise, peaking at a rate of 9.7% this year, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The latest data confirms that coronavirus continues to weigh heavily on the UK labour market. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""While the furlough scheme will help safeguard many jobs over the winter months, with businesses facing the prospect of further restrictions and a messy end to the Brexit transition period, major job losses remain probable in the near term."" The jobs numbers are again grim over the course of the pandemic with 819,000 fewer employees on payrolls since February. But without extension of the furlough scheme to March they would have been even more concerning. The official headline unemployment rate is up only a little at 4.9%. But for most of October it was above 5%. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? These numbers reflect mainly the period before the second national lockdown. And for the first time they are broken down by industry. Well over half of the lost employees during the pandemic have been in hospitality and retail, 456,837 out of 819,000. Health and social care have seen an extra 74,342 jobs. While some optimism has emerged from the prospect of a functioning vaccine, the next few months are likely to remain very challenging, with unemployment continuing to rise. Those rises continue to be contained by the furlough scheme. Many companies began to cut jobs in anticipation of the end of the furlough wage support scheme, which was originally meant to finish on 31 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the scheme until March as the second England lockdown began last month, but some argue he should have moved sooner. Commenting on the latest figures, Mr Sunak said the government had provided Â£280bn of support, including protecting more than nine million jobs through the furlough scheme and offering loans, grants and tax cuts to business. He added: ""But we know that, sadly, many people are already facing unemployment. That's why our Plan for Jobs is also helping to create new jobs, including through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme and expanded apprenticeships and traineeships."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the chancellor's ""irresponsible decisions"" had cost jobs and left the UK with the ""worst recession of any major economy"". ""It's no coincidence that redundancies rocketed to record levels when the clock was ticking down to the chancellor's furlough cliff edge and rising employer contributions were putting businesses under pressure. ""Employers can't afford to wait until the last minute again for this chancellor to decide what happens to the furlough scheme at the end of January. They need clarity now.""

Realising his sport was in danger with little funding and no travel, he bought a van and toured the US, filming his flights in remote locations. Wolfgang noticed a huge reaction to his videos, with people who were in lockdown saying that it allowed them to momentarily leave their homes and experience the sport. He hopes to return to competitions and instructing in 2021, but for now, he's continuing to promote the sport. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There are no plans to change regulations covering Christmas in England, the BBC understands. Talks with devolved administrations - that have been taking place this evening - will continue tomorrow and it's still hoped a common approach can be agreed. There is likely to be tougher guidance in the coming days to reflect the current situation. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have said they will co-ordinate the start of their vaccination campaigns. They pledged to rapidly share information on how vaccination was proceeding, Reuters reports, quoting a joint statement by the countries' health ministries. In Germany, there is growing impatience that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - developed by German scientists and currently being rolled out in the UK and US - has yet to be approved for use in the European Union, says the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin. It was reported earlier thatEurope's medicines regulator EMA will meet sooner than had been planned to consider approving a vaccine. Vaccination programmes are under way in the UK with the Pfizer vaccine, but the approval of a second jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is eagerly awaited. The UK has ordered 100m doses and regulators are assessing its safety and efficacy - how well it works. It is in the last stage of assessment by MHRAafter the government asked it to analyse a final set of data on 27 November.

So we've been hearing tonight about the call between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and the leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on what to do about Christmas. The joint plans to ease Covid restrictions for a few days over the festive period have been discussed. No decisions were made tonight, and further talks on the possible easing of rules around meeting up in the UK will take place on Wednesday. A government source said there was ""recognition a commitment has been made to people"" in the existing plans, but also that there's a need to be ""stronger and clearer in guidance and messaging"". Travel was discussed, the source added. Read more here. Turkey has recorded 235 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours - the highest number since the outbreak began.

The source said there were discussions on travel over the Christmas period, but no decisions were made. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expects to authorise Moderna's vaccine sometime this week, US media report. This means that by Monday, there could be two Covid vaccines available for Americans. The Moderna vaccine can be shipped at -20C, while the jab from Pfizer/BioNTech must be kept at a trickier -70C. The US has agreed to purchase 200m doses of the jab, and 6m could be ready to ship as soon as the vaccine gets FDA approval. The vaccines will be provided at no cost to Americans. In Canada, the government plans to get two million Moderna doses by March. On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 168,000 doses should be available before the end of the month. The country is also expecting 200,000 more Pfizer vaccines by next week. The UK has already pre-ordered 7m doses of the Moderna jab and 40m of the Pfizer/BioNTech version. Also on Tuesday, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for the US' first fully at-home Covid-19 test. Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the tests can be sold in chemists and patients will be able to get results ""in as little as 20 minutes"".

Testing companies have faced problems meeting demand from travellers The new testing system intended to cut quarantine times for travellers arriving in England has facedproblems on its first day, with one company asking to withdraw from the programme. Travellers are now allowed to end self-isolation early if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative five days after arriving. The government picked 11 firms to carry out the private tests, but a number have hit problems. One company, SameDayDoctor, has asked to be withdrawn from the programme. It posted a message on its website saying it has been ""so overwhelmed"" with requests for test-to-release that it cannot answer any more emails or take any more bookings. Downing Street says it is working to approve more test providers. BBC Radio 5 Live All day on 5 live, listeners are sharing theirstories about Covid. Mike Jones is the violence reduction lead for South Western Ambulance Service, where there has been a sharp increase in assaults on paramedics.

Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts who identified thenew variant of Covid that appears to be spreading fast in some parts of Englandsay the infection is probably home-grown rather than imported. Prof Nick Loman, an expert in microbiology from the University of Birmingham and part of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (CoG), says it seems to have appeared spontaneously ""out of nowhere"" in late September. The small number of cases soon grew to many more and got the experts concerned. So far, 1,000 confirmed cases have been discovered in the UK. They are predominantly in the south of England, but cases have been identified in nearly 60 different local authority areas, including parts of Scotland and Wales. Prof Loman says as well as the ""striking growth"" on a wide geographical scale the ""sheer number of mutations"" - 17 in total - that made up the variant was more than they expected to see and set alarm bells ringing. While ""none of those things are smoking guns"", he says there is ""sufficient circumstantial evidence to think this is something that urgently needs following up"". The CoG team says, as yet, there is nothing to suggest the new variant causes worse disease or that Covid vaccines would no longer work. And it will take weeks to monitor whether it might truly be more infective than other versions of Covid. In that space of time, there's also a chance the new variant could burn itself out and disappear as quickly as it arrived. A majority of people think ministers should abandon plans to relax the coronavirus rules over Christmas, an opinion poll suggests. In a survey of 3,856 adults in Great Britain by YouGov, 57% said the current restrictions should be maintained, with 31% supporting the plan to relax the rules. Older people appeared to be more strongly in favour of tighter restrictions, with 70% of over-65s saying the temporary relaxation should be scrapped, and 61% among those aged between 50 and 65. It comes as urgent talks are taking place between the leaders of the devolved administrations and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove - to discuss the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over Christmas.

"Craig McLachlan is a veteran of the Australian entertainment industry Australian actor Craig McLachlan has been found not guilty of allegations that he assaulted four women during a Melbourne stage show. Mr McLachlan, 55, had consistently denied seven charges of indecent assault and six of common assault. The allegations arose from a 2014 production of The Rocky Horror Show, in which the veteran actor played the lead role of Frank-N-Furter. A magistrate handed down the ruling on Tuesday, clearing him of all charges. In her decision, Magistrate Belinda Wallington said the women were ""brave and honest witnesses"" but their accounts of alleged incidents - including one accusation that Mr McLachlan had tickled the inner-thigh of a woman on stage - were not enough to prove intent. ""I'm unable to exclude the possibility that an egotistical, self-entitled sense of humour led the accused to genuinely think that â¦ [she] was consenting to his actions,"" she said, according to the ABC. The trial had heard allegations that Mr McLachlan had kissed one woman without her consent, and inappropriately touched another on other occasions. Mr McLachlan strenuously denied the accusations and told the court in November that hugs and kisses between performers was common practice in showbusiness. He said any inappropriate touching on stage ""could only have been accidental"". Speaking to media in Sydney after the verdict, Mr McLachlan thanked his legal team for their ""exceptional"" efforts. ""We have maintained a dignified and respectful silence for the past almost three years and put our trust in the law. And here we are today,"" he said. After the women's allegations were first published, Mr McLachlan began defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and a former co-star. That case was delayed but is now expected to resume. Internationally, Mr McLachlan is best known for his role as Henry Ramsay in the television soap Neighbours, appearing in more than 800 episodes. He later joined the cast of Home and Away. He also had a brief pop career - his band's cover of the song Mona reached number 2 in the UK charts in 1990.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring?

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs. At the start of the pandemic it was feared that more than one in 10 workers would become unemployed. Instead the unemployment rate is currently less than one in 20. VACCINE:When will I get my jab?

"There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, official figures show. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail, according to the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. While there have been significant job losses in other sectors such as aviation and manufacturing, hospitality has been the most affected by coronavirus restrictions this year. Bars and restaurants had to close for months during the first lockdown, and have faced strict compliance rules and further shutdowns since then. Thousands remain closed in areas covered by tier 3 restrictions and the industry will suffer even more when London - a hive of hospitality firms - enters the highest alert level on Wednesday. ""It you look at the number of people losing their jobs, the number of people on furlough and the vacancies available for people looking for jobs in the hospitality sector, all that adds up to a very difficult time for that industry,"" the ONS's director of economic statistics, Darren Morgan, told the BBC's Today programme. Industry body UK Hospitality called the move to place London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire into tier 3 ""illogical"", despite the recent surge in infections. ""The spread is being predominantly driven through schools... yet, once again, it is hospitality that will take the hit,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""So many pubs, restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels, having invested so much to make their venues safe, are only just clinging on by the skin of their teeth."" Ana Grillo is looking for work in marketing and publishing Ana Grillo graduated in September but has been unable to find work since, despite having made applying for roles her ""full time job"". ""It's extremely overwhelming, especially in a pandemic as there's not as many people to turn to for support,"" she told the BBC. She is looking for work in marketing or publishing but says the competition is intense - so much so she tries to submit applications within an hour of an advert being published. ""Some employers make us very aware that they are overwhelmed so they are just going to take the first bunch,"" she said. Having largely supported herself through university, living back at home with her parents has made her feel a ""bit of burden"". ""I've been independent for three years and now I feel completely helpless. But I have no choice."" Redundancies hit a record 370,000 in the three months to October, according to the ONS, although this began to ease towards the end of the period. But the figures pre-date the November lockdown and unemployment is excepted to continue to rise, peaking at a rate of 9.7% this year, according to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent forecaster. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""The latest data confirms that coronavirus continues to weigh heavily on the UK labour market. How high could the unemployment rate go? ""While the furlough scheme will help safeguard many jobs over the winter months, with businesses facing the prospect of further restrictions and a messy end to the Brexit transition period, major job losses remain probable in the near term."" The jobs numbers are again grim over the course of the pandemic with 819,000 fewer employees on payrolls since February. But without extension of the furlough scheme to March they would have been even more concerning. The official headline unemployment rate is up only a little at 4.9%. But for most of October it was above 5%. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? These numbers reflect mainly the period before the second national lockdown. And for the first time they are broken down by industry. Well over half of the lost employees during the pandemic have been in hospitality and retail, 456,837 out of 819,000. Health and social care have seen an extra 74,342 jobs. While some optimism has emerged from the prospect of a functioning vaccine, the next few months are likely to remain very challenging, with unemployment continuing to rise. Those rises continue to be contained by the furlough scheme. Many companies began to cut jobs in anticipation of the end of the furlough wage support scheme, which was originally meant to finish on 31 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the scheme until March as the second England lockdown began last month, but some argue he should have moved sooner. Commenting on the latest figures, Mr Sunak said the government had provided Â£280bn of support, including protecting more than nine million jobs through the furlough scheme and offering loans, grants and tax cuts to business. He added: ""But we know that, sadly, many people are already facing unemployment. That's why our Plan for Jobs is also helping to create new jobs, including through our Â£2bn Kickstart scheme and expanded apprenticeships and traineeships."" But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the chancellor's ""irresponsible decisions"" had cost jobs and left the UK with the ""worst recession of any major economy"". ""It's no coincidence that redundancies rocketed to record levels when the clock was ticking down to the chancellor's furlough cliff edge and rising employer contributions were putting businesses under pressure. ""Employers can't afford to wait until the last minute again for this chancellor to decide what happens to the furlough scheme at the end of January. They need clarity now.""

"This video can not be played Joe Biden, speaking earlier in December after his election victory was confirmed Joe Biden has said it is ""time to turn the page"" after his presidential election victory was confirmed by the US electoral college. In a speech after the announcement, he said US democracy had been ""pushed, tested and threatened"" and ""proved to be resilient, true and strong"". He condemned President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the result. Later Russian President Vladimir Putin became one of the last world leaders to congratulate Mr Biden on his victory. Moscow had said it would wait for the official results before doing so. Most other national leaders contacted Mr Biden days after the vote on 3 November. Confirmation by the electoral college was one of the steps required for Mr Biden to take office. Under the US system, voters actually cast their ballots for ""electors"", who in turn formally vote for candidates after the election. Democrat Joe Biden won November's contest with 306 electoral college votes to Republican Donald Trump's 232. The people who ultimately pick the US president Can Trump still challenge the result? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? President Trump, who shows few signs of conceding, has not commented. Shortly after the electoral college's vote,he announced on Twitter the departure of Attorney General William Barr,who had said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election, despite the president's claims. Speaking in Delaware, Mr Biden praised ""ordinary men and women"" who had refused to be bullied, referring to the president's efforts to question and overturn the results, involving legal challenges which have been rejected by courts across the country. He described the efforts as ""a position so extreme we've never seen it before"". ""Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even when we find those results hard to accept,"" he said. ""The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago,"" he added. ""And we know that nothing not even a pandemic or an abuse of power can extinguish that flame."" Mr Biden said it was time to ""turn the page, as we've done throughout our history, to unite, to heal"". But he warned that, with the coronavirus pandemic continuing to ravage the US, there would be difficult months ahead. ""There is urgent work in front of us,"" he said. ""Getting this pandemic under control and getting the nation vaccinated against this virus."" He stressed the importance of immediate economic help that was ""so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today"" and rebuilding the economy to be ""better than it ever was"". He was speaking as the Covid death toll in the US - the country worst affected by the virus - rose above 300,000. Normally the electors do not get that much attention but this year, after uncertainty generated by a raft of challenges to results in Democrat-won states by the Trump campaign, the state-by-state vote was in the spotlight. Solidly Democrat California, with its 55 electors, was one of the last states to voteon Monday and took Mr Biden across the 270-vote threshold required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Electoral college affirms Joe Biden as president-elect Heightened security had been put in place in some states, including Michigan and Georgia, ahead of voting, which took place in state capitals and Washington DC. In Michigan - a key swing state Mr Biden won - legislative offices in the state capital Lansing were closed due to ""credible"" threats of violence. The vote at the capitol building went ahead peacefully although a group of Republicans tried to enter the building to hold their own vote and were turned away. This video can not be played The president of the United States is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college In his speech, Mr Biden described the harassment of officials following the election as ""unconscionable"" and said: ""It's my sincere hope we never again see anyone subjected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this election."" He also noted that he had the same number of electoral college votes that Mr Trump said was a ""landslide"" when he won in 2016. Mr Biden emphasised that he had also won the popular vote, something Mr Trump failed to clinch four years ago. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander said: ""The presidential election is over.,externalStates have certified the votes. Courts have resolved disputes. The electors have voted. I hope that President Trump will put the country first, take pride in his considerable accomplishments, and help president-elect Biden get off to a good start."" This video can not be played Can you explain the electoral college in 10 seconds? The quadrennial meeting of the US electoral college is usually a formality along the way to a presidential inauguration - a vestigial political event that long ago lost its power and relevance. Donald Trump's scorched-earth strategy of contesting the results of the 2020 election, however, gave the proceedings new attention. His legal team has had little success in challenging the results in multiple battleground states and the official recording of the electoral college ballots effectively lowered the curtain on these long-shot judicial manoeuvres. That does not mean the Trump team is giving up, of course. They will continue with futile court challenges and, eventually, ask Congress to overturn the election results. It is an alternative reality that Donald Trump's supporters may find more comforting than the one where Joe Biden is president-elect. Given that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, the official electoral college tally has been duly certified by the states and federal law is on Mr Biden's side, Mr Trump's chances of success in the real world, however, sit squarely at zero. The results of the voting process will be sent to Washington DC and formally counted in a joint session of Congress on 6 January presided over by Vice-President Mike Pence. That will pave the way for Joe Biden to be sworn in as president on 20 January. Last month, President Trump said he would leave office in January if Mr Biden were affirmed as the election winner by the electoral college. Nevertheless, he has continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Most Republicans have stood behind Mr Trump in his efforts to overturn the result, but some have broken ranks in recent weeks. One Michigan congressman, Paul Mitchell, announced he was leaving the party weeks before his retirement in protest over what he said was its failure to accept that the election process was over.

"The plan to ease Covid rules over Christmas in the UK is a ""rash decision"" that will ""cost many lives"", two leading medical journals have said. The Health Service Journal and British Medical Journal said people might see the lifting of restrictions ""as permission to drop their guard"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove has held talks on the issue with leaders in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. NI said scientific advisers would be consulted ahead of any decision. It comes after Labour called on ministers to hold an emergency review of the plans. Earlier, No 10 said the rules were ""under constant review"" but it still intended to allow families to meet up. The prime minister's spokesman said the government had been clear that people needed to ""remain cautious and vigilant"" duringthe five days of relaxed rules from 23 to 27 December. The BBC's Nick Eardley said,externalone possible change being discussed was a limit on how far people can travel, but he stressed that no decisions had been taken. It comes as millions of people in London and parts of Hertfordshire and Essex prepare to move into England's toughest tier of coronavirus rules at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene an emergency Cobra meeting to review the Christmas rules.

At the end of November, the leaders of the four UK nationsagreed to allow some coronavirus rules to be temporarily relaxedover the festive period. Travel restrictions will be eased to allow up to three households to form a bubble and stay overnight at each other's homes. Ahead of the latest talks, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""a case"" for tightening planned rules over the Christmas period - ""both in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting"". She said coming to a four nations agreement ""would be preferable"", but added: ""If that is not possible then of course we will consider within the Scottish government what we think is appropriate."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said hewould not ""lightly"" put aside the agreementthe four nations have reached, while Northern Ireland's health ministerwould not speculate on potential rule changes ahead of the call. According to a YouGov poll, a majority of people (57%) in Great Britain believe the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions over Christmas should be scrapped. Some 31% said the easing should go ahead as planned, while 12% said they were unsure. When the government announced the relaxation of rules for Christmas, it was hoped cases would be falling right up to the festive period. It was mid-lockdown and with the new tougher system of regional tiers in the pipeline, the hope was that the virus could be contained. That has not turned out to be the case - hence the moving of London and some of the surrounding areas into tier three. As always, the bottom line is the risk to the NHS - so it's worth pointing out that for all the pressure at the moment hospitals still have more beds free than this time last year. The full impact of the festive relaxation is, of course, impossible to predict. The UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty has called it a ""modest"" relaxation - after all, in tier three areas hospitality will still be closed for all but takeaways. The judgement that has been made is that the benefits outweigh the costs. Allowing families to come together will be an important boost after such a difficult year, the government believes. What is more, there was a fear the public would just ignore pleas not to mix. But it clearly comes with risks - that's why the public is being asked to exercise caution.

"Craig McLachlan is a veteran of the Australian entertainment industry Australian actor Craig McLachlan has been found not guilty of allegations that he assaulted four women during a Melbourne stage show. Mr McLachlan, 55, had consistently denied seven charges of indecent assault and six of common assault. The allegations arose from a 2014 production of The Rocky Horror Show, in which the veteran actor played the lead role of Frank-N-Furter. A magistrate handed down the ruling on Tuesday, clearing him of all charges. In her decision, Magistrate Belinda Wallington said the women were ""brave and honest witnesses"" but their accounts of alleged incidents - including one accusation that Mr McLachlan had tickled the inner-thigh of a woman on stage - were not enough to prove intent. ""I'm unable to exclude the possibility that an egotistical, self-entitled sense of humour led the accused to genuinely think that â¦ [she] was consenting to his actions,"" she said, according to the ABC. The trial had heard allegations that Mr McLachlan had kissed one woman without her consent, and inappropriately touched another on other occasions. Mr McLachlan strenuously denied the accusations and told the court in November that hugs and kisses between performers was common practice in showbusiness. He said any inappropriate touching on stage ""could only have been accidental"". Speaking to media in Sydney after the verdict, Mr McLachlan thanked his legal team for their ""exceptional"" efforts. ""We have maintained a dignified and respectful silence for the past almost three years and put our trust in the law. And here we are today,"" he said. After the women's allegations were first published, Mr McLachlan began defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and a former co-star. That case was delayed but is now expected to resume. Internationally, Mr McLachlan is best known for his role as Henry Ramsay in the television soap Neighbours, appearing in more than 800 episodes. He later joined the cast of Home and Away. He also had a brief pop career - his band's cover of the song Mona reached number 2 in the UK charts in 1990.

"Robotic gliders will be used to gather measurements under and around the iceberg A team of scientists is being sent to the South Atlantic to study the giant iceberg A68a. The 3,900-sq-km behemoth is currently drifting offshore of the British Overseas Territory ofSouth Georgia,externalwhere it threatens to run aground. If that happens it could make life extremely difficult for the wildlife haven's penguins and seals as they go about foraging for fish and krill. TheBritish Antarctic Survey,external(BAS) will lead the expedition. This video can not be played Watch: The RAF flies over iceberg A68a RAF cameras capture world's biggest iceberg World's biggest iceberg is fraying at its edges Giant iceberg splits from Antarctic The researchers will approach A68a in the Royal Research Ship James Cook. They'll use robotic underwater vehicles and sampling instruments to see how the frozen mass is influencing its environment. Big bergs change the temperature of the sea around them and introduce huge volumes of fresh water as they melt. This affects conditions for all marine life - from the simplest planktonic organisms all the way up to the biggest creatures in the ocean, the whales. The RRS James Cook will deploy the gliders and sample the waters around South Georgia A68 broke free from the Larsen C sectorof Antarctica in 2017 and has been steadily moving north, away from the White Continent, ever since. Recent months and weeks have seen it lose a lot of its bulk, so much so that it's just surrendered the title of the ""world's biggest iceberg"". Nonetheless, its scale (roughly now the size of the English county of Suffolk) remains intimidating, especially when seen in satellite images moving only 90km from South Georgia's coast. The researchers hope to be on site at the end of January. They'll deploy two untethered submersible gliders that will spend almost four months in and around A68a. ""We'll probably put one each end of the berg,"" said BAS oceanographer Dr Povl Abrahamsen. ""They'll monitor seawater temperature and salinity, and collect measurements of chlorophyll concentration; and backscatter - essentially how clear the water is or isn't. ""We'll be deploying the gliders but they'll actually be piloted from the UK, by teams at the National Oceanography Centre and at BAS,"" he told BBC News. The chlorophyll data will give an indication of how many phytoplankton are in the water. These organisms are right at the base of the food chain. They're eaten by the small crustaceans krill, which in turn are eaten by the territory's key predators. ""It's quite an efficient system around South Georgia,"" said BAS ecologist Prof Geraint Tarling. ""Unlike in more temperate and tropical regions where you have quite an intricate food chain, at South Georgia the phytoplankton go straight into the krill, which go straight into the penguins, seals and whales. It's a short chain. So, if we see changes in the phytoplankton, we'll almost inevitably see effects further up."" The berg currently is running in a fast-moving stream of water called the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, or SACCF. As this flow encounters the continental shelf at South Georgia, it turns to the southeast; and it does appear as though A68a has turned with it in the past day or so. The expectation is that the SACCF will take the block in a loop around the island, but there is always the risk that the berg's keel will catch somewhere in shallower waters. Originally some 5,800 sq km in size, A68a is now about 3,900 sq km The depth of A68a below the waterline is about 200m,confirms Dr Stef Lhermitte,externalfrom Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. He's just checked this with data from the American IceSat-2 spacecraft. The US space agency mission carries a laser altimeter to measure the elevation of floating ice above the sea surface. Once you know this height (31-38m), some reasonably straightforward calculations will give you a value for the draught - the hidden, submerged part of the berg. ""That thickness is similar to the front of Larsen C before the iceberg calved,""observed Dr Rob Larter,externalfrom BAS. ""There will not have been much basal melting because at around 200m depth, the base will be in the 'winter water', the coldest part of the Southern Ocean water column."" The berg came from a part of the Antarctic where it is still very cold - the Larsen C Ice Shelf. This is a mass of floating ice formed by glaciers that have flowed down off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula into the ocean. On entering the water, the glaciers' buoyant fronts lift up and join together to make a single protrusion. The calving of bergs at the forward edge of this shelf is a very natural behaviour. The shelf likes to maintain an equilibrium and the ejection of bergs is one way it balances the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land. Larsen C calves big bergs like A68 on decadal timescales. One of the worst places for A68a to anchor itself would be just to the southeast of South Georgia. This could then interfere with the flow of krill in the SACCF along the northern edge of the continental shelf, making it harder for the penguins and seals to find the food resource they need to support themselves and their young. It may not come to this, of course. A68a could simply keep on moving past South Georgia. And Prof Ted Scambos from the University of Colorado, Boulder, US, says we should also be on alert for the possibility of a ""spectacular disintegration"" of the berg. He points to the ""ice foot"" that is developing around the block. This is an underwater bulge that can be seen in high-resolution satellite images as lighter-coloured water at the base of the berg's cliff faces. It is caused by increased melting at the waterline due to wave erosion and warmer surface waters. According to Prof Scambos, the ice foot introduces buoyancy stresses in the berg and when this is coupled with meltwater forcing its way down into major crevices and fissures, the possibility exists for catastrophic failure. ""Once flooded with meltwater, the berg may suddenly appear to 'spread out' as thousands of pieces calve and topple into the ocean,"" he said. The ""foot"" is seen as lighter-coloured water at the base of the berg's cliff faces Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Joe Biden, speaking earlier in December after his election victory was confirmed Joe Biden has said it is ""time to turn the page"" after his presidential election victory was confirmed by the US electoral college. In a speech after the announcement, he said US democracy had been ""pushed, tested and threatened"" and ""proved to be resilient, true and strong"". He condemned President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the result. Later Russian President Vladimir Putin became one of the last world leaders to congratulate Mr Biden on his victory. Moscow had said it would wait for the official results before doing so. Most other national leaders contacted Mr Biden days after the vote on 3 November. Confirmation by the electoral college was one of the steps required for Mr Biden to take office. Under the US system, voters actually cast their ballots for ""electors"", who in turn formally vote for candidates after the election. Democrat Joe Biden won November's contest with 306 electoral college votes to Republican Donald Trump's 232. The people who ultimately pick the US president Can Trump still challenge the result? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? President Trump, who shows few signs of conceding, has not commented. Shortly after the electoral college's vote,he announced on Twitter the departure of Attorney General William Barr,who had said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election, despite the president's claims. Speaking in Delaware, Mr Biden praised ""ordinary men and women"" who had refused to be bullied, referring to the president's efforts to question and overturn the results, involving legal challenges which have been rejected by courts across the country. He described the efforts as ""a position so extreme we've never seen it before"". ""Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even when we find those results hard to accept,"" he said. ""The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago,"" he added. ""And we know that nothing not even a pandemic or an abuse of power can extinguish that flame."" Mr Biden said it was time to ""turn the page, as we've done throughout our history, to unite, to heal"". But he warned that, with the coronavirus pandemic continuing to ravage the US, there would be difficult months ahead. ""There is urgent work in front of us,"" he said. ""Getting this pandemic under control and getting the nation vaccinated against this virus."" He stressed the importance of immediate economic help that was ""so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today"" and rebuilding the economy to be ""better than it ever was"". He was speaking as the Covid death toll in the US - the country worst affected by the virus - rose above 300,000. Normally the electors do not get that much attention but this year, after uncertainty generated by a raft of challenges to results in Democrat-won states by the Trump campaign, the state-by-state vote was in the spotlight. Solidly Democrat California, with its 55 electors, was one of the last states to voteon Monday and took Mr Biden across the 270-vote threshold required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Electoral college affirms Joe Biden as president-elect Heightened security had been put in place in some states, including Michigan and Georgia, ahead of voting, which took place in state capitals and Washington DC. In Michigan - a key swing state Mr Biden won - legislative offices in the state capital Lansing were closed due to ""credible"" threats of violence. The vote at the capitol building went ahead peacefully although a group of Republicans tried to enter the building to hold their own vote and were turned away. This video can not be played The president of the United States is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college In his speech, Mr Biden described the harassment of officials following the election as ""unconscionable"" and said: ""It's my sincere hope we never again see anyone subjected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this election."" He also noted that he had the same number of electoral college votes that Mr Trump said was a ""landslide"" when he won in 2016. Mr Biden emphasised that he had also won the popular vote, something Mr Trump failed to clinch four years ago. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander said: ""The presidential election is over.,externalStates have certified the votes. Courts have resolved disputes. The electors have voted. I hope that President Trump will put the country first, take pride in his considerable accomplishments, and help president-elect Biden get off to a good start."" This video can not be played Can you explain the electoral college in 10 seconds? The quadrennial meeting of the US electoral college is usually a formality along the way to a presidential inauguration - a vestigial political event that long ago lost its power and relevance. Donald Trump's scorched-earth strategy of contesting the results of the 2020 election, however, gave the proceedings new attention. His legal team has had little success in challenging the results in multiple battleground states and the official recording of the electoral college ballots effectively lowered the curtain on these long-shot judicial manoeuvres. That does not mean the Trump team is giving up, of course. They will continue with futile court challenges and, eventually, ask Congress to overturn the election results. It is an alternative reality that Donald Trump's supporters may find more comforting than the one where Joe Biden is president-elect. Given that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, the official electoral college tally has been duly certified by the states and federal law is on Mr Biden's side, Mr Trump's chances of success in the real world, however, sit squarely at zero. The results of the voting process will be sent to Washington DC and formally counted in a joint session of Congress on 6 January presided over by Vice-President Mike Pence. That will pave the way for Joe Biden to be sworn in as president on 20 January. Last month, President Trump said he would leave office in January if Mr Biden were affirmed as the election winner by the electoral college. Nevertheless, he has continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Most Republicans have stood behind Mr Trump in his efforts to overturn the result, but some have broken ranks in recent weeks. One Michigan congressman, Paul Mitchell, announced he was leaving the party weeks before his retirement in protest over what he said was its failure to accept that the election process was over.

"William Barr will step down on 23 December, President Trump said US Attorney General William Barr, one of Donald Trump's staunchest allies, is stepping down before Christmas, the president has announced. Mr Barr's term was due to end on 20 January, when Mr Trump leaves office. Tensions between the two flared after Mr Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in November's vote. He was criticised by Mr Trump for not publicly disclosing during the election campaign that the justice department was investigating Joe Biden's son. Mr Trump tweeted Mr Barr's resignation letter saying: ""Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job!"" The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Barr's letter to the president began by saying he ""appreciated the opportunity to update"" the president on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) review of voter fraud allegations in the recent election and ""how these allegations will continue to be pursued"". He did not give more details about the review, and praised Mr Trump's achievements in office before ending the letter by saying he would depart from his position on 23 December.

Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen will serve as acting attorney general, Mr Trump said. Rumours that Attorney General Barr was eyeing an early exit from the Trump administration turned out to be true. Although he received a traditional Trump send-off - his departure announced via Twitter - the president was cordial, thanking him and posting his effusive resignation letter. If there were any discord over the attorney general's recent handling of election investigations - his assertion that he had seen no evidence of widespread fraud - it did not spill into public view. Mr Barr probably will best be remembered for his management of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe. He defused what could have been a political bomb for the president by giving an advanced summary of the independent counsel's full report in a four-page memo that downplayed many of its more serious allegations. Perhaps the president's gratitude for that service outweighed any of their more recent disagreements and allowed them to part on amicable terms. Or perhaps in the waning days of the Trump presidency, there was no sense fighting on the way out the door. With William Barr gone, however, there may be less institutional resistance if President Trump decides to bypass traditional justice department procedures and issue a spate of controversial pardons for his closest allies. By exiting now, Mr Barr is affording himself the ability to stay silent on such matters. Mr Barr, 70, had previously served as attorney general under President George HW Bush in the early 1990s. He came out of semi-retirement in 2019 to replace Jeff Sessions, who was forced out by President Trump over the justice department's appointment of Special Counsel Mueller to investigate alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. This video can not be played Attorney General Barr defends his summary of the Mueller report Democratic critics of Mr Barr accused him of shielding his ex-boss from justice. Trump supporters recently turned on him due to his unwillingness to support Mr Trump's election lawsuits. His comments in early December that claims of voter fraud were unprovenwere a blow to Mr Trump, who has not accepted defeat. This video can not be played Why Donald Trump keeps outperforming the polls Since the 3 November election, Mr Trump has repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud, and members of his legal defence team have spoken of an alleged international plot to hand President-elect Joe Biden the win. Last week, Mr Trump attacked Mr Barr on Twitter, claiming that he did not publicly reveal that Mr Biden's son Hunter was being investigated by the justice department. Hunter Biden has since confirmed that his tax affairs are being looked into. Mr Trump claimed the decision not to reveal the investigation was a""big disadvantage"" for the Republicans at the polls,external. President Trump'sannouncement of Mr Barr's departure came at the same time the US electoral college affirmed Mr Biden's presidential election victory, one of the final steps required for him to take office. Mr Rosen, 56, joined the justice department in May 2019, replacing Rod Rosenstein as deputy attorney general, but he will serve for less than a month in the top job. He is perhaps best known for leading the department's antitrust case against Google, filed in October, which accuses the tech giant of establishing monopolies in search and search advertising. He first joined the Trump administration in 2017 as deputy transportation secretary, but also worked as a policy adviser under President George W Bush. In between government posts, he has followed a legal career in the private sector, with several stints at the powerful US law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Mr Trump has described him as ""an outstanding person"". At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Edinburgh remains in level three despite lower levels of positive Covid tests than nearby areas The latest review of Scotland's Covid-19 restriction levels will be announced at Holyrood later. All 32 local authority areas will have their situation assessed by politicians and public health officials. It could be the last review before the five-day Christmas easing of restrictions begins on 23 December. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said levels for all areas including Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire would be considered. Ms Sturgeon said last week she expected it to be the last review until 5 January although a parliamentary update on levels is scheduled for next week. The first minister said she wanted to provide consistency and stability over the Christmas period but would not rule out action if a particular area saw a surge in cases. Edinburgh is currently in level three, which means tough restrictions on hospitality and limits travel into and out of the local authority area. The decision to keep Edinburgh in level three last week was controversial because positive Covid rates in the city were lower than surrounding areas. But at the daily coronavirus briefing on Monday, the first minister said a 33% spike in cases in the past week showed it was the right one. Ms Sturgeon said moving the capital to level two would have been like ""pouring petrol on smouldering embers."" Aberdeen has the second highest weekly rate of positive tests of all local authorities in level two and cases have continued to rise since the last weekly review. Any changes agreed will come at the same time as the government is advising people tocut down on contacts before Christmas. At Monday's briefing, the first minister said people in Scotland should ""think really carefully"" about gathering indoors, adding that the ""best Christmas gift we can give family and friends"" is to ""keep our distance and keep them safe"". Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? In last week's review, it was announced that 11 council areas that were subject to the highest tier of restrictions would move down to lower levels. The toughest restrictions were imposed to bring down case numbers in Scotland's Covid hotspots - but they came at a cost, with hospitality and non-essential shops required to close, among other measures. Speaking on BBC Scotland'sCoronavirus Updateprogramme, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called on all the evidence behind the Scottish government's decisions on restriction levels to be made available, following the row over Edinburgh remaining in level three. The Scottish Conservative leader reiterated the call for people to be sensible over the Christmas period, but said the government must be honest with the public about the science behind its decisions. Vaccinations for care home staff and residents have started in Scotland Ms Sturgeon told MSPs last week that she considered moving Edinburgh down to level two - but the closeness to the Christmas period meant that this did not happen. On Friday, Scotland's highest civil court ruled the decision to keep Edinburgh under level three Covid restrictions was lawful, with the judge deciding the Scottish government had a right to consider factors other than data. The court heard there was ""no simple algorithm"" to determine levels and the indicators used ""may change over time"". The judge highlighted that in level two people could travel around Scotland freely - except for entering level three or four areas - whereas those in level three could not leave the local authority area, limiting the potential for viral spread in the capital city. The assessment of restriction levels for each area come as vaccinations are rolled out for frontline health workers and care home residents. Vaccinations for health staff began last week, and the first vaccines for care home residents, who are considered the most vulnerable to Covid-19, were administered on Tuesday.

"This video can not be played 'Kids need to understand the harshness of reality', says Tatum Price A mother who lost her 13-year-old son to drugs he bought off Snapchat has welcomed a new safety campaign on the social media app. Carson Price, of Hengoed, Caerphilly county, bought high-strength ecstasy for a few pounds in April last year. He died in hospital after beingfound ""in and out of consciousness, pale and shaking""in a park. His mother, Tatum, said the new ""Fearless"" campaign was a ""positive"" move but more still needed to be done. The video adverts are based on real stories reported to Crimestoppers, around drug use, exploitation and ""county lines"" drugs gangs. Teen died from 'violent reaction' to illegal drug Viral app Yolo raises abuse concerns Snapchat hits nearly 250m daily users They also make it clear how concerns about illegal activity can be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers. ""I think going through social media will target kids better as they're addicted to their phones,"" Tatum Price said. ""If adverts are on TV or a billboard, I don't think they'd take notice - they're just gonna walk past."" But she said more would need to be done on the app to keep children safe. Snapchat has a predominantly young audience Since the coronavirus pandemic outbreak in March, Crimestoppers Wales has engaged with 60,000 young people through Snapchat alone. Last year, it reached 32,000 children on a face-to-face basis in schools and youth groups. Ella Rabaiotti, the national manager for Crimestoppers in Wales, said the adverts on the app have seen more people come forward. ""What we find is when we put those messages out on Snapchat, we will then see an increase in reports to us,"" she said. ""So it's about reminding them that if they have information and they are fearful or worried about coming forward, they can use our anonymous service."" Tatum Price believes anonymous reporting will help more young people come forward Anonymity is something welcomed by Ms Price. She added: ""I think probably the majority of Carson's friends if they knew they could report something anonymously then I think they would.

"The deluge has led to rising floodwaters across parts of northern New South Wales Australian authorities have issued evacuation warnings for low-lying towns in northern New South Wales (NSW) as storms batter the nation's east coast. On Tuesday, emergency officials said they had fielded about 150 calls for help in the past 24 hours. Huge swells pummelled the coasts of NSW and south-east Queensland on Monday, causing major erosion. An already depleted beach at Byron Bay - a popular holiday spot - had all but disappeared, locals said. Authorities said the storm had moved south on Tuesday, bringing the threat of flooding to inland NSW. Byron Bay beach âall but goneâ in Australia storms They told communities around the Tweed River to evacuate on Tuesday, after it burst its banks. Some electricity, internet and other utility networks were also disrupted. Meteorologists say the system has already released an amount of rain similar to a cyclone - about 1,000mm over four days. Australia is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during the nation's summer. Heavy rain affected a 1,000km (620 miles) stretch of Australia's east coast - including Brisbane and the Gold Coast - but was expected to ease late on Tuesday. In one area, Upper Springbook in Queensland, close to a metre of rain had fallen since Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The NSW State Emergency Service said it had carried out 12 flood rescues so far, warning people to stay indoors and avoid driving through floodwaters. Some roads in the area between Tweed Heads and Taree were forced to close due to floods. Heavy rain across northern New South Wales has led to floods and road closures On Monday, authorities in Queensland warned that they had seen ""abnormally high"" tides up to 30cm higher than normal. All beaches in the area have been closed. Officials also recorded 8m-high swells and gale force winds exceeding 104km/h (64 mph) at Byron Bay. About 2,500 calls for emergency assistance have been made across the two states since Thursday, mostly for water damage to homes and for fallen trees and power poles. There have been no confirmed reports of injuries or deaths, but authorities said they were investigating a man's death in a car crash on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. This video can not be played A dog is rescued from under a sea of foam at Byron Bay A La NiÃ±a season is historically associated with increased rainfall and floods in Australia. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events, and floods have been recorded in 12 of the 18 events since 1900. Typically, La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia, says the Bureau of Meteorology. However scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian - whose state was worst-hit in last summer's bushfires - said experts were expecting conditions to be ""worse than what we have seen in quite a number of years"". ""I am hoping what we have seen over the last few days won't be repeated frequently over summer but it could,"" she said on Tuesday. ""I know for many residents in northern NSW, they are used to flooding conditions, but what the bushfire season taught us last year is to expect the unexpected.""

"I have one simple rule for making sense of ""new variant"" or ""new strain"" coronavirus stories. Ask: ""Has the virus's behaviour changed?"" A mutated virus sounds instinctively scary, but to mutate and change is what viruses do. Most of the time it is either a meaningless tweak or the virus alters itself in such a way that it gets worse at infecting us and the new variant just dies out. Occasionally it hits on a new winning formula. There is no clear-cut evidence the new variant of coronavirus -which has been detected in south-east England- is able to transmit more easily, cause more serious symptoms or render the vaccine useless. However, there are two reasons scientists are keeping a close eye on it. 'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England Mutated coronavirus may 'jump back and forth' Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine story The first is that levels of the variant are higher in places where cases are higher. It is a warning sign, although it can be interpreted in two ways. The virus could have mutated to spread more easily and is causing more infections. But variants can also get a lucky break by infecting the right people at the right time. One explanation for the spread of the ""Spanish strain"" over the summer was simply people catching it on holiday and then bringing it home. It will take experiments in the laboratory to figure out if this variant really is a better spreader than all the others. The other issue that is raising scientific eyebrows is how the virus has mutated. ""It has a surprisingly large number of mutations, more than we would expect, and a few look interesting,"" Prof Nick Loman from the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium told me. There are two notable sets of mutation - and I apologise for their hideous names. Both are found in the crucial spike protein, which is the key the virus uses to unlock the doorway into our body's cells in order to hijack them. The mutation N501 (I did warn you) alters the most important part of the spike, known as the ""receptor-binding domain"". This is where the spike makes first contact with the surface of our body's cells. Any changes that make it easier for the virus to get inside are likely to give it an edge. ""It looks and smells like an important adaptation,"" said Prof Loman. Mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunised The other mutation - a H69/V70 deletion - has emerged several times before, including famously in infected mink. The concern was that antibodies from the blood of survivors was less effective at attacking that variant of virus. Again, it is going to take more laboratory studies to really understand what is going on. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""We know there's a variant, we know nothing about what that means biologically. ""It is far too early to make any inference on how important this may or may not be."" Mutations to the spike protein lead to questions about the vaccine because the three leading jabs - Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford - all train the immune system to attack the spike. However, the body learns to attack multiple parts of the spike. That is why health officials remain convinced the vaccine will work against this variant. This is a virus that evolved in animals and made the jump to infecting people around a year ago. Since then it has been picking up around two mutations a month - take a sample today and compare it to the first ones from Wuhan in China and there would be around 25 mutations separating them. Coronavirus is still trying out different combinations of mutations to properly nail infecting humans. We have seen this happen before: The emergence and global dominance of another variant (G614) isseen by many as the virus getting better at spreading,external. But soon mass vaccination will put a different kind of pressure on the virus because it will have to change in order to infect people who have been immunized. If this does drive the evolution of the virus, we may have to regularly update the vaccines, as we do for flu, to keep up.

"This video can not be played Joe Biden, speaking earlier in December after his election victory was confirmed Joe Biden has said it is ""time to turn the page"" after his presidential election victory was confirmed by the US electoral college. In a speech after the announcement, he said US democracy had been ""pushed, tested and threatened"" and ""proved to be resilient, true and strong"". He condemned President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the result. Later Russian President Vladimir Putin became one of the last world leaders to congratulate Mr Biden on his victory. Moscow had said it would wait for the official results before doing so. Most other national leaders contacted Mr Biden days after the vote on 3 November. Confirmation by the electoral college was one of the steps required for Mr Biden to take office. Under the US system, voters actually cast their ballots for ""electors"", who in turn formally vote for candidates after the election. Democrat Joe Biden won November's contest with 306 electoral college votes to Republican Donald Trump's 232. The people who ultimately pick the US president Can Trump still challenge the result? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? President Trump, who shows few signs of conceding, has not commented. Shortly after the electoral college's vote,he announced on Twitter the departure of Attorney General William Barr,who had said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election, despite the president's claims. Speaking in Delaware, Mr Biden praised ""ordinary men and women"" who had refused to be bullied, referring to the president's efforts to question and overturn the results, involving legal challenges which have been rejected by courts across the country. He described the efforts as ""a position so extreme we've never seen it before"". ""Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy, even when we find those results hard to accept,"" he said. ""The flame of democracy was lit in this nation a long time ago,"" he added. ""And we know that nothing not even a pandemic or an abuse of power can extinguish that flame."" Mr Biden said it was time to ""turn the page, as we've done throughout our history, to unite, to heal"". But he warned that, with the coronavirus pandemic continuing to ravage the US, there would be difficult months ahead. ""There is urgent work in front of us,"" he said. ""Getting this pandemic under control and getting the nation vaccinated against this virus."" He stressed the importance of immediate economic help that was ""so badly needed by so many Americans who are hurting today"" and rebuilding the economy to be ""better than it ever was"". He was speaking as the Covid death toll in the US - the country worst affected by the virus - rose above 300,000. Normally the electors do not get that much attention but this year, after uncertainty generated by a raft of challenges to results in Democrat-won states by the Trump campaign, the state-by-state vote was in the spotlight. Solidly Democrat California, with its 55 electors, was one of the last states to voteon Monday and took Mr Biden across the 270-vote threshold required to win the presidency. This video can not be played Electoral college affirms Joe Biden as president-elect Heightened security had been put in place in some states, including Michigan and Georgia, ahead of voting, which took place in state capitals and Washington DC. In Michigan - a key swing state Mr Biden won - legislative offices in the state capital Lansing were closed due to ""credible"" threats of violence. The vote at the capitol building went ahead peacefully although a group of Republicans tried to enter the building to hold their own vote and were turned away. This video can not be played The president of the United States is not chosen directly by voters, but by what's known as the electoral college In his speech, Mr Biden described the harassment of officials following the election as ""unconscionable"" and said: ""It's my sincere hope we never again see anyone subjected to the kind of threats and abuse we saw in this election."" He also noted that he had the same number of electoral college votes that Mr Trump said was a ""landslide"" when he won in 2016. Mr Biden emphasised that he had also won the popular vote, something Mr Trump failed to clinch four years ago. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander said: ""The presidential election is over.,externalStates have certified the votes. Courts have resolved disputes. The electors have voted. I hope that President Trump will put the country first, take pride in his considerable accomplishments, and help president-elect Biden get off to a good start."" This video can not be played Can you explain the electoral college in 10 seconds? The quadrennial meeting of the US electoral college is usually a formality along the way to a presidential inauguration - a vestigial political event that long ago lost its power and relevance. Donald Trump's scorched-earth strategy of contesting the results of the 2020 election, however, gave the proceedings new attention. His legal team has had little success in challenging the results in multiple battleground states and the official recording of the electoral college ballots effectively lowered the curtain on these long-shot judicial manoeuvres. That does not mean the Trump team is giving up, of course. They will continue with futile court challenges and, eventually, ask Congress to overturn the election results. It is an alternative reality that Donald Trump's supporters may find more comforting than the one where Joe Biden is president-elect. Given that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, the official electoral college tally has been duly certified by the states and federal law is on Mr Biden's side, Mr Trump's chances of success in the real world, however, sit squarely at zero. The results of the voting process will be sent to Washington DC and formally counted in a joint session of Congress on 6 January presided over by Vice-President Mike Pence. That will pave the way for Joe Biden to be sworn in as president on 20 January. Last month, President Trump said he would leave office in January if Mr Biden were affirmed as the election winner by the electoral college. Nevertheless, he has continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Most Republicans have stood behind Mr Trump in his efforts to overturn the result, but some have broken ranks in recent weeks. One Michigan congressman, Paul Mitchell, announced he was leaving the party weeks before his retirement in protest over what he said was its failure to accept that the election process was over.

"Cigar lounge owner Hassan Dakhteh hopes Trump will run in 2024 Donald Trump may have lost the election but he won a record number of votes, and tightened his grip on states like Ohio. So what can Ohio tell us about the Republican Party's future? Powell, a suburb of the capital Columbus, has a charming and old-worldly feel. Its picturesque neighbourhoods with big houses and rolling lawns reinforce the much romanticised pop culture images of the ideal American suburban life. The downtown market is lined with small cafes, handicraft shops, ice-cream parlours and wine stores. President Trump won this county and, though the election is long over, many shops and businesses still have 'Trump-Pence 2020' campaign signs staked in their lawns. Among them is a cigar shop called Stogies where a 'TRUMP 2020' banner is the centrepiece, flanking photos of Groucho Marx and Winston Churchill - celebrities of a bygone era - holding lit cigars. Concentric rings of smoke fill this cosy lounge, which used to be a church in the early 1900s. There is a group of men inside seated on sofas, all smoking cigars. President Trump looks down on them from an autographed photo. They are all Trump supporters and part of the electorate that gave him a decisive victory in Ohio. Mostly in their 50s and 60s, they're college educated professionals and businessmen. Neil Berberick, a retired professional says: ""What Trump has done is that he has gone back to core values. He picked up the people that were forgotten by the Democrats. He was in tune with us. He has changed the Republican party for the good.'' There is a sense of longing for President Trump - even though they still don't entirely believe he's lost the presidency. Asked about the future of the Republican party after Trump, Taylor Burkhart, a young mechanical engineer says: ""The party is not just going to dissolve because Trump may not be on their ticket. Someone will fill his shoes. We'll find someone else whose values that we agree with."" Hassan Dakhteh and his clientele But there is also this deep hope in the smoke-filled air that Mr Trump remains a force in Republican politics. The owner of the cigar lounge, Hassan Dakhteh, an Iranian immigrant who came to the United States over 40 years ago, says: ""I think he will run in 2024, I hope he runs in 2024."" President Trump remains a dominant force in Ohio. He won the state's 18 electoral college votes and also the popular vote by more than eight percentage points. According to the AP, he won more votes than any other presidential candidate in the state's history. It's a testament to how effectively Mr Trump spoke to rural and working class Ohioans and created a base that adores him. What Trump could do after leaving the White House Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia But not all Republican voters here endorse Mr Trump. About 14 miles from the cigar lounge, outside a grocery store in Hilliard, Amber Baumgartner is preparing to do some grocery shopping. She is a 56-year-old teacher who is passionate about healthcare for ordinary Americans. She leans conservative on most issues but is not a fan of the turn the Republican party has taken in the last four years. ""I am hoping they are going to learn,"" she says. ""They are going to see that this extremism, we are going to have to get a clamp on this. I feel that the last four years have been a joke, almost. It's been embarrassing, scary, terrifying actually. I am hoping that the party understands that and I think that they do. Because so many of them have been unwilling to get on the crazy bus."" An autographed photo of President Trump in Stogies cigar lounge Former Ohio governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich - a vocal critic of Mr Trump - thinks Republicans need to eschew Mr Trump's brand of politics going forward. ""It should become a party of ideas,"" he says. ""It's been basically an anti-Democrat party. They don't have any ideas on healthcare, environment or the wealth gap."" The Democrats are not in great shape either, he adds, but Joe Biden might be able to appeal to middle America. ""We'll see whether they will do that but Republicans really need to get some ideas otherwise they will wilt away."" The sudden death of bellwether America However, Donald Trump remains overwhelmingly popular in Ohio and it's clear he will continue exerting influence on the Republican party even after he leaves the White House. ""His performance in 2016 and 2020 suggests that he is the most popular Republican in Ohio in quite a long time, maybe since Ronald Reagan,"" says Mark Caleb Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Cedarville. His popularity among his base has allowed President Trump to attack senior party leaders who don't agree with him. Among them Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, for not backing his unsubstantiated claims of a rigged election.Mr DeWine, though a supporter of President Trump, was one of the earlier Republicans out of the gate in recognising President-elect Joe Biden's win. US President Donald Trump has been critical of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine Emboldened by Mr Trump's attack, some fellow Republicans are even trying to impeach the governor for enforcing measures to curb Covid-19, which is at a record high in the state. Gov DeWine, who took steps early on to combat the coronavirus and has handled the pandemic very differently to Mr Trump, has hit back at his detractors. So how can Republican leaders like him deal with hostility from within his own party going forward? Professor Smith says that keeping the deeply conservative base happy could be key. Supporters packed a Trump rally in Ohio in October ""Governor DeWine is willing to sign anti-abortion legislation, for example,"" he says. ""I'd expect that kind of thing to continue."" ""His rhetoric on family and marriage will probably ratchet up a bit. Governor DeWine is a staunch Catholic and I would expect him to use that language more frequently about religion and his faith. I think that does quite well with the people who are supportive of the president."" Mr Trump did very well in Ohio in the rural areas outside of major cities such as Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, where the electorate is predominantly white. However, can the party really sustain itself nationally by focusing on his base? Studies show that America is getting more diverse and minorities are already a powerful voting bloc, so Republicans will likely need new strategies going ahead. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? Republican strategist Terry Casey says the party will look for new ideas but President Trump could potentially leave a lasting legacy. ""He has shifted the party somewhat for the good because the Republican party previously had the image of the party of the country club, and the Wall Street rich people. And now it has shifted to issues of the middle class or the working class and a lot of people in the Midwest who have been forgotten."" Whether Donald Trump continues to remain a powerful presence in Republican politics will be determined in the months to come. But one thing seems certain, both parties need to make sure that middle America - like Ohio - does not feel ignored.

"Craig McLachlan is a veteran of the Australian entertainment industry Australian actor Craig McLachlan has been found not guilty of allegations that he assaulted four women during a Melbourne stage show. Mr McLachlan, 55, had consistently denied seven charges of indecent assault and six of common assault. The allegations arose from a 2014 production of The Rocky Horror Show, in which the veteran actor played the lead role of Frank-N-Furter. A magistrate handed down the ruling on Tuesday, clearing him of all charges. In her decision, Magistrate Belinda Wallington said the women were ""brave and honest witnesses"" but their accounts of alleged incidents - including one accusation that Mr McLachlan had tickled the inner-thigh of a woman on stage - were not enough to prove intent. ""I'm unable to exclude the possibility that an egotistical, self-entitled sense of humour led the accused to genuinely think that â¦ [she] was consenting to his actions,"" she said, according to the ABC. The trial had heard allegations that Mr McLachlan had kissed one woman without her consent, and inappropriately touched another on other occasions. Mr McLachlan strenuously denied the accusations and told the court in November that hugs and kisses between performers was common practice in showbusiness. He said any inappropriate touching on stage ""could only have been accidental"". Speaking to media in Sydney after the verdict, Mr McLachlan thanked his legal team for their ""exceptional"" efforts. ""We have maintained a dignified and respectful silence for the past almost three years and put our trust in the law. And here we are today,"" he said. After the women's allegations were first published, Mr McLachlan began defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and a former co-star. That case was delayed but is now expected to resume. Internationally, Mr McLachlan is best known for his role as Henry Ramsay in the television soap Neighbours, appearing in more than 800 episodes.

"Cigar lounge owner Hassan Dakhteh hopes Trump will run in 2024 Donald Trump may have lost the election but he won a record number of votes, and tightened his grip on states like Ohio. So what can Ohio tell us about the Republican Party's future? Powell, a suburb of the capital Columbus, has a charming and old-worldly feel. Its picturesque neighbourhoods with big houses and rolling lawns reinforce the much romanticised pop culture images of the ideal American suburban life. The downtown market is lined with small cafes, handicraft shops, ice-cream parlours and wine stores. President Trump won this county and, though the election is long over, many shops and businesses still have 'Trump-Pence 2020' campaign signs staked in their lawns. Among them is a cigar shop called Stogies where a 'TRUMP 2020' banner is the centrepiece, flanking photos of Groucho Marx and Winston Churchill - celebrities of a bygone era - holding lit cigars. Concentric rings of smoke fill this cosy lounge, which used to be a church in the early 1900s. There is a group of men inside seated on sofas, all smoking cigars. President Trump looks down on them from an autographed photo. They are all Trump supporters and part of the electorate that gave him a decisive victory in Ohio. Mostly in their 50s and 60s, they're college educated professionals and businessmen. Neil Berberick, a retired professional says: ""What Trump has done is that he has gone back to core values. He picked up the people that were forgotten by the Democrats. He was in tune with us. He has changed the Republican party for the good.'' There is a sense of longing for President Trump - even though they still don't entirely believe he's lost the presidency. Asked about the future of the Republican party after Trump, Taylor Burkhart, a young mechanical engineer says: ""The party is not just going to dissolve because Trump may not be on their ticket. Someone will fill his shoes. We'll find someone else whose values that we agree with."" Hassan Dakhteh and his clientele But there is also this deep hope in the smoke-filled air that Mr Trump remains a force in Republican politics. The owner of the cigar lounge, Hassan Dakhteh, an Iranian immigrant who came to the United States over 40 years ago, says: ""I think he will run in 2024, I hope he runs in 2024."" President Trump remains a dominant force in Ohio. He won the state's 18 electoral college votes and also the popular vote by more than eight percentage points. According to the AP, he won more votes than any other presidential candidate in the state's history. It's a testament to how effectively Mr Trump spoke to rural and working class Ohioans and created a base that adores him. What Trump could do after leaving the White House Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia But not all Republican voters here endorse Mr Trump. About 14 miles from the cigar lounge, outside a grocery store in Hilliard, Amber Baumgartner is preparing to do some grocery shopping. She is a 56-year-old teacher who is passionate about healthcare for ordinary Americans. She leans conservative on most issues but is not a fan of the turn the Republican party has taken in the last four years. ""I am hoping they are going to learn,"" she says. ""They are going to see that this extremism, we are going to have to get a clamp on this. I feel that the last four years have been a joke, almost. It's been embarrassing, scary, terrifying actually. I am hoping that the party understands that and I think that they do. Because so many of them have been unwilling to get on the crazy bus."" An autographed photo of President Trump in Stogies cigar lounge Former Ohio governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich - a vocal critic of Mr Trump - thinks Republicans need to eschew Mr Trump's brand of politics going forward. ""It should become a party of ideas,"" he says. ""It's been basically an anti-Democrat party. They don't have any ideas on healthcare, environment or the wealth gap."" The Democrats are not in great shape either, he adds, but Joe Biden might be able to appeal to middle America. ""We'll see whether they will do that but Republicans really need to get some ideas otherwise they will wilt away."" The sudden death of bellwether America However, Donald Trump remains overwhelmingly popular in Ohio and it's clear he will continue exerting influence on the Republican party even after he leaves the White House. ""His performance in 2016 and 2020 suggests that he is the most popular Republican in Ohio in quite a long time, maybe since Ronald Reagan,"" says Mark Caleb Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Cedarville. His popularity among his base has allowed President Trump to attack senior party leaders who don't agree with him. Among them Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, for not backing his unsubstantiated claims of a rigged election.Mr DeWine, though a supporter of President Trump, was one of the earlier Republicans out of the gate in recognising President-elect Joe Biden's win. US President Donald Trump has been critical of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine Emboldened by Mr Trump's attack, some fellow Republicans are even trying to impeach the governor for enforcing measures to curb Covid-19, which is at a record high in the state. Gov DeWine, who took steps early on to combat the coronavirus and has handled the pandemic very differently to Mr Trump, has hit back at his detractors. So how can Republican leaders like him deal with hostility from within his own party going forward? Professor Smith says that keeping the deeply conservative base happy could be key. Supporters packed a Trump rally in Ohio in October ""Governor DeWine is willing to sign anti-abortion legislation, for example,"" he says. ""I'd expect that kind of thing to continue."" ""His rhetoric on family and marriage will probably ratchet up a bit. Governor DeWine is a staunch Catholic and I would expect him to use that language more frequently about religion and his faith. I think that does quite well with the people who are supportive of the president."" Mr Trump did very well in Ohio in the rural areas outside of major cities such as Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, where the electorate is predominantly white. However, can the party really sustain itself nationally by focusing on his base? Studies show that America is getting more diverse and minorities are already a powerful voting bloc, so Republicans will likely need new strategies going ahead. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? Republican strategist Terry Casey says the party will look for new ideas but President Trump could potentially leave a lasting legacy. ""He has shifted the party somewhat for the good because the Republican party previously had the image of the party of the country club, and the Wall Street rich people. And now it has shifted to issues of the middle class or the working class and a lot of people in the Midwest who have been forgotten."" Whether Donald Trump continues to remain a powerful presence in Republican politics will be determined in the months to come. But one thing seems certain, both parties need to make sure that middle America - like Ohio - does not feel ignored.
