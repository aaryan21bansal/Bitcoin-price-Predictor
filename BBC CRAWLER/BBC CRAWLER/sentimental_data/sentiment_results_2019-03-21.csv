"Aaron Campbell, 16, was given a minimum jail term of 27 years The 16-year-old who raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has been sentenced to a minimum of 27 years behind bars after he finally admitted his crime. During his trial, Aaron Campbell had repeatedly denied he abducted, raped and killed the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute last July. But he admitted his offences to a psychologist preparing a report to the court ahead of his sentencing. Judge Lord Matthews imposed a life sentence for the ""brutal"" murder. He set the punishment part of the sentence, before Campbell can apply for parole, at 27 years. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Read the judge's sentencing statement in full,external Lord Matthews said Campbell's crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief"". He said Alesha had been violated and murdered and told Campbell he was a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The judge read out Campbell's ""cold blooded and horrific"" account of his actions that night and how he described seeing Alesha asleep in her room as ""a moment of opportunity"". Campbell's confession was contained in the criminal justice social report and the criminal psychologist's report, which were prepared ahead of his sentencing. The report by the forensic clinical psychologist Dr Gary Macpherson quoted Campbell as saying: ""At any other time in life murder would not have been the conclusion. ""If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence In his sentencing statement, the judge said the teenager had shown breathtaking arrogance during the trial and had failed to plead guilty despite overwhelming evidence against him. He said he had shown ""a staggering lack of remorse"". ""Not once did I detect a flicker of emotion from you,"" the judge said. Lord Matthews said it would be for others to decide if Campbell would ever be released, indeed, he said his reintegration into society might be ""impossible"". During his nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow last month, Campbell claimed he had never met his victim and lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. The judge said this was a ""cruel travesty of the truth"" and said the woman he blamed, Toni McLachlan, was ""completely innocent"". Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial The judge said he was ""shocked"" by the clear admissions of guilt in the background reports, especially after the ""tissue of lies"" Campbell had told in court. The psychologist said that on the night of Alesha's death Campbell had been drinking and wanted cannabis so he decided to go into her father's home to get some. Alesha's father had previously sold him the drug. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' In his sentencing statement, Lord Matthews said Campbell had carried Alesha to a secluded spot where he raped and murdered her ""in the most brutal fashion"". He told the teenager: ""You said that Alesha was drowsy and became a bit more awake when you went out. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead ""At one point she asked who you were and where you were going. ""You said you were a friend of her father and that you were taking her home."" Campbell gave Alesha his coat because she was cold. The judge said that over the next few days Campbell was unconcerned about what had happened, and was ""slightly amused"" that the police had not caught him. The court heard that the teenager had said he was ""quite satisfied by the murder"". Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane leaves court after the sentencing The judge said Campbell told Dr Macpherson that at points during the trial it took ""everything to stop laughing"" and he had to ""zip his mouth"". Lord Matthews said the reports concluded that Campbell was not suffering from a mental health disorder but showed a total lack of victim empathy. Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was just days into a holiday when she was abducted from her bed. She was reported missing from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, near Rothesay, at 06:23 on 2 July last year. Dozens of islanders joined the search for the child but at 08:54 her naked body was discovered in a wooded area in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. After the sentence was read out family members shouted ""evil"" and ""beast"" as Campbell was led down to the cells. Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Identity of Alesha's killer revealed.

"Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February Police searching for Libby Squire have confirmed a body recovered from the Humber estuary is that of the missing student. Humberside Police said the body was discovered near Grimsby docks on Wednesday afternoon. The 21-year-old University of Hull student was last seen in the early hours of 1 February after a night out. A major police inquiry saw hundreds of officers searching for Ms Squire, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Det Supt Martin Smalley said on Thursday: ""A post-mortem examination commenced this afternoon and is continuing to be carried out this evening, however formal identification has now taken place and we can confirm the body recovered is that of missing woman Libby Squire."" He said her family had been informed and were ""receiving support from specially trained officers"". Libby Squire's mother Lisa had appealed for information about her missing daughter Ms Squire was last seen on Beverley Road close to the junction with Haworth Street in Hull. Det Supt Smalley said: ""An extensive search was carried out in the days and weeks after her disappearance, with detectives and officers working relentlessly to find Libby. ""The people in Hull have shown tremendous support to Libby's family and to the officers and support staff involved in the searches and investigation."" Libby police find woman's body in water Mother's 'heartbreak' over missing Libby Latest news and stories from Yorkshire Professor Susan Lea, vice-chancellor at the University of Hull, said staff and students were ""all absolutely devastated by the loss of our student, Libby Squire"". ""Our hearts go out to Libby's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time and we will continue to give them our full support,"" she added. Last month, the student's mother Lisa Squire talked of ""a month of utter heartbreak and despair"". ""As a family we are incomplete,"" she said. A 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of abduction remains under investigation, police said. Pawel Relowicz, of Raglan Street in Hull, is remanded in custody on unrelated charges of burglary, voyeurism, outraging public decency and receiving stolen goods. On the night of her disappearance, detectives think Ms Squire got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house in Wellesley Avenue at about 23:30 GMT, where her mobile phone was found. They do not believe she entered the house and have said her phone ""has not provided any further insight as to her movements that night"". She was spotted on CCTV 10 minutes later near a bench on Beverley Road, where it is thought a motorist stopped to offer her help. Floral tributes are now being laid on the bench.

"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted of the 1988 bombing Five former members of the Stasi, the intelligence service in communist East Germany, have been questioned over the Lockerbie bombing. A German state prosecutor has confirmed the five were spoken to at the request of authorities in Scotland. It is part of the ongoing criminal inquiry into the atrocity 30 years ago. According to reports in Germany, the individuals were in their 70s and 80s, and were interviewed as witnesses, not suspects, over the last nine months. ""These are solely witness interrogations,"" a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in Frankfurt an der Oder, on the Polish border was quoted as saying by Germany's dpa news agency. Pan Am flight 103 was brought down by a bomb over southern Scotland on 21 December, 1988. All 259 passengers and crew were killed, along with 11 residents of the town of Lockerbie. In 2001, a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands ruled that the bombing had been carried out by Abdelbaset al Megrahi, a member of the Libyan intelligence service. Megrahi continued to protest his innocence until his death in Libya in 2012. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds in 2009 when he had terminal cancer, and died three years later in Tripoli. Prosecutors at Scotland's Crown Office have always said that Megrahi did not act alone and was one of a number of Libyans involved in bombing the plane. The prosecution case was that the bomb was placed in an unaccompanied suitcase and smuggled onto a plane from Malta to Frankfurt, where it was loaded onto a feeder flight to Heathrow and then into the hold of Pan Am 103. In 2015, the Crown Office asked the Libyan authorities for permission to interview two unnamed men who were in custody following the revolution which toppled Colonel Gaddafi's regime. Prosecutors said there was a ""proper basis in law"" to treat the men as suspects. The men were Abdullah Senussi, Gaddafi's brother in law and former intelligence chief and Mohammed Abuagila Masud. Senussi had been sentenced to death by a Libyan court that year but is still alive and in custody. Masud was sentenced by the same court to 10 years in prison for bomb-making. The prosecution at the Lockerbie trial alleged that Masud had been with Megrahi on the day the bomb brought down Pan Am 103. Former Stasi agents gave evidence during the trial about the agency's involvement with a Swiss businessman who was said to have made the timer which triggered the Lockerbie bomb. The Stasi also featured in a documentary broadcast in 2015. It was made by American filmmaker Ken Dornstein, whose brother was on board Pan Am 103. Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew from the plane The programme claimed that the Stasi had carried out surveillance on Libyan agents who bombed a disco in West Berlin in 1986. Three people were killed, including two American servicemen.   The documentary said the Stasi had information that Masud was in West Berlin when the disco was attacked. Lockerbie: The town scarred by terror Farmer's tribute to Lockerbie victims Finding words to describe Lockerbie On the 30th anniversary of the bombing last December, the Crown Office said the ongoing criminal inquiry had uncovered ""intelligence and information supportive of the original trial court's finding that the bombing was Libyan state-sponsored terrorism in which Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was a key player"". The Crown said its investigations were also contributing evidence in relation to other individuals ""involved in the conspiracy to commit the atrocity"". Asked about the questioning of the former Stasi agents, the Crown Office said: ""Prosecutors and police, working with UK government and US colleagues, will continue this investigation with the sole aim of bringing those who acted along with al Megrahi to justice. As this is a live criminal investigation, it would not be appropriate to comment."" Megrahi always protested his innocence. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently carrying out its own inquiry to decide whether his case should be referred back to the appeal court.

"The Golan Heights has a political and strategic significance which belies its size President Donald Trump has overturned decades of US policy by saying it is time to recognise Israel's sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in 1967. In a tweet, Mr Trump declared that the plateau was of""critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and regional stability"",external. Israel annexed the Golan in 1981 in a move not recognised internationally. Syria, which has sought to regain the region, has so far made no comments. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who has warned about the ""military entrenchment"" of his country's arch-enemy Iran in Syria and has ordered air strikes in an attempt to thwart it -tweeted his thanks to Mr Trump,external. ""At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognises Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,"" he wrote. Richard Haass, a former senior US state department official who is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, said he ""strongly disagreed"" with Mr Trump. He said such recognising Israeli sovereignty would violate a UN Security Council resolution, ""which rules out acquiring territory by war"". What Trumpâs Golan Heights move really meansâ Why are the Golan Heights so important? The president's declaration comes as Mr Netanyahu faces a closely fought general election on 9 April, as well as a series of possible corruption charges. In 2017, Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and ordered the relocation of the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. The decision was condemned by Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state, and the UN General Assembly demanded its cancellation. Was President Trump's tweet a surprise for even his closest aides? The press travelling with the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was waiting at Prime Minister Netanyahu's house to hear from both men, when word of Mr Trump's Golan decision came through. They delayed their appearance long enough for us to wonder whether they were scrambling to formulate a response. But if the announcement came as a surprise, it was a good surprise for Mr Netanyahu - ""I'm so excited"" were his first words to us. And the surprise would have been in the timing, not the substance, because the idea of the US recognising Israel's sovereignty over the Golan has been under active consideration in the Trump administration for some time. Israel has gained traction in the White House and parts of Congress by arguing that Iran is using Syria as a base from which to target Israel, with the Golan Heights as the front line. But the formal US recognition doesn't change anything on the ground: Israel was already acting with full military authority. So critics have concluded this was a blatant attempt to give Mr Netanyahu a boost in a hotly-contested election. If so, it's one that violates important principles of international law, they say: Mr Trump has endorsed the seizure of territory, and will have no moral authority to criticise Russia for doing so in Ukraine's Crimea. The region is located about 60km (40 miles) south-west of the Syrian capital, Damascus, and covers about 1,000 sq km (400 sq miles). Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Middle East war, and thwarted a Syrian attempt to retake the region during the 1973 war. The two countries agreed a disengagement plan the following year that involved the creation of a 70km-long (44-mile) demilitarised zone patrolled by a United Nations observer force. But they remained technically in a state of war. Syria will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan In 1981, Israel's parliament passed legislation applying Israeli ""law, jurisdiction, and administration"" to the Golan, in effect annexing the territory. But the international community did not recognise the move and maintained that the Golan was occupied Syrian territory.UN Security Council Resolution 497 declared the Israeli decision ""null and void and without international legal effect"",external. Three years ago, when former President Barack Obama was in office,the US voted in favour of a Security Council statement expressing deep concern that Mr Netanyahu had declared Israel would never relinquish the Golan,external. Syria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. The last US-brokered direct peace talks broke down in 2000, while Turkey mediated in indirect talks in 2008. There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured. Trumplomacy on Golan - what does it mean?

"Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain, but is it the deadliest? As glaciers melt at a greater pace,there are concerns among expedition operatorsthat bodies are becoming exposed on Mount Everest. The mountain is one of the crown jewels for climbers - but with the achievement of reaching the world's highest peak come risks. So how deadly is Everest and how does it compare with others in the region? Records suggest there have been just over 280 deaths on the mountain. While the number of deaths has been increasing, however, the death rate - the proportion of those who climb above base camp that die - has fallen to below 1%. Since 2010, there have been 72 deaths on Everest and 7,954 climbs above base camp. Most of these deaths are from avalanches or falls, which partially explains the difficulty in retrieving bodies from the mountain. Acute mountain sickness, with symptoms of dizziness, vomiting and headaches, has also caused deaths. While the risks are clear, Alan Arnette, a professional mountaineer who counts Everest and K2 among his climbs, points out that it is significantly safer climbing Everest than elsewhere in the Himalayas. On Everest, he says, ""it's basically just following a well-used route"". ""There is a lot more infrastructure, more tea houses, more helicopter airlifts possible,"" he says. ""In some of the mountains in Pakistan you have to rely on an army helicopter."" The recent deaths of two climbers in Pakistan have highlighted that danger. The British climber Tom Ballard and his Italian climbing partner Daniele Nardi died attempting to scale the Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat, known colloquially as ""Killer Mountain"". Tom's mother, Alison Hargreaves, had previously died climbing K2, the world's second-highest peak, also in Pakistan. British climber Tom Ballard died climbing Nanga Parbat Both Nanga Parbat and K2 are considered two of the toughest of the ""eight-thousanders"" - the 14 mountains higher than 8,000m (26,000ft). Statistics on successful attempts and deaths are not as readily available in Pakistan. But calculations done by Mr Arnette and other climbers show Nanga Parbat has had 339 successful ascents to the summit and 69 deaths. That works out at roughly one death for every five successful ascents to the summit. K2, which is part of the neighbouring Karakoram mountain range, is even more dangerous - there have been 355 successful ascents to the summit and 82 deaths. Most Himalayan ascents are not attempted from Pakistan but from mountains with their peaks in Nepal. And statistics are more detailed in this part of the Himalayas, thanks primarily to the work of journalist Elizabeth Hawley. Her Himalayan Database is seen as the most authoritative records of climbs, successful or unsuccessful, of more than 450 peaks in the region, including Everest. Elizabeth Hawley, unrivalled Himalayan record keeper Himalayan storm: Climbers' bodies removed from Nepal mountain Unlike records from Pakistan, the Himalayan Database collects information not just on successful ascents to the summit but also on all those who venture beyond base camps, giving a more accurate view of the danger of the mountains. And for all climbs above base camp in the region, the death rate has dropped from 3% in the 1950s to 0.9% over the past decade. For Sherpas, the Nepalese professional climbers hired to support mountaineering teams, it has declined from 1.3% to 0.8%. Since 2010, there have been 183 recorded deaths above base camp in the region, according to the Himalayan Database, and over 21,000 climbs above base camp. The statistics also shine a light on which mountain peak poses the greatest threat to climbers. Since 2010, out of the four mountaineers to have climbed Yalung Kang, three have died. The overall number climbing these peaks is small, which does skew the figures, but ultimately reiterates the point that the mountains less well trod are potentially the most lethal.

"This video can not be played Brendan âDr Evilâ McCarthy admits GBH for performing tongue splitting and nipple removal A body modification artist known as Dr Evil has been jailed for carrying out ear and nipple removals and splitting a customer's tongue. Brendan McCarthy carried out consensual procedures without using anaesthetic. The 50-year-old, of Bushbury in Wolverhampton, ran Dr Evil's Body Modification Emporium. He pleaded guilty to three counts of grievous bodily harm and was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court for three years and four months. McCarthy admitted the charges after the Court of Appeal said his customers' written consent to the procedures did not amount to a defence. Warning: This article contains graphic imagery. Out-of-date medical materials were found in McCarthy's studio Judge Amjad Nawaz said the body-modification industry was unregulated and McCarthy was only registered as a tattooist and cosmetic piercer. He said McCarthy ""had no qualifications to carry out surgical procedures or to deal with any adverse consequences which could have arisen"". ""There is a clear public interest element. There is also a need for deterrent,"" the judge added. Several of McCarthy's friends cried and comforted each other as he was taken from the dock. The court heard customer Ezechiel Lott, whose ear was removed in 2015, had been contacted by police after McCarthy pleaded guilty. In comments to police, read into the record by prosecutor Peter Grieves-Smith QC, Mr Lott said he ""felt like he had been deceived"" as he thought at the time that the procedure was legal. Mr Grieves-Smith said: ""He stated that had he known it was illegal, he would never have had the procedure because he certainly was not that desperate to have his ear removed."" Defence barrister Andrew Smith QC urged the judge not to jail McCarthy, describing the ""unusual"" case as being one of  ""exceptional circumstances"". ""Each individual actively sought the procedures,"" Mr Smith said. McCarthy no longer runs Dr Evil's Body Modification Emporium in Princess Alley West Midlands Police said McCarthy conducted the procedures without knowing his clients' medical histories or psychiatric backgrounds. Officers discovered out-of-date pre-injection swabs, anaesthetic gel, stitching thread and needles, the force added. McCarthy was arrested in December 2015 following a complaint to the City of Wolverhampton Council's environmental health team. The council said its issue was with McCarthy's lack of licence to carry out the modification procedures and the need for more regulation in the industry which delivers results ""akin to cosmetic surgery"". Latest news and stories from the West Midlands Tongue-splitting body artist admits GBH Illegal tongue splitting procedures exposed An online petition which attracted 13,000 signatures was set up to support the ""knowledgeable, skilful and hygienic"" body-piercer, who was refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. In February, McCarthy told the BBC the situation was ""crushing"". He said: ""I'm a shadow of my former self. I don't feel I've done anything wrong."" McCarthy removed a client's ear in 2015 at his studio in Wolverhampton Following a failed bid to convince a crown court judge that consent was a lawful defence, McCarthy took his case to the Court of Appeal arguing that the procedures should be regarded as lawful to protect the ""personal autonomy"" of his customers. But three Court of Appeal judges, who noted that McCarthy had divided a customer's tongue ""to produce an effect similar to that enjoyed by reptiles"", said the procedures were not comparable to tattoos and piercings. Councillor Steve Evans, cabinet member for city environment, said the council had ""exposed a national issue which requires a national regulation to be introduced to protect members of the public against the risks of extreme body modification"". He added: ""Whilst I'm sure Mr McCarthy considers himself an artist, providing a service removing and cutting people's body parts without adequate medical training from unsuitable retail premises, presents a risk to the public that we are not prepared to accept.""

"Stuart Levy claimed the Kirkups had run out when the lights were on green A speeding driver who was not wearing his glasses when he hit a mother and her son on a pedestrian crossing has been jailed for more than five years. Shantelle Kirkup died after being struck on St Cuthbert's Way, Darlington, in May last year. Her ""last act of care"" was to propel her six-year-old son out of the path of Stuart Levy. Levy, 37, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He displayed an ""utterly dangerous and cavalier attitude"", Teesside Crown Court heard. Shantelle Kirkup had married seven months before her death Levy had been out to collect his methadone prescription and had drunk his daily dose before the crash. Having undertaken another vehicle as he approached the crossing, his Ford Focus hit 29-year-old Mrs Kirkup as she held the hand of her son, Jaxon. Her new husband, James, had been pushing their two-year-old daughter, Jemima, in a buggy and had crossed the road ahead of them. Mr Kirkup had taken his son to a dinosaur show while his wife had been buying birthday presents with Jemima before the family bought ice creams. The traffic lights were on amber as they crossed but Levy failed to react until it was too late. It was estimated he was travelling at 34 to 41mph (54 to 66km/h) on the 30mph (48km/h) road when he hit the pair. Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said: ""Shantelle had hold of Jaxon's hand for his safety, that last act of care helped propel Jaxon out of the path of the vehicle thereby probably saving his life."" The youngster suffered a broken leg. Levy, of Rocket Street, Darlington, told police he had been wearing his glasses and said the Kirkups had run out when the lights were on green. Those claims were shown to be lies - Levy's spectacles were broken and found later at his ex-partner's home. He knew he needed to wear them having suffered an almost 50% loss of his ""visual field"" in his left eye following a brain haemorrhage. Levy was travelling above the speed limit when he hit the Kirkups on St Cuthbert's Way Simon Perkins, defending, said Levy ""recognises the dreadful wrong he has brought on this family"". Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, said: ""You knew full well you shouldn't be driving without glasses. You chose to ignore that. ""That was an utterly dangerous and cavalier attitude."" Levy was jailed for five years and four months, and banned from driving for eight years.

"Ramy, 13, is being credited with calling for help and preventing a tragedy One of the children caught up in an attack on a school bus in Italy is being hailed by his classmates for saving everyone on board. The bus driver allegedly hijacked the vehicle and its 51 schoolchildren near Milan, then set it on fire. Children interviewed by Italian media said 13-year-old Ramy Shehata hid his mobile phone when the driver confiscated them from other students. The police were then phoned. ""He is our hero"", one classmate said. The driver, named as 47-year-old Ousseynou Sy, allegedly told the children: ""No-one will survive."" Italy's Ansa news agency reports that Ramy made the call while pretending to pray in Arabic - but was in fact issuing a warning to his father. His father told Ansa that the family came from Egypt, and Ramy was born in 2005 in Italy - but has never been issued official citizenship documentation. ""My son did his duty, it would be nice if he got Italian citizenship now,"" he told the news agency. ""We would love to stay in this country. When I met him yesterday I hugged him hard."" Everyone escaped the burning bus with the help of police who located it Police vehicles located the bus and forced it to a stop before the driver, during a stand-off with police, set it alight, having already doused the vehicle in petrol. Italy's La Reppublica newspaper reports that all the hammers to break glass had been deliberately removed from the vehicle. The children were rescued from the rear windows after they were broken by police. Roberto Manucci, a police officer who helped in the rescue, said: ""The thing that struck me most was the children... that will, that strength to save themselves and to get out."" Investigators are turning their attention to the driver Ousseynou Sy, an Italian citizen of Senegalese origin. During the hijacking, he reportedly told the captured schoolchildren he was prompted by the deaths of African migrants crossing the sea. A police spokesman also said that during the standoff, he had shouted ""stop the deaths at sea, I'll carry out a massacre"". Italy's government has taken a hard-line stance against migration from northern Africa, curtailing search and rescue operations - which humanitarian groups say endangers lives. Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, a key architect of that policy, has referred to the suspect as ""a Senegalese with Italian citizenship"" rather than calling him an Italian. Ousseynou S told police his actions were a ""personal decision"" Alberto Nobili, head of counter-terrorism at the Milan public prosecutor's offices, said the suspect had not linked himself to any banned groups or movements. He told reporters the suspect had said ""it was my personal choice, I could no longer see children torn apart by sharks in the Mediterranean Sea, pregnant women dead"". Ansa reports that he recorded a video outlining his motives, which investigators are now trying to obtain from a private online account. Officials at Mr Salvini's interior ministry are considering revoking his Italian citizenship. The driver was also known to have a conviction for sexual assault - which resulted in a year-long prison sentence - and a drunk driving conviction, Mr Nobili said. Questions are now being asked about how the suspect became a school bus driver with such pre-existing convictions. Since coming into power in June, Italy's ruling right-wing League party and populist Five Star Movement have established a strong anti-immigration stance. Located at the frontline of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea into Europe, Italy has tried to close its ports to boats. On Tuesday, around 50 people were rescued by a charity ship from a rubber boat off the coast of Libya and taken to the island of Lampedusa. Italian authorities ordered that the ship be seized and launched an investigation into the alleged aiding of clandestine immigration. Earlier this month,around 200,000 people attended an anti-racism march in Milan.

"Tate director Maria Balshaw said that funding for the organisation is always considered by an ethics committee Another of Britain's prestigious art institutions has decided to shun donations from the US Sackler family. The Tate's board of trustees said it would decline further donations, which comes after the withdrawal of a Â£1m National Portrait Gallery grant. The Sackler family is facing legal action over its production of opioid drugs, which are linked to deaths. Given these circumstances, it would not be right to seek or accept further donations, the Tate said. The BBC's arts editor, Will Gompertz, said the Tate's move was ""a significant moment in this ongoing story"". ""It makes it very difficult for any other arts organisation to accept Sackler money,"" he said. ""It also implicitly puts pressure on recent recipients of its donations. "" Pressure has been building on institutions to reject support from the Sackler fortune. The family owns Purdue Pharma, seller of the prescription painkiller OxyContin, which has earned billions of dollars for the company. Purdue faces claims it misled regulators over the dangers of Oxycontin, held responsible for helping to fuel the US opioid crisis which has led to thousands of deaths. The Sackler family has ""vigorously denied"" the allegations against it. The Tate has received about Â£4m from Sackler family trusts over several years, including Â£1m in 2008 and Â£1m in 2015, which went towards funding the new Tate Modern building. But the institution said in a statement: ""The Sackler family has given generously to Tate in the past, as they have to a large number of UK arts institutions.

"The descendant of a black American slave has sued Harvard University, claiming the college profits from images of her alleged ancestor. The pictures, commissioned in 1850 by a professor seeking to prove that black people were inferior, is believed to among the first photos of US slaves. Tamara Lanier's lawsuit says the school is ""perpetuating the systematic subversion of black property rights"". It comes as several US universities grapple with their racist histories. Harvard spokesman Jonathan Swain told the Associated Press the university ""has not yet been served, and with that is in no position to comment on this complaint"". The images, which were daguerreotypes, an early type of photograph, were made in a studio in South Carolina, and show a man known as Renty, stripped naked to the waist, along with his daughter Delia. The pictures were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, who used them to argue for slavery in the US. Ms Lanier, a retired probation officer who claims to be the great-great-great-granddaughter of Renty, asks in her lawsuit for Harvard to return the images to her family, pay unspecified damages to her and acknowledge that it was ""complicit in perpetuating and justifying the institution of slavery"". It remains unclear whether Ms Lanier can prove her genetic lineage to the man she calls ""Papa Renty"" and grew up hearing bed time stories about. Tamara Lanier has asked the Ivy League school to return the photo to her family, acknowledge her ancestry and pay damages ""What I hope we're able to accomplish is to show the world who Renty is,"" she said at a news conference in New York City on Wednesday. ""I think this case is important because it will test the moral climate of this country and force this country to reckon with its long history of racism."" The 'Underground Railroad': A secret network that helped slaves find freedom According to her complaint: ""By denying Ms Lanier's superior claim to the daguerreotypes, Harvard is perpetuating the systematic subversion of black property rights that began during slavery and continued for a century thereafter."" The images were discovered in 1976 in a storage attic at Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. According to unearthed records, Renty was born in Congo. Ms Lanier says she attended a 2017 conference at Harvard on the links between academia and slavery in which an image of Renty was projected over the speakers. Ta-Nehisi Coates, who wrote a popular essay about paying reparations to black Americans for slavery and discrimination, attended the conference and told the New York Times that he understands why Ms Lanier was offended. ""That photograph is like a hostage photograph,""he said,external. ""This is an enslaved black man with no choice being forced to participate in white supremacist propaganda - that's what that photograph was taken for."" The suit also alleges Harvard requests a large licensing fee to use the image and points to a book the university sells, From Site to Sight: Anthropology, Photography, and the Power of Imagery, for $40 (Â£31). A lawyer for Ms Lanier, civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said: ""These photographs make it clear that Harvard benefited from slavery then and continues to benefit now. By my calculation, Renty is 169 years a slave. When will Harvard finally set him free?"" Harvard is one among several elite US universities criticised for failing to recognise their racist legacies. In 2016 a member of Yale University's kitchen staff was arrested after he smashed a stained glass window depicting slaves toiling in a field, telling police that ""no employee should be subject to coming to work and seeing slave portraits on a daily basis"". The charges against Corey Menafee, who is black,were later dropped,external. Georgetown University vows to help slave descendants Harvard scraps crest in slavery row In 2017, Georgetown University in Washington DC apologised for selling 272 slaves in the early 1800s and offered an admissions advantage to the descendants of the men, women and children who were sold in order to cancel the university's debt. Harvard Law School removed its official seal in 2016 after it was found to have been used as the family crest of a notoriously brutal slave owner, Isaac Royall, who was known to have ordered 77 enslaved people to be burned alive.

"Alice Cutter and Mark Jones deny being part of banned neo-Nazi group National Action A woman who entered a ""Miss Hitler"" beauty pageant was obsessed with ""ethnic cleansing"", a court has heard. Alice Cutter has denied being a member of a banned neo-Nazi organisation. The 22-year-old is standing trial alongside her partner, Mark Jones, who is accused of being a ""leader and strategist"" for National Action. Birmingham Crown Court heard they shared an ""obsession with knives, guns and the ideology of violent ethnic cleansing"". Mr Jones, 24, and Ms Cutter, both of Mulhalls Mill, Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, have pleaded not guilty to being members of National Action between December 2016 and September 2017. Garry Jack, 23, from Heathland Avenue, Birmingham, and 18-year-old Connor Scothern, of Bagnall Avenue, Nottingham, have denied the same charge. Connor Scothern denies being part of the banned extremist group National Action Prosecutor Barnaby Jameson QC told the jury Ms Cutter ""was a central spoke in the National Action wheel"", having been photographed giving the Nazi salute on the steps of Leeds Town Hall in May 2016. Mr Jameson said that, in a private chat group with a convicted National Action member, she said she wanted to play football with the head of a Jewish person. Meanwhile, Mr Jameson said Mr Scothern ""came to Nazism via a circuitous route"". ""He was drawn apparently to communism at one stage, and for a short time when he was 12 or 13 practised Islam. ""But make no mistake, however, that when Scothern found Nazism he never looked back,"" he said. The trial continues.

"The Brexit operations are taking place at the main MoD building in Whitehall The Ministry of Defence has set up an operations room in a bunker at its main Whitehall building to deal with a potential no-deal Brexit. The preparations are being run under the banner of Operation Redfold - although officials stress they are part of wider cross-government planning.

A draft European Council document says theUK could be offered a Brexit delayto 22 May on the condition MPs approve the withdrawal deal the prime minister has agreed with EU leaders. But the government has been preparing for a potential no-deal in the event Theresa May's plans are rejected.

May 'hopes' UK will leave EU with a deal How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? It is not the most popular ever on the Parliament website. A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address, and postcode to sign. Data from the petitions website on Thursday evening suggested 1.3m signatures were from people who said they were from the UK, 10,000 from France, nearly 6,000 from Spain and more than 4,000 from Germany, among others. A Commons spokesman said signature patterns are investigated to check for fraudulent activity and suspect signatures are removed, including those that are ""clearly bots"". He added: ""Anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition. This includes British citizens living overseas."" By BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler Petitions on the Parliament website rarely lead to a change in the law. They are not even guaranteed to lead to a debate in Parliament - they only get considered for debate if they reach 100,000 signatures. The petitions committee rejects them if it believes the UK government can't do anything about the issue. But what petitions can do is put an issue on the political radar - and that is what appears to have happened with the petition to revoke Article 50. It was previously something of a taboo subject at Westminster. Even the most ardent anti-Brexiteers know it would be political suicide for any prime minister to overturn a referendum result without going back to the people. But some Remainer MPs are now calling on social media for the government to do just that. Earlier Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the petition as not being on the same scale as the pro-Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum. ""Should it reach 17.4 million respondents then I am sure there will be a very clear case for taking action,"" she told MPs. She added: ""It's absolutely right that people do have the opportunity to put their views and that can then spark yet another Brexit debate."" In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Few MPs have mentioned this as a potential option so far.

Margaret Anne Georgiadou, who started the petition, told the BBC: ""I became like every other Remainer - very frustrated that we've been silenced and ignored for so long. ""So I think now it's almost like a dam bursting, because we've been held back in a sense - it's almost like last chance saloon now."" She said the petition ""didn't do very well for a week"". ""I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,"" she added. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 371,673 signatures. MPs have been sharing the revoke Article 50 petition on social media, including Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, who said Mrs May's ""cliff-edge ultimatum"" had led ""hundreds of thousands"" to sign.

Pete Wishart, who was among a number of SNP MPs who shared the petition, called on the public to sign and ""end the madness"". And Labour MP Neil Coyle urged the public to sign. But Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the only way to rule out a no-deal Brexit ""at all"" was to back the prime minister's deal. A House of Commons spokesperson said the site crashed on Thursday morning because of ""a large and sustained load on the system"". The petition reads: ""The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. ""We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."" The government will have a third try at getting MPs to back Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in a Commons vote next week, but only if it thinks it has enough support to win. At the same time, a cross-party group of MPs will try to give Parliament control of Brexit by allowing a series of ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to the PM's deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted MPs only had a ""limited"" range of options ""if we are in the same situation this time next week"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament could vote to revoke Article 50, which is cancelling the Brexit process. I think that's highly unlikely."" He said the other, more likely, options were leaving without a deal, or having a longer extension granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" he said. What happens now that a deal's been done? How does another Brexit delay work?

"Aaron Campbell, 16, was given a minimum jail term of 27 years The 16-year-old who raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has been sentenced to a minimum of 27 years behind bars after he finally admitted his crime. During his trial, Aaron Campbell had repeatedly denied he abducted, raped and killed the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute last July. But he admitted his offences to a psychologist preparing a report to the court ahead of his sentencing. Judge Lord Matthews imposed a life sentence for the ""brutal"" murder. He set the punishment part of the sentence, before Campbell can apply for parole, at 27 years. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Read the judge's sentencing statement in full,external Lord Matthews said Campbell's crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief"". He said Alesha had been violated and murdered and told Campbell he was a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The judge read out Campbell's ""cold blooded and horrific"" account of his actions that night and how he described seeing Alesha asleep in her room as ""a moment of opportunity"". Campbell's confession was contained in the criminal justice social report and the criminal psychologist's report, which were prepared ahead of his sentencing. The report by the forensic clinical psychologist Dr Gary Macpherson quoted Campbell as saying: ""At any other time in life murder would not have been the conclusion. ""If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence In his sentencing statement, the judge said the teenager had shown breathtaking arrogance during the trial and had failed to plead guilty despite overwhelming evidence against him. He said he had shown ""a staggering lack of remorse"". ""Not once did I detect a flicker of emotion from you,"" the judge said. Lord Matthews said it would be for others to decide if Campbell would ever be released, indeed, he said his reintegration into society might be ""impossible"". During his nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow last month, Campbell claimed he had never met his victim and lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. The judge said this was a ""cruel travesty of the truth"" and said the woman he blamed, Toni McLachlan, was ""completely innocent"". Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial The judge said he was ""shocked"" by the clear admissions of guilt in the background reports, especially after the ""tissue of lies"" Campbell had told in court. The psychologist said that on the night of Alesha's death Campbell had been drinking and wanted cannabis so he decided to go into her father's home to get some. Alesha's father had previously sold him the drug. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' In his sentencing statement, Lord Matthews said Campbell had carried Alesha to a secluded spot where he raped and murdered her ""in the most brutal fashion"". He told the teenager: ""You said that Alesha was drowsy and became a bit more awake when you went out. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead ""At one point she asked who you were and where you were going. ""You said you were a friend of her father and that you were taking her home."" Campbell gave Alesha his coat because she was cold. The judge said that over the next few days Campbell was unconcerned about what had happened, and was ""slightly amused"" that the police had not caught him. The court heard that the teenager had said he was ""quite satisfied by the murder"". Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane leaves court after the sentencing The judge said Campbell told Dr Macpherson that at points during the trial it took ""everything to stop laughing"" and he had to ""zip his mouth"". Lord Matthews said the reports concluded that Campbell was not suffering from a mental health disorder but showed a total lack of victim empathy. Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was just days into a holiday when she was abducted from her bed. She was reported missing from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, near Rothesay, at 06:23 on 2 July last year. Dozens of islanders joined the search for the child but at 08:54 her naked body was discovered in a wooded area in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. After the sentence was read out family members shouted ""evil"" and ""beast"" as Campbell was led down to the cells. Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Identity of Alesha's killer revealed.

"NHS Lothian has written to nearly 200 patients who underwent heart surgery in the last six months to warn them of a potentially deadly infection risk. The move comes after a review found six patients who were operated on had contracted an infection. NHS Lothian said it is thought the infections may have been acquired during surgery and that ""a number"" of those patients later died. However, the health board refused to reveal how many deaths were involved. Health officials have now written to 186 patients operated on at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in the last six months to warn them of the potential risk of an unusual strain of heart valve infection known as endocarditis. The fungal mould infection can take up to six months to materialise and patients are being advised of the symptoms. As a precaution, four operations planned for this week at the hospital have been cancelled to allow for specialist cleaning and disinfection of the theatres. A number of hospitals across Scotland have been dealing with infections which have led to patients dying in recent months, including Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, wherea 10-year-old boy contracted the Cryptococcus infection, related to pigeon droppings. Prof Alex McMahon, executive lead for infection control for NHS Lothian, said:  ""We extend our sincere apologies and deepest condolences to the families of the patients who died, all of whom were informed at the time of their treatment that they had an unusual and difficult-to-treat infection. ""Many patients receiving this type of surgery are already very ill and vulnerable to infection so we place the highest importance on a stringent infection prevention and control regime. "" He added: ""We have contacted patients purely as a precaution. ""Although this risk is very low and we do not anticipate any more cases, we know that it can take up to six months for these infections to materialise."" Notification letters have been sent to 186 patients about the potential infection risk Endocarditis occurs in 0.5% of patients per year, and usually the source is the patient's own body. Medications similar to antibiotics are available to treat the infection but can have limited impact on patients who are already very ill. Jane Claire Judson, chief executive of Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland, said:  ""This is concerning. Families have lost loved ones and people will be shocked and worried when they receive these letters.  They will need reassurance. ""NHS Lothian is one of the national centres for this kind of surgery, so it's important that any people beyond Lothian are also given the support they need."" ""If you don't feel well you should go straight to your GP - and bring your letter with you to make sure you can go through any concerns you have."" NHS Lothian said it convened an incident management team after a case of endocarditis was reported and they looked through the infection records of thousands of patients who had many different types of surgery carried out since the beginning of 2015. The team found that six patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery over a period of 18 months where affected by what the health board described as ""unusual infections caused by micro organisms commonly found in the environment"". A number of those patients later died but the board refused to say how many on ""patient confidentiality"" grounds. No cases were found prior to March 2017 and there have been no known cases in patients operated on since November 2018. Do hospitals make you sick?

"The descendant of a black American slave has sued Harvard University, claiming the college profits from images of her alleged ancestor. The pictures, commissioned in 1850 by a professor seeking to prove that black people were inferior, is believed to among the first photos of US slaves. Tamara Lanier's lawsuit says the school is ""perpetuating the systematic subversion of black property rights"". It comes as several US universities grapple with their racist histories. Harvard spokesman Jonathan Swain told the Associated Press the university ""has not yet been served, and with that is in no position to comment on this complaint"". The images, which were daguerreotypes, an early type of photograph, were made in a studio in South Carolina, and show a man known as Renty, stripped naked to the waist, along with his daughter Delia. The pictures were commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, who used them to argue for slavery in the US. Ms Lanier, a retired probation officer who claims to be the great-great-great-granddaughter of Renty, asks in her lawsuit for Harvard to return the images to her family, pay unspecified damages to her and acknowledge that it was ""complicit in perpetuating and justifying the institution of slavery"". It remains unclear whether Ms Lanier can prove her genetic lineage to the man she calls ""Papa Renty"" and grew up hearing bed time stories about. Tamara Lanier has asked the Ivy League school to return the photo to her family, acknowledge her ancestry and pay damages ""What I hope we're able to accomplish is to show the world who Renty is,"" she said at a news conference in New York City on Wednesday. ""I think this case is important because it will test the moral climate of this country and force this country to reckon with its long history of racism."" The 'Underground Railroad': A secret network that helped slaves find freedom According to her complaint: ""By denying Ms Lanier's superior claim to the daguerreotypes, Harvard is perpetuating the systematic subversion of black property rights that began during slavery and continued for a century thereafter."" The images were discovered in 1976 in a storage attic at Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. According to unearthed records, Renty was born in Congo. Ms Lanier says she attended a 2017 conference at Harvard on the links between academia and slavery in which an image of Renty was projected over the speakers. Ta-Nehisi Coates, who wrote a popular essay about paying reparations to black Americans for slavery and discrimination, attended the conference and told the New York Times that he understands why Ms Lanier was offended. ""That photograph is like a hostage photograph,""he said,external. ""This is an enslaved black man with no choice being forced to participate in white supremacist propaganda - that's what that photograph was taken for."" The suit also alleges Harvard requests a large licensing fee to use the image and points to a book the university sells, From Site to Sight: Anthropology, Photography, and the Power of Imagery, for $40 (Â£31). A lawyer for Ms Lanier, civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said: ""These photographs make it clear that Harvard benefited from slavery then and continues to benefit now. By my calculation, Renty is 169 years a slave. When will Harvard finally set him free?"" Harvard is one among several elite US universities criticised for failing to recognise their racist legacies. In 2016 a member of Yale University's kitchen staff was arrested after he smashed a stained glass window depicting slaves toiling in a field, telling police that ""no employee should be subject to coming to work and seeing slave portraits on a daily basis"". The charges against Corey Menafee, who is black,were later dropped,external. Georgetown University vows to help slave descendants Harvard scraps crest in slavery row In 2017, Georgetown University in Washington DC apologised for selling 272 slaves in the early 1800s and offered an admissions advantage to the descendants of the men, women and children who were sold in order to cancel the university's debt. Harvard Law School removed its official seal in 2016 after it was found to have been used as the family crest of a notoriously brutal slave owner, Isaac Royall, who was known to have ordered 77 enslaved people to be burned alive.

"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted of the 1988 bombing Five former members of the Stasi, the intelligence service in communist East Germany, have been questioned over the Lockerbie bombing. A German state prosecutor has confirmed the five were spoken to at the request of authorities in Scotland. It is part of the ongoing criminal inquiry into the atrocity 30 years ago. According to reports in Germany, the individuals were in their 70s and 80s, and were interviewed as witnesses, not suspects, over the last nine months. ""These are solely witness interrogations,"" a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in Frankfurt an der Oder, on the Polish border was quoted as saying by Germany's dpa news agency. Pan Am flight 103 was brought down by a bomb over southern Scotland on 21 December, 1988. All 259 passengers and crew were killed, along with 11 residents of the town of Lockerbie. In 2001, a Scottish court sitting in the Netherlands ruled that the bombing had been carried out by Abdelbaset al Megrahi, a member of the Libyan intelligence service. Megrahi continued to protest his innocence until his death in Libya in 2012. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds in 2009 when he had terminal cancer, and died three years later in Tripoli. Prosecutors at Scotland's Crown Office have always said that Megrahi did not act alone and was one of a number of Libyans involved in bombing the plane. The prosecution case was that the bomb was placed in an unaccompanied suitcase and smuggled onto a plane from Malta to Frankfurt, where it was loaded onto a feeder flight to Heathrow and then into the hold of Pan Am 103. In 2015, the Crown Office asked the Libyan authorities for permission to interview two unnamed men who were in custody following the revolution which toppled Colonel Gaddafi's regime. Prosecutors said there was a ""proper basis in law"" to treat the men as suspects. The men were Abdullah Senussi, Gaddafi's brother in law and former intelligence chief and Mohammed Abuagila Masud. Senussi had been sentenced to death by a Libyan court that year but is still alive and in custody. Masud was sentenced by the same court to 10 years in prison for bomb-making. The prosecution at the Lockerbie trial alleged that Masud had been with Megrahi on the day the bomb brought down Pan Am 103. Former Stasi agents gave evidence during the trial about the agency's involvement with a Swiss businessman who was said to have made the timer which triggered the Lockerbie bomb. The Stasi also featured in a documentary broadcast in 2015. It was made by American filmmaker Ken Dornstein, whose brother was on board Pan Am 103. Eleven people in Lockerbie died along with 259 passengers and crew from the plane The programme claimed that the Stasi had carried out surveillance on Libyan agents who bombed a disco in West Berlin in 1986. Three people were killed, including two American servicemen.   The documentary said the Stasi had information that Masud was in West Berlin when the disco was attacked. Lockerbie: The town scarred by terror Farmer's tribute to Lockerbie victims Finding words to describe Lockerbie On the 30th anniversary of the bombing last December, the Crown Office said the ongoing criminal inquiry had uncovered ""intelligence and information supportive of the original trial court's finding that the bombing was Libyan state-sponsored terrorism in which Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was a key player"". The Crown said its investigations were also contributing evidence in relation to other individuals ""involved in the conspiracy to commit the atrocity"". Asked about the questioning of the former Stasi agents, the Crown Office said: ""Prosecutors and police, working with UK government and US colleagues, will continue this investigation with the sole aim of bringing those who acted along with al Megrahi to justice. As this is a live criminal investigation, it would not be appropriate to comment."" Megrahi always protested his innocence. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently carrying out its own inquiry to decide whether his case should be referred back to the appeal court.

A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address, and postcode to sign. Data from the petitions website on Thursday evening suggested 1.3m signatures were from people who said they were from the UK, 10,000 from France, nearly 6,000 from Spain and more than 4,000 from Germany, among others. A Commons spokesman said signature patterns are investigated to check for fraudulent activity and suspect signatures are removed, including those that are ""clearly bots"". He added: ""Anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition. This includes British citizens living overseas."" By BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler Petitions on the Parliament website rarely lead to a change in the law. They are not even guaranteed to lead to a debate in Parliament - they only get considered for debate if they reach 100,000 signatures. The petitions committee rejects them if it believes the UK government can't do anything about the issue. But what petitions can do is put an issue on the political radar - and that is what appears to have happened with the petition to revoke Article 50. It was previously something of a taboo subject at Westminster. Even the most ardent anti-Brexiteers know it would be political suicide for any prime minister to overturn a referendum result without going back to the people. But some Remainer MPs are now calling on social media for the government to do just that. Earlier Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the petition as not being on the same scale as the pro-Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum. ""Should it reach 17.4 million respondents then I am sure there will be a very clear case for taking action,"" she told MPs. She added: ""It's absolutely right that people do have the opportunity to put their views and that can then spark yet another Brexit debate."" In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Few MPs have mentioned this as a potential option so far. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The petition has long since passed the 100,000 signatures that means it will be considered for debate. Margaret Anne Georgiadou, who started the petition, told the BBC: ""I became like every other Remainer - very frustrated that we've been silenced and ignored for so long. ""So I think now it's almost like a dam bursting, because we've been held back in a sense - it's almost like last chance saloon now."" She said the petition ""didn't do very well for a week"". ""I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,"" she added. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 371,673 signatures. MPs have been sharing the revoke Article 50 petition on social media, including Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, who said Mrs May's ""cliff-edge ultimatum"" had led ""hundreds of thousands"" to sign.

Pete Wishart, who was among a number of SNP MPs who shared the petition, called on the public to sign and ""end the madness"". And Labour MP Neil Coyle urged the public to sign. But Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the only way to rule out a no-deal Brexit ""at all"" was to back the prime minister's deal. A House of Commons spokesperson said the site crashed on Thursday morning because of ""a large and sustained load on the system"". The petition reads: ""The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. ""We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."" The government will have a third try at getting MPs to back Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in a Commons vote next week, but only if it thinks it has enough support to win. At the same time, a cross-party group of MPs will try to give Parliament control of Brexit by allowing a series of ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to the PM's deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted MPs only had a ""limited"" range of options ""if we are in the same situation this time next week"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament could vote to revoke Article 50, which is cancelling the Brexit process. I think that's highly unlikely."" He said the other, more likely, options were leaving without a deal, or having a longer extension granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" he said. What happens now that a deal's been done? How does another Brexit delay work?

"The University of Hull philosophy student was last seen sitting on a bench on Beverley Road Police searching for missing Hull student Libby Squire have confirmed a body recovered from the Humber estuary is that of a woman. Post-mortem tests on the body, which was found close to Spurn Point on Wednesday afternoon, are taking place. Humberside Police said there had been no formal identification but ""we have been in contact and informed those that needed to be made aware of the recovery"". Ms Squire was last seen on 1 February. The 21-year-old University of Hull philosophy student, originally from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was seen just after midnight at the junction of Beverley Road and Haworth Street in Hull following a night out. The body was taken to Grimsby docks after being found in the Humber estuary The body was recovered at around 15:30 GMT on Wednesday and taken to Grimsby Docks, police said. The post-mortem is expected to last for the rest of the day. More stories across East Yorkshire here Humberside Police said: ""Formal identification is still yet to take place and we remain unable at this stage to confirm her identity."" Hundreds of uniformed officers and around 50 detectives have been searching ""around the clock"" for Ms Squire, with specialist search advisors, underwater officers, the fire service, police dogs, local businesses and the public also involved. A 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of abduction remains a person of interest, police said. Pawel Relowicz, of Raglan Street, Hull, is remanded in custody on unrelated charges of burglary, voyeurism, outraging public decency and receiving stolen goods. On the night of her disappearance, detectives think Ms Squire got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house in Wellesley Avenue at about 23:30, where her mobile phone was found. They do not believe she entered the house and have said her phone ""has not provided any further insight as to her movements that night"". She was spotted on CCTV 10 minutes later near a bench on Beverley Road, where it is thought a motorist stopped to offer her help. Ms Squire, who is 5ft 7in tall and has long dark brown hair, was wearing a black leather jacket, black long-sleeved top and a black denim skirt with lace when she was last seen.

"Stuart Levy claimed the Kirkups had run out when the lights were on green A speeding driver who was not wearing his glasses when he hit a mother and her son on a pedestrian crossing has been jailed for more than five years. Shantelle Kirkup died after being struck on St Cuthbert's Way, Darlington, in May last year. Her ""last act of care"" was to propel her six-year-old son out of the path of Stuart Levy. Levy, 37, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He displayed an ""utterly dangerous and cavalier attitude"", Teesside Crown Court heard. Shantelle Kirkup had married seven months before her death Levy had been out to collect his methadone prescription and had drunk his daily dose before the crash. Having undertaken another vehicle as he approached the crossing, his Ford Focus hit 29-year-old Mrs Kirkup as she held the hand of her son, Jaxon. Her new husband, James, had been pushing their two-year-old daughter, Jemima, in a buggy and had crossed the road ahead of them. Mr Kirkup had taken his son to a dinosaur show while his wife had been buying birthday presents with Jemima before the family bought ice creams. The traffic lights were on amber as they crossed but Levy failed to react until it was too late. It was estimated he was travelling at 34 to 41mph (54 to 66km/h) on the 30mph (48km/h) road when he hit the pair. Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said: ""Shantelle had hold of Jaxon's hand for his safety, that last act of care helped propel Jaxon out of the path of the vehicle thereby probably saving his life."" The youngster suffered a broken leg. Levy, of Rocket Street, Darlington, told police he had been wearing his glasses and said the Kirkups had run out when the lights were on green. Those claims were shown to be lies - Levy's spectacles were broken and found later at his ex-partner's home. He knew he needed to wear them having suffered an almost 50% loss of his ""visual field"" in his left eye following a brain haemorrhage. Levy was travelling above the speed limit when he hit the Kirkups on St Cuthbert's Way Simon Perkins, defending, said Levy ""recognises the dreadful wrong he has brought on this family"". Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, said: ""You knew full well you shouldn't be driving without glasses. You chose to ignore that. ""That was an utterly dangerous and cavalier attitude."" Levy was jailed for five years and four months, and banned from driving for eight years.

"Every school should have a dog or another pet to reduce stress in the classroom, says Sir Anthony Seldon. The University of Buckingham vice-chancellor says it is ""a powerfully cost-effective way of helping children feel more secure at schools"". Sir Anthony was speaking at a conference about the need to improve young people's sense of wellbeing. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says more schools seem to have ""wellbeing dogs"" and ""the pets can really help"". The University of Buckingham's Ultimate Wellbeing in Education Conference examined how to respond to the stresses and anxieties facing young people. Mr Hinds told the conference that the relentless presence of social media made growing up ""more pressurised"". He said this could be all-pervasive for teenagers, making them compare their own experiences with the ""perfect lives"" on social media. Dog helps pupils with reading at primary school in Somerset School with dog subject of TV documentary Why a Bristol school has a dog on its staff University switches off social media to help wellbeing It could also normalise exposure to harmful material on subjects like self-harm or eating disorders, he added. Social media creates the pressure to have ""perfect lives"", says the education secretary The education secretary called for more attention to be paid to ways of building up children's wellbeing, such as teaching emotional resilience and a sense of ""character"". Sir Anthony has been a longstanding advocate of the need for schools and universities to pay much more attention to mental health. He told the conference, held at the Westminster Academy in west London, that it was no longer possible for schools to focus solely on academic achievement without thinking about the emotional wellbeing of pupils. His campaigns have helped to raise awareness about the prevalence of mental health problems on university campuses - and he has argued for more recognition for the risks from drug use. But Sir Anthony suggested another more low-tech approach to reducing anxiety - the soothing presence of animals such as dogs. ""The quickest and biggest hit that we can make to improve mental health in our schools and to make them feel safe for children, is to have at least one dog in every single school in the country,"" said Sir Anthony. Damian Hinds said young people were under pressure from false expectations created by social media ""Because children can relate to animals when they are hurt and anxious and sad in a way that they can't always with human beings. ""It will be a powerfully cost-effective way of helping children feel more secure at schools. ""It's very easy to do, it's very cost-effective, the evidence is very clear that it works, and every single school - primary, secondary, special - should have dogs. ""It's hard to think of an easier, quicker benefit,"" he said. Universities have increasingly been bringing pets on to campuses at exam times, as a way of reducing stress. But the education secretary said that his visits had shown him how common ""wellbeing dogs"" were becoming in schools. ""This is one of those things that wasn't around when I was at school,"" said Mr Hinds. ""I hadn't really realised the incidence of it until I was education secretary. ""First I was a bit surprised, but actually it's a great thing. ""For the kids it can be really uplifting, particularly those that have different ways of expressing themselves and coming out of themselves - and the dog or the pets can really help."" But he said there were no plans for a ""central dog policy"". The school with a dog on the staff. Audio, 00:04:48The school with a dog on the staff School dog helps pupils with reading.

"Hospital doctors have dropped their 13-year opposition to the concept of helping terminally ill patients die. Following a poll of its members, the Royal College of Physicians has now adopted a neutral stance on the issue of assisted dying. Some groups have spoken out against the change, saying a respected medical body's reputation has been damaged. Others called the decision ""absurd"". Under UK law, it is illegal to encourage or assist a suicide. Nearly 7,000 doctors voted in the online poll: 43% thought the college should oppose a change in the law 32% wanted the college to support a change 25% were neutral And the college has shifted to a neutral stance because neither side achieved a majority of 60%. However, a group of doctors opposed to any change in the college's position are planning to challenge the decision to ask for a majority result. Royal College of Physicians (RCP) president Prof Andrew Goddard said: ""It is clear that there is a range of views on assisted dying in medicine, just as there is in society. ""We have been open from the start of this process that adopting a neutral position will mean that we can reflect the differing opinions among our membership. ""Neutral means the RCP neither supports nor opposes a change in the law and we won't be focusing on assisted dying in our work. ""Instead, we will continue championing high-quality palliative care services."" Dr Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of Care Not Killing, said most doctors didn't want a change in the law on assisted suicide or euthanasia. ""We hope that the RCP will listen to this message from their members and reverse their absurd decision to adopt a position that is the least popular and commands the support of just one in four of doctors,"" he said. ""This is why our view is clear, society should be doing everything in our power to prevent suicide, not assist it."" Campaign group Living and Dying Well said the shift had damaged the college's reputation as a professional body. This shift by the Royal College of Physicians has no effect on the law and does not bring assisted dying any closer. But it is symbolic that a respected body should change its stance and has been warmly welcomed by campaigners aiming to change the law. The decision has infuriated and dismayed those opposed to the change, however, who argue that it is unreasonable to demand a supermajority in order to maintain the status quo. The RCP has revealed that only one of the 39 specialisms it represents met the 60% threshold. Of palliative medicine doctors, 80% voted to maintain the college's opposition to assisted dying. This is a group who will spend more time than any other with patients at the end of life, so their view is significant. The RCP also pointed out that it had adopted a neutral position until 2006 and so this move was a return to its previous stance. The BMA, the doctors' trade union, is opposed to assisted dying. Motions calling for it to adopt a neutral position have been repeatedly rejected. Dr John Chisholm, BMA medical ethics committee chair, said: ""Our focus remains on improving the standard of palliative care available for patients, through calling for greater investment and support to enable staff to deliver the highest quality end-of-life care.""

"Theresa May has said she ""sincerely hopes"" the UK will leave the EU with a deal and she is still ""working on"" ensuring Parliament's agreement. Arriving in Brussels, she said that she had ""personal regret"" over her request to delay Brexit, but said it will allow time for MPs to make a ""final choice"". At the EU summit the PM spoke to the other 27 leaders to try to get their backing for a delay beyond 29 March. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were ""very constructive"". BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said Mrs May spoke to EU leaders for 90 minutes and was asked several times what her contingency plans were if she lost the third ""meaningful vote"" on her deal in Parliament. Live updates: PM appeals to EU leaders Revoke Article 50 petition crashes site John Bercow: MPs are not traitors Corbyn calls for Brexit compromise Your really simple guide to Brexit French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that if MPs vote down Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement next week, the UK will leave without a deal. ""In the case of a negative British vote then we'd be heading to a no deal. We all know it. And it's essential to be clear in these days and moments,"" said Mr Macron, as he arrived at the summit. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that a short Brexit delay ""should be conditional on a positive vote next week in the House of Commons"". ""We have done our best, now the solution is in London,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says no prime minister ""in living memory"" has been tested like Theresa May How the day will unfold (timings are approximate): EU leaders are discussing whether to grant the UK's request and examining other Brexit options 18:00 GMT - Press conference by European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker 18:30 GMT - Working dinner Mrs May is also expected to make a statement On her arrival in Brussels, Mrs May said: ""A short extension gives us that opportunity to decide to leave the European Union, to deliver on that result of that referendum and I sincerely hope that will be with a negotiated deal."" She added: ""I'm still working on ensuring that Parliament can agree a deal so that we can leave in an orderly way."" Earlier, speaking in the German Parliament, Angela Merkel said the EU could meet Mrs May's request to delay Brexit if in the next week there was a ""positive vote"" on the withdrawal agreement in the UK Parliament. The German Chancellor said European elections at the end of May would have to be considered during discussions on the suggested extension deadline of 30 June, adding: ""But of course we can certainly talk about a short term extension."" Beware the reports of ""huge"" differences between EU leaders when it comes to a Brexit delay and the way forward in the coming days. Take Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron: there are big differences in their political styles. And big differences in the message they want to send their own domestic audiences (tough for France; open for Germany) when talking about Brexit. But like most EU leaders - irritation, frustration and Brexit fatigue aside - they would rather avoid a costly no-deal Brexit. Chancellor Merkel, like European Council President Donald Tusk has announced she will work ""until the last hours"" to try to avoid it. And while EU leaders have ruled out re-opening the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the ""backstop"" text, you can bet they'll discuss a longer Brexit delay at their summit today. They will also discuss the short delay requested by Theresa May, in case - as the EU fears - chaos and division continue next week in Westminster. A risky pitch of Parliament versus Public How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? Dover warns of Brexit disruption risk The UK is set to leave the EU next Friday unless the law is changed. The current default position for leaving is without a withdrawal agreement. Mrs May agreed a deal with the EU, but MPs have rejected it twice. She has asked the EU for a short extension of the two-year Brexit process until 30 June, but any extension needs to be agreed to by all EU members. European Council President Donald Tusksaid he believedthe EU would agree to a short extension, but this would only be if Mrs May's deal is signed off by MPs next week. Another EU summit next week could be called in an emergency if needed, he said. Mr Tusk said the ""question remains open"" as to how long a delay the other EU leaders would support. Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar said that he appreciated the situation in London was ""somewhat chaotic"" and for that reason ""we need to cut the entire British establishment a little bit of slack on this"". He said there was ""openness to an extension"" as ""nobody wants no deal"". In her speech from Number 10 on Wednesday evening, Mrs May insisted she would not be willing to postpone Brexit any further than 30 June, despite appeals from some MPs. She added: ""Of this I am absolutely sure. You, the public, have had enough. ""You are tired of the infighting, tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children's schools, our National Health Service, knife crime. ""You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side."" She said it was now up to MPs to decide whether they wanted to leave with her deal, no deal or not to leave at all. But she warned that the latter option could cause ""irreparable damage to public trust"" in politicians. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be faced with three options if Mrs May's deal was defeated again next week: revoke Article 50; leave without a deal; or a longer extension could be granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He also defended the prime minister's statement, saying Mrs May was under ""extraordinary pressure"" and MPs have a ""special responsibility"" in a hung Parliament. Many MPs have expressed anger at Mrs May's comments, with Conservative MP Nicky Morgan telling the BBC's World at One they were ""terribly misjudged"". Fellow Tory Ben Bradley, who had backed Mrs May's deal, said they were ""not helpful"". Meanwhile,union and business leaders have written,externala joint letter to Mrs May urging her to ""change course"" in her approach to Brexit, saying the UK is facing a ""national emergency"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn have requested a meeting to discuss their concerns. They said: ""Our country is facing a national emergency. Decisions of recent days have caused the risk of no deal to soar. ""Firms and communities across the UK are not ready for this outcome. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come."" Jeremy Corbyn says consensus can be built around Labour's plan Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said talks with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr in Brussels were ""very constructive"". ""Our determination is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union next Friday,"" he said. ""We are therefore looking for alternatives and building a majority in Parliament that can agree on a future constructive economic relationship with the European Union."" He said he had been ""reaching out"" to colleagues from all parties in Parliament on this.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I hope we can all agree we are now at the moment of decision"" EU leaders have agreed on a plan to delay the Article 50 process, postponing Brexit beyond 29 March. The UK will be offered a delay until 22 May, if MPs approve the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU next week. If they do not, the EU will back a shorter delay until 12 April, allowing the UK time to get the deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". Mrs May said there was now a ""clear choice"" facing UK MPs, who could vote for a third time on her deal next week. They could back the withdrawal deal, deliver on the referendum and leave the EU in ""an orderly manner"" or face the prospect of having to stand candidates in the European Parliamentary elections, three years after the UK voted to leave the EU. She said she would be ""working hard to build support for getting the deal through"". She said she had ""expressed frustration"" in her speech last night, in which she blamed MPs for the delay, but added ""I know that MPs are frustrated too"" and she was ""very grateful"" to those who had supported the deal. ""I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward,"" she said. As it happened: EU leaders agree Brexit delay 'Cancel Brexit' petition passes 2m signatures Your really simple guide to Brexit Brexit: What could happen next? She also dismissed calls to revoke Article 50 - as a petition calling for that on the Parliament website attracted more than two million signatures - saying people had voted to leave and were told their decision would be respected.

In a press conference with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk said that, until 12 April - by when the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the 2019 European Parliament elections - ""all options remain on the table ... the UK government will still have a chance of a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50"". If the UK has not decided by 12 April whether to take part in the elections the ""option of a long extension will automatically become impossible"", he said. He added that the atmosphere was ""much better than I had expected"" among EU leaders in discussions and he was now ""much more optimistic"". Mr Juncker said the European Commission had ""worked tirelessly"" to negotiate the withdrawal deal and respond to requests from the UK for further reassurances about keeping the Northern Irish border open.Legally-binding assurances agreed in Strasbourg last weekhad been endorsed, he added. ""This closes and completes the full package. There is no more that we can have."" Discussions ran late into the evening on Thursday amid reports of disagreement between the 27 other EU leaders about the details. They are understood to have discussed potential dates of 7 May or a longer delay until the end of the year. What will EU leaders do if UK MPs reject the deal for a third time? By Reality Check's Chris Morris It's been clear for some time that EU leaders were prepared to offer a short extension of the Article 50 process. But there have been different views about how long ""short"" should be. Now we know. If the UK doesn't take part in European elections, a strict interpretation of the law rules out an extension until the end of June, which is what the Prime Minister had initially requested. That's why the 27 EU leaders offered a possible extension until 22 May, the day before voting in the elections begins. Such an extension is only on offer, though, if UK MPs vote for the Brexit deal in the House of Commons next week. And EU leaders know the numbers there don't look good for the government. So their second offer is a much shorter extension until 12 April, by which time the UK would have to legislate for holding elections in May. The government has insisted that it has no intention of taking part in the elections. But the language used by the EU keeps the possibility of UK participation open. That means that a much longer extension has not been ruled out, even though that too is an idea that has been rejected by Theresa May in the past. So the legal and political calculations that surround the EU's offer are complex, and the outcome is difficult to predict. But one thing is clear - barring dramatic developments, it confirms that the UK will not be leaving the EU on 29 March as originally intended.

"Jeremy Corbyn says he is seeking a ""constructive alternative"" to the PM's deal, in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader was speaking after meeting the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, for talks in Brussels. It comes ahead of an EU summit where Theresa May will ask EU leaders to postpone Brexit for three months. Mr Corbyn said he did not believe the PM's deal ""is a way forward"". ""We are therefore looking at alternatives, and building a majority in Parliament that can agree on a future constructive economic relationship with the European Union,"" he told reporters after the meeting. Mr Corbyn was joined by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer for the talks, which also included European Commission Secretary-General Martin Selmayr. Brexit: Theresa May at Brussels EU summit to urge short delay Brexit delay: How can Article 50 be extended? He is also expected to meet seven European leaders at the two-day summit, which begins later. Mr Corbyn has faced criticism after walking out of a Brexit meeting with the PM on Wednesday because Labour defectors, who are now members of the Independent Group, turned up. Independent Group spokesman Chuka Umunna described the Labour leader's behaviour as ""juvenile"" at a time of national crisis. After the meeting, other opposition party leaders said they were unimpressed with what they heard from the prime minister. Mr Corbyn said there had been ""a confusion"" over the meeting, and he had held separate discussions with Mrs May later on. ""I'm also arranging to meet the prime minister next week again on a one-to-one basis,"" he added. Labour has backed an extension of Brexit talks to find an alternative to the prime minister's deal which will command a majority in the Commons. On Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said Labour's plans were ""not credible"", and the party was asking for ""things that are simply not on offer"".

"The ferry was on its way to this tourist island upstream from the city centre Almost 100 people are reported to have died after a ferry sank in the Tigris river in Iraq's city of Mosul. Most of the victims were women and children, the interior ministry said. It is thought nearly 200 people were on board. The ferry was heading towards a tourist island as part of new year celebrations. Mosul's civil defence agency reportedly said most on board could not swim. At least 19 children and 61 women were among the 94 people said to have died, and 55 people were rescued. The vessel was on its way to Umm Rabaen island, a tourist area about 4km (2.5 miles) upstream and north of the city centre. People across the region are celebrating Nowruz, the new year festival. Footage shows the ferry tilting sharply to the right and taking on water, before flipping over entirely and being dragged swiftly downstream by the fast-flowing river. Images on social media showed the upturned vessel and people floating in the current. ""It was carrying too many passengers, so the water began to rush onboard and the ferry became heavier and overturned,"" one passenger told AFP news agency. ""With my own eyes I saw dead children in the water."" Ambulances and helicopters arrived to help survivors and search for the bodies of those who died. Authorities had reportedly warned people about rising water levels as the gates of the Mosul dam had been opened, and some are accusing the ship operator of ignoring the advice. Iraq's justice ministry reportedly ordered the arrest of nine ferry company workers, and barred the ship's owners and the owners of the tourist site from leaving Iraq. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi meanwhile has ordered an investigation ""to determine responsibilities"". In a statementMr Mahdi said he was following the story ""with pain and sadness"",external, and had ordered ""all state efforts"" to find survivors and treat victims. The prime minister later toured a hospital and a morgue in the city, and declared three days of national mourning. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert,the special representative for Iraq of the United Nations secretary general, said it was a ""terrible tragedy"",external. ""Our hearts go out to the families and relatives of the victims,"" she said in a statement. However, local information accountMosul Eye reports that security forces are trying to arrest journalists reporting on the ferry sinking,external. Iraqi soldiers helped join the search for survivors So far dozens of people have been saved from the waters People are celebrating Nowruz, the Kurdish new year festival Mosul lies 400 km (250 miles) north of Iraq's capital Baghdad on the river Tigris, and is home to up to 2 million people. The city was captured by the Islamic State group in June 2014 and became its de-facto capital. It was not liberated until July 2017 after a nine-month battle that left large parts of the city in ruins.

"Steven Fairbairn proposed to Abbey Green just two weeks ago A British man has died after crashing in an off-road rally in Texas. Steven Fairbairn, 25, from Newcastle, died in hospital on Saturday from multiple injuries after a 4x4 vehicle he was in crashed at the Rednecks with Paychecks Spring Break event. He moved to Oklahoma in 2017 and had proposed to his partner two weeks ago. Mr Fairbairn's family say they still have unanswered questions about Saturday's crash. The organisers have been approached for comment. The death has been ruled an accident due to ""blunt head trauma"", according to the Tarrant County medical examiner's office. Mr Fairbairn's fiancÃ© Abbey Green toldDallas-based WFAA television,external: ""I remember preparing for the worst but hoping so bad there was something they could do. ""It took a little while to find out where they were going to take him, but I knew that when it was a hospital that was 80 miles away, it wasn't good."" Mr Fairbairn moved to Duncan in Oklahoma 18 months ago She said Mr Fairbairn, like others who attended the event, were asked to sign a waiver, which she described as ""signing your life away"". Local media have reported the 4x4 he was driving collided head-on with another all-terrain vehicle at the festival in Saint Jo, 75 miles north-west of Dallas.

"Term time holidays were behind 85% of fines for absences from schools in 2017-18 The number of fines issued to parents in England for taking children on term time holidays has almost doubled in a year, statistics show. Penalty notices rose by 93% to almost 223,000 in 2017-18. Jon Platt, a father who lost aSupreme Court battleagainst a fine, said he felt ""partly responsible"" for the rise. ""Unauthorised family holiday absence"" was the most common reason for attendance fines, the Department for Education (DfE) said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Can't see the map?Tap or click here,external Councils can require parents to pay Â£60 each per child taken out of school without permission. This rises to Â£120 if not paid within 21 days, and after 28 days parents can be prosecuted. Overall in 2017-18 there were 260,877 penalty notices issued for unauthorised absence from school. Of these, just over one in 10 was withdrawn. There were 19,518 prosecutions in England in 2017-18 for non-payment of the fines, up from 13,324 the year before. Mr Platt say there is no evidence to suggest term time holidays impact on a child's education Jon Platt, from the Isle of Wight, said he felt ""partly responsible"" for fines increasing in the past year. He was fined after taking his daughter on holiday to Florida during term time and challenged the case in the courts. In 2017 he lost thecase in the Supreme Court. Since the ruling he said the law had become ""harsher and stricter"". ""There is clarity [on the law] but it's a draconian clarity,"" he said. ""It's disappointing to see that where there were tens of thousands of parents being fined, it's now hundreds of thousands."" Mr Platt has now put his children into private education, exempting himself from further fines from the council. ""I would very much like the government to look at this again, but I don't think they will,"" he added. In a report accompanying the statistics the DfE said it had contacted councils following the court case. It said all six that responded said the Supreme Court judgement in this case ""had an effect on the number of penalty notices issued in 2017-18, either as a result of returning to pre-court case levels following a slowdown or from a change in behaviour as a result of the ruling."" Why am I paying more tax to the police? Katie Price denies abuse outside school Smear-test mums offered free childcare The Campaign for Real Education said fines should be used a ""last resort"". Its chairman, retired head teacher Chris McGovern, said taking a child out of school for a ""cheap holiday"" could be a ""remarkably selfish action"". He said term time holidays were disruptive to the absent student and the rest of the class. ""Teachers are distracted from their regular teaching by having to help the absentees to catch up,"" he said. He added term time holidays were mostly ""for the benefit of the parents, rather than the children"". Jane Lynch says there is no flexibility in the system which creates a ""negative"" atmosphere Jane Lynch, from Margate, said she budgets for the cost of fines when planning a trip because it was still cheaper than paying full price during the school break. The 37-year-old, who works with her husband in childcare, said prices ""double"" after term finishes. She says this has an additional cost because there is more work available for her during school holidays. ""We never take them out near exam periods,"" she said. ""We can't see how going away once a year hurts."" Head teachers used to be able to allow pupil 10 days of leave in ""special circumstances"" Parents are responsible for ensuring their children receive an education. The can be found guilty of an offence if their child""fails to attend regularly"",externalat the school where they are registered. In September 2013the government changed the lawso head teachers could only grant a leave of absence to pupils during term time in ""exceptional circumstances"". Penalties can be issued to parents who fail to make their child regularly attend the school they are registered at. This applies to children who are aged five to fifteen at the start of the academic year. Schools in Wales are allowed to grant pupils up to 10 days absence for a family holiday during term time. In Scotland there are no fines but the government says schools will not normally give a family permission to take pupils out of school for trips. In Northern Ireland term time holidays are considered unauthorised absences, but there are no fines. Since 2016-17 the number of penalty notices issued to parents for unauthorised absences overall has increased by 75%. In the 2017-18 academic year family holidays accounted for 85% of fines issued, but fines were also issued for pupils arriving late to school. The Isle of Wight Council said the money from penalty notices was used to cover the costs of administering and enforcing the fines scheme. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said children should miss ""as little time at school as possible"". However, a spokesman said the current system of fines was ""clearly too blunt an instrument"" which ""drives a wedge between schools and families"". The association added the ""real problem"" was holiday prices, putting families ""between a rock and a hard place"". A spokesman for DfE said children should not be taken out of school ""without good reason"". ""We have put head teachers back in control by supporting them - and local authorities - to use their powers to deal with unauthorised absence.""

"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died as a result of the crush outside the St Patrick's Day disco Police have refused to apologise for the arrest and subsequent de-arrest of hotel owner Michael McElhatton over a suspected drug offence. The 52-year-old was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter followingthe deaths of three teenagersand has since been released on police bail. On Wednesday, he was further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. But after forensic testing of the substance, he was de-arrested. Police later said the white powder - which was found on Tuesday in an unmarked, unbranded, clear plastic bag, during a search of Mr McElhatton's home - was an ""innocent substance"". What does it mean to be de-arrested? How to talk to traumatised teens Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and Connor Currie, 16, died after a crush in the queue for a disco at the hotel on St Patrick's Day. A 40-year-old man, who was also arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, remains in police custody. Under the law he can only be held for a limited time before detectives must seek extensions. At a High Court hearing on Thursday he was granted anonymity but failed in a bid to secure an immediate release from custody. The court heard that since being detained XX has been taken to hospital twice for psychiatric assessments - trips accounting for a combined period in excess of 17 hours. The controversy over the drug ""de-arrest"" is a distraction the police would have wanted to avoid. The explanation for their actions has temporarily shifted the focus away from their overall investigation. The more serious question is whether public confidence in the quality of the investigation has been damaged in the Cookstown and Dungannon area and, crucially, amongst the families of those who died. There is no concrete evidence, to date, to suggest that it has done. Detectives will be hoping it stays that way. ""I'm not going to apologise, but I will explain,"" Det Ch Insp Raymond Murray told a press conference. He said he recognised the public concern, but ""everything that happened in relation to that arrest and seizure is what we normally do"" ""I have seen images of the discovery... white powder in an unmarked, unbranded, clear plastic bag, surrounded by tin foil pieces. This video can not be played Cookstown disco deaths: No apology for drugs arrest of hotelier ""The officer reasonably suspected that these were drugs and made the seizure."" In his statement issued earlier in response to the drugs arrest, Mr McElhatton said: ""While I wished to respect the ongoing investigation by the police into the tragic deaths of the three young people at the Greenvale Hotel on St Patrick's night, I have no choice but to make it completely clear that I have nothing whatsoever to do with drugs. ""I can assure everyone that whatever any suspicions the police have raised about me in relation to anything to do with drugs is totally without any basis. ""I am shocked and horrified that the powdery substance taken by police from the laundry in my house could be drugs. Greenvale owner Michael McElhatton said his name had been blackened by the drugs allegation ""Despite there being no basis to these suspicions, they have blackened my name and caused so much upset for so many people especially those who are grieving and distressed over the events at the Greenvale Hotel."" Some 400 people were outside the venue during the crush, police have said. Mr Murray said police had interviewed more than 80 people, adding that while they had identified the bulk of potential witnesses, any more ""still out there"" should come forward. Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to the investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal.,external The funerals for the three teenagers will be held on Friday.

"NHS Lothian has written to nearly 200 patients who underwent heart surgery in the last six months to warn them of a potentially deadly infection risk. The move comes after a review found six patients who were operated on had contracted an infection. NHS Lothian said it is thought the infections may have been acquired during surgery and that ""a number"" of those patients later died. However, the health board refused to reveal how many deaths were involved. Health officials have now written to 186 patients operated on at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in the last six months to warn them of the potential risk of an unusual strain of heart valve infection known as endocarditis. The fungal mould infection can take up to six months to materialise and patients are being advised of the symptoms. As a precaution, four operations planned for this week at the hospital have been cancelled to allow for specialist cleaning and disinfection of the theatres. A number of hospitals across Scotland have been dealing with infections which have led to patients dying in recent months, including Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, wherea 10-year-old boy contracted the Cryptococcus infection, related to pigeon droppings. Prof Alex McMahon, executive lead for infection control for NHS Lothian, said:  ""We extend our sincere apologies and deepest condolences to the families of the patients who died, all of whom were informed at the time of their treatment that they had an unusual and difficult-to-treat infection. ""Many patients receiving this type of surgery are already very ill and vulnerable to infection so we place the highest importance on a stringent infection prevention and control regime. "" He added: ""We have contacted patients purely as a precaution. ""Although this risk is very low and we do not anticipate any more cases, we know that it can take up to six months for these infections to materialise."" Notification letters have been sent to 186 patients about the potential infection risk Endocarditis occurs in 0.5% of patients per year, and usually the source is the patient's own body. Medications similar to antibiotics are available to treat the infection but can have limited impact on patients who are already very ill. Jane Claire Judson, chief executive of Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland, said:  ""This is concerning. Families have lost loved ones and people will be shocked and worried when they receive these letters.  They will need reassurance. ""NHS Lothian is one of the national centres for this kind of surgery, so it's important that any people beyond Lothian are also given the support they need."" ""If you don't feel well you should go straight to your GP - and bring your letter with you to make sure you can go through any concerns you have."" NHS Lothian said it convened an incident management team after a case of endocarditis was reported and they looked through the infection records of thousands of patients who had many different types of surgery carried out since the beginning of 2015. The team found that six patients who underwent cardiothoracic surgery over a period of 18 months where affected by what the health board described as ""unusual infections caused by micro organisms commonly found in the environment"". A number of those patients later died but the board refused to say how many on ""patient confidentiality"" grounds. No cases were found prior to March 2017 and there have been no known cases in patients operated on since November 2018. Do hospitals make you sick?

"Every school should have a dog or another pet to reduce stress in the classroom, says Sir Anthony Seldon. The University of Buckingham vice-chancellor says it is ""a powerfully cost-effective way of helping children feel more secure at schools"". Sir Anthony was speaking at a conference about the need to improve young people's sense of wellbeing. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says more schools seem to have ""wellbeing dogs"" and ""the pets can really help"". The University of Buckingham's Ultimate Wellbeing in Education Conference examined how to respond to the stresses and anxieties facing young people. Mr Hinds told the conference that the relentless presence of social media made growing up ""more pressurised"". He said this could be all-pervasive for teenagers, making them compare their own experiences with the ""perfect lives"" on social media. Dog helps pupils with reading at primary school in Somerset School with dog subject of TV documentary Why a Bristol school has a dog on its staff University switches off social media to help wellbeing It could also normalise exposure to harmful material on subjects like self-harm or eating disorders, he added. Social media creates the pressure to have ""perfect lives"", says the education secretary The education secretary called for more attention to be paid to ways of building up children's wellbeing, such as teaching emotional resilience and a sense of ""character"". Sir Anthony has been a longstanding advocate of the need for schools and universities to pay much more attention to mental health. He told the conference, held at the Westminster Academy in west London, that it was no longer possible for schools to focus solely on academic achievement without thinking about the emotional wellbeing of pupils. His campaigns have helped to raise awareness about the prevalence of mental health problems on university campuses - and he has argued for more recognition for the risks from drug use. But Sir Anthony suggested another more low-tech approach to reducing anxiety - the soothing presence of animals such as dogs. ""The quickest and biggest hit that we can make to improve mental health in our schools and to make them feel safe for children, is to have at least one dog in every single school in the country,"" said Sir Anthony. Damian Hinds said young people were under pressure from false expectations created by social media ""Because children can relate to animals when they are hurt and anxious and sad in a way that they can't always with human beings. ""It will be a powerfully cost-effective way of helping children feel more secure at schools. ""It's very easy to do, it's very cost-effective, the evidence is very clear that it works, and every single school - primary, secondary, special - should have dogs. ""It's hard to think of an easier, quicker benefit,"" he said. Universities have increasingly been bringing pets on to campuses at exam times, as a way of reducing stress. But the education secretary said that his visits had shown him how common ""wellbeing dogs"" were becoming in schools. ""This is one of those things that wasn't around when I was at school,"" said Mr Hinds. ""I hadn't really realised the incidence of it until I was education secretary. ""First I was a bit surprised, but actually it's a great thing. ""For the kids it can be really uplifting, particularly those that have different ways of expressing themselves and coming out of themselves - and the dog or the pets can really help."" But he said there were no plans for a ""central dog policy"". The school with a dog on the staff. Audio, 00:04:48The school with a dog on the staff School dog helps pupils with reading.

"England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, wants the NHS to embrace genomics technology England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has been criticised by doctors for over-reacting to a DNA test he said may have saved his life by revealing a ""higher risk of prostate cancer"". Some senior medics said the test had shown his risk was normal and he would be wasting NHS resources acting on it. And GPs warned genetic test results could be ""of dubious value"" and leave people ""unnecessarily distressed"". Others welcomed his focus on using genetic testing more widely in the NHS. In a speech to the Royal Society, Mr Hancock set out his vision for genetic testing to be made available to everyone on the NHS in order to prevent disease and save lives. He also revealed his own genetic test results, saying he had been ""surprised and concerned"" to discover he had a 15% risk of developing prostate cancer by the age of 75. Having then booked an appointment with his GP to discuss ""the correct course of action"", he said, he would now make sure he didn't ""miss any screening appointments in the future"". Mr Hancock said: ""I would never have found this out if it hadn't been for the genomic test. ""Tragically, so many men don't find out they have it [the risk], until it's too late. ""The truth is, this test may have saved my life."" But the average lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer for men born after 1960 in the UK is 18%, according to Cancer Research UK data. Prof Anneke Lucassen, professor of clinical genetics at the University of Southampton, said Mr Hancock's claim his life had been saved by the test was ""somewhat over-egging the pudding"". Leading geneticist Prof David Curtis, from University College London, went further, saying his claim was ""frankly ridiculous"" because far more people developed prostate cancer than actually died of it. And Prof Diana Eccles, dean of medicine and professor of cancer genetics at the University of Southampton, called his risk ""pretty modest"". ""Prostate cancer is not one disease - many are indolent - and early detection means knowing about it for longer when it may never impact on life expectancy,"" she added. The PSA test is not a reliable test for prostate cancer and can lead to over diagnosis There are also many other risk factors for prostate cancer - other than genetic ones - and there is currently no UK screening programme for the condition because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is unreliable and could result in many men receiving treatment unnecessarily. Prostate Cancer UK said there was ""no clear guidance on what men should do if a genetic risk is identified - particularly in the absence of tests suitable for a prostate cancer screening programme"". ""That is why we do not currently recommend investing privately in DNA tests as a first step for men concerned about their risk of prostate cancer,"" chief executive Angela Culhane said. Sophia Lowes, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""We'd always encourage anyone who's experiencing symptoms or something that isn't normal for them to visit their GP. ""In most cases, it won't be cancer - but it's better to get it checked out."" Prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra). They can include: needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night needing to rush to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate (hesitancy) straining or taking a long time while urinating weak flow of urine feeling the bladder has not emptied fully blood in urine or in semen But many men's prostates grow as they age because of a non-cancerous condition called prostate enlargement. Signs the cancer may have spread include: bone and back pain a loss of appetite, pain in the testicles unexplained weight loss Source:Prostate cancer - NHS,external Although there is widespread agreement that genetic testing will have an important role to play in the future, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said it had to be properly evaluated first. ""Many things that will be picked up by genetic testing will be unimportant or of dubious value and these could leave people unnecessarily confused and distressed,"" she said. ""This will undoubtedly lead to an increased number of worried people wanting to visit their GP to discuss their borderline results, at a time when general practice is already struggling to cope with intense demand and millions of patients are already waiting too long for an appointment."" Medical research charities said genomics offered the potential to better understand a wide range of diseases and develop new treatments. However, Prof Ewan Birney, from the European Bioinformatics Institute, said there was more work to do first. ""The rollout of responsible use of genetic risk scores requires careful integration from genetic research to healthcare practice,"" he said. A Whitehall source said: ""There's never any progress that hasn't been opposed by someone, somewhere. ""Genomics has the potential to transform our lives for the better - so it is vital we embrace the potential of this new technology for the benefit of all.""

"Uptake of cervical screening is at a 20-year low Women are to be offered the chance to carry out smear tests at home in a bid to cut the rates of cervical cancer. The pilot scheme will see some women in north and east London given self-sampling kits from September. It comes as take-up of cervical screening in England hits a 20-year low, with concerns that embarrassment could make some people miss tests. The home testing could be a ""game-changer"", said charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. The kits test for human papillomavirus, the virus that causes 99% of cervical cancer cases. The organisers hope to offer self-sampling kits to more than 22,000 women. Recent worries about the low rate of women having the test led to thefirst cervical screening advertto be launched in England earlier this month. The NHS wants 80% of women between the ages of 25 and 49 to be tested every three years. It wants the same proportion of women aged 50 to 64 to be screened every five years. London has been chosen for the home testing project because figures show it consistently has the lowest average screening coverage in England - 64.7% against 71.4% nationally in 2018. In some areas of England, less than half of eligible women are having the test. Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Trust, said he was ""delighted"" at the pilot scheme. He said: ""We have been calling for this for a long time and believe this could be a game-changer in regards to access to screening. ""Introduction of self sampling will be of enormous benefit to many people, including survivors of sexual violence and women with a physical disability. ""Other countries are already seeing very positive results of HPV self-sampling, with those who have delayed attending for many years choosing to take the test. ""It is now crucial that this pilot moves forward quickly to ensure we are not left behind in our vision of eliminating cervical cancer."" This video can not be played What happens during a smear test? Women aged 25-64 who are eligible for screening but are at least six months overdue for the test will be invited to take part in the pilot at participating GP surgeries. King's College London is working on the pilot with University College London Hospitals Cancer Collaborative, which has been commissioned by the NHS to improve cancer outcomes. It aims to assess the feasibility of providing the option of home testing to women across England who have not responded to invitations for screening. Some women trialling home-testing in other countries have compared it to using a tampon. The kits will contain a vaginal swab, similar to a long cotton bud, and it will take a few minutes to collect a sample. A freepost envelope or box will be provided for women to send their sample to the lab for testing. Doctors say women may not attend cervical screening for a number of reasons, which can be related to the procedure itself, such as embarrassment, fear or a previous bad experience. Busy lifestyles can also get in the way for some women, or they have difficulty getting appointments. Big Brother contestant Jade Goody died on 22 March 2009 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer Professor Sir Mike Richards, the government's former cancer director for England, told thePublic Accounts Committee,externalthe pilot had ""great promise"". He said: ""If we find it is successful, it might well be able to reach people who aren't being reached by the current service. ""We need to improve the convenience for patients - better access in terms of out-of-hours services, better access in terms of [clinics] close to where people work - but on top of that we may get to a different segment of the population by offering HPV self-sampling sets through the post. ""That's what we are beginning to see in other countries."" NHS chiefs announced earlier this week that they were taking the cervical screening system back into their own control, as it has been run by Capita in recent years. There has been dissatisfaction at how it had been performing. News of the pilot comes on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the death of reality TV star Jade Goody, who died at the age of 27 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer. There is already a home-testing scheme for bowel cancer. Correction 21 March 2019: This story was updated to make clear that the pilot scheme will run in London only, and not London and north-east England.

"This video can not be played New Zealand's PM said she hoped the ban would be in place by 11 April New Zealand will ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles following the Christchurch attacks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said. The announcement comes less than a week after 50 people were killed at two mosques, allegedly by a lone gunman. Ms Ardern said she expected new legislation to be in place by 11 April, saying: ""Our history changed forever. Now, our laws will too."" All of the dead have now been formally identified, police have confirmed. Australian Brenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder and was expected to face further charges. However, police said on Thursday thatthe person he was formally accused of killing had been wrongly declared dead. They said they had apologised to the woman and her family, and that the charge sheet would be updated when the suspect appeared in court on 5 April. ""Six days after this attack, we are announcing a ban on all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles in New Zealand,"",externalMs Ardern said in a news conference. ""Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs are also being banned, along with all high-capacity magazines."" An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. Victim named in NZ murder charge is alive How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Ms Ardern said the buy-back could cost up to NZ$200m ($138m; Â£104m), but ""that is the price that we must pay to ensure the safety of our communities"". The prime minister has called the Christchurch attacker a terrorist and said she will not utter his name. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines - the part of the gun which stores ammunition - so they could hold more bullets. Jacinda Ardern: 'A leader with love on full display' As of Thursday, several weapons have been reclassified as military style semi-automatic firearms, making them harder to buy. ""For many people, you will now be in unlawful possession of your firearm,"" Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Semi-automatic weapons, also known as self-loading firearms, fire one bullet per trigger pull with no reloading required They differ from fully automatic weapons, which continuously fire rounds as long as the trigger is pressed An assault weapon can switch between semi-automatic or fully automatic modes Semi-automatic weapons are typically pistols, rifles and shotguns, including the AR-15 rifle AR-15 rifles can discharge between 45 and 60 rounds per minute Sources: Violence Policy Center and assaultweapon.info Ms Ardern said the legislation would be introduced when parliament sits in the first week of April. There would be a ""short, sharp select committee process"" for feedback on technical aspects of the law, she said, and changes to the Arms Act should be passed within the session. Once the amnesty period ends, anyone in possession of a banned weapon would face a fine of up to NZ$4,000 and three years in jail. As with Australia's gun reforms in 1996, exemptions will be made for farmers who need weapons for pest control and animal welfare. By Phil Mercer in Christchurch New Zealand has tried - and failed - to reform its gun laws several times in the past two decades, but the momentum for change is now overwhelming. Owners will be forced to surrender proscribed firearms and will be compensated, but those who resist could be prosecuted. A major hurdle for the authorities is that no-one knows how many assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons are out there. New Zealand's Police Association has said there also needs to be a register of all guns and their owners. That could happen in the next round of amendments promised by the prime minister, which will focus on licensing and registration. She has broad public support following the atrocities in Christchurch. Earlier, MPs in the capital, Wellington, were handed a petition with more than 65,000 signatures demanding tougher laws. Some gun owners aren't happy, insisting that vetting procedures were already strict enough. They are, though, swimming against the tide. Survivor Kawthar Abulaban, 54, who was at the Al-Noor mosque, welcomed the move: ""It's a good thing, why would we need to have guns like this in our houses?"" she told AFP. The leader of New Zealand's opposition National Party, Simon Bridges, backed the changes and said it was ""imperative in the national interest [that] we keep New Zealanders safe."" The move drew strong responses in the US, where campaigners against gun violence frequently clash with the pro-gun lobby. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders called for America to follow New Zealand's lead,external, tweeting: ""This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like."" In response, National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch cited the Second Amendment of the US constitution, which gives Americans the right to carry guns. ""The US isn't NZ,"" she tweeted. ""While they do not have an inalienable right to bear arms and to self defense, we do."" Fifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city.

In the port city of Beira, aid workers say there are only two to three days of clean water left. Some 300 people are confirmed dead in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, but the toll is expected to rise. The powerful cyclone swept in to Beira last Thursday, with winds of more than 177km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland. Oxfam has told the BBC that an area of about 3,000 sq km (1,864 sq miles) is now under water. Medical agencies are warning that the shortage of food and clean drinking water is increasing the threat of disease. ""The first thing you see when you arrive is destruction and a lot of water,"" said Get Verdonck, an emergency co-ordinator with the medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF).  15,000still need to be rescued 3,000have already been rescued 300dead in Mozambique 
and Zimbabwe 217of whom are in Mozambique 177km/hwind speed during Cyclone Idai ""People are using well water with no chlorination, and that water is unlikely to be clean... pneumonia and other respiratory diseases are going to be a problem,"" he told Reuters from Beira. Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. A total of 217 people are confirmed dead in the country, but many areas have still not been reached. Caroline Haga, an official with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the worst-hit areas were close to the Buzi river west of Beira. She said rescue teams were dropping high-energy biscuits, water purification tablets and other supplies to people surrounded by water and mud. ""We have thousands of people... in roofs and trees waiting for rescue,"" Ms Haga told AFP news agency. Cyclone Idai: Maps reveal storm's destruction The devastation in pictures 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' What's climate change got to do with it? ""We are running out of time. People have been waiting for rescue for more than three days now. We can't pick up all the people so our priority is children, pregnant women, injured people."" Celso Correia, Mozambique's minister of land and environment, confirmed this, telling Reuters the number of people still needing to be rescued was thought to be about 15,000. He added that 3,000 people had already been rescued so far. Desperate people carried away sacks of rice from this warehouse in Beira Deborah Nguyen, of the World Food Programme (WFP), said the priorities were reaching people trapped in the flooded areas and then organising temporary shelter for those rescued. ""Relief operations are progressing, but there is still a lot of work,"" she told AFP. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk. Wilker de Assis de Sousa Dias, a survivor in Beira, speaks to BBC Focus on Africa The winds started on Wednesday, but only around 60km/h. On Thursday, at around 14:00 it started getting at worse, and at around 19:00, the show really started, if I can say that. The cyclone was already starting to cause damage, picking up everything in its path. It was just destroying everything. In the parts of the city which are near the sea, there is almost nothing left. My house has two floors, and there's basically nothing there now. The roof has given way, and water is coming in from every corner. I was in my house during the storm. I actually didn't have any way of leaving, even if I'd wanted to. All of the roads near the sea, where my house is, were flooded. The wind was so strong it was picking up stones and hurling them around. I saw stones flying, zinc sheets flying, even pieces of cars. The debris smashed all of the windows in my house. I was able to walk around some of the affected areas shortly after the storm. I would say that 75% of the city is totally destroyed. We're still waiting for help. We need food, certainly, and we urgently need construction materials. In Zimbabwe, at least 98 people have died and 217 people are missing in the east and south, the government said. In Malawi, the UN says more than 80,000 people have been displaced by the cyclone. Amid the devastation, people in Zimbabwe are doing everything they can to help survivors. Videos and pictures have emerged of people queuing - not to collect fuel or bread, but to donate food, clothes and other goods to the relief effort. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka says the country is in the middle of an economic crisis but this has not stopped an unprecedented community aid effort. Reporters from BBC Africa have visited a Presbyterian church in the capital Harare, where volunteers have been sorting through donations. One woman turned up having walked for about two hours to bring her donation. Volunteer Natalie Detering told BBC News the donor said she could not afford her bus fare, but decided to walk from home because Jesus had told her to. This woman had walked for almost two hours to make her donation in Harare Among her donations was a pot, a blanket, some of her clothes and a towel. The generosity shown by ordinary Zimbabweans has prompted President Emmerson Mnangagwa to tweet his appreciation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, wants the NHS to embrace genomics technology England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has been criticised by doctors for over-reacting to a DNA test he said may have saved his life by revealing a ""higher risk of prostate cancer"". Some senior medics said the test had shown his risk was normal and he would be wasting NHS resources acting on it. And GPs warned genetic test results could be ""of dubious value"" and leave people ""unnecessarily distressed"". Others welcomed his focus on using genetic testing more widely in the NHS. In a speech to the Royal Society, Mr Hancock set out his vision for genetic testing to be made available to everyone on the NHS in order to prevent disease and save lives. He also revealed his own genetic test results, saying he had been ""surprised and concerned"" to discover he had a 15% risk of developing prostate cancer by the age of 75. Having then booked an appointment with his GP to discuss ""the correct course of action"", he said, he would now make sure he didn't ""miss any screening appointments in the future"". Mr Hancock said: ""I would never have found this out if it hadn't been for the genomic test. ""Tragically, so many men don't find out they have it [the risk], until it's too late. ""The truth is, this test may have saved my life."" But the average lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer for men born after 1960 in the UK is 18%, according to Cancer Research UK data. Prof Anneke Lucassen, professor of clinical genetics at the University of Southampton, said Mr Hancock's claim his life had been saved by the test was ""somewhat over-egging the pudding"". Leading geneticist Prof David Curtis, from University College London, went further, saying his claim was ""frankly ridiculous"" because far more people developed prostate cancer than actually died of it. And Prof Diana Eccles, dean of medicine and professor of cancer genetics at the University of Southampton, called his risk ""pretty modest"". ""Prostate cancer is not one disease - many are indolent - and early detection means knowing about it for longer when it may never impact on life expectancy,"" she added. The PSA test is not a reliable test for prostate cancer and can lead to over diagnosis There are also many other risk factors for prostate cancer - other than genetic ones - and there is currently no UK screening programme for the condition because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is unreliable and could result in many men receiving treatment unnecessarily. Prostate Cancer UK said there was ""no clear guidance on what men should do if a genetic risk is identified - particularly in the absence of tests suitable for a prostate cancer screening programme"". ""That is why we do not currently recommend investing privately in DNA tests as a first step for men concerned about their risk of prostate cancer,"" chief executive Angela Culhane said. Sophia Lowes, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""We'd always encourage anyone who's experiencing symptoms or something that isn't normal for them to visit their GP. ""In most cases, it won't be cancer - but it's better to get it checked out."" Prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra). They can include: needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night needing to rush to the toilet difficulty in starting to urinate (hesitancy) straining or taking a long time while urinating weak flow of urine feeling the bladder has not emptied fully blood in urine or in semen But many men's prostates grow as they age because of a non-cancerous condition called prostate enlargement. Signs the cancer may have spread include: bone and back pain a loss of appetite, pain in the testicles unexplained weight loss Source:Prostate cancer - NHS,external Although there is widespread agreement that genetic testing will have an important role to play in the future, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said it had to be properly evaluated first. ""Many things that will be picked up by genetic testing will be unimportant or of dubious value and these could leave people unnecessarily confused and distressed,"" she said. ""This will undoubtedly lead to an increased number of worried people wanting to visit their GP to discuss their borderline results, at a time when general practice is already struggling to cope with intense demand and millions of patients are already waiting too long for an appointment."" Medical research charities said genomics offered the potential to better understand a wide range of diseases and develop new treatments. However, Prof Ewan Birney, from the European Bioinformatics Institute, said there was more work to do first. ""The rollout of responsible use of genetic risk scores requires careful integration from genetic research to healthcare practice,"" he said. A Whitehall source said: ""There's never any progress that hasn't been opposed by someone, somewhere. ""Genomics has the potential to transform our lives for the better - so it is vital we embrace the potential of this new technology for the benefit of all.""

"Theresa May has said she ""sincerely hopes"" the UK will leave the EU with a deal and she is still ""working on"" ensuring Parliament's agreement. Arriving in Brussels, she said that she had ""personal regret"" over her request to delay Brexit, but said it will allow time for MPs to make a ""final choice"". At the EU summit the PM spoke to the other 27 leaders to try to get their backing for a delay beyond 29 March. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were ""very constructive"". BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said Mrs May spoke to EU leaders for 90 minutes and was asked several times what her contingency plans were if she lost the third ""meaningful vote"" on her deal in Parliament. Live updates: PM appeals to EU leaders Revoke Article 50 petition crashes site John Bercow: MPs are not traitors Corbyn calls for Brexit compromise Your really simple guide to Brexit French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that if MPs vote down Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement next week, the UK will leave without a deal. ""In the case of a negative British vote then we'd be heading to a no deal. We all know it. And it's essential to be clear in these days and moments,"" said Mr Macron, as he arrived at the summit. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that a short Brexit delay ""should be conditional on a positive vote next week in the House of Commons"". ""We have done our best, now the solution is in London,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says no prime minister ""in living memory"" has been tested like Theresa May How the day will unfold (timings are approximate): EU leaders are discussing whether to grant the UK's request and examining other Brexit options 18:00 GMT - Press conference by European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker 18:30 GMT - Working dinner Mrs May is also expected to make a statement On her arrival in Brussels, Mrs May said: ""A short extension gives us that opportunity to decide to leave the European Union, to deliver on that result of that referendum and I sincerely hope that will be with a negotiated deal."" She added: ""I'm still working on ensuring that Parliament can agree a deal so that we can leave in an orderly way."" Earlier, speaking in the German Parliament, Angela Merkel said the EU could meet Mrs May's request to delay Brexit if in the next week there was a ""positive vote"" on the withdrawal agreement in the UK Parliament. The German Chancellor said European elections at the end of May would have to be considered during discussions on the suggested extension deadline of 30 June, adding: ""But of course we can certainly talk about a short term extension."" Beware the reports of ""huge"" differences between EU leaders when it comes to a Brexit delay and the way forward in the coming days. Take Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron: there are big differences in their political styles. And big differences in the message they want to send their own domestic audiences (tough for France; open for Germany) when talking about Brexit. But like most EU leaders - irritation, frustration and Brexit fatigue aside - they would rather avoid a costly no-deal Brexit. Chancellor Merkel, like European Council President Donald Tusk has announced she will work ""until the last hours"" to try to avoid it. And while EU leaders have ruled out re-opening the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the ""backstop"" text, you can bet they'll discuss a longer Brexit delay at their summit today. They will also discuss the short delay requested by Theresa May, in case - as the EU fears - chaos and division continue next week in Westminster. A risky pitch of Parliament versus Public How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? Dover warns of Brexit disruption risk The UK is set to leave the EU next Friday unless the law is changed. The current default position for leaving is without a withdrawal agreement. Mrs May agreed a deal with the EU, but MPs have rejected it twice. She has asked the EU for a short extension of the two-year Brexit process until 30 June, but any extension needs to be agreed to by all EU members. European Council President Donald Tusksaid he believedthe EU would agree to a short extension, but this would only be if Mrs May's deal is signed off by MPs next week. Another EU summit next week could be called in an emergency if needed, he said. Mr Tusk said the ""question remains open"" as to how long a delay the other EU leaders would support. Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar said that he appreciated the situation in London was ""somewhat chaotic"" and for that reason ""we need to cut the entire British establishment a little bit of slack on this"". He said there was ""openness to an extension"" as ""nobody wants no deal"". In her speech from Number 10 on Wednesday evening, Mrs May insisted she would not be willing to postpone Brexit any further than 30 June, despite appeals from some MPs. She added: ""Of this I am absolutely sure. You, the public, have had enough. ""You are tired of the infighting, tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children's schools, our National Health Service, knife crime. ""You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side."" She said it was now up to MPs to decide whether they wanted to leave with her deal, no deal or not to leave at all. But she warned that the latter option could cause ""irreparable damage to public trust"" in politicians. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be faced with three options if Mrs May's deal was defeated again next week: revoke Article 50; leave without a deal; or a longer extension could be granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He also defended the prime minister's statement, saying Mrs May was under ""extraordinary pressure"" and MPs have a ""special responsibility"" in a hung Parliament. Many MPs have expressed anger at Mrs May's comments, with Conservative MP Nicky Morgan telling the BBC's World at One they were ""terribly misjudged"". Fellow Tory Ben Bradley, who had backed Mrs May's deal, said they were ""not helpful"". Meanwhile,union and business leaders have written,externala joint letter to Mrs May urging her to ""change course"" in her approach to Brexit, saying the UK is facing a ""national emergency"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn have requested a meeting to discuss their concerns. They said: ""Our country is facing a national emergency. Decisions of recent days have caused the risk of no deal to soar. ""Firms and communities across the UK are not ready for this outcome. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come."" Jeremy Corbyn says consensus can be built around Labour's plan Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said talks with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr in Brussels were ""very constructive"". ""Our determination is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union next Friday,"" he said. ""We are therefore looking for alternatives and building a majority in Parliament that can agree on a future constructive economic relationship with the European Union."" He said he had been ""reaching out"" to colleagues from all parties in Parliament on this.

"Aaron Campbell, 16, was given a minimum jail term of 27 years The 16-year-old who raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has been sentenced to a minimum of 27 years behind bars after he finally admitted his crime. During his trial, Aaron Campbell had repeatedly denied he abducted, raped and killed the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute last July. But he admitted his offences to a psychologist preparing a report to the court ahead of his sentencing. Judge Lord Matthews imposed a life sentence for the ""brutal"" murder. He set the punishment part of the sentence, before Campbell can apply for parole, at 27 years. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Read the judge's sentencing statement in full,external Lord Matthews said Campbell's crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief"". He said Alesha had been violated and murdered and told Campbell he was a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The judge read out Campbell's ""cold blooded and horrific"" account of his actions that night and how he described seeing Alesha asleep in her room as ""a moment of opportunity"". Campbell's confession was contained in the criminal justice social report and the criminal psychologist's report, which were prepared ahead of his sentencing. The report by the forensic clinical psychologist Dr Gary Macpherson quoted Campbell as saying: ""At any other time in life murder would not have been the conclusion. ""If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence In his sentencing statement, the judge said the teenager had shown breathtaking arrogance during the trial and had failed to plead guilty despite overwhelming evidence against him. He said he had shown ""a staggering lack of remorse"". ""Not once did I detect a flicker of emotion from you,"" the judge said. Lord Matthews said it would be for others to decide if Campbell would ever be released, indeed, he said his reintegration into society might be ""impossible"". During his nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow last month, Campbell claimed he had never met his victim and lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. The judge said this was a ""cruel travesty of the truth"" and said the woman he blamed, Toni McLachlan, was ""completely innocent"". Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial The judge said he was ""shocked"" by the clear admissions of guilt in the background reports, especially after the ""tissue of lies"" Campbell had told in court. The psychologist said that on the night of Alesha's death Campbell had been drinking and wanted cannabis so he decided to go into her father's home to get some. Alesha's father had previously sold him the drug. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' In his sentencing statement, Lord Matthews said Campbell had carried Alesha to a secluded spot where he raped and murdered her ""in the most brutal fashion"". He told the teenager: ""You said that Alesha was drowsy and became a bit more awake when you went out. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead ""At one point she asked who you were and where you were going. ""You said you were a friend of her father and that you were taking her home."" Campbell gave Alesha his coat because she was cold. The judge said that over the next few days Campbell was unconcerned about what had happened, and was ""slightly amused"" that the police had not caught him. The court heard that the teenager had said he was ""quite satisfied by the murder"". Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane leaves court after the sentencing The judge said Campbell told Dr Macpherson that at points during the trial it took ""everything to stop laughing"" and he had to ""zip his mouth"". Lord Matthews said the reports concluded that Campbell was not suffering from a mental health disorder but showed a total lack of victim empathy. Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was just days into a holiday when she was abducted from her bed. She was reported missing from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, near Rothesay, at 06:23 on 2 July last year. Dozens of islanders joined the search for the child but at 08:54 her naked body was discovered in a wooded area in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. After the sentence was read out family members shouted ""evil"" and ""beast"" as Campbell was led down to the cells. Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Identity of Alesha's killer revealed.

"Most of the dead bodies of mountaineers have appeared on the Khumbu Glacier Expedition operators are concerned at the number of climbers' bodies that are becoming exposed on Mount Everest as its glaciers melt. Nearly 300 mountaineers have died on the peak since the first ascent attempt and two-thirds of bodies are thought still to be buried in the snow and ice. Bodies are being removed on the Chinese side of the mountain, to the north, as the spring climbing season starts. More than 4,800 climbers have scaled the highest peak on Earth. ""Because of global warming, the ice sheet and glaciers are fast melting and the dead bodies that remained buried all these years are now becoming exposed,"" said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association. ""We have brought down dead bodies of some mountaineers who died in recent years, but the old ones that remained buried are now coming out."" And a government officer who worked as a liaison officer on Everest added: ""I myself have retrieved around 10 dead bodies in recent years from different locations on Everest and clearly more and more of them are emerging now."" High Mountain Asia's glaciers put the brakes on BBC Future: Death in the clouds Recovery of climbers' bodies 'possible' Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal (EOAN) said they were bringing down all ropes from the higher camps of Everest and Lhotse mountains this climbing season, but dealing with dead bodies was not as easy. They point at Nepal's law that requires government agencies' involvement when dealing with bodies and said that was a challenge. ""This issue needs to be prioritised by both the government and the mountaineering industry,"" said Dambar Parajuli, president of EOAN. ""If they can do it on the Tibet side of Everest, we can do it here as well."" Dead bodies are said to be appearing at Camp 4 mainly because of its flat ground In 2017, the hand of a dead mountaineer appeared above the ground at Camp 1. Expedition operators said they deployed professional climbers of the Sherpa community to move the body. The same year, another body appeared on the surface of the Khumbu Glacier. Also known as the Khumbu Icefall, this is where most dead bodies have been surfacing in recent years, mountaineers say. Another place that has been seeing dead bodies becoming exposed is the Camp 4 area, also called South Col, which is relatively flat. ""Hands and legs of dead bodies have appeared at the base camp as well in the last few years,"" said an official with a non-government organisation active in the region. ""We have noticed that the ice level at and around the base camp has been going down, and that is why the bodies are becoming exposed."" Scientists have found ponds expanding and joining up on the Khumbu Glacier Several studies show that glaciers in the Everest region, as in most parts of the Himalayas, are fast melting and thinning. A study in 2015 revealed that ponds on the Khumbu Glacier - that climbers need to cross to scale the mighty peak - were expanding and joining up because of the accelerated melting. Nepal's army drained the Imja Lake near Mount Everest in 2016 after its water from rapid glacial-melt had reached dangerous levels. Another team of researchers, including members from Leeds and Aberystwyth universities in the UK, last year drilled the Khumbu Glacier and found the ice to be warmer than expected. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external The ice recorded a minimum temperature of only â3.3C, with even the coldest ice being a full 2C warmer than the mean annual air temperature. Not all dead bodies emerging from under the ice, however, are because of rapid glacial meltdown. Some of them get exposed also because of the movement of the Khumbu Glacier, mountaineers say. ""Because of the movement of the Khumbu Glacier, we do get to see dead bodies from time to time,"" said Tshering Pandey Bhote, vice president of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. ""But most climbers are mentally prepared to come across such a sight."" Most of the dead bodies brought down relate to recent incidents on the mountains Some of the dead bodies on the higher altitude sectors of Mount Everest have also served as landmarks for mountaineers. One such waypoint had been the ""green boots"" near the summit. They were a reference to a climber who died under an overhanging rock. His green boots, still on his feet, faced the climbing route. Some climbing experts said the body was later removed while Nepal's tourism officials said they had no information on whether the remains are still visible. Recovering and removing bodies from the higher camps can be both expensive and difficult. Experts say it costs $40,000 to $80,000 to bring down dead bodies. ""One of the most challenging recoveries was from the height of 8,700m, near the summit,"" said Ang Tshering Sherpa, the former president of NMA. ""The body was totally frozen and weighed 150kg and it had to be recovered from a difficult place at that altitude."" Experts say any decision over what to do with a dead body on the mountain is also a very personal issue. ""Most climbers like to be left on the mountains if they died,"" said Alan Arnette, a noted mountaineer who also writes on mountaineering. ""So it would be deemed disrespectful to just remove them unless they need to be moved from the climbing route or their families want them.""

"This video can not be played New Zealand's PM said she hoped the ban would be in place by 11 April New Zealand will ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles following the Christchurch attacks, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said. The announcement comes less than a week after 50 people were killed at two mosques, allegedly by a lone gunman. Ms Ardern said she expected new legislation to be in place by 11 April, saying: ""Our history changed forever. Now, our laws will too."" All of the dead have now been formally identified, police have confirmed. Australian Brenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder and was expected to face further charges. However, police said on Thursday thatthe person he was formally accused of killing had been wrongly declared dead. They said they had apologised to the woman and her family, and that the charge sheet would be updated when the suspect appeared in court on 5 April. ""Six days after this attack, we are announcing a ban on all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles in New Zealand,"",externalMs Ardern said in a news conference. ""Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs are also being banned, along with all high-capacity magazines."" An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. Victim named in NZ murder charge is alive How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Ms Ardern said the buy-back could cost up to NZ$200m ($138m; Â£104m), but ""that is the price that we must pay to ensure the safety of our communities"". The prime minister has called the Christchurch attacker a terrorist and said she will not utter his name. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines - the part of the gun which stores ammunition - so they could hold more bullets. Jacinda Ardern: 'A leader with love on full display' As of Thursday, several weapons have been reclassified as military style semi-automatic firearms, making them harder to buy. ""For many people, you will now be in unlawful possession of your firearm,"" Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. Semi-automatic weapons, also known as self-loading firearms, fire one bullet per trigger pull with no reloading required They differ from fully automatic weapons, which continuously fire rounds as long as the trigger is pressed An assault weapon can switch between semi-automatic or fully automatic modes Semi-automatic weapons are typically pistols, rifles and shotguns, including the AR-15 rifle AR-15 rifles can discharge between 45 and 60 rounds per minute Sources: Violence Policy Center and assaultweapon.info Ms Ardern said the legislation would be introduced when parliament sits in the first week of April. There would be a ""short, sharp select committee process"" for feedback on technical aspects of the law, she said, and changes to the Arms Act should be passed within the session. Once the amnesty period ends, anyone in possession of a banned weapon would face a fine of up to NZ$4,000 and three years in jail. As with Australia's gun reforms in 1996, exemptions will be made for farmers who need weapons for pest control and animal welfare. By Phil Mercer in Christchurch New Zealand has tried - and failed - to reform its gun laws several times in the past two decades, but the momentum for change is now overwhelming. Owners will be forced to surrender proscribed firearms and will be compensated, but those who resist could be prosecuted. A major hurdle for the authorities is that no-one knows how many assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons are out there. New Zealand's Police Association has said there also needs to be a register of all guns and their owners. That could happen in the next round of amendments promised by the prime minister, which will focus on licensing and registration. She has broad public support following the atrocities in Christchurch. Earlier, MPs in the capital, Wellington, were handed a petition with more than 65,000 signatures demanding tougher laws. Some gun owners aren't happy, insisting that vetting procedures were already strict enough. They are, though, swimming against the tide. Survivor Kawthar Abulaban, 54, who was at the Al-Noor mosque, welcomed the move: ""It's a good thing, why would we need to have guns like this in our houses?"" she told AFP. The leader of New Zealand's opposition National Party, Simon Bridges, backed the changes and said it was ""imperative in the national interest [that] we keep New Zealanders safe."" The move drew strong responses in the US, where campaigners against gun violence frequently clash with the pro-gun lobby. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders called for America to follow New Zealand's lead,external, tweeting: ""This is what real action to stop gun violence looks like."" In response, National Rifle Association (NRA) spokeswoman Dana Loesch cited the Second Amendment of the US constitution, which gives Americans the right to carry guns. ""The US isn't NZ,"" she tweeted. ""While they do not have an inalienable right to bear arms and to self defense, we do."" Fifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city.

"Term time holidays were behind 85% of fines for absences from schools in 2017-18 The number of fines issued to parents in England for taking children on term time holidays has almost doubled in a year, statistics show. Penalty notices rose by 93% to almost 223,000 in 2017-18. Jon Platt, a father who lost aSupreme Court battleagainst a fine, said he felt ""partly responsible"" for the rise. ""Unauthorised family holiday absence"" was the most common reason for attendance fines, the Department for Education (DfE) said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Can't see the map?Tap or click here,external Councils can require parents to pay Â£60 each per child taken out of school without permission. This rises to Â£120 if not paid within 21 days, and after 28 days parents can be prosecuted. Overall in 2017-18 there were 260,877 penalty notices issued for unauthorised absence from school. Of these, just over one in 10 was withdrawn. There were 19,518 prosecutions in England in 2017-18 for non-payment of the fines, up from 13,324 the year before. Mr Platt say there is no evidence to suggest term time holidays impact on a child's education Jon Platt, from the Isle of Wight, said he felt ""partly responsible"" for fines increasing in the past year. He was fined after taking his daughter on holiday to Florida during term time and challenged the case in the courts. In 2017 he lost thecase in the Supreme Court. Since the ruling he said the law had become ""harsher and stricter"". ""There is clarity [on the law] but it's a draconian clarity,"" he said. ""It's disappointing to see that where there were tens of thousands of parents being fined, it's now hundreds of thousands."" Mr Platt has now put his children into private education, exempting himself from further fines from the council. ""I would very much like the government to look at this again, but I don't think they will,"" he added. In a report accompanying the statistics the DfE said it had contacted councils following the court case. It said all six that responded said the Supreme Court judgement in this case ""had an effect on the number of penalty notices issued in 2017-18, either as a result of returning to pre-court case levels following a slowdown or from a change in behaviour as a result of the ruling."" Why am I paying more tax to the police? Katie Price denies abuse outside school Smear-test mums offered free childcare The Campaign for Real Education said fines should be used a ""last resort"". Its chairman, retired head teacher Chris McGovern, said taking a child out of school for a ""cheap holiday"" could be a ""remarkably selfish action"". He said term time holidays were disruptive to the absent student and the rest of the class. ""Teachers are distracted from their regular teaching by having to help the absentees to catch up,"" he said. He added term time holidays were mostly ""for the benefit of the parents, rather than the children"". Jane Lynch says there is no flexibility in the system which creates a ""negative"" atmosphere Jane Lynch, from Margate, said she budgets for the cost of fines when planning a trip because it was still cheaper than paying full price during the school break. The 37-year-old, who works with her husband in childcare, said prices ""double"" after term finishes. She says this has an additional cost because there is more work available for her during school holidays. ""We never take them out near exam periods,"" she said. ""We can't see how going away once a year hurts."" Head teachers used to be able to allow pupil 10 days of leave in ""special circumstances"" Parents are responsible for ensuring their children receive an education. The can be found guilty of an offence if their child""fails to attend regularly"",externalat the school where they are registered. In September 2013the government changed the lawso head teachers could only grant a leave of absence to pupils during term time in ""exceptional circumstances"". Penalties can be issued to parents who fail to make their child regularly attend the school they are registered at. This applies to children who are aged five to fifteen at the start of the academic year. Schools in Wales are allowed to grant pupils up to 10 days absence for a family holiday during term time. In Scotland there are no fines but the government says schools will not normally give a family permission to take pupils out of school for trips. In Northern Ireland term time holidays are considered unauthorised absences, but there are no fines. Since 2016-17 the number of penalty notices issued to parents for unauthorised absences overall has increased by 75%. In the 2017-18 academic year family holidays accounted for 85% of fines issued, but fines were also issued for pupils arriving late to school. The Isle of Wight Council said the money from penalty notices was used to cover the costs of administering and enforcing the fines scheme. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said children should miss ""as little time at school as possible"". However, a spokesman said the current system of fines was ""clearly too blunt an instrument"" which ""drives a wedge between schools and families"". The association added the ""real problem"" was holiday prices, putting families ""between a rock and a hard place"". A spokesman for DfE said children should not be taken out of school ""without good reason"". ""We have put head teachers back in control by supporting them - and local authorities - to use their powers to deal with unauthorised absence.""

"The ferry was on its way to this tourist island upstream from the city centre Almost 100 people are reported to have died after a ferry sank in the Tigris river in Iraq's city of Mosul. Most of the victims were women and children, the interior ministry said. It is thought nearly 200 people were on board. The ferry was heading towards a tourist island as part of new year celebrations. Mosul's civil defence agency reportedly said most on board could not swim. At least 19 children and 61 women were among the 94 people said to have died, and 55 people were rescued. The vessel was on its way to Umm Rabaen island, a tourist area about 4km (2.5 miles) upstream and north of the city centre. People across the region are celebrating Nowruz, the new year festival. Footage shows the ferry tilting sharply to the right and taking on water, before flipping over entirely and being dragged swiftly downstream by the fast-flowing river. Images on social media showed the upturned vessel and people floating in the current. ""It was carrying too many passengers, so the water began to rush onboard and the ferry became heavier and overturned,"" one passenger told AFP news agency. ""With my own eyes I saw dead children in the water."" Ambulances and helicopters arrived to help survivors and search for the bodies of those who died. Authorities had reportedly warned people about rising water levels as the gates of the Mosul dam had been opened, and some are accusing the ship operator of ignoring the advice. Iraq's justice ministry reportedly ordered the arrest of nine ferry company workers, and barred the ship's owners and the owners of the tourist site from leaving Iraq. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi meanwhile has ordered an investigation ""to determine responsibilities"". In a statementMr Mahdi said he was following the story ""with pain and sadness"",external, and had ordered ""all state efforts"" to find survivors and treat victims. The prime minister later toured a hospital and a morgue in the city, and declared three days of national mourning.

"Scams in which criminals trick bank customers into paying them money out of their bank accounts jumped by 45% in the second half of last year. In the six months to December, Â£135m was transferred out of personal accounts to fraudsters with the customer's permission. In the first half of 2018, the total was Â£93m. Over the whole of last year, more than 84,000 bank customers fell victim, some losing tens of thousands of pounds. Banks say scam merchants are shifting their attention from trying to penetrate banking systems to conning members of the public directly. Business are being targeted as well, with a similar sharp rise to Â£74m in suspicious transfers unwittingly authorised by staff members. The frauds range from dodgy or non-existent goods being sold online to sophisticated scams in which the perpetrator pretends to be a trader known to the customer and demands payments. In some of the worst cases, criminals hack into the email accounts of solicitors handling house sales or builders genuinely working on a house, then send invoices asking customers to transfer money to a fraudulent account. Katy Worobec, who deals with economic crime at UK Finance, believes the most sinister examples are when fraudsters phone, email or arrive in person, claiming to be from the police or from the customer's bank. ""We are seeing a shift away from some of the methods that fraudsters are using to try and attack banks' security systems to focusing on the person and duping them into making the payment themselves,"" she says. The increase in documented cases has happened partly because more banks are detecting and reporting the scams, but UK Finance admits it is worried by the development. The problem is that in most cases, the customer was blamed for authorising the payments and ends up footing the bill. Banks reimbursed Â£83m of the losses over 2018, but that compared with a total bill to individuals and businesses of Â£354m. They have promised to follow a new voluntary code from 28 May this year, under which victims will be refunded if they have met expected standards of behaviour. But banks can still avoid paying if they can prove gross negligence by the customer.

"A petition calling for Theresa May to cancel Brexit by revoking Article 50 has passed two million signatures. Parliament'spetitions committee tweeted,externalthat the rate of signatures was ""the highest the site has ever had to deal with"", after the website crashed. EU leaders in Brussels havereached agreement on a plan to delay Brexit beyond 29 March. Downing Street said the prime minister ""has said many times she will not countenance revoking Article 50"". The PM's spokesman added: ""The PM has long been clear that failing to deliver on the referendum result would be a failure of democracy and a failure she wouldn't countenance."" Revoke Article 50 has been trending on Twitter as people were urged to sign it. At one point, the petitions committee said there were nearly 2,000 signatures a minute. It latertweeted,externalthat sudden spikes in numbers continued to cause intermittent problems with the site. It also said validation emails were taking longer than usual to get through. The petition'sheat map,externalshows the constituencies with the highest number of signatories, including seats in Bristol, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford, London, Cambridge and Brighton. May 'hopes' UK will leave EU with a deal How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? It is not the most popular ever on the Parliament website. A petition for a second EU referendum in June 2016 attracted more than four million signatures and was debated in the Commons - but thousands of signatures were removed after it wasdiscovered to have been hijacked by automated bots. People signing petitions on the Parliament website are asked to tick a box saying they are a British citizen or UK resident and to confirm their name, email address, and postcode to sign. Data from the petitions website on Thursday evening suggested 1.3m signatures were from people who said they were from the UK, 10,000 from France, nearly 6,000 from Spain and more than 4,000 from Germany, among others. A Commons spokesman said signature patterns are investigated to check for fraudulent activity and suspect signatures are removed, including those that are ""clearly bots"". He added: ""Anyone who is a UK resident or a British citizen can sign a petition. This includes British citizens living overseas."" By BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler Petitions on the Parliament website rarely lead to a change in the law. They are not even guaranteed to lead to a debate in Parliament - they only get considered for debate if they reach 100,000 signatures. The petitions committee rejects them if it believes the UK government can't do anything about the issue. But what petitions can do is put an issue on the political radar - and that is what appears to have happened with the petition to revoke Article 50. It was previously something of a taboo subject at Westminster. Even the most ardent anti-Brexiteers know it would be political suicide for any prime minister to overturn a referendum result without going back to the people. But some Remainer MPs are now calling on social media for the government to do just that. Earlier Commons leader Andrea Leadsom dismissed the petition as not being on the same scale as the pro-Brexit vote in the 2016 referendum. ""Should it reach 17.4 million respondents then I am sure there will be a very clear case for taking action,"" she told MPs. She added: ""It's absolutely right that people do have the opportunity to put their views and that can then spark yet another Brexit debate."" In December, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. This means the UK can decide to stay in the EU without the consent of the 27 other member states. Few MPs have mentioned this as a potential option so far. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The petition has long since passed the 100,000 signatures that means it will be considered for debate. Margaret Anne Georgiadou, who started the petition, told the BBC: ""I became like every other Remainer - very frustrated that we've been silenced and ignored for so long. ""So I think now it's almost like a dam bursting, because we've been held back in a sense - it's almost like last chance saloon now."" She said the petition ""didn't do very well for a week"". ""I nearly gave up but then I contacted a lot of people and it took off,"" she added. In January, MPsdebated whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal,after a petition calling for that got 371,673 signatures. MPs have been sharing the revoke Article 50 petition on social media, including Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, who said Mrs May's ""cliff-edge ultimatum"" had led ""hundreds of thousands"" to sign.

Pete Wishart, who was among a number of SNP MPs who shared the petition, called on the public to sign and ""end the madness"". And Labour MP Neil Coyle urged the public to sign. But Conservative MP Andrew Bowie said the only way to rule out a no-deal Brexit ""at all"" was to back the prime minister's deal. A House of Commons spokesperson said the site crashed on Thursday morning because of ""a large and sustained load on the system"". The petition reads: ""The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. ""We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now, for remaining in the EU. A People's Vote may not happen - so vote now."" The government will have a third try at getting MPs to back Theresa May's EU withdrawal deal in a Commons vote next week, but only if it thinks it has enough support to win. At the same time, a cross-party group of MPs will try to give Parliament control of Brexit by allowing a series of ""indicative"" votes on alternatives to the PM's deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted MPs only had a ""limited"" range of options ""if we are in the same situation this time next week"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Parliament could vote to revoke Article 50, which is cancelling the Brexit process. I think that's highly unlikely."" He said the other, more likely, options were leaving without a deal, or having a longer extension granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" he said. What happens now that a deal's been done? How does another Brexit delay work?

"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died as a result of the crush outside the St Patrick's Day disco Police have refused to apologise for the arrest and subsequent de-arrest of hotel owner Michael McElhatton over a suspected drug offence. The 52-year-old was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter followingthe deaths of three teenagersand has since been released on police bail. On Wednesday, he was further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. But after forensic testing of the substance, he was de-arrested. Police later said the white powder - which was found on Tuesday in an unmarked, unbranded, clear plastic bag, during a search of Mr McElhatton's home - was an ""innocent substance"". What does it mean to be de-arrested? How to talk to traumatised teens Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and Connor Currie, 16, died after a crush in the queue for a disco at the hotel on St Patrick's Day. A 40-year-old man, who was also arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, remains in police custody. Under the law he can only be held for a limited time before detectives must seek extensions. At a High Court hearing on Thursday he was granted anonymity but failed in a bid to secure an immediate release from custody. The court heard that since being detained XX has been taken to hospital twice for psychiatric assessments - trips accounting for a combined period in excess of 17 hours. The controversy over the drug ""de-arrest"" is a distraction the police would have wanted to avoid. The explanation for their actions has temporarily shifted the focus away from their overall investigation. The more serious question is whether public confidence in the quality of the investigation has been damaged in the Cookstown and Dungannon area and, crucially, amongst the families of those who died. There is no concrete evidence, to date, to suggest that it has done. Detectives will be hoping it stays that way. ""I'm not going to apologise, but I will explain,"" Det Ch Insp Raymond Murray told a press conference. He said he recognised the public concern, but ""everything that happened in relation to that arrest and seizure is what we normally do"" ""I have seen images of the discovery... white powder in an unmarked, unbranded, clear plastic bag, surrounded by tin foil pieces. This video can not be played Cookstown disco deaths: No apology for drugs arrest of hotelier ""The officer reasonably suspected that these were drugs and made the seizure."" In his statement issued earlier in response to the drugs arrest, Mr McElhatton said: ""While I wished to respect the ongoing investigation by the police into the tragic deaths of the three young people at the Greenvale Hotel on St Patrick's night, I have no choice but to make it completely clear that I have nothing whatsoever to do with drugs. ""I can assure everyone that whatever any suspicions the police have raised about me in relation to anything to do with drugs is totally without any basis. ""I am shocked and horrified that the powdery substance taken by police from the laundry in my house could be drugs. Greenvale owner Michael McElhatton said his name had been blackened by the drugs allegation ""Despite there being no basis to these suspicions, they have blackened my name and caused so much upset for so many people especially those who are grieving and distressed over the events at the Greenvale Hotel."" Some 400 people were outside the venue during the crush, police have said. Mr Murray said police had interviewed more than 80 people, adding that while they had identified the bulk of potential witnesses, any more ""still out there"" should come forward. Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to the investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal.,external The funerals for the three teenagers will be held on Friday.

"The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold amid continued uncertainty over Brexit. All nine members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep rates at 0.75%, where they have been since August last year. In the meeting's minutes,,externalthe MPC said the economic outlook would continue to depend ""significantly on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal"". The MPC's response in terms of interest rates could be ""in either direction"". In setting interest rates the Bank is aiming to keep inflation within 1% either side of its target of 2% ""in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment"". The inflation rate in February was 1.9% and is expected to remain ""close to the 2% target over coming months"". In the minutes of its latest meeting, the Bank said thatpredictions contained in its February inflation report,external""appear on track"". The projections were conditional on a ""smooth adjustment to the average of a range of possible outcomes for the UK's eventual trading relationship with the EU"". It added that the economic outlook would continue to ""depend significantly"" on the nature and timing of EU withdrawal. In particular it highlighted the ""new trading arrangements between the EU and the UK; whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth; and how households, businesses and financial markets respond"". ""The appropriate path of monetary policy will depend on the balance of these effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The monetary policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes, will not be automatic and could be in either direction."" Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC, said the most notable aspect of the statement was how little had changed over the past month. ""The global economy is slowing, the UK economy is still growing modestly, held up by consumer spending and dragged down by business investment; employment remains very strong and inflation around the Bank's 2% target. ""As there are still a number of potential outcomes to the Brexit process, the Bank is keeping all options on the table, pledging that its next move could be in either direction."" The Bank found that the ""cumulative effect of Brexit uncertainties"" had hit investment by companies. Its data suggested that the level of ""nominal investment"" may be between 6-14% lower than would have been the case in the absence of Brexit uncertainties, with larger items such as machinery, equipment and buildings singled out in particular. The Bank warned that a short delay to Brexit could prompt firms to cut investment even more. A short delay may see a ""larger immediate reduction"", while firms hold off and wait for a deal to be reached. If the delay carried on for longer, it might have less of an effect on investment as businesses ""judge it too costly to wait for any resolution to become apparent"", according to the Bank. There was also further evidence that companies were continuing to stockpile, the Bank said, though the signs were that imports had risen strongly recently, so a lot of the goods were coming from overseas. According to the findings of a special survey carried out by the Bank's agents, about 80% of firms thought they were ready for a no-deal, no-transition Brexit scenario, against about 50% in January. However, ""companies had continued to report significantly weaker expectations of output, employment and investment in the  event of a no-deal, no transition Brexit"". PwC's Mike Jakeman said given the ""high anxiety"" about the UK's future relationship with the EU, it was ""inconceivable"" the Bank would have raised rates this month. ""However, its base assumption remains that a disorderly Brexit will be avoided and that in this outcome the economy will require a gradual tightening of monetary policy as slack gradually disappears. ""We concur and expect the Bank to raise interest rates once in the second half of the year, if a no-deal Brexit is avoided."" Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said there were three ""distinct paths"" interest rates could take depending on what happens with Brexit. If Parliament passes Mrs May's withdrawal deal next week, the ""elimination of uncertainty would support a strengthening in the economy"". In that case, Capital Economics thinks the MPC could raise rates four times by the end of 2020, with the first increase coming in August of this year. If there was a long delay to Brexit of a year or more, Mr Wishart said the MPC might raise rates in the summer, However, if there was a no-deal Brexit next week, Capital thinks the MPC could cut rates to 0.25% at its next scheduled meeting in May, or even earlier at an emergency meeting.

"This video can not be played Det Ch Insp Pete Montgomery talked about the footage on the BBC's Crimewatch programme on Thursday. Police believe the gunman who killed a west Belfast man outside a school in December was at the scene five days previously, waiting for him. They have also attributed the murder of Jim Donegan, 43, to the INLA, a republican paramilitary group. Mr Donegan wasshot dead as he waited to collect his teenage son on the Glen Roadon 4 December. The latest CCTV images of the alleged gunman were broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme on Thursday. Donegan murder investigation criticised PSNI investigated over murder victim threat School shooting scene 'covered by coats' Donegan family asks for 'no retaliation' They show the suspected killer standing among school children outside St Mary's Grammar school on 29 November. Analysis: Who are the INLA? By Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI home affairs correspondent The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) is believed to have been behind 120 murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In 1979, it used a car bomb to murder Tory MP Airey Neave at the House of Commons. Post-ceasefire in 1998, it has morphed into an organised criminal gang, whose activities include extortion and prostitution. A government report four years ago said it operated largely ""for the personal gain of its membership"". It is one of the groups targeted by the Paramilitary Crime Task Force, led by the PSNI, established in late 2017. Last April, the task force mounted a major arrest operation against the INLA in greater Belfast. It continues to have access to some weapons. Read more: Who are the INLA? Speaking on Crimewatch,  PSNI Det Ch Insp Pete Montgomery said: ""This is CCTV footage from 29 November and I believe this is the same person who murdered Jim.

"The INLA has been on ceasefire since 1998 The Irish National Liberation Army was a familiar name on news bulletins throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland. A much smaller group than the IRA, it retained a capacity for ruthless killing and was behind some of the most high-profile murders of the period. The republican paramilitary group is believed to have been responsible for more than 120 murders from its formation in 1975 until its ceasefire in 1998. Despite its declared ceasefire, the INLA is still thought to have been involved in a number of murders since then. In February 2009, the INLA claimed responsibility for the murder of a drug dealer in Londonderry. The group has regularly indulged in bouts of bloody infighting. Formed in 1975, many of its early recruits were thought to have come from the Official IRA which had called a ceasefire three years earlier. It came to world prominence in 1979 with the murder of Conservative Northern Ireland spokesman Airey Neave by leaving a bomb under his car in the House of Commons car park. In December, it was behind one of Northern Ireland's worst atrocities when it killed 17 people in a bomb attack on the Droppin' Well pub in Ballykelly, County Londonderry. When other paramilitaries began declaring ceasefires in 1994, the INLA did not follow suit until four years later. In December 1997, Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright was shot dead inside the Maze prison by the INLA. Three members of the INLA died in the jail while on hunger strike in the 1980s. The INLA murdered Airey Neave in a car bomb outside the Commons In February 2010, the INLA said it had decommissioned its weapons. The INLA was believed to have a small arsenal and several dozen active members. It was thought to hold a small stock of rifles, hand guns and, possibly, grenades and a small amount of commercial explosives dating from the mid-1990s. In 2009, the Independent Monitoring Commission said its members remained deeply involved in serious crime, with extortion being its main form of income. INLA members were targeting individuals and exploiting tensions at sectarian interfaces in the recent past, the commission said. In its report in 2010, it said it ""had no reason to change the view we had expressed before that the organisation remained capable of criminal violence"".

"The family of Jim Donegan, who was murdered outside a school in west Belfast, have asked for ""no retaliation, only justice"". Mr Donegan, 43, was shoton 4 December while waiting for his 13-year-old son outside St Mary's Grammar Schoolon the Glen Road. His funeral took place on Thursday at St John's Parish. Parish priest Fr Martin Magill passed on the family's message to mourners, saying they were ""heartbroken"". CCTV shows gunman 'mixing with pupils' Shooting scene 'covered by coats' ""We are truly heartbroken by Jim being taken away from us in such a cruel, cold way but we wish for no retaliation, only justice for Jim,"" Fr Magill said. Jim Donegan was shot dead while waiting for his son outside of a school ""Those words come from Jim's family as they prepared for this Requiem Mass.  They are heartfelt and sincere."" Fr Magill also told the congregation that some relatives and friends of Jim learned of his death after pictures of his car were posted on social media. By BBC News NI's Catherine Morrison Several hundred mourners filled St John's Church on the Falls Road, on a cold and bleak December morning. Jim Donegan's young sons helped carry his coffin in for the Requiem Mass - the red and white flowers a tribute to his love of Liverpool Football Club. Personal items - his wedding photograph, a car key and sunglasses - were brought to the front of the church. As the service drew to a close, his widow, Laura, addressed mourners. She told them her husband was the light of her life - of their family's lives. As the cortege then made its way up the Falls Road, mourners walked behind the coffin. Mr Donegan's youngest son kept one hand on it, a final goodbye. He also added that ""speculation and allegations"" that Jim was involved in criminal activity had added to the family's grief. ""Last Tuesday afternoon, Jim Donegan went to collect his son from school, an ordinary and everyday event in the lives of so many parents,"" Fr Magill said. ""His murder in any circumstances was wrong but even more so in the presence of children who were nearby and witnessed the traumatic scene, one that will stay with them for the rest of their lives."" Mr Donegan was described to the congregation as a ""hard worker, business man and gentleman"". Fr Magill also passed on the family's gratitude to the members of the public and the teachers from nearby schools who stopped to try and help in the aftermath of the shooting.

"This video can not be played Commons Speaker John Bercow tells MPs they are not traitors Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended Parliament, telling MPs ""none of you is a traitor"". His comments come afterTheresa May told the publicshe was ""on their side"" and blamed the delay to Brexit on MPs. SNP MP Pete Wishart accused the prime minister of irresponsibility, while Labour's Paula Sherriff urged her to ""dial down the hate"". A spokesman for the prime minister ""flatly rejected"" the suggestion that her comments had put MPs at risk. Speaking from Downing Street on Wednesday evening, Mrs May said the public were ""tired of infighting and political games"" and it was ""high time"" politicians made a decision on the next steps. ""So far Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,"" said Mrs May. ""All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want."" Her statement was criticised by MPs for laying the blame for the delay in Brexit with MPs at a time of heightened tensions. SNP MP Pete Wishart said it was ""the height of irresponsibility by the prime minister to pitch the public against Parliament in this current climate"". He added that there were a few MPs feeling  ""just a little bit more insecure this morning"". Labour MP Paula Sherriff told MPs that she had received messages saying that her head should be ""chopped off"". Labour's Paula Sherriff urged the prime minister to show leadership She said she had spoken to the prime minister last Thursday and had ""begged her to dial down the hate"". ""People are frightened, not just in this place, but in the country as a whole,"" she said. ""The prime minister must show some leadership."" Another Labour MP, Diana Johnson, said she had seen Facebook posts calling for her, and other MPs, to be ""shot and hanged"". She called for a debate on how MPs ""love our country, want the best for our country and how there is much more that unites us than divides us"". Earlier, Remain-supporter Tory MP Sam Gyimah, who quit as a minister over her deal, described her remarks as ""toxic"" and said the ""blame game"" was ""a low blow"". Labour's Lisa Nandy called Mrs May's statement as ""disgraceful"" for ""pitting Parliament against the people"", while fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting added it was ""incendiary and irresponsible"" at a time when some MPs had received death threats. Conservative Dominic Grieve said: ""Simply browbeating MPs into submission serves no purpose at all,"" adding ""it brings us, the government, Parliament and democracy itself into contempt."" Addressing MPs, Speaker John Bercow said: ""None of you is a traitor - all of you are doing your best. ""I believe passionately in the institution of Parliament and in the rights of members of this House and in their commitment to their duty,"" he said.

"Jeremy Corbyn says he is seeking a ""constructive alternative"" to the PM's deal, in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader was speaking after meeting the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, for talks in Brussels. It comes ahead of an EU summit where Theresa May will ask EU leaders to postpone Brexit for three months. Mr Corbyn said he did not believe the PM's deal ""is a way forward"". ""We are therefore looking at alternatives, and building a majority in Parliament that can agree on a future constructive economic relationship with the European Union,"" he told reporters after the meeting. Mr Corbyn was joined by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer for the talks, which also included European Commission Secretary-General Martin Selmayr. Brexit: Theresa May at Brussels EU summit to urge short delay Brexit delay: How can Article 50 be extended? He is also expected to meet seven European leaders at the two-day summit, which begins later. Mr Corbyn has faced criticism after walking out of a Brexit meeting with the PM on Wednesday because Labour defectors, who are now members of the Independent Group, turned up. Independent Group spokesman Chuka Umunna described the Labour leader's behaviour as ""juvenile"" at a time of national crisis. After the meeting, other opposition party leaders said they were unimpressed with what they heard from the prime minister. Mr Corbyn said there had been ""a confusion"" over the meeting, and he had held separate discussions with Mrs May later on. ""I'm also arranging to meet the prime minister next week again on a one-to-one basis,"" he added. Labour has backed an extension of Brexit talks to find an alternative to the prime minister's deal which will command a majority in the Commons. On Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said Labour's plans were ""not credible"", and the party was asking for ""things that are simply not on offer"".

"Nicola Sturgeon is quizzed by opposition party leaders during FMQs Jackson Carlaw, Richard Leonard, Patrick Harvie and Willie Rennie all have questions today We expect FMQs to begin with tributes being paid to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack Craig Hutchison and Emma Gordon Nicola Sturgeon said Theresa May had failed to take responsibility for her role in the Brexit ""mess"" That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 21 March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May ""must change course"" on Brexit ""before it is too late"", Nicola Sturgeon has said. Mrs May is in Brussels for talks over an extension to the Brexit deadline, having laid the blame for the delay squarely on MPs in a public statement. The Scottish first minister said Mrs May's comments were ""deeply irresponsible"" and ""failed to accept"" her own responsibility for the ""mess"". Ms Sturgeon said that ""if all else fails"", MPs should revoke Article 50. Scottish government motion Labour amendment The government land reform motion, as amended by Labour, is agreed to with 83 MSPs backing it and 32 against. MSPs back the Labour amendment with 83 MSPs agreeing to it and 32 against. They reject the Green amendment, with 32 MSPs backing it and 83 against. MSPs reject the Tory amendment on land reform, 27 MSPs back it and 87 reject it.  Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham says the Scottish Land Commission report is evidence based. Ms Cunningham points out there was little evidence of support for land reform in Edward Mountain's speech. She goes on to say she will resist the Green amendment today. The minister concludes: ""When we talk about our aspirations for our land, we talk about our aspirations for ourselves. ""Land is not a commodity it's a human right."" Maurice Golden closes for the Conservatives, saying the Scottish government is one of the biggest landowners in Scotland. Land is very important to the people of Scotland, for living, food, and leisure, he says. ""There is too much focus on ownership, rather than how it is being used."" Most landowners are being tarred with the same brush, the West Scotland MSP states. There is cross party support for land reform, but it must be evidence-based, he adds. Privacy and safety of landowners must be respected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Large concentrations of land ownership are leading to power being abused in some parts of Scotland, according to a report by the Scottish Land Commission. Its investigation said a ""land monopoly"" in effect existed in many areas. The report also said the law provided very little protection. Scottish Land and Estates, which represents land owners, said the report did not adequately reflect the contribution made by rural businesses. The commission's report calls for a public interest test for future land sales. Read more here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Lorraine Kelly has won a row over a Â£1.2m tax bill, after a judge ruled she was not employed by ITV, but performs as her ""chatty"" TV persona. Kelly, 59, who presents the show Lorraine on weekday mornings, received the national insurance and income tax bill from the tax office in 2016. HMRC claimed the Scottish broadcaster was an ITV employee, but she said she was a freelancer. The judge ruled in Kelly's favour that she was a ""self-employed star"". Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake The case centres on a contract that Kelly signed in 2012 - through a company she runs with her husband - to present Lorraine, as well as her former show Daybreak which ended in 2014 when Good Morning Britain was relaunched. Four years later, she was sent a bill of nearly Â£900,000 in income tax and more than Â£300,000 in national insurance contributions. Kelly appealed against tax authority HMRC, and the case was heard by the first-tier tax tribunal. Judge Jennifer Dean ruled that the relationship that Kelly had with ITV ""was a contract for services and not that of employer and employee"". The tribunal found that Kelly did not receive staff benefits such as holiday or sick pay and was allowed to carry out other work. The judge said that Kelly could be classed as a ""theatrical artist"", which would mean any payments to an agent would be allowed as a tax-deductible expense. Judge Dean said: ""We did not accept that Ms Kelly simply appeared as herself - we were satisfied that Ms Kelly presents a persona of herself, she presents herself as a brand and that is the brand ITV sought when engaging her. ""All parts of the show are a performance, the act being to perform the role of a friendly, chatty and fun personality. ""Quite simply put, the programmes are entertaining, Ms Kelly is entertaining and the 'DNA' referred to is the personality, performance, the 'Lorraine Kelly' brand that is brought to the programmes."" She added: ""We should make clear we do not doubt that Ms Kelly is an entertaining lady but the point is that for the time Ms Kelly is contracted to perform live on air she is public 'Lorraine Kelly'. ""She may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed but that is where the performance lies."" Kelly - who this year marked her 35th anniversary working in television - has been described as the queen of the breakfast TV sofa. The Glasgow-born broadcaster began her career at a local newspaper before joining BBC Scotland. In 1984 she landed her dream job as the roving Scotland correspondent for ITV's breakfast television franchise TV-am. This video can not be played Lorraine Kelly: I'm training to go into space! She went on to host GMTV and Daybreak, before her current slot on eponymous show Lorraine. In 2012, she was included on the New Year's Honours List,and was appointed an OBEfor services to charity and the armed forces. She has been involved with many charities and took part in the 100km (62 miles) BT Red Nose Desert Trek in Kenya, which raised money for Comic Relief projects. A spokesman for HMRC said it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling. ""We will carefully consider the outcome of the tribunal before deciding whether to appeal,"" he said. Someone's employment status - meaning whether they are classed as an employee or self-employed - determines how much tax they pay. The tax affairs of freelance presenters working at the BBChave also made headlines,after some presenters faced big tax bills after being given no choice about changes to the way they were employed. Earlier this year, director generalTony Hall apologisedto the presenters affected and said the BBC aimed to get the issue sorted with HMRC.

"Nicola Sturgeon is quizzed by opposition party leaders during FMQs Jackson Carlaw, Richard Leonard, Patrick Harvie and Willie Rennie all have questions today We expect FMQs to begin with tributes being paid to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack Craig Hutchison and Emma Gordon Nicola Sturgeon said Theresa May had failed to take responsibility for her role in the Brexit ""mess"" That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 21 March 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May ""must change course"" on Brexit ""before it is too late"", Nicola Sturgeon has said. Mrs May is in Brussels for talks over an extension to the Brexit deadline, having laid the blame for the delay squarely on MPs in a public statement. The Scottish first minister said Mrs May's comments were ""deeply irresponsible"" and ""failed to accept"" her own responsibility for the ""mess"". Ms Sturgeon said that ""if all else fails"", MPs should revoke Article 50. Scottish government motion Labour amendment The government land reform motion, as amended by Labour, is agreed to with 83 MSPs backing it and 32 against. MSPs back the Labour amendment with 83 MSPs agreeing to it and 32 against. They reject the Green amendment, with 32 MSPs backing it and 83 against. MSPs reject the Tory amendment on land reform, 27 MSPs back it and 87 reject it.  Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham says the Scottish Land Commission report is evidence based. Ms Cunningham points out there was little evidence of support for land reform in Edward Mountain's speech. She goes on to say she will resist the Green amendment today. The minister concludes: ""When we talk about our aspirations for our land, we talk about our aspirations for ourselves. ""Land is not a commodity it's a human right."" Maurice Golden closes for the Conservatives, saying the Scottish government is one of the biggest landowners in Scotland. Land is very important to the people of Scotland, for living, food, and leisure, he says. ""There is too much focus on ownership, rather than how it is being used."" Most landowners are being tarred with the same brush, the West Scotland MSP states. There is cross party support for land reform, but it must be evidence-based, he adds. Privacy and safety of landowners must be respected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Large concentrations of land ownership are leading to power being abused in some parts of Scotland, according to a report by the Scottish Land Commission. Its investigation said a ""land monopoly"" in effect existed in many areas. The report also said the law provided very little protection. Scottish Land and Estates, which represents land owners, said the report did not adequately reflect the contribution made by rural businesses. The commission's report calls for a public interest test for future land sales. Read more here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played 'It has become an inland sea' An appeal to help the survivors of Cyclone Idai has been launched by the UK's Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC). At least 300 people are confirmed dead in Mozambique along with another 100 in neighbouring Zimbabwe, but the death toll is feared to be much higher. Aid workers in Mozambique say there are only two or three days of clean water left in the devastated city of Beira. Although supplies have begun to arrive, some communities remain cut off. Thousands of people are stranded by catastrophic flooding, clinging to roofs or stuck in trees, charities say. Rescuers race to reach cyclone survivors In pictures: Cyclone Idai devastation Cyclone Idai and the climate connection 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' In a statement, DEC said its members were working closely with national organisations to deliver emergency shelter kits, food, water purification tablets and medical help. Penny Mordaunt, the UK's International Development Secretary, described the cyclone as ""one of the biggest natural disasters"" to hit the southern African region. The committee brings together 14 UK charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals The charities include Oxfam GB, Save the Children UK, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Christian Aid and Islamic Relief Worldwide Its website,externalprovides more details of its Cyclone Idai Appeal and its other current appeals Broadcasters including the BBC will show the DEC fundraising appeals on Thursday.

""Right now the primary focus is to save lives, but the after-effects of this crisis will be felt for some time to come."" The powerful cyclone swept in to Beira last Thursday, with winds of more than 177 km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland across Zimbabwe and Malawi.

"Theresa May has said she ""sincerely hopes"" the UK will leave the EU with a deal and she is still ""working on"" ensuring Parliament's agreement. Arriving in Brussels, she said that she had ""personal regret"" over her request to delay Brexit, but said it will allow time for MPs to make a ""final choice"". At the EU summit the PM spoke to the other 27 leaders to try to get their backing for a delay beyond 29 March. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn said his talks in Brussels were ""very constructive"". BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said Mrs May spoke to EU leaders for 90 minutes and was asked several times what her contingency plans were if she lost the third ""meaningful vote"" on her deal in Parliament. Live updates: PM appeals to EU leaders Revoke Article 50 petition crashes site John Bercow: MPs are not traitors Corbyn calls for Brexit compromise Your really simple guide to Brexit French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that if MPs vote down Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement next week, the UK will leave without a deal. ""In the case of a negative British vote then we'd be heading to a no deal. We all know it. And it's essential to be clear in these days and moments,"" said Mr Macron, as he arrived at the summit. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that a short Brexit delay ""should be conditional on a positive vote next week in the House of Commons"". ""We have done our best, now the solution is in London,"" he said. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says no prime minister ""in living memory"" has been tested like Theresa May How the day will unfold (timings are approximate): EU leaders are discussing whether to grant the UK's request and examining other Brexit options 18:00 GMT - Press conference by European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker 18:30 GMT - Working dinner Mrs May is also expected to make a statement On her arrival in Brussels, Mrs May said: ""A short extension gives us that opportunity to decide to leave the European Union, to deliver on that result of that referendum and I sincerely hope that will be with a negotiated deal."" She added: ""I'm still working on ensuring that Parliament can agree a deal so that we can leave in an orderly way."" Earlier, speaking in the German Parliament, Angela Merkel said the EU could meet Mrs May's request to delay Brexit if in the next week there was a ""positive vote"" on the withdrawal agreement in the UK Parliament. The German Chancellor said European elections at the end of May would have to be considered during discussions on the suggested extension deadline of 30 June, adding: ""But of course we can certainly talk about a short term extension."" Beware the reports of ""huge"" differences between EU leaders when it comes to a Brexit delay and the way forward in the coming days. Take Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron: there are big differences in their political styles. And big differences in the message they want to send their own domestic audiences (tough for France; open for Germany) when talking about Brexit. But like most EU leaders - irritation, frustration and Brexit fatigue aside - they would rather avoid a costly no-deal Brexit. Chancellor Merkel, like European Council President Donald Tusk has announced she will work ""until the last hours"" to try to avoid it. And while EU leaders have ruled out re-opening the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the ""backstop"" text, you can bet they'll discuss a longer Brexit delay at their summit today. They will also discuss the short delay requested by Theresa May, in case - as the EU fears - chaos and division continue next week in Westminster. A risky pitch of Parliament versus Public How could Brexit be delayed? Brexit: What could happen next? Dover warns of Brexit disruption risk The UK is set to leave the EU next Friday unless the law is changed. The current default position for leaving is without a withdrawal agreement. Mrs May agreed a deal with the EU, but MPs have rejected it twice. She has asked the EU for a short extension of the two-year Brexit process until 30 June, but any extension needs to be agreed to by all EU members. European Council President Donald Tusksaid he believedthe EU would agree to a short extension, but this would only be if Mrs May's deal is signed off by MPs next week. Another EU summit next week could be called in an emergency if needed, he said. Mr Tusk said the ""question remains open"" as to how long a delay the other EU leaders would support. Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar said that he appreciated the situation in London was ""somewhat chaotic"" and for that reason ""we need to cut the entire British establishment a little bit of slack on this"". He said there was ""openness to an extension"" as ""nobody wants no deal"". In her speech from Number 10 on Wednesday evening, Mrs May insisted she would not be willing to postpone Brexit any further than 30 June, despite appeals from some MPs. She added: ""Of this I am absolutely sure. You, the public, have had enough. ""You are tired of the infighting, tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children's schools, our National Health Service, knife crime. ""You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side."" She said it was now up to MPs to decide whether they wanted to leave with her deal, no deal or not to leave at all. But she warned that the latter option could cause ""irreparable damage to public trust"" in politicians. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be faced with three options if Mrs May's deal was defeated again next week: revoke Article 50; leave without a deal; or a longer extension could be granted at an emergency EU summit, but with ""onerous conditions"". ""The choice that we have now is one of resolving this issue or extreme unpredictability,"" Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He also defended the prime minister's statement, saying Mrs May was under ""extraordinary pressure"" and MPs have a ""special responsibility"" in a hung Parliament. Many MPs have expressed anger at Mrs May's comments, with Conservative MP Nicky Morgan telling the BBC's World at One they were ""terribly misjudged"". Fellow Tory Ben Bradley, who had backed Mrs May's deal, said they were ""not helpful"". Meanwhile,union and business leaders have written,externala joint letter to Mrs May urging her to ""change course"" in her approach to Brexit, saying the UK is facing a ""national emergency"". TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn have requested a meeting to discuss their concerns. They said: ""Our country is facing a national emergency. Decisions of recent days have caused the risk of no deal to soar. ""Firms and communities across the UK are not ready for this outcome. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come."" Jeremy Corbyn says consensus can be built around Labour's plan Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said talks with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr in Brussels were ""very constructive"". ""Our determination is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union next Friday,"" he said. ""We are therefore looking for alternatives and building a majority in Parliament that can agree on a future constructive economic relationship with the European Union."" He said he had been ""reaching out"" to colleagues from all parties in Parliament on this.

"Language in the north east of Scotland will feature heavily in the study A major new linguistic survey of the Scots vocabulary is being launched, in a bid to help preserve the language. Researchers at the University of Aberdeen will lead what they describe as the first comprehensive appraisal of the language to be conducted since the 1950s. It will cover Scots as well as what is known as Ulster-Scots. The project - said to be a ""huge undertaking"" - is expected to take many years to complete. Allow Twitter content?

Robert Millar, a professor in Linguistics and Scottish Language at the University of Aberdeen, explained: ""In Scotland we have the Linguistic Atlas of Scotland and Dictionary of the Scots Language but both draw heavily on material collated in the 1950s. In Ireland no such equivalent exists for Ulster Scots. ""The Linguistic Survey of Scots in the 1950s was ground breaking but does it remain relevant today? This is a question we will be seeking to address. ""This will be the first real attempt to move towards a survey that will give us a sense of the language in the 2020s. ""We hope it will represent the same great leap forwards as the original survey did and can contribute greatly to our national dictionaries."" Prof Millar said: ""Language naturally changes over time and words are replaced and cannibalised. ""Much of what makes Scots so distinctive is entwined with occupations and pastimes that have changed beyond recognition since the surveys of the 1950s. ""Nonetheless Scots continues to play an important role in our cultural and everyday lives and informs both our identity and sense of place."" The project will get under way in the coming year. Prof Robert Millar says things have changed significantly in 60 years Prof Millar added: ""The previous survey was quite patchy and relied on volunteers so the quality of the information recorded varies significantly. ""We will use the north east of Scotland, which has one of the best preserved native speech varieties, as a test bed but want to collate information from across Scotland and the areas of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland where Ulster Scots is spoken.

"Windows were smashed at five mosques around Birmingham Five mosques in Birmingham have been targeted in a string of violent attacks overnight and into the morning. Reports of a man smashing windows with a sledgehammer on Birchfield Road were received at 02:30 GMT, police said. Officers were then alerted to a similar attack in Erdington about 45 minutes later, with more in Aston and Perry Barr reported. Another on Albert Road was struck at 10:00 GMT. West Midlands Police said it was yet to establish a motive. Officers from its Counter Terrorism Unit were investigating, the force said. Yousef Zaman, chairman of Masjid Faizul Islam mosque in Aston, said: ""My initial reaction was shock that this had happened. ""There's a fear factor now in that adults are saying they're going to keep their children away from the mosque today because they're worried that it's not safe. ""But we're not going to stop worship, we're going to carry on as normal, we won't let them win, we will defy them."" He said a summit was planned to discuss security around the mosques. Police forensic teams were at work at the mosque on Albert Road following the attack A spokesperson for Witton Islamic Centre on Witton Road, also in Aston, said CCTV captured a man smashing windows at about 01:30. ""The whole of the front windows, about six, were smashed,"" he said. ""Because of the force he used it's gone through the windows and into the mosque itself"". Councillor Majid Mahmood tweeted a video of the clean-up taking place at the centre. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Most of the dead bodies of mountaineers have appeared on the Khumbu Glacier Expedition operators are concerned at the number of climbers' bodies that are becoming exposed on Mount Everest as its glaciers melt. Nearly 300 mountaineers have died on the peak since the first ascent attempt and two-thirds of bodies are thought still to be buried in the snow and ice. Bodies are being removed on the Chinese side of the mountain, to the north, as the spring climbing season starts. More than 4,800 climbers have scaled the highest peak on Earth. ""Because of global warming, the ice sheet and glaciers are fast melting and the dead bodies that remained buried all these years are now becoming exposed,"" said Ang Tshering Sherpa, former president of Nepal Mountaineering Association. ""We have brought down dead bodies of some mountaineers who died in recent years, but the old ones that remained buried are now coming out."" And a government officer who worked as a liaison officer on Everest added: ""I myself have retrieved around 10 dead bodies in recent years from different locations on Everest and clearly more and more of them are emerging now."" High Mountain Asia's glaciers put the brakes on BBC Future: Death in the clouds Recovery of climbers' bodies 'possible' Officials with the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal (EOAN) said they were bringing down all ropes from the higher camps of Everest and Lhotse mountains this climbing season, but dealing with dead bodies was not as easy. They point at Nepal's law that requires government agencies' involvement when dealing with bodies and said that was a challenge. ""This issue needs to be prioritised by both the government and the mountaineering industry,"" said Dambar Parajuli, president of EOAN. ""If they can do it on the Tibet side of Everest, we can do it here as well."" Dead bodies are said to be appearing at Camp 4 mainly because of its flat ground In 2017, the hand of a dead mountaineer appeared above the ground at Camp 1. Expedition operators said they deployed professional climbers of the Sherpa community to move the body. The same year, another body appeared on the surface of the Khumbu Glacier. Also known as the Khumbu Icefall, this is where most dead bodies have been surfacing in recent years, mountaineers say. Another place that has been seeing dead bodies becoming exposed is the Camp 4 area, also called South Col, which is relatively flat. ""Hands and legs of dead bodies have appeared at the base camp as well in the last few years,"" said an official with a non-government organisation active in the region. ""We have noticed that the ice level at and around the base camp has been going down, and that is why the bodies are becoming exposed."" Scientists have found ponds expanding and joining up on the Khumbu Glacier Several studies show that glaciers in the Everest region, as in most parts of the Himalayas, are fast melting and thinning. A study in 2015 revealed that ponds on the Khumbu Glacier - that climbers need to cross to scale the mighty peak - were expanding and joining up because of the accelerated melting. Nepal's army drained the Imja Lake near Mount Everest in 2016 after its water from rapid glacial-melt had reached dangerous levels. Another team of researchers, including members from Leeds and Aberystwyth universities in the UK, last year drilled the Khumbu Glacier and found the ice to be warmer than expected. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external The ice recorded a minimum temperature of only â3.3C, with even the coldest ice being a full 2C warmer than the mean annual air temperature. Not all dead bodies emerging from under the ice, however, are because of rapid glacial meltdown. Some of them get exposed also because of the movement of the Khumbu Glacier, mountaineers say. ""Because of the movement of the Khumbu Glacier, we do get to see dead bodies from time to time,"" said Tshering Pandey Bhote, vice president of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. ""But most climbers are mentally prepared to come across such a sight."" Most of the dead bodies brought down relate to recent incidents on the mountains Some of the dead bodies on the higher altitude sectors of Mount Everest have also served as landmarks for mountaineers. One such waypoint had been the ""green boots"" near the summit. They were a reference to a climber who died under an overhanging rock. His green boots, still on his feet, faced the climbing route. Some climbing experts said the body was later removed while Nepal's tourism officials said they had no information on whether the remains are still visible. Recovering and removing bodies from the higher camps can be both expensive and difficult. Experts say it costs $40,000 to $80,000 to bring down dead bodies. ""One of the most challenging recoveries was from the height of 8,700m, near the summit,"" said Ang Tshering Sherpa, the former president of NMA. ""The body was totally frozen and weighed 150kg and it had to be recovered from a difficult place at that altitude."" Experts say any decision over what to do with a dead body on the mountain is also a very personal issue. ""Most climbers like to be left on the mountains if they died,"" said Alan Arnette, a noted mountaineer who also writes on mountaineering. ""So it would be deemed disrespectful to just remove them unless they need to be moved from the climbing route or their families want them.""

"Retail sales rose in February, up by 0.4% on the previous month, official figures show. But sales at food stores saw the biggest fall since December 2016,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Separate data,externalshowed government borrowing fell to Â£0.2bn in February from Â£1.2bn a year earlier. After 11 months of the current financial year, government borrowing stands at Â£23.1bn, 44% lower than in the same period last year. Unusually warm weather in February contributed to the rise in retail sales, said the ONS, boosting spending at garden centres and on sporting equipment. A decline of 1.2% in food stores was offset by growth in all other main sectors, it added. The ONS's head of retail sales, Rhian Murphy, said strong increases in fuel sales and online shopping had also driven the continued ""bounce back"". She added: ""Food growth slowed, however, due to a significant fall for supermarkets, specialist food and alcohol stores in February after the sales and promotions seen in January came to an end."" Annual retail sales growth in the year to February was 4%. Food and wine costs push up inflation UK employment at highest since 1971 The government borrowing figures, issued separately, are subject to revision. January's figure, which at the time showed a record surplus of Â£14.9bn, has now been revised down to Â£13.3bn. In his Spring Statement last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the borrowing forecast for the 2018-19 financial year to Â£22.8bn, almost Â£3bn lower than the Â£25.5bn predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the October 2018 Budget. However, the January revision means that Mr Hammond ""may just miss out"" on his new lower forecast, according to analysis by the EY Item Club. The government needs to borrow the money to plug the gap between what it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. The OBR expects the improvement in the public finances to continue in future years, helped by stronger tax receipts and lower spending on debt interest. Mr Hammond warned that a disorderly Brexit would deal a ""significant"" blow to economic activity in the short term and pledged to spend Â£26.6bn to boost the economy if MPs voted to leave the EU with a deal. Public sector net debt at the end of February 2019 was Â£1,785.6bn or 82.8% of GDP. That was Â£22.7bn higher than in February 2018, but 1.4 percentage points lower as a proportion of GDP. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""With just eight days to go until Brexit and the uncertainty higher than ever, it is reassuring that in February households increased their spending at a decent rate. ""And February's public finances data suggest that the chancellor has the cash to splash if there were a no-deal Brexit.""

"Lorraine Kelly has won a row over a Â£1.2m tax bill, after a judge ruled she was not employed by ITV, but performs as her ""chatty"" TV persona. Kelly, 59, who presents the show Lorraine on weekday mornings, received the national insurance and income tax bill from the tax office in 2016. HMRC claimed the Scottish broadcaster was an ITV employee, but she said she was a freelancer. The judge ruled in Kelly's favour that she was a ""self-employed star"". Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake The case centres on a contract that Kelly signed in 2012 - through a company she runs with her husband - to present Lorraine, as well as her former show Daybreak which ended in 2014 when Good Morning Britain was relaunched. Four years later, she was sent a bill of nearly Â£900,000 in income tax and more than Â£300,000 in national insurance contributions. Kelly appealed against tax authority HMRC, and the case was heard by the first-tier tax tribunal. Judge Jennifer Dean ruled that the relationship that Kelly had with ITV ""was a contract for services and not that of employer and employee"". The tribunal found that Kelly did not receive staff benefits such as holiday or sick pay and was allowed to carry out other work. The judge said that Kelly could be classed as a ""theatrical artist"", which would mean any payments to an agent would be allowed as a tax-deductible expense. Judge Dean said: ""We did not accept that Ms Kelly simply appeared as herself - we were satisfied that Ms Kelly presents a persona of herself, she presents herself as a brand and that is the brand ITV sought when engaging her. ""All parts of the show are a performance, the act being to perform the role of a friendly, chatty and fun personality. ""Quite simply put, the programmes are entertaining, Ms Kelly is entertaining and the 'DNA' referred to is the personality, performance, the 'Lorraine Kelly' brand that is brought to the programmes."" She added: ""We should make clear we do not doubt that Ms Kelly is an entertaining lady but the point is that for the time Ms Kelly is contracted to perform live on air she is public 'Lorraine Kelly'. ""She may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed but that is where the performance lies."" Kelly - who this year marked her 35th anniversary working in television - has been described as the queen of the breakfast TV sofa. The Glasgow-born broadcaster began her career at a local newspaper before joining BBC Scotland. In 1984 she landed her dream job as the roving Scotland correspondent for ITV's breakfast television franchise TV-am. This video can not be played Lorraine Kelly: I'm training to go into space! She went on to host GMTV and Daybreak, before her current slot on eponymous show Lorraine. In 2012, she was included on the New Year's Honours List,and was appointed an OBEfor services to charity and the armed forces. She has been involved with many charities and took part in the 100km (62 miles) BT Red Nose Desert Trek in Kenya, which raised money for Comic Relief projects. A spokesman for HMRC said it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling. ""We will carefully consider the outcome of the tribunal before deciding whether to appeal,"" he said. Someone's employment status - meaning whether they are classed as an employee or self-employed - determines how much tax they pay. The tax affairs of freelance presenters working at the BBChave also made headlines,after some presenters faced big tax bills after being given no choice about changes to the way they were employed. Earlier this year, director generalTony Hall apologisedto the presenters affected and said the BBC aimed to get the issue sorted with HMRC.

Analysis: Who are the INLA? By Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI home affairs correspondent The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) is believed to have been behind 120 murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In 1979, it used a car bomb to murder Tory MP Airey Neave at the House of Commons. Post-ceasefire in 1998, it has morphed into an organised criminal gang, whose activities include extortion and prostitution. A government report four years ago said it operated largely ""for the personal gain of its membership"". It is one of the groups targeted by the Paramilitary Crime Task Force, led by the PSNI, established in late 2017. Last April, the task force mounted a major arrest operation against the INLA in greater Belfast. It continues to have access to some weapons. Read more: Who are the INLA?

"Staff at Brook House detention centre were filmed physically and verbally abusing detainees. The Home Office has ""utterly failed"" to ensure the safety of people held in UK immigration detention centres, a damning report says. MPs on the home affairs committee warn there are ""serious problems"" in almost every part of the detention system. They want to see an end to indefinite detention and much more done to protect vulnerable detainees, for example those who have been tortured. The Home Office says it is moving ""further and faster"" with reforms. The committee began examining the issue after a reporter fromBBC Panorama filmed staff at the Brook House detention centrephysically and verbally abusing detainees. Since the Panorama programme was broadcast in September 2017, 15 of the 21 staff allegedly involved in the incidents have either left G4S, resigned or been sacked. The committee says the uncovered abuse was ""not the first of its kind"", and urges the government to ensure immigration removal centres have safe and humane management, high quality healthcare and effective whistle-blowing procedures. Detainees 'treated like criminals' 'Serious flaws' in immigration decisions Detainees win bid for abuse inquiry It accuses the Home Office of having a ""shockingly cavalier attitude"" towards detention. The report calls for a 28-day limit on detentions, saying it is ""unacceptable"" that due to bureaucratic inefficiencies some people are detained for more than three years. It says policies that should prevent ""unlawful detention"" of vulnerable people are regularly applied in a way which means they are not being afforded the necessary protection. The report speaks of an ""institutional culture"" which prioritises the use of detention ""as a means to enforce removal"", above respect, dignity and the protection of vulnerable people. Kingsley Newuh claimed asylum in the UK Kingsley Newuh, 39, is a political asylum seeker who has been detained at Morton Hall detention centre twice. Morton Hall is run by the Prison Service on behalf of UK Border Agency. Mr Newuh, who campaigns with Movement For Justice, says he came to England on a student visa, and due to the nature of his research - which criticised the government of Cameroon - he was told he would face imprisonment, should he return to the country. He says he found the detention process ""terrifying"" and started feeling ""anxious and depressed"" by the time he was released, three months later. He claimspeople died in the detention centrewhile he was there, saying: ""I felt like a lamb to the slaughter. No one told me how long I was going to be there for - that was the most tormenting aspect of it, the fact I didn't know."" ""It's a prison under a different name. It was unsanitary, very, very dirty and I was locked in my room from 8am to 8pm."" The Home Office denies detaining people indefinitely, arguing that the ""law does not allow it"". A spokesman said: ""Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention. ""We are looking closely at the issue of time limits to understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies."" The report doesn't use the phrase ""not fit for purpose"", but it might as well have done. That was how John Reid described the immigration department he inherited as home secretary in 2006, after 1,000 foreign prisoners were freed without being considered for deportation. The scandal sparked a tougher approach towards immigration enforcement, with more people rounded up for detention and removal. Now the concern is that detention is being used too often, and for too long, in a system which remains dysfunctional. But there are tentative signs, evident in the Home Office's response, that ministers are aware of the problems and may be prepared to act. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs committee, said the Home Office's approach to immigration was ""careless and cavalier"", arguing that reform was needed urgently to ensure the detention system was fair, sensible, transparent and humane. She said: ""Making the wrong decision on detention can have a devastating impact on people's lives - as we saw from the Windrush scandal, but also from many other cases we have seen. ""The lack of any time limit and of proper judicial safeguards has allowed the Home Office to drift and delay, leaving people stuck in detention for months who really shouldn't be there at all."" Removal centres are used in cases where people have no legal right to be in the UK but have refused to leave voluntarily. They may hold asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions and people whose claims have failed and are awaiting deportation. A minority of detainees are foreign national prisoners who have completed prison terms for serious crimes and are being held in detention while steps are taken to remove them from the UK. The Home Office has 10 immigration centres in England. The Windrush generation is the name used for an estimated 500,000 people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971 and were granted indefinite leave to remain. However, following changes to immigration law, many who arrived as children found themselves later unable to prove their status and some were subsequently held in detention or removed - despite having lived in the UK for decades. Olu Adekunle, 47, became a refugee in the UK last year - after four years and three judicial reviews - and spent time at three different detention centres. He had claimed asylum after escaping persecution from Nigeria because of his sexuality. Mr Adekunle said: ""I felt like a criminal. You don't know what's going to happen to you."" He said he believed the UK immigration system assumed claimants were lying and were ""guilty until you prove you're innocent"". He recalled a time when he was ""chained like a dog"" during a hospital visit, and says that although he is now a refugee, he still suffers from anxiety. The Home Office says it is looking closely at the issue of time limits to ""understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies"".

"Retail sales rose in February, up by 0.4% on the previous month, official figures show. But sales at food stores saw the biggest fall since December 2016,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Separate data,externalshowed government borrowing fell to Â£0.2bn in February from Â£1.2bn a year earlier. After 11 months of the current financial year, government borrowing stands at Â£23.1bn, 44% lower than in the same period last year. Unusually warm weather in February contributed to the rise in retail sales, said the ONS, boosting spending at garden centres and on sporting equipment. A decline of 1.2% in food stores was offset by growth in all other main sectors, it added. The ONS's head of retail sales, Rhian Murphy, said strong increases in fuel sales and online shopping had also driven the continued ""bounce back"". She added: ""Food growth slowed, however, due to a significant fall for supermarkets, specialist food and alcohol stores in February after the sales and promotions seen in January came to an end."" Annual retail sales growth in the year to February was 4%. Food and wine costs push up inflation UK employment at highest since 1971 The government borrowing figures, issued separately, are subject to revision. January's figure, which at the time showed a record surplus of Â£14.9bn, has now been revised down to Â£13.3bn. In his Spring Statement last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond cut the borrowing forecast for the 2018-19 financial year to Â£22.8bn, almost Â£3bn lower than the Â£25.5bn predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the October 2018 Budget. However, the January revision means that Mr Hammond ""may just miss out"" on his new lower forecast, according to analysis by the EY Item Club. The government needs to borrow the money to plug the gap between what it spends on public services and the tax revenues it collects. The OBR expects the improvement in the public finances to continue in future years, helped by stronger tax receipts and lower spending on debt interest. Mr Hammond warned that a disorderly Brexit would deal a ""significant"" blow to economic activity in the short term and pledged to spend Â£26.6bn to boost the economy if MPs voted to leave the EU with a deal. Public sector net debt at the end of February 2019 was Â£1,785.6bn or 82.8% of GDP. That was Â£22.7bn higher than in February 2018, but 1.4 percentage points lower as a proportion of GDP. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""With just eight days to go until Brexit and the uncertainty higher than ever, it is reassuring that in February households increased their spending at a decent rate. ""And February's public finances data suggest that the chancellor has the cash to splash if there were a no-deal Brexit.""

"Aaron Campbell, 16, was given a minimum jail term of 27 years The 16-year-old who raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has been sentenced to a minimum of 27 years behind bars after he finally admitted his crime. During his trial, Aaron Campbell had repeatedly denied he abducted, raped and killed the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute last July. But he admitted his offences to a psychologist preparing a report to the court ahead of his sentencing. Judge Lord Matthews imposed a life sentence for the ""brutal"" murder. He set the punishment part of the sentence, before Campbell can apply for parole, at 27 years. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Read the judge's sentencing statement in full,external Lord Matthews said Campbell's crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief"". He said Alesha had been violated and murdered and told Campbell he was a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The judge read out Campbell's ""cold blooded and horrific"" account of his actions that night and how he described seeing Alesha asleep in her room as ""a moment of opportunity"". Campbell's confession was contained in the criminal justice social report and the criminal psychologist's report, which were prepared ahead of his sentencing. The report by the forensic clinical psychologist Dr Gary Macpherson quoted Campbell as saying: ""At any other time in life murder would not have been the conclusion. ""If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence In his sentencing statement, the judge said the teenager had shown breathtaking arrogance during the trial and had failed to plead guilty despite overwhelming evidence against him. He said he had shown ""a staggering lack of remorse"". ""Not once did I detect a flicker of emotion from you,"" the judge said. Lord Matthews said it would be for others to decide if Campbell would ever be released, indeed, he said his reintegration into society might be ""impossible"". During his nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow last month, Campbell claimed he had never met his victim and lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. The judge said this was a ""cruel travesty of the truth"" and said the woman he blamed, Toni McLachlan, was ""completely innocent"". Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial The judge said he was ""shocked"" by the clear admissions of guilt in the background reports, especially after the ""tissue of lies"" Campbell had told in court. The psychologist said that on the night of Alesha's death Campbell had been drinking and wanted cannabis so he decided to go into her father's home to get some. Alesha's father had previously sold him the drug. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' In his sentencing statement, Lord Matthews said Campbell had carried Alesha to a secluded spot where he raped and murdered her ""in the most brutal fashion"". He told the teenager: ""You said that Alesha was drowsy and became a bit more awake when you went out. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead ""At one point she asked who you were and where you were going. ""You said you were a friend of her father and that you were taking her home."" Campbell gave Alesha his coat because she was cold. The judge said that over the next few days Campbell was unconcerned about what had happened, and was ""slightly amused"" that the police had not caught him. The court heard that the teenager had said he was ""quite satisfied by the murder"". Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane leaves court after the sentencing The judge said Campbell told Dr Macpherson that at points during the trial it took ""everything to stop laughing"" and he had to ""zip his mouth"". Lord Matthews said the reports concluded that Campbell was not suffering from a mental health disorder but showed a total lack of victim empathy. Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was just days into a holiday when she was abducted from her bed. She was reported missing from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, near Rothesay, at 06:23 on 2 July last year. Dozens of islanders joined the search for the child but at 08:54 her naked body was discovered in a wooded area in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. After the sentence was read out family members shouted ""evil"" and ""beast"" as Campbell was led down to the cells. Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Identity of Alesha's killer revealed.

"Staff at Brook House detention centre were filmed physically and verbally abusing detainees. The Home Office has ""utterly failed"" to ensure the safety of people held in UK immigration detention centres, a damning report says. MPs on the home affairs committee warn there are ""serious problems"" in almost every part of the detention system. They want to see an end to indefinite detention and much more done to protect vulnerable detainees, for example those who have been tortured. The Home Office says it is moving ""further and faster"" with reforms. The committee began examining the issue after a reporter fromBBC Panorama filmed staff at the Brook House detention centrephysically and verbally abusing detainees. Since the Panorama programme was broadcast in September 2017, 15 of the 21 staff allegedly involved in the incidents have either left G4S, resigned or been sacked. The committee says the uncovered abuse was ""not the first of its kind"", and urges the government to ensure immigration removal centres have safe and humane management, high quality healthcare and effective whistle-blowing procedures. Detainees 'treated like criminals' 'Serious flaws' in immigration decisions Detainees win bid for abuse inquiry It accuses the Home Office of having a ""shockingly cavalier attitude"" towards detention. The report calls for a 28-day limit on detentions, saying it is ""unacceptable"" that due to bureaucratic inefficiencies some people are detained for more than three years. It says policies that should prevent ""unlawful detention"" of vulnerable people are regularly applied in a way which means they are not being afforded the necessary protection. The report speaks of an ""institutional culture"" which prioritises the use of detention ""as a means to enforce removal"", above respect, dignity and the protection of vulnerable people. Kingsley Newuh claimed asylum in the UK Kingsley Newuh, 39, is a political asylum seeker who has been detained at Morton Hall detention centre twice. Morton Hall is run by the Prison Service on behalf of UK Border Agency. Mr Newuh, who campaigns with Movement For Justice, says he came to England on a student visa, and due to the nature of his research - which criticised the government of Cameroon - he was told he would face imprisonment, should he return to the country. He says he found the detention process ""terrifying"" and started feeling ""anxious and depressed"" by the time he was released, three months later. He claimspeople died in the detention centrewhile he was there, saying: ""I felt like a lamb to the slaughter. No one told me how long I was going to be there for - that was the most tormenting aspect of it, the fact I didn't know."" ""It's a prison under a different name. It was unsanitary, very, very dirty and I was locked in my room from 8am to 8pm."" The Home Office denies detaining people indefinitely, arguing that the ""law does not allow it"". A spokesman said: ""Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention. ""We are looking closely at the issue of time limits to understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies."" The report doesn't use the phrase ""not fit for purpose"", but it might as well have done. That was how John Reid described the immigration department he inherited as home secretary in 2006, after 1,000 foreign prisoners were freed without being considered for deportation. The scandal sparked a tougher approach towards immigration enforcement, with more people rounded up for detention and removal. Now the concern is that detention is being used too often, and for too long, in a system which remains dysfunctional. But there are tentative signs, evident in the Home Office's response, that ministers are aware of the problems and may be prepared to act. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs committee, said the Home Office's approach to immigration was ""careless and cavalier"", arguing that reform was needed urgently to ensure the detention system was fair, sensible, transparent and humane. She said: ""Making the wrong decision on detention can have a devastating impact on people's lives - as we saw from the Windrush scandal, but also from many other cases we have seen. ""The lack of any time limit and of proper judicial safeguards has allowed the Home Office to drift and delay, leaving people stuck in detention for months who really shouldn't be there at all."" Removal centres are used in cases where people have no legal right to be in the UK but have refused to leave voluntarily. They may hold asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions and people whose claims have failed and are awaiting deportation. A minority of detainees are foreign national prisoners who have completed prison terms for serious crimes and are being held in detention while steps are taken to remove them from the UK. The Home Office has 10 immigration centres in England. The Windrush generation is the name used for an estimated 500,000 people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971 and were granted indefinite leave to remain. However, following changes to immigration law, many who arrived as children found themselves later unable to prove their status and some were subsequently held in detention or removed - despite having lived in the UK for decades. Olu Adekunle, 47, became a refugee in the UK last year - after four years and three judicial reviews - and spent time at three different detention centres. He had claimed asylum after escaping persecution from Nigeria because of his sexuality. Mr Adekunle said: ""I felt like a criminal. You don't know what's going to happen to you."" He said he believed the UK immigration system assumed claimants were lying and were ""guilty until you prove you're innocent"". He recalled a time when he was ""chained like a dog"" during a hospital visit, and says that although he is now a refugee, he still suffers from anxiety.

"The NHS in England has no chance of training enough GPs and nurses to solve the shortages it faces, experts say. A report by three leading think tanks predicts that in the next five years nurse shortages will double and GP gaps nearly treble, without radical action. The Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and King's Fund says a combination of international recruitment, student grants and innovation is needed. But the government is insisting plans are in place to recruit more staff. It is already well documented that the NHS is short of staff. Current figures suggest there more than 30,000 extra nurses are needed and almost 3,000 GPs. The think tanks say on current trends this will rise to nearly 70,000 nurses and more than 7,000 GPs within five years. And after a decade the gap could be 100,000 and more than 11,000 respectively. That will make it harder to access many services - despite the extra investment being made in the health service, they say. Report co-author Anita Charlesworth said: ""The workforce is the make-or-break issue for the health service. ""Unless staffing shortages are substantially reduced, the recent NHS Long Term Plan can only be a wish list."" The think tanks have come up with some solutions to solve the staffing problems. For nurses, they say studying in England must be made more attractive. Bursaries were removed and tuition fees introduced in 2016. The report warns this has had a negative effect and calls for the introduction of a Â£5,200 annual grant for student nurses. It also says students who have already completed a degree and then want to retrain to be a nurse should be exempt from university fees. But even these measures will not be enough. The report predicts the NHS will need to recruit 5,000 new nurses from abroad every year - three times the figure it is currently recruiting. And the think tanks say this will be a real challenge given Brexit and the global shortage of nurses. Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, said the numbers were ""staggering"" and should ""cause alarm"". For GPs, the report recommends a different approach, as international recruitment is extremely difficult given the language requirements for GPs and the unique nature of general practice in the NHS. It says other staff, such as physiotherapists and pharmacists, will need to see some of the patients GPs are currently treating. This could include patients with back pain and joint problems and those needing advice for minor conditions and requiring medicine reviews. The idea of using other staff to support GPs is already part of policy. The government and NHS England arelooking to recruit 20,000 staff to work alongside GPs. Training places for doctors and nurses are also being increased, by 25%. The Department of Health and Social Care believes this will give the NHS the staff it needs but acknowledges it will take time. And it says more detail will be revealed in the workforce plan being developed by the regulator NHS Improvement. Dido Harding, who chairs NHS Improvement, said an interim plan would be published soon. ""It is vital we do more to retain, recruit and develop them across both health and social care,"" she added. The think tanks did not study these staffing issues in the rest of the UK because no comparable data exists.

"Aaron Campbell, 16, was given a minimum jail term of 27 years The 16-year-old who raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has been sentenced to a minimum of 27 years behind bars after he finally admitted his crime. During his trial, Aaron Campbell had repeatedly denied he abducted, raped and killed the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute last July. But he admitted his offences to a psychologist preparing a report to the court ahead of his sentencing. Judge Lord Matthews imposed a life sentence for the ""brutal"" murder. He set the punishment part of the sentence, before Campbell can apply for parole, at 27 years. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Read the judge's sentencing statement in full,external Lord Matthews said Campbell's crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief"". He said Alesha had been violated and murdered and told Campbell he was a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The judge read out Campbell's ""cold blooded and horrific"" account of his actions that night and how he described seeing Alesha asleep in her room as ""a moment of opportunity"". Campbell's confession was contained in the criminal justice social report and the criminal psychologist's report, which were prepared ahead of his sentencing. The report by the forensic clinical psychologist Dr Gary Macpherson quoted Campbell as saying: ""At any other time in life murder would not have been the conclusion. ""If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence In his sentencing statement, the judge said the teenager had shown breathtaking arrogance during the trial and had failed to plead guilty despite overwhelming evidence against him. He said he had shown ""a staggering lack of remorse"". ""Not once did I detect a flicker of emotion from you,"" the judge said. Lord Matthews said it would be for others to decide if Campbell would ever be released, indeed, he said his reintegration into society might be ""impossible"". During his nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow last month, Campbell claimed he had never met his victim and lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. The judge said this was a ""cruel travesty of the truth"" and said the woman he blamed, Toni McLachlan, was ""completely innocent"". Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial The judge said he was ""shocked"" by the clear admissions of guilt in the background reports, especially after the ""tissue of lies"" Campbell had told in court. The psychologist said that on the night of Alesha's death Campbell had been drinking and wanted cannabis so he decided to go into her father's home to get some. Alesha's father had previously sold him the drug. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' In his sentencing statement, Lord Matthews said Campbell had carried Alesha to a secluded spot where he raped and murdered her ""in the most brutal fashion"". He told the teenager: ""You said that Alesha was drowsy and became a bit more awake when you went out. CCTV showed Campbell leaving his house with a torch the morning Alesha was found dead ""At one point she asked who you were and where you were going. ""You said you were a friend of her father and that you were taking her home."" Campbell gave Alesha his coat because she was cold. The judge said that over the next few days Campbell was unconcerned about what had happened, and was ""slightly amused"" that the police had not caught him. The court heard that the teenager had said he was ""quite satisfied by the murder"". Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane leaves court after the sentencing The judge said Campbell told Dr Macpherson that at points during the trial it took ""everything to stop laughing"" and he had to ""zip his mouth"". Lord Matthews said the reports concluded that Campbell was not suffering from a mental health disorder but showed a total lack of victim empathy. Alesha, from Airdrie in Lanarkshire, was just days into a holiday when she was abducted from her bed. She was reported missing from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, near Rothesay, at 06:23 on 2 July last year. Dozens of islanders joined the search for the child but at 08:54 her naked body was discovered in a wooded area in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydropathic Hotel. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. After the sentence was read out family members shouted ""evil"" and ""beast"" as Campbell was led down to the cells. Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Identity of Alesha's killer revealed.

"Language in the north east of Scotland will feature heavily in the study A major new linguistic survey of the Scots vocabulary is being launched, in a bid to help preserve the language. Researchers at the University of Aberdeen will lead what they describe as the first comprehensive appraisal of the language to be conducted since the 1950s. It will cover Scots as well as what is known as Ulster-Scots. The project - said to be a ""huge undertaking"" - is expected to take many years to complete. Allow Twitter content?

Robert Millar, a professor in Linguistics and Scottish Language at the University of Aberdeen, explained: ""In Scotland we have the Linguistic Atlas of Scotland and Dictionary of the Scots Language but both draw heavily on material collated in the 1950s. In Ireland no such equivalent exists for Ulster Scots. ""The Linguistic Survey of Scots in the 1950s was ground breaking but does it remain relevant today? This is a question we will be seeking to address. ""This will be the first real attempt to move towards a survey that will give us a sense of the language in the 2020s. ""We hope it will represent the same great leap forwards as the original survey did and can contribute greatly to our national dictionaries."" Prof Millar said: ""Language naturally changes over time and words are replaced and cannibalised. ""Much of what makes Scots so distinctive is entwined with occupations and pastimes that have changed beyond recognition since the surveys of the 1950s. ""Nonetheless Scots continues to play an important role in our cultural and everyday lives and informs both our identity and sense of place."" The project will get under way in the coming year. Prof Robert Millar says things have changed significantly in 60 years Prof Millar added: ""The previous survey was quite patchy and relied on volunteers so the quality of the information recorded varies significantly. ""We will use the north east of Scotland, which has one of the best preserved native speech varieties, as a test bed but want to collate information from across Scotland and the areas of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland where Ulster Scots is spoken. ""Our approach will be much more scientific and we want to make our findings freely available on the internet once it is complete.""

"Ray Kelvin has often hidden his face in photographs Troubled fashion chain Ted Baker has said it is ""determined to learn lessons"" from the ""forced hugs"" scandal that forced out its boss Ray Kelvin. The pledge came in its annual results statement, less than three weeks after Mr Kelvin resigned in the wake of the misconduct allegations. Pre-tax profit for the year to 26 January was down 26% to Â£50.9m, from Â£68.8m a year earlier. The figures were in line with a profit warning issued last month. The firm is continuing an investigation into the allegations against Mr Kelvin. Its shares fell more than 5% in early Thursday trading. In its results statement,external, Ted Baker said it wanted all employees to feel ""respected and valued"" and would ensure that ""appropriate changes"" were made. The scandal over Mr Kelvin, who founded the chain and was its chief executive, broke in December, when employees launched anonline petition accusing him of inappropriatecomments and behaviour. The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence after at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him or let him massage their ears. At the time, Mr Kelvin took a voluntary leave of absence. He stepped down on 4 March. The firm said its investigation was continuing and would now focus on Ted Baker's ""policies, procedures and handling of HR-related complaints"".

"Anya can sometimes lose developmental skills and have to re-learn them all over again An Edinburgh mother has described  her 18-month-old daughter as a ""human timebomb"" after being diagnosed with a one-in-a-million condition. Anya Behl is one of only two Scots with the rare illness, with only 500 cases in the world. Doctors describe it as being like having seven diseases all at once. Katherine Behl said she wakes every morning not knowing if it  will be a normal day or one where her child has a life-threatening episode. Anya was born in July 2017. When she was just 10 weeks old, she had her first experience of Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC). The condition causes ""episodes"" similar to epileptic seizures, but also has symptoms similar to stroke, paralysis and Parkinson's disease. The episodes can happen at any time. Katherine Behl thought 10-week-old Anya was going to die during her terrifying first episode Mrs Behl, a doctor, toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat the first one was terrifying: ""At ten weeks old life just stopped. ""She was in bed with us - she was loving tummy time in the mornings. Suddenly she did this terrible, really heart-wrenching scream. ""We turned her over and my husband said her eyes were twitching. I had a quick look at them and it was obvious something really bad was happening. ""Her eyes were just flickering to the side and rolling and she was looking really vacant. She started getting really rigid in her spine. I thought she was having a seizure. ""It lasted about three minutes. We were getting ready to go to hospital. Then it happened again in the house. ""On the way on the car it started again. She did a scream and I thought she was having a stroke. ""I thought she was going to die."" Abhishek and Katherine have decided to make the most of each day while they try to help fund research into treatments AHC is caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Sufferers experience repeated, though short-lasting, attacks of hemiplegia - paralysis of a portion of the body. This ranges from numbness to full loss of feeling and movement. Attacks or episodes may last for minutes, hours, or even days. Sleep can relieve the symptoms. If the autonomic nervous system - which controls body functions such as breathing or the heartbeat - fails, AHC can cause sudden death. Many more episodes and many tests followed at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children and in February 2018 Katherine and her husband Abhishek learned from genetics results that Anya had the one-in-a-million condition. Mrs Behl explained: ""It involves lots of neurological symptoms and some experts describe it as many conditions in one. It is not inherited it is just by chance. ""Along with neurological symptoms which can be tremors, weakness, paralysis, eye movements, speech problems, painful rigidity, it causes other non-neurological problems - breathing, heart and developmental problems."" Mr Behl says it is sometimes a case of one step forward, two steps back. After each episode, some skills can be lost. Things she has learnt can be lost because of her condition. Mrs Behl said: ""Last May, she lost her head control, went floppy like a new born. She had to re-learn that all over again."" After spending months just waiting for the next episode to happen, the family decided they had to move on. Mrs Behl said: ""You can't live like that waiting for each episode to come so we just try to enjoy each day as it comes and we live in hope each day will go well. Because the condition is so rare, there is little research and treatment. The only drug she takes has so far been unable to stop the episodes. The family are now fundraising to help pay for pre-clinical trials into the condition with the support of several AHC foundations in the US. They hope this could mean a brighter future for their one-in-a-million girl.

"Anya can sometimes lose developmental skills and have to re-learn them all over again An Edinburgh mother has described  her 18-month-old daughter as a ""human timebomb"" after being diagnosed with a one-in-a-million condition. Anya Behl is one of only two Scots with the rare illness, with only 500 cases in the world. Doctors describe it as being like having seven diseases all at once. Katherine Behl said she wakes every morning not knowing if it  will be a normal day or one where her child has a life-threatening episode. Anya was born in July 2017. When she was just 10 weeks old, she had her first experience of Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC). The condition causes ""episodes"" similar to epileptic seizures, but also has symptoms similar to stroke, paralysis and Parkinson's disease. The episodes can happen at any time. Katherine Behl thought 10-week-old Anya was going to die during her terrifying first episode Mrs Behl, a doctor, toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat the first one was terrifying: ""At ten weeks old life just stopped. ""She was in bed with us - she was loving tummy time in the mornings. Suddenly she did this terrible, really heart-wrenching scream. ""We turned her over and my husband said her eyes were twitching. I had a quick look at them and it was obvious something really bad was happening. ""Her eyes were just flickering to the side and rolling and she was looking really vacant. She started getting really rigid in her spine. I thought she was having a seizure. ""It lasted about three minutes. We were getting ready to go to hospital. Then it happened again in the house. ""On the way on the car it started again. She did a scream and I thought she was having a stroke. ""I thought she was going to die."" Abhishek and Katherine have decided to make the most of each day while they try to help fund research into treatments AHC is caused by mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. Sufferers experience repeated, though short-lasting, attacks of hemiplegia - paralysis of a portion of the body. This ranges from numbness to full loss of feeling and movement. Attacks or episodes may last for minutes, hours, or even days. Sleep can relieve the symptoms. If the autonomic nervous system - which controls body functions such as breathing or the heartbeat - fails, AHC can cause sudden death. Many more episodes and many tests followed at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children and in February 2018 Katherine and her husband Abhishek learned from genetics results that Anya had the one-in-a-million condition. Mrs Behl explained: ""It involves lots of neurological symptoms and some experts describe it as many conditions in one. It is not inherited it is just by chance. ""Along with neurological symptoms which can be tremors, weakness, paralysis, eye movements, speech problems, painful rigidity, it causes other non-neurological problems - breathing, heart and developmental problems."" Mr Behl says it is sometimes a case of one step forward, two steps back. After each episode, some skills can be lost. Things she has learnt can be lost because of her condition. Mrs Behl said: ""Last May, she lost her head control, went floppy like a new born. She had to re-learn that all over again."" After spending months just waiting for the next episode to happen, the family decided they had to move on. Mrs Behl said: ""You can't live like that waiting for each episode to come so we just try to enjoy each day as it comes and we live in hope each day will go well. Because the condition is so rare, there is little research and treatment. The only drug she takes has so far been unable to stop the episodes. The family are now fundraising to help pay for pre-clinical trials into the condition with the support of several AHC foundations in the US. They hope this could mean a brighter future for their one-in-a-million girl.

"This video can not be played Police bodycam footage shows Minnie Moloney getting hysterical upon being arrested The way a pregnant Irish Traveller was arrested was shameful and inappropriate, a race charity has said. Minnie Moloney, 25, who has severe mental health issues, was visited by several male police officers on 7 December 2017 after a row at a shop six weeks earlier. During the arrest, Ms Moloney became hysterical and was handcuffed wearing nothing but an untied dressing gown. South Wales Police said its actions were ""proportionate and necessary"". In bodycam footage from one of the officers, she can be seen coming down the stairs wearing just her dressing gown. After realising there was no woman officer, Ms Moloney became hysterical and tried to contact her mother as officers told her to calm down. She is eventually handcuffed with her arms around her back and led out to the police van despite her protestations that her modesty was being compromised by her dressing gown becoming undone. Race Equality First said the arrest should have been handled differently due to Ms Moloney's mental health issues and her cultural background which means her husband is the only man who should touch her. The charity said: A mental health professional should have been called to assess Ms Moloney as police knew she had mental health issues A female police officer should have been present She should have been allowed to get dressed before going to the police station Police should have asked her to attend the station voluntarily as she had done previously Ms Moloney's husband told police his wife was pregnant and not to handcuff her, but police say they will do because of how she is behaving The force said an investigation found no evidence Ms Moloney was mistreated during her arrest for a public order offence. She was later released without charge. Police were not called to the original row at the shop, but went to Ms Moloney's home in Rumney several weeks later to arrest her. Ms Moloney has mental health issues including psychosis, psychotic mood disorder and anxiety disorder. She said the experience was ""humiliating"" and made her feel ""helpless, stressed and worried"". ""When they took me out of the house, I was naked, I was stressed, I didn't have my medication, I didn't wake up properly, I knew they'd just leave me in the cell,"" she said. South Wales Police and the Independent Office of Police Conduct investigated and found no case to answer, with no evidence Ms Moloney was mistreated. Aliya Mohammed said the bodycam footage looked like ""a bit of fun and laughs and a bit of games basically at the expense of a vulnerable young woman"" But Aliya Mohammed, chief executive of Race Equality First, disagreed and said it was racial discrimination. ""I've never seen [a case] that has been caught on body-cam footage that shows such shocking scenes of blatant inappropriate, shameful behaviour. ""Why haven't we had a case like this for a non-ethnic minority person? For someone who is not a Gypsy or Traveller?"" In an investigation by the Professional Standards Department, the officer who arrested Minnie said he feared the situation would quickly escalate. His statement said: ""I took hold of Minnie's arm and she immediately became extremely irate and aggressive to a level that I have rarely seen in my 10.5 years of front line policing."" But Ms Mohammed disagrees: ""There are points where she holds up her hands, there are points when she is protesting, she does swear a lot throughout the video, however, she doesn't lash out at them, she doesn't hit them, she doesn't obstruct them either, she is just protesting at the way she's being treated. ""She wasn't being overly aggressive - certainly not for a woman who was half naked - with an open dressing gown and not even being allowed to cover herself up. I think it's extremely shocking."" Minnie Moloney's case is being handled by Race Equality First Ms Mohammed has now called for a new investigation. ""In the video footage, you can see that police officers are staring at her naked body, they are laughing and they are making inappropriate comments. ""Why were they doing that? Why did the police feel that it was appropriate and that they were able to actually make such inappropriate comments?"" South Wales Police said the incident highlighted the ""incredibly difficult job"" officers do on a daily basis. ""Once a complaint was received it was immediately referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct which directed a local investigation by the force's professional standards department,"" it said. ""An investigation found that none of the officers had a case to answer and the complainant was sent a report containing the findings of the investigation."" The force said it had met Race Equality First, no new complaints were presented and they rejected a civil claim. But Ms Moloney said: ""If two people from Cyncoed (an affluent Cardiff suburb) had an argument, would they have arrested a woman from Cyncoed in that manner? ""It's no different because I'm an Irish Traveller. I'm still the same as everybody else. I still bleed the same. I still feel the same. We're all human.""

"Lorraine Kelly has won a row over a Â£1.2m tax bill, after a judge ruled she was not employed by ITV, but performs as her ""chatty"" TV persona. Kelly, 59, who presents the show Lorraine on weekday mornings, received the national insurance and income tax bill from the tax office in 2016. HMRC claimed the Scottish broadcaster was an ITV employee, but she said she was a freelancer. The judge ruled in Kelly's favour that she was a ""self-employed star"". Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake The case centres on a contract that Kelly signed in 2012 - through a company she runs with her husband - to present Lorraine, as well as her former show Daybreak which ended in 2014 when Good Morning Britain was relaunched. Four years later, she was sent a bill of nearly Â£900,000 in income tax and more than Â£300,000 in national insurance contributions. Kelly appealed against tax authority HMRC, and the case was heard by the first-tier tax tribunal. Judge Jennifer Dean ruled that the relationship that Kelly had with ITV ""was a contract for services and not that of employer and employee"". The tribunal found that Kelly did not receive staff benefits such as holiday or sick pay and was allowed to carry out other work. The judge said that Kelly could be classed as a ""theatrical artist"", which would mean any payments to an agent would be allowed as a tax-deductible expense. Judge Dean said: ""We did not accept that Ms Kelly simply appeared as herself - we were satisfied that Ms Kelly presents a persona of herself, she presents herself as a brand and that is the brand ITV sought when engaging her. ""All parts of the show are a performance, the act being to perform the role of a friendly, chatty and fun personality. ""Quite simply put, the programmes are entertaining, Ms Kelly is entertaining and the 'DNA' referred to is the personality, performance, the 'Lorraine Kelly' brand that is brought to the programmes."" She added: ""We should make clear we do not doubt that Ms Kelly is an entertaining lady but the point is that for the time Ms Kelly is contracted to perform live on air she is public 'Lorraine Kelly'. ""She may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed but that is where the performance lies."" Kelly - who this year marked her 35th anniversary working in television - has been described as the queen of the breakfast TV sofa. The Glasgow-born broadcaster began her career at a local newspaper before joining BBC Scotland. In 1984 she landed her dream job as the roving Scotland correspondent for ITV's breakfast television franchise TV-am. This video can not be played Lorraine Kelly: I'm training to go into space! She went on to host GMTV and Daybreak, before her current slot on eponymous show Lorraine.

She has been involved with many charities and took part in the 100km (62 miles) BT Red Nose Desert Trek in Kenya, which raised money for Comic Relief projects. A spokesman for HMRC said it was ""disappointed"" with the ruling. ""We will carefully consider the outcome of the tribunal before deciding whether to appeal,"" he said.

"Five minutes before closing time, Lilly was restocking milk when two masked men entered the shop where she worked, one with a Taser and one with a gun. They demanded money from the till, then panicked and tasered both Lilly and her colleague Mary. Lilly and Mary are just two of the 115 shop staff physically attacked at work every day, industry figures suggest. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said incidents were becoming ""more violent and frightening"". Knife crime was an issue of ""significant"" concern, the BRC added. The attack suffered by Lilly and Mary - whose names have been changed - is outlined in the BRC's latest report on retail crime. The BRC said it recorded just over 42,000 violent incidents for the year to the 31 March 2018, an average of 115 every day. The respondents to its survey control 11,000 stores with sales of Â£103bn, equating to just under one-third of the retail market. Better protection call for shop workers Shoplifting at supermarkets on the rise 'Make drivers pay for fuel in advance' The total number of incidents of violence and abuse, including threatening behaviour not involving violence, rose from 350 incidents a day in the previous year to 390. Recounting her experience, Lilly said: ""There were four customers in store, and some of them shouted. The men robbers looked panicked, and thank God they ran away. ""They took Â£150 from the till with them. Â£150 - was it really worth it for them?"" In its report, the BRC said it would be wrong to assume that weapons were only used in the ""higher-end incidents, or for very significant amounts"". Lilly said she was ""shaken and upset"" after her ordeal. ""The next time I stood on the till, thoughts of what I could have done, what I should have done, ran through my head. ""I was suspicious of every man who came to the till that day, wondering could it have been them? ""But you have to get over these feelings and get on with the job, you can't think like that."" Chief executive Helen Dickinson said violence against staff remained one of the most ""pressing issues"" facing retailers. ""Yet once again, we have seen an increase in the overall number of incidents. No one should go to work fearing threats and abuse."" The BRC said the most worrying triggers for violence were: intentional use of violence to assist with theft as a response to age-related sales challenges and by criminals high on drugs or alcohol Respondents said knives were the ""most significant"" threat, followed by syringes and ""hitting implements"". ""Guns were also concerningly high,"" the BRC added. About 70% said the police response to retail crime was ""poor or very poor"". Ms Dickinson said : ""We hope this report will act as a catalyst for Police and Crime Commissioners around the country to take action. ""Retail crime should be explicitly addressed by Police and Crime Plans. Furthermore, Parliament must play its part in stemming this tide of crime by creating a specific criminal offence to protect retail employees from assault at work, as has been done for emergency workers."" The BRC's Retail Crime Survey also found that retailers lost Â£900m to all forms of crime over the course of the year and that crime prevention cost Â£1bn. The combined total of Â£1.9bn is equivalent to about 20% of the estimated profits of the entire retail industry, it said. The cost of customer theft rose by 31% compared with the previous year, to Â£700m. Are you a retail worker who has encountered violent or threatening behaviour?

"Ray Kelvin has often hidden his face in photographs Troubled fashion chain Ted Baker has said it is ""determined to learn lessons"" from the ""forced hugs"" scandal that forced out its boss Ray Kelvin. The pledge came in its annual results statement, less than three weeks after Mr Kelvin resigned in the wake of the misconduct allegations. Pre-tax profit for the year to 26 January was down 26% to Â£50.9m, from Â£68.8m a year earlier. The figures were in line with a profit warning issued last month. The firm is continuing an investigation into the allegations against Mr Kelvin. Its shares fell more than 5% in early Thursday trading. In its results statement,external, Ted Baker said it wanted all employees to feel ""respected and valued"" and would ensure that ""appropriate changes"" were made. The scandal over Mr Kelvin, who founded the chain and was its chief executive, broke in December, when employees launched anonline petition accusing him of inappropriatecomments and behaviour. The petition, on the workplace website Organise, said that more than 200 Ted Baker staff were finally breaking their silence after at least ""50 recorded incidents of harassment"" at the fashion group. Staff claimed that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder had asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him or let him massage their ears. At the time, Mr Kelvin took a voluntary leave of absence. He stepped down on 4 March. The firm said its investigation was continuing and would now focus on Ted Baker's ""policies, procedures and handling of HR-related complaints"". Acting chief executive Lindsay Page said that ""despite difficult trading conditions"", the firm's sales performance over the year had been ""resilient"". The results showed a marked divergence between the fortunes of its online and High Street operations, reflecting current consumer trends. E-commerce sales rose 20.4% to Â£121.7m, but overall retail sales were just 4.2% higher at Â£461m. At the same time, retail sales per sq ft of High Street store space decreased by 5.5% to Â£786. ""Performance was impacted by competitive discounting across the retail sector, consumer uncertainty, the well-publicised challenges facing some of our UK trading partners and the unseasonable weather across our global markets at different points throughout the year,"" the retailer said. ""Despite this, growth was driven by continued investment across the retail channel in new and existing stores and our e-commerce platform."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""These are turbulent times for Ted. The top line is still heading in the right direction, but only on account of the continued addition of new sales space and the strong contribution from online sales. ""However, Ted had already braced investors to expect a drop in profits this year, and sentiment was already frayed on the back of the ongoing investigation into the former CEO's conduct. ""We think the share price movement is more to do with Ted's notably downbeat outlook - which will be a surprise to many after the positive trading statement in January.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June"" Theresa May has told the public she is ""on their side"", laying the blame for the delay to Brexit squarely with MPs. Speaking from Downing Street, the prime minister said people were ""tired of infighting and political games"" and it was ""high time"" politicians made a decision on the next steps. Earlier, Mrs May wrote to EU Council President Donald Tusk requesting to delay Brexit until 30 June. Jeremy Corbyn said she was ""in complete denial about the scale of the crisis"". Mrs May was forced to ask for a postponement after MPs twice rejected the withdrawal deal she has negotiated and also voted to reject a no-deal departure. She said the delay was a ""matter of great personal regret"", but insisted she would not be willing to extend Brexit any further than 30 June - despite appeals from some MPs for a longer extension to give time for a change in direction. A risky pitch of Parliament versus Public EU backs Brexit delay but only with deal Your really simple guide to Brexit The UK is set to leave the EU next Friday, on 29 March, unless the law is changed. All other 27 EU members would have to agree any extension beyond that date. Mr Tusk said he believed the EU would agree to a short extension, but only if Mrs May's deal is signed off by MPs next week at a third time of asking. In her statement, Mrs May said: ""Of this I am absolutely sure. You, the public, have had enough. ""You are tired of the infighting, tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing else but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children's schools, our National Health Service, knife crime. ""You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side."" The PM said it was ""now time for MPs to decide"" whether they wanted to leave with her deal, no deal or whether they chose not to leave at all - the latter, she warned, could cause ""irreparable damage to public trust"" in politicians. ""So far Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice,"" said Mrs May. ""All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want."" She made a final appeal to MPs to back her deal and told the public: ""You just want us to get on with it and that is what I am determined to do."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It's not me - it's them. Theresa May has pitched herself tonight against Parliament and on the side of the people. It's true that No 10 believes strongly that swathes of the population have simply had enough of Brexit. The way it drowns out other public concerns, the way its processes, contradictions and clamour have wrapped their way around the normal workings of Westminster - remote at the best of times and downright bizarre at the worst. But, when it is MPs the prime minister needs to get on side if she is to have a real chance of finally getting her deal through next week - third time extremely lucky - the choice of message was not without risk. Read Laura's blog in full Mrs May will travel to Brussels for a summit of EU leaders on Thursday, where she is expected to discuss the extension with other member states. In her letter to Mr Tusk, the prime minister said she had wanted to hold another Commons vote on her withdrawal agreement this week but had been prevented from doing so by Speaker John Bercow. On Monday, he ruled that bringing it back a third time in its current form would break longstanding conventions designed to prevent MPs from being repeatedly asked the same question. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the mood in Brussels is very sombre as there is a feeling that a no-deal Brexit is now a very real possibility. A lot is riding on Theresa May's address to the summit on Thursday, our correspondent adds, but the PM's past performances have not gone down well. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mr Corbyn criticised Mrs May after the speech, saying she was ""unable to offer the leadership the country needs"". The Labour leader added: ""To continue to bring back her damaging and twice rejected deal without significant changes, while threatening a no deal outcome ruled out by MPs, is unacceptable and reckless."" This video can not be played PM: 'Not prepared' to delay Brexit beyond 30 June A string of other MPs also reacted angrily to Mrs May's comments. Conservative Remain-backer Dominic Grieve said her ""attack on the integrity of MPs is very unfortunate"". Speaking to BBC News, the former Attorney General said he would not be ""bullied by anyone in government into supporting something that I think will do our country a great deal of harm"".

But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said both the prime minister and the country feel ""frustration"" at not getting her deal through Parliament. He told BBC Newsnight: ""She has been straight with the public, saying we need to not play games, not see the different subterfuges that we have experienced over last number of weeks, to actually crystallise this, to write this down, and make it real. ""The fact is that we have a duty and a responsibility to give effect to that referendum and actually frame the choices and the consequences as well."" The prime minister met opposition parties to discuss her proposal for a delay on Wednesday evening ahead of her statement, but sources told the BBC that Mr Corbyn walked out and other leaders remained unimpressed with what they heard.

The Labour leader will also travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. He is expected to hold talks with several EU 27 leaders too. Earlier on Wednesday, Mrs May met a group of about 20 MPs from her own party who voted against her deal in the first meaningful vote, but backed her in the second. One of them, Eurosceptic Nigel Evans, said she was told ""her neck was on the block"". He said MPs told her if her deal went through, she should not be part of the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, adding: ""The buck stops with the prime minister."" Meanwhile, an emergency debate took place in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, with Labour pressing for further detail about the PM's intentions and demanding that any delay is long enough to allow MPs to ""break the impasse and find a way forward"".

On her own side, some MPs have openly questioned the merit of her evening at the podium - toxic and delusional are some of the descriptions given. Yet Theresa May's allies say, at this vital moment, she felt it imperative to express that she has a line - staying in the EU three years after the referendum - that she is not, as prime minister, willing to cross. For those Brexiteers who want her gone, that is not, it's understood, a promise that she would quit in return for support for her deal. But No 10 must know too that choice, her fate, is not just in her hands, but in Parliament's and, as she prepares to travel to Brussels, in the grasp of the European Union.

"Staff at Brook House detention centre were filmed physically and verbally abusing detainees. The Home Office has ""utterly failed"" to ensure the safety of people held in UK immigration detention centres, a damning report says. MPs on the home affairs committee warn there are ""serious problems"" in almost every part of the detention system. They want to see an end to indefinite detention and much more done to protect vulnerable detainees, for example those who have been tortured. The Home Office says it is moving ""further and faster"" with reforms. The committee began examining the issue after a reporter fromBBC Panorama filmed staff at the Brook House detention centrephysically and verbally abusing detainees. Since the Panorama programme was broadcast in September 2017, 15 of the 21 staff allegedly involved in the incidents have either left G4S, resigned or been sacked. The committee says the uncovered abuse was ""not the first of its kind"", and urges the government to ensure immigration removal centres have safe and humane management, high quality healthcare and effective whistle-blowing procedures. Detainees 'treated like criminals' 'Serious flaws' in immigration decisions Detainees win bid for abuse inquiry It accuses the Home Office of having a ""shockingly cavalier attitude"" towards detention. The report calls for a 28-day limit on detentions, saying it is ""unacceptable"" that due to bureaucratic inefficiencies some people are detained for more than three years. It says policies that should prevent ""unlawful detention"" of vulnerable people are regularly applied in a way which means they are not being afforded the necessary protection. The report speaks of an ""institutional culture"" which prioritises the use of detention ""as a means to enforce removal"", above respect, dignity and the protection of vulnerable people. Kingsley Newuh claimed asylum in the UK Kingsley Newuh, 39, is a political asylum seeker who has been detained at Morton Hall detention centre twice. Morton Hall is run by the Prison Service on behalf of UK Border Agency. Mr Newuh, who campaigns with Movement For Justice, says he came to England on a student visa, and due to the nature of his research - which criticised the government of Cameroon - he was told he would face imprisonment, should he return to the country. He says he found the detention process ""terrifying"" and started feeling ""anxious and depressed"" by the time he was released, three months later. He claimspeople died in the detention centrewhile he was there, saying: ""I felt like a lamb to the slaughter. No one told me how long I was going to be there for - that was the most tormenting aspect of it, the fact I didn't know."" ""It's a prison under a different name. It was unsanitary, very, very dirty and I was locked in my room from 8am to 8pm."" The Home Office denies detaining people indefinitely, arguing that the ""law does not allow it"". A spokesman said: ""Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention. ""We are looking closely at the issue of time limits to understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies."" The report doesn't use the phrase ""not fit for purpose"", but it might as well have done. That was how John Reid described the immigration department he inherited as home secretary in 2006, after 1,000 foreign prisoners were freed without being considered for deportation. The scandal sparked a tougher approach towards immigration enforcement, with more people rounded up for detention and removal. Now the concern is that detention is being used too often, and for too long, in a system which remains dysfunctional. But there are tentative signs, evident in the Home Office's response, that ministers are aware of the problems and may be prepared to act. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs committee, said the Home Office's approach to immigration was ""careless and cavalier"", arguing that reform was needed urgently to ensure the detention system was fair, sensible, transparent and humane. She said: ""Making the wrong decision on detention can have a devastating impact on people's lives - as we saw from the Windrush scandal, but also from many other cases we have seen. ""The lack of any time limit and of proper judicial safeguards has allowed the Home Office to drift and delay, leaving people stuck in detention for months who really shouldn't be there at all."" Removal centres are used in cases where people have no legal right to be in the UK but have refused to leave voluntarily. They may hold asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions and people whose claims have failed and are awaiting deportation. A minority of detainees are foreign national prisoners who have completed prison terms for serious crimes and are being held in detention while steps are taken to remove them from the UK. The Home Office has 10 immigration centres in England. The Windrush generation is the name used for an estimated 500,000 people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971 and were granted indefinite leave to remain. However, following changes to immigration law, many who arrived as children found themselves later unable to prove their status and some were subsequently held in detention or removed - despite having lived in the UK for decades. Olu Adekunle, 47, became a refugee in the UK last year - after four years and three judicial reviews - and spent time at three different detention centres. He had claimed asylum after escaping persecution from Nigeria because of his sexuality. Mr Adekunle said: ""I felt like a criminal. You don't know what's going to happen to you."" He said he believed the UK immigration system assumed claimants were lying and were ""guilty until you prove you're innocent"". He recalled a time when he was ""chained like a dog"" during a hospital visit, and says that although he is now a refugee, he still suffers from anxiety. The Home Office says it is looking closely at the issue of time limits to ""understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies"".

In his statement issued earlier in response the drugs arrest, Mr McElhatton said: ""While I wished to respect the ongoing investigation by the police into the tragic deaths of the three young people at the Greenvale Hotel on St Patrick's night, I have no choice but to make it completely clear that I have nothing whatsoever to do with drugs. ""I can assure everyone that whatever any suspicions the police have raised about me in relation to anything to do with drugs is totally without any basis. ""I am shocked and horrified that the powdery substance taken by police from the laundry in my house could be drugs.

In line with normal procedure, the suspect was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. This arrest was communicated to the media in line with procedure. ""Given the gravity of the investigation the examination of the bag was carried out urgently.

""The actions taken were in good faith and in line with procedure. We will continue to carry out a rigorous investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of these three young people and we are deeply grateful for the huge assistance we are receiving from the community and we hope that people will continue to come forward and assist us with this enquiry.""

"Lorraine Kelly has won a row over a Â£1.2m tax bill, after a judge ruled she was not employed by ITV, but performs as her ""chatty"" TV persona. Kelly, 59, who presents the show Lorraine on weekday mornings, received the national insurance and income tax bill from the tax office in 2016. HMRC claimed the Scottish broadcaster was an ITV employee, but she said she was a freelancer. The judge ruled in Kelly's favour that she was a ""self-employed star"". Don't worry, Lorraine Kelly isn't being fake The case centres on a contract that Kelly signed in 2012 - through a company she runs with her husband - to present Lorraine, as well as her former show Daybreak which ended in 2014 when Good Morning Britain was relaunched. Four years later, she was sent a bill of nearly Â£900,000 in income tax and more than Â£300,000 in national insurance contributions. Kelly appealed against tax authority HMRC, and the case was heard by the first-tier tax tribunal. Judge Jennifer Dean ruled that the relationship that Kelly had with ITV ""was a contract for services and not that of employer and employee"". The tribunal found that Kelly did not receive staff benefits such as holiday or sick pay and was allowed to carry out other work. The judge said that Kelly could be classed as a ""theatrical artist"", which would mean any payments to an agent would be allowed as a tax-deductible expense. Judge Dean said: ""We did not accept that Ms Kelly simply appeared as herself - we were satisfied that Ms Kelly presents a persona of herself, she presents herself as a brand and that is the brand ITV sought when engaging her. ""All parts of the show are a performance, the act being to perform the role of a friendly, chatty and fun personality. ""Quite simply put, the programmes are entertaining, Ms Kelly is entertaining and the 'DNA' referred to is the personality, performance, the 'Lorraine Kelly' brand that is brought to the programmes."" She added: ""We should make clear we do not doubt that Ms Kelly is an entertaining lady but the point is that for the time Ms Kelly is contracted to perform live on air she is public 'Lorraine Kelly'. ""She may not like the guest she interviews, she may not like the food she eats, she may not like the film she viewed but that is where the performance lies."" Kelly - who this year marked her 35th anniversary working in television - has been described as the queen of the breakfast TV sofa. The Glasgow-born broadcaster began her career at a local newspaper before joining BBC Scotland.

"Rachel Johnston's mother Diana has started a legal battle for negligence The mother of a disabled woman who died after all her teeth were removed says she did not consent to the operation. Rachel Johnston's family has started a legal claim for negligence, saying medics failed to discuss risks of the treatment she had for tooth decay. Ms Johnston, 49, who collapsed shortly after being discharged from hospital, was readmitted and died weeks later. Health chiefs in Worcestershire said serious incident investigations had been carried out. Ms Johnston, who suffered brain damage after contracting meningitis as a baby, had the operation at Kidderminster Hospital in October and was discharged hours later. She was later rushed to hospital suffering from bleeding and breathing difficulties and put on a life-support machine. Her family was eventually told there was nothing more doctors could do for her and she died on 13 November. Rachel Johnston collapsed shortly after being discharged from hospital Lawyers acting for Ms Johnston's family claim a series of errors led to her death. They said the law around consent stated that doctors should discuss all risks and state why alternatives are not appropriate. The family claim that because Ms Johnston lacked the capacity to make a decision, her mother Diana Johnston's concerns should have been taken into consideration by medical staff. 'They took her teeth without telling me' Woman died after all teeth removed 'We had to pull out our own teeth' Mrs Johnston, who lives in Evesham, Worcestershire, said she wanted ""to get justice for my baby"". ""I don't feel that I was properly consulted, or that Rachel's treatment was discussed properly,"" she added. ""Things should have happened very differently. I wanted them to take a few teeth out at a time, maybe two at a time and give her a chance to recover. ""I wanted to make sure that she was safe. Her life was in my hands."" Ms Johnston underwent the operation at Kidderminster Hospital in October Ms Johnston's suffered cerebral hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia after having her teeth out, a post-mortem test found. Her family are also claiming she should not have been treated as a day patient. Caron Heyes, from legal firm Fieldfisher which is representing the family, said Mrs Johnston was not told how many of her daughter's teeth were removed. ""She [Mrs Johnston] found out after a learning disabilities mortality review investigation was launched,"" she said. ""Prior to surgery, Diana clearly stated that she did not think complete extraction was the right option for her daughter."" Rachel Johnston celebrated her 40th birthday with family and friends In a statement, the three health organisations dealing with the case - Worcestershire Health and Care Trust, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust and Wyre Forest Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) - said: ""We would like to express our condolences with Ms Johnston's family for their loss. ""Both trusts have completed internal serious incident reports, which is usual in a case like this, and are also participating in the wider review led by the CCG looking at the care provided by all of the agencies involved."" It said the reports would be shared with Ms Johnston's family. A three-day inquest is set to take place in August at Stourport Coroner's Court.

"Staff at Brook House detention centre were filmed physically and verbally abusing detainees. The Home Office has ""utterly failed"" to ensure the safety of people held in UK immigration detention centres, a damning report says. MPs on the home affairs committee warn there are ""serious problems"" in almost every part of the detention system. They want to see an end to indefinite detention and much more done to protect vulnerable detainees, for example those who have been tortured. The Home Office says it is moving ""further and faster"" with reforms. The committee began examining the issue after a reporter fromBBC Panorama filmed staff at the Brook House detention centrephysically and verbally abusing detainees. Since the Panorama programme was broadcast in September 2017, 15 of the 21 staff allegedly involved in the incidents have either left G4S, resigned or been sacked. The committee says the uncovered abuse was ""not the first of its kind"", and urges the government to ensure immigration removal centres have safe and humane management, high quality healthcare and effective whistle-blowing procedures. Detainees 'treated like criminals' 'Serious flaws' in immigration decisions Detainees win bid for abuse inquiry It accuses the Home Office of having a ""shockingly cavalier attitude"" towards detention. The report calls for a 28-day limit on detentions, saying it is ""unacceptable"" that due to bureaucratic inefficiencies some people are detained for more than three years. It says policies that should prevent ""unlawful detention"" of vulnerable people are regularly applied in a way which means they are not being afforded the necessary protection. The report speaks of an ""institutional culture"" which prioritises the use of detention ""as a means to enforce removal"", above respect, dignity and the protection of vulnerable people. Kingsley Newuh claimed asylum in the UK Kingsley Newuh, 39, is a political asylum seeker who has been detained at Morton Hall detention centre twice. Morton Hall is run by the Prison Service on behalf of UK Border Agency. Mr Newuh, who campaigns with Movement For Justice, says he came to England on a student visa, and due to the nature of his research - which criticised the government of Cameroon - he was told he would face imprisonment, should he return to the country. He says he found the detention process ""terrifying"" and started feeling ""anxious and depressed"" by the time he was released, three months later. He claimspeople died in the detention centrewhile he was there, saying: ""I felt like a lamb to the slaughter. No one told me how long I was going to be there for - that was the most tormenting aspect of it, the fact I didn't know."" ""It's a prison under a different name. It was unsanitary, very, very dirty and I was locked in my room from 8am to 8pm."" The Home Office denies detaining people indefinitely, arguing that the ""law does not allow it"". A spokesman said: ""Most people detained under immigration powers spend only short periods in detention. ""We are looking closely at the issue of time limits to understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies."" The report doesn't use the phrase ""not fit for purpose"", but it might as well have done. That was how John Reid described the immigration department he inherited as home secretary in 2006, after 1,000 foreign prisoners were freed without being considered for deportation. The scandal sparked a tougher approach towards immigration enforcement, with more people rounded up for detention and removal. Now the concern is that detention is being used too often, and for too long, in a system which remains dysfunctional. But there are tentative signs, evident in the Home Office's response, that ministers are aware of the problems and may be prepared to act. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs committee, said the Home Office's approach to immigration was ""careless and cavalier"", arguing that reform was needed urgently to ensure the detention system was fair, sensible, transparent and humane. She said: ""Making the wrong decision on detention can have a devastating impact on people's lives - as we saw from the Windrush scandal, but also from many other cases we have seen. ""The lack of any time limit and of proper judicial safeguards has allowed the Home Office to drift and delay, leaving people stuck in detention for months who really shouldn't be there at all."" Removal centres are used in cases where people have no legal right to be in the UK but have refused to leave voluntarily. They may hold asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions and people whose claims have failed and are awaiting deportation. A minority of detainees are foreign national prisoners who have completed prison terms for serious crimes and are being held in detention while steps are taken to remove them from the UK. The Home Office has 10 immigration centres in England. The Windrush generation is the name used for an estimated 500,000 people from Caribbean countries who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971 and were granted indefinite leave to remain. However, following changes to immigration law, many who arrived as children found themselves later unable to prove their status and some were subsequently held in detention or removed - despite having lived in the UK for decades. Olu Adekunle, 47, became a refugee in the UK last year - after four years and three judicial reviews - and spent time at three different detention centres. He had claimed asylum after escaping persecution from Nigeria because of his sexuality. Mr Adekunle said: ""I felt like a criminal. You don't know what's going to happen to you."" He said he believed the UK immigration system assumed claimants were lying and were ""guilty until you prove you're innocent"". He recalled a time when he was ""chained like a dog"" during a hospital visit, and says that although he is now a refugee, he still suffers from anxiety. The Home Office says it is looking closely at the issue of time limits to ""understand how we can have a detention system that is fair to those who may be detained, upholds our immigration policies, and acts as a deterrent to those who might seek to frustrate those policies"".

"This video can not be played Police bodycam footage shows Minnie Moloney getting hysterical upon being arrested The way a pregnant Irish Traveller was arrested was shameful and inappropriate, a race charity has said. Minnie Moloney, 25, who has severe mental health issues, was visited by several male police officers on 7 December 2017 after a row at a shop six weeks earlier. During the arrest, Ms Moloney became hysterical and was handcuffed wearing nothing but an untied dressing gown. South Wales Police said its actions were ""proportionate and necessary"". In bodycam footage from one of the officers, she can be seen coming down the stairs wearing just her dressing gown. After realising there was no woman officer, Ms Moloney became hysterical and tried to contact her mother as officers told her to calm down. She is eventually handcuffed with her arms around her back and led out to the police van despite her protestations that her modesty was being compromised by her dressing gown becoming undone. Race Equality First said the arrest should have been handled differently due to Ms Moloney's mental health issues and her cultural background which means her husband is the only man who should touch her. The charity said: A mental health professional should have been called to assess Ms Moloney as police knew she had mental health issues A female police officer should have been present She should have been allowed to get dressed before going to the police station Police should have asked her to attend the station voluntarily as she had done previously Ms Moloney's husband told police his wife was pregnant and not to handcuff her, but police say they will do because of how she is behaving The force said an investigation found no evidence Ms Moloney was mistreated during her arrest for a public order offence. She was later released without charge. Police were not called to the original row at the shop, but went to Ms Moloney's home in Rumney several weeks later to arrest her. Ms Moloney has mental health issues including psychosis, psychotic mood disorder and anxiety disorder. She said the experience was ""humiliating"" and made her feel ""helpless, stressed and worried"". ""When they took me out of the house, I was naked, I was stressed, I didn't have my medication, I didn't wake up properly, I knew they'd just leave me in the cell,"" she said. South Wales Police and the Independent Office of Police Conduct investigated and found no case to answer, with no evidence Ms Moloney was mistreated. Aliya Mohammed said the bodycam footage looked like ""a bit of fun and laughs and a bit of games basically at the expense of a vulnerable young woman"" But Aliya Mohammed, chief executive of Race Equality First, disagreed and said it was racial discrimination. ""I've never seen [a case] that has been caught on body-cam footage that shows such shocking scenes of blatant inappropriate, shameful behaviour. ""Why haven't we had a case like this for a non-ethnic minority person? For someone who is not a Gypsy or Traveller?"" In an investigation by the Professional Standards Department, the officer who arrested Minnie said he feared the situation would quickly escalate. His statement said: ""I took hold of Minnie's arm and she immediately became extremely irate and aggressive to a level that I have rarely seen in my 10.5 years of front line policing."" But Ms Mohammed disagrees: ""There are points where she holds up her hands, there are points when she is protesting, she does swear a lot throughout the video, however, she doesn't lash out at them, she doesn't hit them, she doesn't obstruct them either, she is just protesting at the way she's being treated. ""She wasn't being overly aggressive - certainly not for a woman who was half naked - with an open dressing gown and not even being allowed to cover herself up. I think it's extremely shocking."" Minnie Moloney's case is being handled by Race Equality First Ms Mohammed has now called for a new investigation. ""In the video footage, you can see that police officers are staring at her naked body, they are laughing and they are making inappropriate comments. ""Why were they doing that? Why did the police feel that it was appropriate and that they were able to actually make such inappropriate comments?"" South Wales Police said the incident highlighted the ""incredibly difficult job"" officers do on a daily basis. ""Once a complaint was received it was immediately referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct which directed a local investigation by the force's professional standards department,"" it said. ""An investigation found that none of the officers had a case to answer and the complainant was sent a report containing the findings of the investigation."" The force said it had met Race Equality First, no new complaints were presented and they rejected a civil claim. But Ms Moloney said: ""If two people from Cyncoed (an affluent Cardiff suburb) had an argument, would they have arrested a woman from Cyncoed in that manner? ""It's no different because I'm an Irish Traveller. I'm still the same as everybody else. I still bleed the same. I still feel the same. We're all human.""

"This video can not be played ""It has become an inland sea"" Some 15,000 people still need to be rescued from the devastation caused by Cyclone Idai, Mozambique officials say. The cyclone victims there are stranded by catastrophic flooding and are clinging to roofs or stuck in trees, charities say. In the port city of Beira, aid workers say there are only two to three days of clean water left. Some 300 people are confirmed dead in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, but the toll is expected to rise. The powerful cyclone swept in to Beira last Thursday, with winds of more than 177km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland. Oxfam has told the BBC that an area of about 3,000 sq km (1,864 sq miles) is now under water. Medical agencies are warning that the shortage of food and clean drinking water is increasing the threat of disease. ""The first thing you see when you arrive is destruction and a lot of water,"" said Get Verdonck, an emergency co-ordinator with the medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF).  15,000still need to be rescued 3,000have already been rescued 300dead in Mozambique 
and Zimbabwe 217of whom are in Mozambique 177km/hwind speed during Cyclone Idai ""People are using well water with no chlorination, and that water is unlikely to be clean... pneumonia and other respiratory diseases are going to be a problem,"" he told Reuters from Beira. Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. A total of 217 people are confirmed dead in the country, but many areas have still not been reached. Caroline Haga, an official with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the worst-hit areas were close to the Buzi river west of Beira. She said rescue teams were dropping high-energy biscuits, water purification tablets and other supplies to people surrounded by water and mud. ""We have thousands of people... in roofs and trees waiting for rescue,"" Ms Haga told AFP news agency. Cyclone Idai: Maps reveal storm's destruction The devastation in pictures 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' What's climate change got to do with it? ""We are running out of time. People have been waiting for rescue for more than three days now. We can't pick up all the people so our priority is children, pregnant women, injured people."" Celso Correia, Mozambique's minister of land and environment, confirmed this, telling Reuters the number of people still needing to be rescued was thought to be about 15,000. He added that 3,000 people had already been rescued so far. Desperate people carried away sacks of rice from this warehouse in Beira Deborah Nguyen, of the World Food Programme (WFP), said the priorities were reaching people trapped in the flooded areas and then organising temporary shelter for those rescued. ""Relief operations are progressing, but there is still a lot of work,"" she told AFP. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk. Wilker de Assis de Sousa Dias, a survivor in Beira, speaks to BBC Focus on Africa The winds started on Wednesday, but only around 60km/h. On Thursday, at around 14:00 it started getting at worse, and at around 19:00, the show really started, if I can say that. The cyclone was already starting to cause damage, picking up everything in its path. It was just destroying everything. In the parts of the city which are near the sea, there is almost nothing left. My house has two floors, and there's basically nothing there now. The roof has given way, and water is coming in from every corner. I was in my house during the storm. I actually didn't have any way of leaving, even if I'd wanted to. All of the roads near the sea, where my house is, were flooded. The wind was so strong it was picking up stones and hurling them around. I saw stones flying, zinc sheets flying, even pieces of cars. The debris smashed all of the windows in my house. I was able to walk around some of the affected areas shortly after the storm. I would say that 75% of the city is totally destroyed. We're still waiting for help. We need food, certainly, and we urgently need construction materials. In Zimbabwe, at least 98 people have died and 217 people are missing in the east and south, the government said. In Malawi, the UN says more than 80,000 people have been displaced by the cyclone. Amid the devastation, people in Zimbabwe are doing everything they can to help survivors. Videos and pictures have emerged of people queuing - not to collect fuel or bread, but to donate food, clothes and other goods to the relief effort. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka says the country is in the middle of an economic crisis but this has not stopped an unprecedented community aid effort. Reporters from BBC Africa have visited a Presbyterian church in the capital Harare, where volunteers have been sorting through donations. One woman turned up having walked for about two hours to bring her donation. Volunteer Natalie Detering told BBC News the donor said she could not afford her bus fare, but decided to walk from home because Jesus had told her to. This woman had walked for almost two hours to make her donation in Harare Among her donations was a pot, a blanket, some of her clothes and a towel. The generosity shown by ordinary Zimbabweans has prompted President Emmerson Mnangagwa to tweet his appreciation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The bus crashed into three other vehicles before the driver eventually got out A bus carrying 51 schoolchildren was hijacked by its driver and set alight near Milan in Italy. The children, some of them tied up, were rescued through smashed windows at the back of the bus and no-one was badly hurt. Fourteen people suffered smoke inhalation. The driver, a 47-year-old Italian citizen originally from Senegal, has been arrested. ""No-one will survive,"" the driver was alleged to have said. ""It was a miracle, it could have been a massacre,"" Milan chief prosecutor Francesco Greco was quoted as saying. A teacher who had been on the bus said the suspect - named by police as Ousseynou Sy - was known to be angry about Italy's immigration policy and about the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean. ""He shouted, 'Stop the deaths at sea, I'll carry out a massacre',"" police spokesman Marco Palmieri said. Italy government backs 'anti-migrant' bill Migrants allowed on land after stand-off Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Prosecutors said the suspect faced charges of kidnapping, attempted mass murder, causing a fire and resisting arrest. Mr Greco said officials were still weighing terrorism charges against him. The suspect was known to police, having been previously convicted of assault and for driving while intoxicated, Alberto Nobili, head of counter-terrorism at the Milan public prosecutor's office, told a news conference. Two classes of teenagers and their adult supervisors were being driven from a school in Vailati di Crema to a gym but the driver suddenly took a different route, apparently heading for Milan's Linate airport, reports said. When the suspect began threatening passengers with a knife, a boy phoned his parents who alerted the police. Officers then tried to intercept the bus. The vehicle rammed into police cars before slowing down. Parents collected their children from police after the bus rescue Once the bus stopped, the driver jumped off and set it alight, having already doused it in petrol. Police were able to smash the rear windows and get passengers off before the vehicle was engulfed in flames. ""It was a miracle they [the children] survived and we have to thank the Carabinieri for that,"" Mr Greco said. Interior ministry officials are investigating the possibility of annulling the driver's Italian citizenship, the AFP news agency reports. A decree issued in September makes it easier to deport migrants and take away their citizenship if they commit serious crimes. Since coming into power in June, Italy's ruling right-wing League party and populist Five Star Movement have established a strong anti-immigration stance. Located at the frontline of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea into Europe, Italy has tried to close its ports to boats. On Tuesday, around 50 people were rescued by a charity ship from a rubber boat off the coast of Libya and taken to the island of Lampedusa. Italian authorities ordered that the ship be seized and launched an investigation into the alleged aiding of clandestine immigration. Earlier this month,around 200,000 people attended an anti-racism march in Milan.

"It's not me - it's them. Theresa May has pitched herself tonight against Parliament on the side of the people. It's true that No 10 believes strongly that swathes of the population have simply had enough of Brexit. The way it drowns out other public concerns, the way its processes, contradictions and clamour have wrapped their way around the normal workings of Westminster - remote at the best of times and downright bizarre at the worst. But, when it is MPs the prime minister needs to get on side if she is to have a real chance of finally getting her deal through next week - third time extremely lucky - the choice of message was not without risk. 'Tired' public needs Brexit decision, says PM EU backs Brexit delay but only with deal Brexit: What could happen next? On her own side, some MPs have openly questioned the merit of her evening at the podium - toxic and delusional are some of the descriptions given. Yet Theresa May's allies say, at this vital moment, she felt it imperative to express that she has a line - staying in the EU three years after the referendum - that she is not, as prime minister, willing to cross. For those Brexiteers who want her gone, that is not, it's understood, a promise that she would quit in return for support for her deal. But No 10 must know too that choice, her fate, is not just in her hands, but in Parliament's and, as she prepares to travel to Brussels, in the grasp of the European Union.

"Rachel Johnston's mother Diana has started a legal battle for negligence The mother of a disabled woman who died after all her teeth were removed says she did not consent to the operation. Rachel Johnston's family has started a legal claim for negligence, saying medics failed to discuss risks of the treatment she had for tooth decay. Ms Johnston, 49, who collapsed shortly after being discharged from hospital, was readmitted and died weeks later. Health chiefs in Worcestershire said serious incident investigations had been carried out. Ms Johnston, who suffered brain damage after contracting meningitis as a baby, had the operation at Kidderminster Hospital in October and was discharged hours later. She was later rushed to hospital suffering from bleeding and breathing difficulties and put on a life-support machine. Her family was eventually told there was nothing more doctors could do for her and she died on 13 November. Rachel Johnston collapsed shortly after being discharged from hospital Lawyers acting for Ms Johnston's family claim a series of errors led to her death. They said the law around consent stated that doctors should discuss all risks and state why alternatives are not appropriate. The family claim that because Ms Johnston lacked the capacity to make a decision, her mother Diana Johnston's concerns should have been taken into consideration by medical staff. 'They took her teeth without telling me' Woman died after all teeth removed 'We had to pull out our own teeth' Mrs Johnston, who lives in Evesham, Worcestershire, said she wanted ""to get justice for my baby"". ""I don't feel that I was properly consulted, or that Rachel's treatment was discussed properly,"" she added. ""Things should have happened very differently. I wanted them to take a few teeth out at a time, maybe two at a time and give her a chance to recover. ""I wanted to make sure that she was safe. Her life was in my hands."" Ms Johnston underwent the operation at Kidderminster Hospital in October Ms Johnston's suffered cerebral hypoxia and aspiration pneumonia after having her teeth out, a post-mortem test found. Her family are also claiming she should not have been treated as a day patient. Caron Heyes, from legal firm Fieldfisher which is representing the family, said Mrs Johnston was not told how many of her daughter's teeth were removed. ""She [Mrs Johnston] found out after a learning disabilities mortality review investigation was launched,"" she said. ""Prior to surgery, Diana clearly stated that she did not think complete extraction was the right option for her daughter."" Rachel Johnston celebrated her 40th birthday with family and friends In a statement, the three health organisations dealing with the case - Worcestershire Health and Care Trust, Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust and Wyre Forest Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) - said: ""We would like to express our condolences with Ms Johnston's family for their loss. ""Both trusts have completed internal serious incident reports, which is usual in a case like this, and are also participating in the wider review led by the CCG looking at the care provided by all of the agencies involved."" It said the reports would be shared with Ms Johnston's family. A three-day inquest is set to take place in August at Stourport Coroner's Court.

"The UK media must not help terrorists by showing ""harmful"" content in their coverage of incidents, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer says. Neil Basu said a ""sensible conversation"" was needed,externalabout how incidents like the Christchurch attack should be reported. Several UK newspaper websites used film taken by suspected gunman or posted links to his so-called ""manifesto"". Mr Basu said it was wrong to ""hide behind the mantra"" of free speech. The attacks in Christchurch on Friday, the deadliest in New Zealand's history, happened as people were attending prayers at two mosques. Fifty people were killed and dozens more were injured. The gunman videoed his rampage and streamed the images live on social media. Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight Who were the Christchurch victims? The rising new threat of far-right violence Police in Christchurch asked social media users not to share the footage or links to a document the alleged gunman posted online about his motives. Social media companies like YouTube and Facebook raced to take the footage down,but it was still published on the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites - including in the UK and Australia - in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. The Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror all put edited footage on their websites, although the latter removed it soon afterwards. The Mirror's editor, Lloyd Embley, later apologised,explaining in a tweet,externalthe film should not have been carried as it was not in line with its policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos. The decision to disseminate the material prompted anger from people who argued that was exactly what the attacker had wanted. MailOnline did eventually remove a link to the alleged gunman's document from its site, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"". Neil Basu's open letter will inevitably stir up a debate about where the balance lies between freedom of speech and national security. And that is clearly what he wants. His frustration about the mainstream media's coverage of the New Zealand gun attack, and terrorism more broadly, seeps from the page. It strongly suggests that the Met Assistant Commissioner has seen compelling evidence of the impact of such reporting, as opposed to a theoretical concern. Nevertheless, criticising newspapers in the way he has runs the risk of losing support among those who are well placed to convey important police messages. Mr Basu clearly believes that's a risk worth taking. Assistant Commissioner Basu's open letter said it was ""time to have a sensible conversation about how to report terrorism in a way that doesn't help terrorists"". He said the same media organisations who have criticised social media platforms for not acting fast enough to remove extremist content have published ""uncensored propaganda"" of the Islamic State or made the ""rambling 'manifestos' of crazed killers available for download"". Freedom of speech ""is not an absolute right, it is not the freedom to cause harm"", Mr Basu said. Urging editors to debate the issue with survivors of terrorism and police, Mr Basu added: ""Anyone who seeks to deny the negative effects that promoting terrorist propaganda can have, should think carefully about the massive global effort to remove terrorist content from social media platforms and the pressure that governments, law enforcement and, ironically, the mass media has put on those companies to cleanse their sites."" He said extremist propaganda that might reach tens of thousands of people through their own channels or networks has a potential reach of tens of millions when a national newspaper published it. ""We must recognise this as harmful to our society and security,"" he said. New Zealand Prime MinisterJacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the nameof the Christchurch mosque gunman because she refused to give him the ""notoriety"" he sought. She urged her political colleagues to do the same.

"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died after the incident The 52-year-old hotel owner who was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after three teenagers' deaths has been released on police bail. The three people died after a crush outside the Greenvale Hotel, Cookstown. Michael McElhatton was first arrested on Tuesday. He has been bailed and will return for ""further questioning at a future date"", police said. He was also de-arrested in relation to an arrest on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. Mr McElhatton, who was arrested on the drug suspicion on Wednesday, said in a statement that he had ""nothing"" to do with drugs. In his statement issued earlier in response the drugs arrest, Mr McElhatton said: ""While I wished to respect the ongoing investigation by the police into the tragic deaths of the three young people at the Greenvale Hotel on St Patrick's night, I have no choice but to make it completely clear that I have nothing whatsoever to do with drugs. ""I can assure everyone that whatever any suspicions the police have raised about me in relation to anything to do with drugs is totally without any basis. ""I am shocked and horrified that the powdery substance taken by police from the laundry in my house could be drugs. ""Despite there being no basis to these suspicions, they have blackened my name and caused so much upset for so many people especially those who are grieving and distressed over the events at the Greenvale Hotel."" Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and Connor Currie, 16, died after a crush in the queue for a disco at the hotel on St Patrick's Day. Two days later, Mr McElhatton was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter along with a 40-year-old man, who remains in custody. Greenvale owner Michael McElhatton Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said police carried out a search at Mr McElhatton's property on Wednesday following his arrest. ""The search discovered a medium size clear polythene bag containing an amount of a white powdery substance and pieces of tin foil,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""This discovery led to the suspicion that the substance was a Class A drug. In line with normal procedure, the suspect was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply. This arrest was communicated to the media in line with procedure. ""Given the gravity of the investigation the examination of the bag was carried out urgently. Once opened by the Forensic Science Agency for Northern Ireland the substance inside the bag was ascertained to be an innocent substance. ""The suspect was then de-arrested, in respect of the drugs offence, and a communication made to the media.""

"This video can not be played ""It has become an inland sea"" Some 15,000 people still need to be rescued from the devastation caused by Cyclone Idai, Mozambique officials say. The cyclone victims there are stranded by catastrophic flooding and are clinging to roofs or stuck in trees, charities say. In the port city of Beira, aid workers say there are only two to three days of clean water left. Some 300 people are confirmed dead in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, but the toll is expected to rise. The powerful cyclone swept in to Beira last Thursday, with winds of more than 177km/h (106 mph). It left a trail of devastation as it moved inland. Oxfam has told the BBC that an area of about 3,000 sq km (1,864 sq miles) is now under water. Medical agencies are warning that the shortage of food and clean drinking water is increasing the threat of disease. ""The first thing you see when you arrive is destruction and a lot of water,"" said Get Verdonck, an emergency co-ordinator with the medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF).  15,000still need to be rescued 3,000have already been rescued 300dead in Mozambique 
and Zimbabwe 217of whom are in Mozambique 177km/hwind speed during Cyclone Idai ""People are using well water with no chlorination, and that water is unlikely to be clean... pneumonia and other respiratory diseases are going to be a problem,"" he told Reuters from Beira. Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. A total of 217 people are confirmed dead in the country, but many areas have still not been reached. Caroline Haga, an official with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the worst-hit areas were close to the Buzi river west of Beira. She said rescue teams were dropping high-energy biscuits, water purification tablets and other supplies to people surrounded by water and mud. ""We have thousands of people... in roofs and trees waiting for rescue,"" Ms Haga told AFP news agency. Cyclone Idai: Maps reveal storm's destruction The devastation in pictures 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' What's climate change got to do with it? ""We are running out of time. People have been waiting for rescue for more than three days now. We can't pick up all the people so our priority is children, pregnant women, injured people."" Celso Correia, Mozambique's minister of land and environment, confirmed this, telling Reuters the number of people still needing to be rescued was thought to be about 15,000. He added that 3,000 people had already been rescued so far. Desperate people carried away sacks of rice from this warehouse in Beira Deborah Nguyen, of the World Food Programme (WFP), said the priorities were reaching people trapped in the flooded areas and then organising temporary shelter for those rescued. ""Relief operations are progressing, but there is still a lot of work,"" she told AFP. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk. Wilker de Assis de Sousa Dias, a survivor in Beira, speaks to BBC Focus on Africa The winds started on Wednesday, but only around 60km/h. On Thursday, at around 14:00 it started getting at worse, and at around 19:00, the show really started, if I can say that. The cyclone was already starting to cause damage, picking up everything in its path. It was just destroying everything. In the parts of the city which are near the sea, there is almost nothing left. My house has two floors, and there's basically nothing there now. The roof has given way, and water is coming in from every corner. I was in my house during the storm. I actually didn't have any way of leaving, even if I'd wanted to. All of the roads near the sea, where my house is, were flooded. The wind was so strong it was picking up stones and hurling them around. I saw stones flying, zinc sheets flying, even pieces of cars. The debris smashed all of the windows in my house. I was able to walk around some of the affected areas shortly after the storm. I would say that 75% of the city is totally destroyed. We're still waiting for help. We need food, certainly, and we urgently need construction materials. In Zimbabwe, at least 98 people have died and 217 people are missing in the east and south, the government said. In Malawi, the UN says more than 80,000 people have been displaced by the cyclone. Amid the devastation, people in Zimbabwe are doing everything they can to help survivors. Videos and pictures have emerged of people queuing - not to collect fuel or bread, but to donate food, clothes and other goods to the relief effort. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka says the country is in the middle of an economic crisis but this has not stopped an unprecedented community aid effort. Reporters from BBC Africa have visited a Presbyterian church in the capital Harare, where volunteers have been sorting through donations. One woman turned up having walked for about two hours to bring her donation. Volunteer Natalie Detering told BBC News the donor said she could not afford her bus fare, but decided to walk from home because Jesus had told her to. This woman had walked for almost two hours to make her donation in Harare Among her donations was a pot, a blanket, some of her clothes and a towel. The generosity shown by ordinary Zimbabweans has prompted President Emmerson Mnangagwa to tweet his appreciation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
