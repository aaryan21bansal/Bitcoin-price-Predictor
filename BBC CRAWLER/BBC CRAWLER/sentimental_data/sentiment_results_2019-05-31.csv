"Fans of Tottenham and and Liverpool soak up the Madrid atmosphere Thousands of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur fans are in Madrid for the Champions League final. The Premier League sides meet at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium on Saturday evening, after both made remarkable comebacks in the semi-finals. Many supporters spent Friday making the journey to Spain from the UK. Uefa said ""an organised group of people impersonating genuine stewards"" was behind aplot to steal match ticketsand warned fans to be on their guard. It said the group's aim was to steal tickets ""as if they were conducting the visual or technical ticket check"". Spurs and Liverpool fans are sharing 33,226 tickets for the final, which takes place at the 68,000-capacity home of Atletico Madrid. Fans have been warned only to show their tickets at clearly marked check zones outside the Wanda Metropolitano. Spanish police have arrested a number of people for selling fake tickets, including a pair who were allegedly attempting to sell counterfeits near the Liverpool fans' meeting point in Madrid. Uefa issues 'fake stewards' ticket warning Tenor 'gutted' over Â£7,000 Spurs tickets Match preview and team news The inside story of two incredible semis The UK governmenthas issued travel advice those heading to the Spanish capital,external. Spanish police have told English football fans to ""behave like tourists"", as an extra 1,300 officers have been deployed to cope with the influx of supporters. An acknowledgement from both sets of fans is that the Liverpool contingent is so far outnumbering that of their north London rivals. Police said supporters had so far been well-behaved. A fan poses with the Uefa Champions League trophy in a Madrid square Officer Jose Ramon Carrasco said: ""We understand they're going to be noisy, happy or singing or whatever - that's understandable. ""What's not understandable is maybe throwing bottles in the street, getting into fights. We don't accept that."" About9,000 flights were estimatedto have taken off from the UK on Friday, which would exceed the previous record of 8,854 set on 25 May last year, a day before Liverpool's appearance in the 2018 final. Air traffic controller Nats has predicted an extra 800 flights over the weekend.

He said he had seen plenty of other Spurs fans on the roads of Europe bound for Madrid, including many who did not have match tickets. Sisters Toni Moran and Collette Slater, ""born and bred"" Liverpool fans, flew to Madrid with family - including a nephew who travelled from Sydney.

"This video can not be played CCTV captures the moment hundreds of migrants cross into the US Mexico's president has insisted his government will not be provoked, after President Donald Trump announced escalating tariffs on all goods unless Mexico curbed illegal migration. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador described Mr Trump's slogan ""America First"" as a fallacy and said universal justice was more important than borders. Stock markets saw sharp lossesfollowing Mr Trump's announcement. Mr Trump declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border in February. He said it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis with thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the US southern frontier. Threat of Mexico trade war sends markets lower The butterflies that could stop Trumpâs wall Trump's border wall - in seven charts Mr Trump's latest statement came a day after US border authorities in El Paso, Texas, detained a group of more than 1,000 migrants - the largest single group agents had ever encountered. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday that Mexico could have done more to stop the group - and others - as they travelled through the country. ""They could have easily broken up this group, arrested them or sent them back home, and they didn't do anything,"" she told reporters. ""We're asking Mexico to enforce their own laws to help stop the people coming in from Central America."" The migrants caught on Wednesday came from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador and included entire families, agents said In tweets later on Friday, President Trump said the tariffs were also to encourage Mexico to ""take back"" the country from drugs cartels.

The president said he had ordered his foreign minister to travel to Washington on Friday. ""I want to insist that we are not going to fall into any provocations, that we are going to act prudently with respect to the authorities of the United States [and] with respect to President Donald Trump,"" he said. In a letter to his US counterpart, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said Mexico was complying with its responsibility to avoid ""as far as possible and without violating human rights, the passage [of migrants] through our country"". AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said social problems could not be resolved with tariffs ""President Trump: Social problems are not resolved with tariffs or coercive measures,"" he added. ""With all due respect, although you have the sovereign right to express this, the slogan 'United States [America] First' is a fallacy because, until the end of time, and even over and above national frontiers, universal justice and fraternity will prevail."" Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard confirmed on Twitter that he would lead a delegation to Washington, adding: ""The treatment of Mexico is unfair and does not make economic sense to anyone."" He later tweeted that a summit to resolve the dispute would be held in Washington on Wednesday, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heading the US side. ""We will be firm and defend the dignity of Mexico,"" he said. The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents three million businesses in the US, condemned Mr Trump's plan. Chief policy officer Neil Bradley said the tariffs would ""be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border"". The Business Roundtable, a US body made of chief executives of major US corporations, said it would be ""a grave error"" and urged Mr Trump to reconsider. This video can not be played Five numbers that explain US border crisis It warned that the move jeopardised the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). President Trump's top trade adviserRobert Lighthizer had opposed the plan, the Wall Street Journal reported,external, also warning that the new trade deal could be affected. One source quoted by the paper said: ""Lighthizer is not happy."" The US president has long accused Mexico of not doing enough to stem the flow of people. Migrants, most of whom say they are fleeing violence in Central American countries, travel through Mexico on their way to the US, where they hope to claim asylum. In a White House statement,Mr Trump said the tariffs would rise by five percentage points each month,externaluntil 1 October, when the rate would reach 25%. The tariffs would stay at that level ""unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory"", he said. ""For years, Mexico has not treated us fairly - but we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign nation,"" the statement said. Allow Twitter content?

The president also took aim at his Democratic opponents, accusing them of a ""total dereliction of duty"" over border security. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is taking legal action to halt the Trump administration's efforts to build a border wall, saying it would be a waste of funds and would not stop illegal immigration. Mexico was the second largest supplier of goods to the US last year, with imports totalling $352bn (Â£275bn), according to Goldman Sachs.

"This video can not be played ""We had to pay Â£2,000 to move in"" A ban on ""unfair"" fees charged by lettings agents to tenants in England has started, two-and-a-half years after the plan was first announced. It means tenants will no longer face fees for services including viewings, credit checks, references and setting up a tenancy. Citizens Advice claims people renting privately in England have collectively been paying Â£13m a month in these fees. Landlords say rents could rise and choice fall as a result of the ban. The ban in England was first announced by Chancellor Philip Hammond in November 2016, when the government said it would become law ""as soon as possible"". The detail of the new rules have been fiercely debated by all sides ever since. Can a landlord kick me out? Agency 'locking out tenants and taking belongings' ""The new law means families and other renters don't have to hand over hundreds of pounds every time they move home,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice. A ban has been in place in Scotland since 2012, while Wales is set to implementits own rulesin September, but the picture is more complicated in Northern Ireland, where a potential ban requires a sitting assembly to pass it. It has been the case that England's five million private tenants faced various unavoidable fees every time they moved or renewed a tenancy. With renting becoming more widespread,including among middle-aged people, more people were caught up by these mostly upfront costs. The level of fees had to be clearly displayed but varied significantly, with tenants in big cities facing the highest charges. Typically, this cost tenants Â£200 to Â£300 each time, although campaigners claimed the average was higher. Fees may have been charged for administration, references from tenants' employers, inventory checks and so on. Agents, and ultimately landlords, will now have to pick up the cost of this work for new and renewed tenancies under the Tenant Fees Act. The new rules prevent them from simply charging a higher rent for the first month to cover the cost. But Hannah Slater, from lobby group Generation Rent, said that moving house would still be expensive. So-called deposit alternative products - which include a fee - could end up being expensive for tenants, she added. Kirsty McDermott has been forced to move twice when her landlords have sold up, and with each move has come the extra fees. The 22-year-old hotel receptionist from Coventry said her landlords had been good, but the upfront charges had been a challenge. ""We saved up, but it was painful to hear that we had to pay Â£2,000 to move in,"" she said, recalling the rent, deposit and fees. ""For young people, there is a lot of money pressure anyway. It was disappointing because it could have been money we could have put towards our own place."" The new rules, she said, meant the money she would have paid in her next move could be put towards her future. Many young adults have had the same experience. Charlotte Von Crease, a 27-year-old renter,recently told the BBC: ""When we moved into our last property, we were hit with nearly Â£3,500 worth of fees before we even got the keys."" The new law does not mean tenants will not have to pay any upfront fees at all. They will still be expected to pay the first month's rent, and a deposit. Following debate, the government settled on a rule that means security deposits will be limited to five weeks' worth of rent for properties costing less than Â£50,000 annually to rent, or six weeks for higher-value renting. Holding deposits are capped at one week's rent. Additionally, there can be a charge for a lost key replacement, at close to the cost to the landlords themselves. If rent is outstanding for more than 14 days, then agencies can impose a penalty limited to 3% higher than the Bank of England's base rate, which is 0.75% at present. There might also be a fee of about Â£50 if a tenant requests a change to the tenancy, and also one if a tenant wants to leave the contract early. Those who signed a tenancy agreement before 1 June may still face fees in their contract for the next 12 months, including renewal fees. An impact assessment from the government last year suggested the first year of the policy would collectively cost landlords nearly Â£83m, while letting agents would take a hit of Â£157m. An agents' trade body has described the new law as ""the biggest change to hit the lettings industry in decades"". Leona Leung says some landlords may leave the sector Leona Leung, a landlord and lettings agency manager, said that agents would have to cover their cost and pass this on to the landlords. This could then be handed on to tenants in higher rent. Housing charity Shelter argued that experience from the ban in Scotland suggested otherwise, saying that rises in rent had been ""small and short-lived"", despite expectations that rents would increase. Ms Leung said that other tax changes, such as the Insurance Premium Tax, had hit landlords - meaning that they were already facing tough cost pressures. All but the biggest companies could decide to self-manage their property or sell up. ""Many landlords will be asking whether it is a feasible business."" she said. ""The small landlords and local agents could be out of the business very soon. It is a loss for everyone - tenants, landlords and agents."" Many agents are unhappy that they are facing higher costs as a result of overcharging by the unscrupulous few in the past. This is a matter of debate, as the cost of renting a property has been rising on average in the UK. The lower upfront costs will be a benefit, but there remains stiff competition for good-quality rented homes in some parts of the UK. Housing organisations recommend spending no more than 30% of your salary on rent. The average rent of a 1-bedroom home exceeds this for twenty-somethings in two-thirds of Britain.    High demand could push up the cost of renting in these areas, irrespective of the one-off costs they may save on now. Many tenants have also seen their wages remain relatively stagnant in recent years, although this has started to pick up.

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonny Dymond on what to expect from President Trump's visit to the UK US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are making a state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Here's a rundown of what we can expect. It's a formal trip to the UK by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. Although they're grand occasions, they're not just ceremonial affairs - they're also used by the government to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state per year and has hosted 112 of these visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Familyhas a full list of all the other state visits,external, and details ofhow the ceremonies unfold,external. Visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, but because Buckingham Palace is being renovated the US president is not expected to stay there. While Mr Trump is only the third US president to make a state visit to the UK, the Queenhas met almost all the US presidents in office during that time, either in the UK or in the US. On Monday, the first day of Mr Trump's three-day trip, a ceremonial welcome attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall was held in the Buckingham Palace garden. After the welcome, the Duke of Sussex joined the group for a private lunch at the palace. This video can not be played Here's what happened on day one of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK (tweets not included).

Thousands of people are expected to join protests against Mr Trump's visit in UK cities on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the London rally in Trafalgar Square, where he will be joined by members of other political parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. In the evening, the Trumps will host a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador attended by Charles and Camilla on behalf of the Queen. The trip is expected to culminate on Wednesday 5 June with Mr Trump, the Queen and Prince Charles attending the national commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. More than 300 veterans will be at the ceremony, which will feature musical performances, testimonial readings and military displays.

The prime minister says the visit is a chance for the UK and the US to strengthen their ""already close relationship"". Talks will cover areas such as trade, investment, security and defence. But Mr Trump is a controversial figure and many have opposed the visit. Thousands gathered to protest against President Trump's policies when he visited the UK in 2018 His policies - from the executive order that restricts entry to the US from certain countries, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - have provoked criticism, both domestically and internationally. And that is to say nothing about some of the comments he's made - including outspoken attacks against political opponents, the media, and his critics - and the investigation into his links to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also declined an invitation. Others argue that the US is a key ally of the UK and that Mr Trump should be welcomed accordingly.

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"".

Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact.

"Eight people were killed and many more injured when three attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market. The men were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. Here is what we know about what happened on Saturday 3 June 2017. At 21:58 BST,a van with the three attackers inside drove onto London Bridge from the north side of the river. The vehicle crossed over, before returning in the opposite direction six minutes later. When it reached the northern end of the bridge, police said it made a U-turn and mounted the pavement. It then crossed the bridge again, ploughing into pedestrians, including three of those killed. Xavier Thomas, walking with his girlfriend, was hit by the van, the force apparently knocking him into the river. His body was later found downstream. BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, said the van was ""probably travelling at about 50mph"". ""He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people,"" she said. This video can not be played ""He looked demented"": The BBC's Holly Jones was in the path of the van driver on London Bridge 'I was convinced I was going to die' Victims of the attack Who were the attackers? After crossing the bridge, the van crashed near the Barrowboy and Banker pub. Three men got out, armed with 12in (30cm) pink ceramic knives tied to their wrists, and ran towards Borough Market, slashing and stabbing people in their path. The men attached blades to their wrists before the attack As the attackers moved through Borough Market, people tried to fight them off by throwing crates, chairs and glasses.

"John Bolton said Brexit was a chance for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"" The Trump administration wants the UK to follow the 2016 referendum result and leave the European Union, National Security Advisor John Bolton said. Speaking to the UK's Telegraph, Mr Bolton said Brexit was an opportunity for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"". His remarks came ahead of a UK visit by President Trump, who has previously stated his support for Brexit. Mr Trump was critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. The president's three-day trip, from 3 to 5 June, includes a Buckingham Palace dinner and breakfast with Mrs May, who has hailed the visit as an opportunity for the UK and US ""to strengthen our already close relationship"". Speaking ahead of his visit,President Trump praised the UK Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson, saying he would make ""excellent"" choice. In an interview published on Friday, Mr Bolton - a former ambassador to the UN who is considered one of the more hawkish members of the Trump administration - said the world and the Nato military alliance would benefit from the UK being outside the EU. ""As a separate nation again, Britain's impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater...,externalI think it will help us in Nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help Nato to be more effective, and that has to be a plus."" He added: ""The US preference is for Britain to follow the course of what the people asked for and leave the EU. It's a lesson for everyone in the triumph of democracy."" Trump says Boris Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader What's Trump bringing with him to the UK? What can we expect from the visit? Mr Bolton said the first step towards a closer relationship was for the next prime minister to finish the Brexit process and negotiate a new trade deal with the US. Theresa May has resigned as prime minister over her Brexit deal Last week, Mrs May - whose withdrawal agreement with the EU was rejected by the UK Parliament three times - announced thatshe would quit as Conservative party leader on 7 Junebut stay in office until a successor was found. ""[Mr Trump] wants to make a deal with Britain that will leave both of us better off, and free Britain from the regulatory constraints it faces with the EU,"" Mr Bolton said. The US president, who has previously said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to negotiate a deal with the EU, said the agreement reached by the prime minister sounded ""like a great deal for the EU"". He had also raised fears that, under Mrs May's Brexit deal,the US and the UK would not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement. Mr Trump has said he might meet Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Boris Johnson - one of the 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader - during his trip to the UK. This video can not be played Donald Trump in March: ""I'm surprised at how badly Brexit negotiations have all gone"" Meanwhile, there are growing signs that President Trump will warn British authorities that the US government is prepared to limit intelligence sharing if the UK allows Chinese technology giant Huawei to build part of its 5G network Washington believes the technology could be used by China to spy, a claim Huawei has denied. Speaking in Germany, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The risk that we'll have to change our behaviour in light of the fact that we can't permit private citizen data from the US or national security data from the US to go across networks that we don't have confidence, that we don't view as trusted networks."" The UK, where 5G was launched in six cities on Thursday, is moving towards letting Huawei build certain parts of its network - non-core elements, such as transmission equipment rather than information infrastructure.

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"Some fans said they queued for more than two hours to collect tickets Cricket fans who missed the start of the World Cup match between Pakistan and West Indies due to delays at Trent Bridge are to receive refunds. Some spectators complained they were forced to wait more than two hours to collect paper tickets before the game. The International Cricket Council said due to a problem delivering tickets, there had been a high volume of people collecting them at the ground. It apologised and said refunds would be automatically issued to those affected. Pakistan lost to West Indies despite strong support BBC producer Emb Hashmi, who was attending the game, said it was ""absolutely frustrating"" to see queues that seemed to go on for ""miles and miles"" as fans from all over the world missed the start of the game they had paid to see. Bilal Zafar said he was queuing for more than an hour and jokingly compared the scenes to theFyre Festival, the US music event that famously descended into chaos in 2017. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Steve Elworthy, managing director of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, said: ""I sincerely apologise to every single fan who was affected by the queues today. ""We have delivered over 700,000 tickets to more than 120 countries, but not all tickets were successfully delivered and as such we have seen a higher volume collecting at the venue. ""It is only right that we refund these fans by way of apology. The refund will happen automatically so the fans do not need to do anything."" Cricket fans had travelled from across the world to see the game The ICC said it was working with Ticketmaster to resolve outstanding issues and had put measures in place to avoid a similar situation at future World Cup games. It added data from ticket scanners would be used to determine which spectators missed the start of play. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage.

"Cilmate protesters held a demonstration outside Heathrow Airport on 19 April Extinction Rebellion activists are threatening to shut down Heathrow Airport with drones. The climate change protest group vowed to stage a one-day demonstration in June and then 10 further days in July - unless the government cancels plans for expanding the airport. Ten days of protests across central London in April saw 1,130 people arrested for various offences. Heathrow Airport said the plan was ""reckless"" and could ""endanger lives"". Extinction Rebellion said it was in talks with members about carrying out action to close the airport on 18 June and again from 1 July for up to 10 days if the government did not cancel plans to expand the airport. A spokesman for the group said it was ""fully committed to non-violence"" and it would ""not take action that would put airline passengers at risk"" but ""in the face of climate and ecological collapse [would] continue to build a peaceful movement"". Protesters occupied Oxford Circus as part of Extinction Rebellion demonstrations in April The plan to use drones was discussed in a consultation document shared between group members. A Heathrow spokesman said: ""This is reckless action that if carried out could endanger the lives of the travelling public and our colleagues. ""We agree with the need to act on climate change, but that requires us to work together constructively - not commit serious criminal offences just as hard-working people prepare to spend a well-earned holiday with their family and friends."" Met wants 1,130 climate protesters charged Extinction Rebellion: What happened? New powers to tackle illegal drone use Aviation Minister Baroness Vere warned that any illegal activity ""must be met with the full force of the law"". She added: ""Flying drones near an airport is a serious criminal offence and using drones to deliberately put people's safety at risk carries a maximum life sentence. ""No government has done more to reduce carbon emissions and Britain is at the forefront of global efforts to tackle climate change."" The Met Police said the protests in April cost the force ""an extra Â£7.5m"" Last month the group's tactics in central London included asking volunteers to deliberately get arrested to cause maximum disruption at roadblocks on Waterloo Bridge, Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. Demonstrators also protested at Heathrow but did not cause disruption to flights. A small group of mostly teenage activists briefly unfurled a banner near a tunnel which leads to Terminals 2 and 3 as several police officers watched on. This video can not be played Extinction Rebellion protesters reach Parliament Square It was announced in January that police would begiven new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones, after hundreds of flights at Gatwick Airport were disrupted by drone sightings in December. Last year the government made it illegal to fly a droneabove 400ft (120m) or within 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. The exclusion zone will now be extended to the current Air Traffic Zone around airports, which is approximately a 5km (3.1 miles) radius, with additional extensions from runway ends. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of up to five years. Met wants 1,130 climate protesters charged Extinction Rebellion: What happened?

"This video can not be played Five numbers that explain US border crisis US President Donald Trump has announced tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico, demanding the country curb illegal immigration into the US. In a tweet, Mr Trump said that from 10 June a 5% tariff would be imposed and would slowly rise ""until the illegal immigration problem is remedied"". JesÃºs Seade, Mexico's top diplomat for North America, said the proposed tariffs would be ""disastrous"". Mr Trump declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border in February. He said it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis at the US southern border. Border agents say they are overwhelmed, but critics say they are mishandling and mistreating migrants. The butterflies that could stop Trumpâs wall Trump's border wall - in seven charts On Thursday, US border authorities in El Paso, Texas, said a group of more than 1,000 migrants were detained on Wednesday - the largest single group agents had encountered. This video can not be played CCTV captures the moment hundreds of migrants cross into the US Robert Perez, customs and border protection deputy commissioner, said the apprehension ""demonstrates the severity of the border security and humanitarian crisis at our south-west border"". The US president has long accused Mexico of not doing enough to stem the flow of people, and this is his latest attempt to put pressure on the neighbouring state. The migrants caught on Wednesday came from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador and included entire families, agents said Mr Seade said Mexico ""must respond vigorously"" if the tariffs - a tax on products made abroad - were brought in. However, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador responded by saying he did not want ""confrontation"". ""I propose deepening our dialogue, to look for other alternatives to the migration problem,"" he wrote in a letter on Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

During his election campaign and throughout his time in office, President Trump has sought funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He declared the national emergency at the border in an attempt to divert federal funds for a barrier wall, buta judge blocked his efforts in May. The White House said on Thursday that the president would use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the new tariffs on Mexico. The announcement came the same day that the White House told Congress it planned to pursue a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. In a White House statement,Mr Trump said the tariffs would rise by five percentage points each month,externaluntil 1 October, when the rate would reach 25%. The tariffs would stay at that level ""unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory"", he said. ""For years, Mexico has not treated us fairly - but we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign nation,"" the statement said. The president also took aim at his Democratic opponents, accusing them of a ""total dereliction of duty"" over border security. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is taking legal action to halt the Trump administration's efforts to build a border wall, saying it would be a waste of funds and would not stop illegal immigration. Amid record numbers of migrants crossing the border,the deaths of six sick children in US custody since Septemberhave raised questions about the level of care provided by US authorities. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent President Trump's latest tariff proposal is driven by a political issue  - which is not to say that previous tariff moves did not have any politics behind them. But it is sure to have financial and economic consequences. Stock markets in many countries have already registered significant falls. Japanese car makers were among those hit - they have operations in Mexico which will be affected if President Trump does go ahead. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Perhaps he hoped that a welcome side effect would be improved competitiveness for American industry. Well, half the potential impact for the first stage in the proposed tariffs hikes was wiped immediately by a decline in the value of the Mexican peso, which has the effect of making Mexico a little more competitive, at least until the tariffs come into effect. There could also be ramifications for the new trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. It will probably make the Mexican Congress a lot more wary about approving the accord. Migrants, most of whom say they are fleeing violence in Central American countries, travel through Mexico on their way to the US, where they hope to claim asylum. Mr Trump believes they should be stopped long before they reach the border, however. The agony over an American dream In pictures: : A river of people moving north Police do appear to have been cracking down, with400 migrants detained in the southern state of Chiapas in April. President LÃ³pez Obrador used the arrests to emphasise the country was not giving migrants ""free passage"". However, he added that it was out of concern for the migrants' safety over anything else. Mexico was the second largest supplier of goods to the US last year, with imports totalling $352bn (Â£275bn), according to Goldman Sachs. It is known for agricultural products like avocados and tequila, but the country is also a major manufacturing hub and home to many US companies. The country produces hundreds of thousands of cars every month, and is also home to technology and aerospace companies. It is one of the G20 economies. US firms Ford, General Motors, John Deere, IBM and Coca-Cola all operate in Mexico, as well as thousands of other multinationals. The president's statement comes amid a trade war with China. After complaining for years about the US trade deficit with China, Mr Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods coming from the country.

"Eight people were killed and many more injured when three attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market. The men were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. Here is what we know about what happened on Saturday 3 June 2017. At 21:58 BST,a van with the three attackers inside drove onto London Bridge from the north side of the river. The vehicle crossed over, before returning in the opposite direction six minutes later. When it reached the northern end of the bridge, police said it made a U-turn and mounted the pavement. It then crossed the bridge again, ploughing into pedestrians, including three of those killed. Xavier Thomas, walking with his girlfriend, was hit by the van, the force apparently knocking him into the river. His body was later found downstream. BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, said the van was ""probably travelling at about 50mph"". ""He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Julius Agyei says his clothes and passport were taken from his room A letting agency has been illegally evicting tenants and taking their belongings, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. Three tenants said they arrived home to find locks had been changed and rooms emptied. Some said their possessions had not yet been returned. Others said their belongings were given back in bin bags, left on the street outside the agency. Flintons, in east London, said it ""strongly denies"" the claims. BBC News haspreviously reported that Flintonsdemanded hundreds of pounds before prospective tenants were allowed to view properties for rent, which it denied. Figures show just 18 landlords were convicted of illegal eviction in England and Wales in 2018. The charity Citizens Advice said it had logged 2,164 complaints about the problem in the same period. Julius Agyei rented a room, through Flintons, in a shared flat in east London last year. The letting agency provides short-term rentals, usually to young professionals and students. At one stage, he says he was charged extra fees for late payment of rent, which he disputes and was in discussions with Flintons to resolve. But then, in December 2018, he arrived home to find the key to his room would not work. And when a locksmith eventually let him in, his room was empty. ""Everything was gone,"" he says. ""They'd taken literally all my clothes, my towels, my passport, they even took my bed sheets around my bed."" Julius Agyei says his clothes and passport were removed Flintons disputes that Julius was locked out of his room or that his possessions were removed. It says he told them in a phone call, two days before, that he had already moved out and a later inspection found the room apparently abandoned. Julius strongly denies that. ""Every day I'm just thinking, 'Why has this happened to me? I haven't done anything. I'm here trying to work, mind my own business,'"" he says. He said he was now planning to take legal action to make the agency return his belongings or pay compensation. Flintons says it will ""vigorously defend"" any legal claim. Under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977, it can be a criminal offence for a landlord or agency to evict a tenant without going to court to acquire a possession order. The number of complaints has been rising in England and Wales, driven by a sharp increase in people renting privately. The charity Citizens Advice said 2,164 people had reported the problem in 2018-19, up from 1,415 in 2014-15. But the evidence threshold for a prosecution is high and according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice, only 47 complaints led to a prosecution in 2018. Georgiana and her partner, Stan, were awarded Â£400 in compensation There were 18 convictions, and, in the most serious cases, two people received a jail sentence. Support workers believe the true scale of the problem is hard to measure, as many tenants will simply find a new place to live without going to the authorities. David Hickling, who chairs the Association of Tenancy Relations Officers, says local authorities have no statutory duty to act in cases where private tenants suffer harassment or unlawful eviction. And even after a conviction, there is a wide variation in sentencing, with fines ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands of pounds for what look like very similar offences. The BBC is not aware of any criminal investigation into Flintons related to allegations of illegal eviction. One couple, Stan Cristinel and Georgiana Militaru, say they were left hundreds of pounds out of pocket after renting a room with Flintons. After falling behind with some rent payments, they say, they came home to find their door wide open and their belongings gone. They say there was no warning letter or phone call from the agency. ""This was the room when I came home,"" Stan says, pointing to photos he took at the time. ""I found nothing, nothing [in the room]."" The couple complained to Flintons and say they paid Â£450 to get their belongings back - which were left in bin bags in the street outside the agency. Stan and Georgiana say their possessions were left out in the street outside the agency Responding to the allegation, Flintons produced a receipt saying the Â£450 fee had been for breaking their contract early, though the couple, originally from Romania, deny that was the case. The pair went to Citizens Advice, which helped take their complaint to the property ombudsman. Ten months later, Flintons was ordered to pay them Â£400 in compensation for breaching the ombudsman's code of practice, though the ombudsman said it could not rule on the legality of the eviction itself. Flintons says Stan and Georgiana left the property ""of their own free will"" and the ombudsman's ruling came after it had failed to submit paperwork because of an ""administrative oversight"". In October 2017, the UK government said it would take action to license letting agents, with plans to set minimum standards and put in place an independent regulatory body. But no legislation has yet been introduced and discussions about what form it could take are ongoing, with a working group chaired by Lord Best due to report in July. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We have given local authorities greater enforcement powers to tackle landlords who pursue illegal practices. ""These include updating relevant guidance, providing national training, and awarding Â£2.3m in grant funding to help local authorities implement these measures."" There are already stricter controls in Scotland and Wales, where agents must apply for a licence and can be refused if they do not meet certain standards.

"This video can not be played Julius Agyei says his clothes and passport were taken from his room A letting agency has been illegally evicting tenants and taking their belongings, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. Three tenants said they arrived home to find locks had been changed and rooms emptied. Some said their possessions had not yet been returned. Others said their belongings were given back in bin bags, left on the street outside the agency. Flintons, in east London, said it ""strongly denies"" the claims. BBC News haspreviously reported that Flintonsdemanded hundreds of pounds before prospective tenants were allowed to view properties for rent, which it denied. Figures show just 18 landlords were convicted of illegal eviction in England and Wales in 2018. The charity Citizens Advice said it had logged 2,164 complaints about the problem in the same period. Julius Agyei rented a room, through Flintons, in a shared flat in east London last year. The letting agency provides short-term rentals, usually to young professionals and students. At one stage, he says he was charged extra fees for late payment of rent, which he disputes and was in discussions with Flintons to resolve. But then, in December 2018, he arrived home to find the key to his room would not work. And when a locksmith eventually let him in, his room was empty. ""Everything was gone,"" he says.

"This video can not be played Five numbers that explain US border crisis US President Donald Trump has announced tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico, demanding the country curb illegal immigration into the US. In a tweet, Mr Trump said that from 10 June a 5% tariff would be imposed and would slowly rise ""until the illegal immigration problem is remedied"". JesÃºs Seade, Mexico's top diplomat for North America, said the proposed tariffs would be ""disastrous"". Mr Trump declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border in February. He said it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis at the US southern border. Border agents say they are overwhelmed, but critics say they are mishandling and mistreating migrants. The butterflies that could stop Trumpâs wall Trump's border wall - in seven charts On Thursday, US border authorities in El Paso, Texas, said a group of more than 1,000 migrants were detained on Wednesday - the largest single group agents had encountered. This video can not be played CCTV captures the moment hundreds of migrants cross into the US Robert Perez, customs and border protection deputy commissioner, said the apprehension ""demonstrates the severity of the border security and humanitarian crisis at our south-west border"". The US president has long accused Mexico of not doing enough to stem the flow of people, and this is his latest attempt to put pressure on the neighbouring state. The migrants caught on Wednesday came from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador and included entire families, agents said Mr Seade said Mexico ""must respond vigorously"" if the tariffs - a tax on products made abroad - were brought in. However, Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador responded by saying he did not want ""confrontation"". ""I propose deepening our dialogue, to look for other alternatives to the migration problem,"" he wrote in a letter on Thursday. Allow Twitter content?

During his election campaign and throughout his time in office, President Trump has sought funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. He declared the national emergency at the border in an attempt to divert federal funds for a barrier wall, buta judge blocked his efforts in May. The White House said on Thursday that the president would use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the new tariffs on Mexico. The announcement came the same day that the White House told Congress it planned to pursue a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. In a White House statement,Mr Trump said the tariffs would rise by five percentage points each month,externaluntil 1 October, when the rate would reach 25%. The tariffs would stay at that level ""unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory"", he said. ""For years, Mexico has not treated us fairly - but we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign nation,"" the statement said. The president also took aim at his Democratic opponents, accusing them of a ""total dereliction of duty"" over border security. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is taking legal action to halt the Trump administration's efforts to build a border wall, saying it would be a waste of funds and would not stop illegal immigration. Amid record numbers of migrants crossing the border,the deaths of six sick children in US custody since Septemberhave raised questions about the level of care provided by US authorities. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent President Trump's latest tariff proposal is driven by a political issue  - which is not to say that previous tariff moves did not have any politics behind them. But it is sure to have financial and economic consequences. Stock markets in many countries have already registered significant falls. Japanese car makers were among those hit - they have operations in Mexico which will be affected if President Trump does go ahead. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Perhaps he hoped that a welcome side effect would be improved competitiveness for American industry. Well, half the potential impact for the first stage in the proposed tariffs hikes was wiped immediately by a decline in the value of the Mexican peso, which has the effect of making Mexico a little more competitive, at least until the tariffs come into effect. There could also be ramifications for the new trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. It will probably make the Mexican Congress a lot more wary about approving the accord. Migrants, most of whom say they are fleeing violence in Central American countries, travel through Mexico on their way to the US, where they hope to claim asylum. Mr Trump believes they should be stopped long before they reach the border, however. The agony over an American dream In pictures: : A river of people moving north Police do appear to have been cracking down, with400 migrants detained in the southern state of Chiapas in April. President LÃ³pez Obrador used the arrests to emphasise the country was not giving migrants ""free passage"". However, he added that it was out of concern for the migrants' safety over anything else. Mexico was the second largest supplier of goods to the US last year, with imports totalling $352bn (Â£275bn), according to Goldman Sachs. It is known for agricultural products like avocados and tequila, but the country is also a major manufacturing hub and home to many US companies. The country produces hundreds of thousands of cars every month, and is also home to technology and aerospace companies. It is one of the G20 economies. US firms Ford, General Motors, John Deere, IBM and Coca-Cola all operate in Mexico, as well as thousands of other multinationals. The president's statement comes amid a trade war with China. After complaining for years about the US trade deficit with China, Mr Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods coming from the country.

"A vote in Parliament to seek a delay to Brexit could only be ""a stay of execution"", according to business group the CBI. Industry bodies saw a glimmer of hope in the vote, but said the UK could still crash out of the EU with no deal. The British Chambers of Commerce said the vote ""leaves firms with no real clarity on the future."" The pound fell a third of a cent against the dollar immediately following the vote. The fall follows a climb to nine-month highs against the US dollar and a nearly two-year high against the euro after a vote on Wednesday. The House of Commons voted by a majority of 210 for Theresa May to request an extension to the two-year Brexit negotiation process, pushing the EU exit back from its current 29 March deadline, as long as the 27 other European Union states agree. The latest vote came after MPs rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement for the second time and then ruled out a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May will now renew efforts to get her Brexit deal approved by Parliament. She is putting pressure on MPs to back her by threatening a longer delay if they vote against her. However, business groups remained sceptical about the Brexit process. Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said: ""After an exasperating few days, Parliament's rejection of no deal and desire for an extension shows there is still some common sense in Westminster. But without a radically new approach, business fears this is simply a stay of execution."" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ""Britain stands on a knife edge. Parliament must put an end to this uncertainty."" ""Without definitive action by MPs in the next six days, we will see the UK crashing out of the EU on 29 March without a deal."" Brexit uncertaintyhas had mixed effects on the UK economy. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest an increase in manufacturing has largely been driven by companies speeding up production due to the risk of no-deal disruption. Business investment has been one casualty of the uncertainty, with a slow down in December recorded by theOffice for National Statistics,external. It said that investment had fallen quarter on quarter all through the year for the first time since the economic downturn of 2008 to 2009. The Bank of England ascribed the falls to ""rising uncertainty, mostly related to concerns around Brexit"". Business groups have beenincreasingly exasperatedby a lack of progress in Parliament on Brexit. Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""Once again, businesses are left waiting for Parliament to reach a consensus on the way forward and are losing faith that they will achieve this. ""In the meantime, firms are continuing to enact their contingency plans, anxiety amongst many businesses is rising, and customers are being lost. ""Businesses, jobs, investment and our communities are still firmly in the danger zone."" Catherine McGuinness, policy chair of The City of London Corporation said: ""The clock is ticking. Further delays will mean households and businesses remain hostage to the crippling economic uncertainty that has already plagued them since the referendum."" Tech industry body TechUK said ""We remain days away from a chaotic exit from the EU."" Pound jumps to nine-month high Business âexasperatedâ after Brexit vote How does Brexit affect the pound?

"The president of business organisation, the CBI, has said if politicians cannot ""get their act together"" on Brexit, then the only other option is to ""go back to the people"". John Allan stressed this was his personal view, not that of the CBI. Speaking to the BBC Mr Allan said it was ""astonishing"" that 27 European countries could agree a ""lot more readily"" than UK politicians. MPs should ""take a lesson"" from European solidarity, he said. Mr Allan, who is also chairman of Tesco and house builder Barrett, said the CBI did not have a position on a second or confirmatory referendum. ""But my personal view is if the politicians can't get their act together and get to an agreement the only other option is to go back to the people and have a second referendum to see whether people still feel the same way now that they did almost three years ago and resolve it that way. ""One way or the other we have just got  to break out of this impasse that we've got at the moment and get agreement. In a thinly veiled warning to MPs he said: ""It's astonishing that 27 European countries can agree on things a lot more readily than, frankly, our politicians. They should actually take a lesson from the solidarity the Europeans have shown over the last couple of years."" Mr Allan said politicians needed to put their ""prejudices behind them"", and try to find a settlement in an ""open-minded way"". ""I think it would be great to erase red lines and for people to start thinking about the national interest as opposed to party interests or, as I think some politicians have been doing, their own personal self-interests."" New Brexit deadline set for 31 October Business âdevastatedâ by Brexit vote The withdrawal agreement was ""non-negotiable"", he said, adding that MPs had three choices: First, a no deal, which would be ""extremely damaging to the UK economy. I can't believe any sane politicians would like to do that""; second, a compromise that a majority of MPs can agree on; third, revoke Article 50. ""Those are the only three options and it shouldn't take our politicians too long if they tackle it positively and sincerely to get to a solution to that."" Separately, the CBI issued an official response to the extension of Article 50 until 31 October, which was agreed in Brussels in the early hours of Thursday. Director General Carolyn Fairbairn, said the extension had averted ""an imminent economic crisis"". However, she added: ""It needs to mark a fresh start. More of the same will just mean more chaos this autumn. ""For the good of jobs and communities across the country, all political leaders must use the time well. Sincere cross-party collaboration must happen now to end this crisis."" Other business organisations also expressed their impatience with the failure to reach a Brexit agreement. The British Chambers of Commerce said businesses would be relieved by the extension. ""But their frustration with this seemingly endless political process is palpable,"" said director general Adam Marshall. ""This extension buys Parliament some time to come to a consensus, but they can't afford to squander it. Politicians must urgently agree on a way forward. It would be a disaster for business confidence and investment if a similar late-night drama is played out yet again in October."" At the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief executive Mike Hawes said it was ""utterly unacceptable"" that, more than two years since negotiations started, industry still did not know what the UK's relationship with the EU was going to be. Uncertainty had already caused serious damage, he said, with car plants on enforced shutdown, investment being cut and jobs being lost. ""This cannot go on. Government and Parliament must use this extension purposefully to take no deal off the table for good, and guarantee a positive long-term resolution that delivers frictionless trade. ""If they fail, we face yet another devastating no deal precipice on 31 October,"" he said.

"US President Donald Trump will touch down in the UK on Tuesday for a Nato summit - the second visit he has made to Britain this year. What will the security operation involve and what hardware and staff will the president bring with him? Whenever the US president arrives in the UK, a multi-million-pound security operation is brought into action. Mr Trump's three-day state visit in June, which involved more than 6,300 officers,cost the Metropolitan Police Â£3.4m,external, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act. A previous four-day working visit in 2018cost more than Â£14.2m. Here are some of the incredible vehicles and entourage the president could be bringing with him this time around. The president is likely to arrive in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Air Force One isn't actually a specific plane but instead refers to one of two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. Whichever of these aircraft the president is on board is referred to as Air Force One.,external Donald Trump confirms pre-election UK visit Trump visits US troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving With its advanced avionics and defences, Air Force One is classed as a military aircraft, designed to withstand an air attack. It can jam enemy radar and eject flares to throw heat-seeking missiles off course. It is also capable of refuelling midair, allowing it to fly for an unlimited time - crucial in an emergency. Air Force One is also equipped with secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre. There are 85 onboard telephones, a collection of two-way radios and computer connections. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the president, a medical facility with an operating table, a conference and dining room, two food preparation galleys that can feed 100 people at a time, and designated areas for the press, VIPs, security and secretarial staff. Several cargo planes, including C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft, carry the president's fleet of armoured vehicles and helicopters, usually landing in advance of his arrival. According to the Washington Post, the president is always accompanied by a military aide carrying an emergency satchel known as the ""football"", whichcontains the ""gold codes"" for launching the country's nuclear weapons and options for their use.,external The military aide must be nearby the president at all times, as the commander-in-chief is in possession of personal identification codes required to order a strike. They are carried on a plastic card known as the ""biscuit"", which can be read only when its opaque plastic covering is snapped in two and removed. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines and other security and communications vehicles, are transported ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. On the ground, the president travels in Cadillac One - a bullish, enhanced limousine dubbed the ""Beast"" for obvious reasons. The spare, decoy vehicle that accompanies it has the same Washington DC licence plates - 800-002. President Trump's generation of presidential car debuted in 2018 - with the US Secret Service tweeting ahead of the UN General Assembly that it was ""ready to roll"". But the service and vehicle's designers at General Motors have remained tight-lipped about the vehicle's special security features. Weighing in at about nine tonnes (20,000lb) - with an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows (which don't all open) - the car is reported to have tear gas grenade launchers, night vision cameras and a built-in satellite phone. Reinforced tyres surround steel-rimmed wheels, which mean the car can still be driven if the tyres are flat. The passenger cabin is said to be sealed, to fend off a chemical attack, while special foam would surround the fuel tank in case of impact. The vehicle also has extensive electronic equipment, Reuters reports. The car can hold at least seven people and has a wide range of medical supplies on board, including - NBC News suggests - a fridge full of blood matching the president's blood type, in case of emergency. But that's not all. When the president's on the move - you know about it. Other vehicles in the cavalcade include a parade of police outriders, secret service backup vehicles, counter-assault and hazardous attack teams, an armoured SUV communications vehicle, known as Roadrunner, medics and the press corps. The president could also bring a fleet of helicopters with him to the UK. Among them Marine One, which, like Air Force One, isn't a specific aircraft but instead refers to any US Marine Corps aircraft carrying the president. However, Marine One usually refers toone of the president's large Sikorsky VH-3D Sea Kings or the newer, smaller VH-60N White Hawks.,external The specially adapted helicopters are known as ""white tops"" because of their livery and are fitted with communications equipment, anti-missile defences and hardened hulls. It was Sea King versions that met the president at Stansted Airport and carried him to London, accompanied by tandem rotor chinook aircraft. As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys. It is also usually accompanied by two or threeOsprey MV-22 escort aircraft,,externalreferred to as ""green tops"". These tilt-rotor aircraft carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency. The Ospreys, capable of vertical landings and high-speed flight, were heard circling around London during President Trump's last visit to the UK in 2018. Staff are also transported around in CH-46s Sea Knight helicopters. British forces' aircraft are also likely to be part of the security operation during his visit. Some estimates put the number of people in Mr Trump's entourage for his UK visit in 2018 at 1,000, including more than 150 US secret service agents. Staff included military communications specialists, White House aides, a doctor, a chef and members of the media. Some 750 rooms were booked out to accommodate his entourage,external, according to Matt Chorley, of the Times newspaper. For his 2019 state visit, the president was reported to have booked a floor of the Corinthia Hotel in Westminster for his family and entourage. This time around Mr Trump will be in London and Hertfordshire between 2 and 4 December for the Nato summit. He will also attend a reception at Buckingham Palace on 3 December, which will be hosted by the Queen.

"Energy firms need to work harder to identify and protect poor and elderly customers, an independent report found. The study's authors were told of incidents in which vulnerable people were either left in the dark or facing bills running to thousands of pounds. In one case, a disabled woman with poor mental health had her electricity cut off. Energy UK, which commissioned the report, called for new rules of conduct. The trade association, whose members include energy suppliers and generators, set up the Commission for Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances last year, to look at how standards of care could be improved. In its report, the commission said energy companies, regulators and the government were failing to consistently meet the needs of customers. Energy prices to increase for millions What has happened to energy since privatisation? Commission chairman, the Labour peer Lord John Whitty, said: ""From listening to those on the front line, it's very clear that there are huge variations in the way energy suppliers deal with those in need."" He said those examples ranged from ""really good practice"" to cases of ""seriously insensitive"" treatment that ""fall far short of acceptable"". ""It can't be right that in such a highly-regulated industry, it can be a matter of chance how - or if - you get the support required."" Evidence provided to the report's authors by Citizens Advice included an account of one man, who was suffering with multiple mental health issues, facing a bill of Â£1,900. Citizens Advice said the man felt his energy provider, which was not named, was ""intimidating and harassing"" him to pay the bill even though he could not afford it. In another case, a pensioner was overcharged by Â£1,000 after her electricity meter broke. The Commission for Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances report called for an independently-monitored code of conduct advising companies on how to improve the way they deal with poor, elderly and disabled customers. It said energy companies needed to train staff to help them to identify and offer support to vulnerable households. Firms should also make sure customers can contact them on a free phone number and by letter, it said. The report went on to recommend that the regulator, Ofgem, should ensure energy firms had measures in place to protect those customers. In addition, the report's authors called on the government to introduce a state-funded scheme to help tackle fuel poverty. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""This Government strongly believes that everyone has the right to a reliable and reasonably-priced energy supply, and wants to protect consumers from rip-off deals. ""This is why we are making sure two million low-income households get money off their winter energy bills, as well as protecting 11 million households with our energy price cap. We are also giving extra money to pensioners through the winter and are committing Â£6 billion to upgrading the energy efficiency of the homes of the most vulnerable.""
