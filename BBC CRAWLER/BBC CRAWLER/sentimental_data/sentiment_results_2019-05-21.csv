"The sharing economy is now making its way into the fashion industry as Urban Outfitters looks to rent clothes to younger fashionistas. The retailer is launching an online subscription service allowing people to borrow six items to wear for a month before swapping them.

"Some of the world's biggest footwear firms are urging Donald Trump to end the US trade war with China, warning of a ""catastrophic"" effect on consumers. A letter signed by 173 companies, including Nike and Adidas, says the president's decision to raise import tariffs will affect the working class. They also warn that higher levies threaten the future of some businesses. Mr Trump says that the trade deficit with China hurts the US economy. The US presidentincreased levies on $200bn (Â£157.3bn) worth of Chinese imports into the USfrom 10% to 25% more than a week ago after Washington and Beijing failed to reach a deal on trade. China retaliated by announcing plans to raise levies on $60bn of US imports from 1 June. US-China trade war: What could Beijing do next? Who loses out in the US-China trade war? US firms fear 'retaliation' against Huawei curbs The footwear companies that signed the letter,,externalincluding Clarks, Dr Martens and Converse, say that while the average US tariff on footwear is 11.3%, in some cases it can reach as high as 67.5%. ""Adding a 25% tax increase on top of these tariffs would mean some working American families could pay a nearly 100% duty on their shoes,"" the companies wrote. ""This is unfathomable."" ""It is time to bring this trade war to an end,"" the firms urged. When he raised tariffs earlier this month, Mr Trump told companies that they could reduce costs by shifting production to the US.

However, the shoemakers and retailers say that while they have been moving their sourcing away from China: ""Footwear is a very capital-intensive industry, with years of planning required to make sourcing decisions, and companies cannot simply move factories to adjust to these changes."" On Tuesday, a top business lobby in China released a survey of its members that found just over 40% had relocated, or were considering moving production facilities, outside of China because of tariffs. The survey by the American Chambers of Commerce in China and Shanghai found one-third of respondents had delayed or cancelled investment decisions to cope with tariffs. A recent escalation in the trade conflict - including tighter restrictions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei - was creating fresh concerns for businesses in China, the group said. Huawei faces break with UK chip giant ARM Moving to Vietnam to avoid tariffs A quick guide to the US-China trade war Last week,the Trump administration added Huawei to its ""entity list"",external, which bans the company from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. Speaking to the BBC, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in China, Tim Stratford, said its members had ""real concerns"" about the fallout from the US action against Huawei. ""Particularly in the wake of the decision to put Huawei on the... entity list, there are concerns that the government of China may decide to retaliate against American companies,"" Mr Stratford said. This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets A survey by AmCham found that slightly more than 40% of its members had relocated, or were considering moving, outside of China because of tariffs. The group represents more than 900 US companies working in China. Plane manufacturer Boeing, pharmaceuticals firm Pfizer and soft drink giant Coca-Cola are among the US companies AmCham represents in China. Last year, Boeing opened its first completion plant for its 737 passenger plane in eastern China, near the city of Shanghai. Boeing's president of China, John Bruns, said he was ""nervous"" about the ""challenging environment"" caused by the tit-for-tat tariff war. Trump's tariffs and protectionism explained China and the US have been engaged in a fractious dispute over trade since the early days of Mr Trump's presidency. While campaigning for the presidential election in 2016, Mr Trump repeatedly accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. He threatened to apply tariffs, saying China's entry into the World Trade Organization had paved the way for the ""greatest jobs theft in history"". Coca-Cola is one of the US companies with a manufacturing base in China He also wants to cut America's trade deficit with China, which he says is hurting US manufacturing. Despite several rounds of talks, the world's two largest economies have failed to reach an agreement to end the trade war. Still, Beijing signalled some willingness to work with Washington to solve their trade dispute. No discussions have been scheduled since the last round of talks ended on 10 May. ""China remains ready to continue our talks with our American colleagues to reach a conclusion. Our door is still open,"" China's ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said on Fox News. The leaders of the US and China are also set to meet again at the G20 summit in Japan next month.

"Prime Minister Theresa May has unveiled what she called her new Brexit deal The backstop is perhaps the most controversial part of the prime minister's Brexit deal. It is an insurance arrangement designed toavoid a hard borderbetween Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic under all circumstances. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and leave Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Some MPs fear it could trap the UK in a customs union with the EU while Northern Ireland unionists think it would diminish their place in the union. Brexit: What happens next? Has time run out for another referendum? What is the Irish border backstop? In herspeech on Tuesday, the prime minister said she had listened to unionist concerns. But she was also clear that the backstop would be staying in the Withdrawal Agreement. Instead, she promised to give legal force to commitments that she has already made and proposed an enhanced role for the Northern Ireland Assembly - should it ever be reconstituted. Firstly, Theresa May said there would now be a legal commitment to find ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border by December 2020. Alternative arrangements basically mean technological solutions for the Irish border which would allow trade to flow across it unimpeded, even if the UK is outside the EU's customs union and single market. The Irish border has been one of the most contentious issues surrounding Brexit Brexit supporters see this as being key to avoiding the backstop. However, a government commitment to seek alternative arrangements by the end of 2020 is not new - it was laid out in ajoint statement with the EU in March,external. The prime minister also said that if the backstop was applied and Northern Ireland had to continue to follow EU rules, then the rest of the UK would voluntarily follow those same rules. That is also not new - it was part of apackage of commitments,externalannounced by the UK government almost six months ago. However, the government would claim that moving from political promises to legally binding commitments should be seen as significant. What was new in the prime minister's speech was the role that Stormont would play if the backstop was ever implemented. In January, the UK government said that if any new areas of Northern Ireland-specific alignment were to be added to the backstop, then it would ""seek the agreement of the Northern Ireland Assembly"". NI's devolved government collapsed in January 2017 following a bitter dispute between Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP That stopped well short of a Stormont veto - Westminster was only required to seek agreement, not to get it. This has now been toughened up. The prime minister said: ""The Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to give their consent on a cross-community basis for new regulations which are added to the backstop."" The words ""cross-community basis"" are important as it means that a simple majority vote of the assembly would not be enough. It is possible that unionists, who dislike the very concept of the backstop, could use a blocking mechanism known as the petition of concern. What would happen if Stormont did veto any addition to the backstop is not entirely clear. All we can say for sure is that there is a mechanism in the Withdrawal Agreement that ultimately allows the EU to take ""appropriate remedial measures"" if the UK does not update the backstop. There is also the question of how to define a new regulation - under the Withdrawal Agreement a regulation is not new if it is replacing or amending an existing regulation. So it is likely that Stormont would only, very rarely, get an opportunity to wield its veto. 'One last chance to deliver Brexit' Is May's 'new' Brexit deal actually new? Has time run out for another referendum? What happens after Brexit? What trade deals has the UK done so far? What are the Brexit backstop options?

"This video can not be played Contaminated blood inquiry: 'It messes with your head' A man who was infected by contaminated blood has told a public inquiry of a life of fear, paranoia and anger. Hearings into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"" opened in Belfast on Tuesday. An estimated 4,000 people across the UK were infected and thousands are thought to have died. With allegations of a cover-up, no-one in government or the NHS has been held to account. Paul Kirkpatrick from Londonderry, who has haemophilia, was speaking for the first time about his experience. Lives have been ruined, say victims Blood inquiry seeks answers at last Tainted love: One woman's story Mr Kirkpatrick, who is in his fifties, said he had lived a life being told he was a public health risk and had been paranoid that his children would be affected. As a result of the infection he contracted Hepatitis B and C. Giving evidence, he said he had felt unclean and only now as a result of the inquiry had he been offered counselling. Over the past three decades, he said he had batted away various ""clouds"", including potential cancer, CJD, AIDS, never knowing what the health service would throw at him next. He described the ""shocking, confused process of passing on life-threatening information to patients"" including himself, ""where often information is passed on to patients because they ticked a box"" Mr Kirkpatrick said this should never be allowed to happen again. At the inquiry, Paul Kirkpatrick spoke of how the infection affected his family and his children. He said: ""My wife would follow me round the house sterilising everything to make sure there was no risk to the kids."" He added that he would not touch dummies, prepare food or allow the children to get into his bed when he had open wounds. Mr Kirkpatrick said: ""Like any parent you want to protect your kids first and foremost and both of us did that as best we could. There was fear they would be contaminated in some fashion."" Witnesses from Northern Ireland are speaking at the inquiry this week The first UK-wide public inquiry into the scandalis being led by Sir Brian Langstaff, who was appointed in February 2018, and is looking at why thousands of people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. Some people have waited 30 years for a full public inquiry. Speaking at the start of proceedings on Tuesday, Sir Brian said the inquiry had visited Belfast ""as a matter of principle"", adding that it puts people first and that he was in the city to listen. Each of the UK nations has its own financial support scheme for infected patients. There have been complaints that victims of the contaminated blood scandal in England and Scotlandare receiving more financial help than those in Wales and Northern Ireland. The problem dates back to the 1970s when imported blood-clotting products derived from blood plasma caused haemophiliacs and others to be infected with HIV and hepatitis. Warnings raised as early as 1974 were ignored - now patients want to know who within the NHS and the government knew what and when. Christina McLaughlin's brother Seamus Conway, who was 45, died last year - he had haemophilia, which affects the blood's ability to clot. Seamus Conway died aged 45 last year from haemophilia His family believes his eventual liver cancer diagnosis was a direct result of having hepatitis after he was given infected blood products as a child. Ms McLaughlin is due to give evidence to the inquiry on Thursday and said she had every faith in its chairman. She told BBC News NI that although previous attempts at inquiries were not successful, Sir Brian had said he would ""get to the truth and leave no stone unturned"". Ms McLaughlin's sister, Patricia Kelly, said she hoped lessons would be learned. ""This inquiry will get people some kind of closure but it won't bring back their family members, their sisters or brothers, their mothers or fathers,"" said Mrs Kelly. ""It's horrendous, but at least people will get a closure."" About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then, patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors and concentrating it. People who had blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s, the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991. And by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. This is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to compel witnesses to testify or require the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion.

"Jordan Adlard Rogers said he would trade anything to go back and know his father while he was alive A former care worker has inherited a manor house after a DNA test proved he was the heir to a country estate. Jordan Adlard Rogers, 31, only found out his father was Charles Rogers after his death in 2018,Cornwall Live reported,external. Mr Rogers' family had lived in the 1,536-acre Penrose Estate between Helston and Porthleven for generations. The family gifted the estate to the National Trust in 1974 in exchange for a 1,000-year lease to live there. Mr Adlard Rogers said he knew from the age of eight that Mr Rogers may be his father and made several unsuccessful attempts to get a DNA test done. He said after his father died he was finally able to get the test completed. The striking resemblance between the pair can be seen clearly in a photograph of Charles Rogers when he was younger An inquest last week heard Mr Rogers spent 40 years living as a drug addict and a recluse before dying in his car following an overdose on a heroin substitute.

"The pound has fallen to its lowest level for five months just as many UK holidaymakers get ready to head off for the late-May half-term break. Against the US dollar, thepound fell below $1.27for the first time since January on Tuesday. It alsofell early in the day against the euro. But it picked up again later in the day in a sign of its current volatility. Cabinet backing for Prime Minister Theresa May's latest Brexit plan led to the rebound. Currency experts say Brexit uncertainty and the US-China trade war have both contributed to the pound's recent fall. Sterling had gained some ground in recent months, but in recent days rates have fallen back to the kind of levels seen during the Christmas holidays. It is a very different picture from March 2008, when the pound was briefly worth more than $2. Live updates: The pound and today's other business stories Holidaymakers heading off for an early summer break in Europe or the US may be saving money by avoiding the even higher costs of travelling in July and August. However, they are finding that their money will not go as far as it did a few years ago. Anyone leaving it to the last minute and changing money at the airport will always get the worst rates. At some airports, they will find an exchange rate little better than parity between the pound and the euro. James Hickman, chief commercial officer at currency traders FairFx, said that the best rates were given to those who ordered their holiday money ahead. He suggested that would also be a good plan for anyone thinking about their holiday money for later this summer. At present, the best rates on pre-loaded currency cards sees a pound buy just over $1.27 and just over â¬1.13. For those collecting from an exchange bureau, the best deals will see the pound get slightly less than $1.26 and just under â¬1.13. The Post Office - the most popular bureau for UK holidaymakers - sees anyone changing more than Â£400 receiving slightly over $1.24 and just over â¬1.11 for their pound. The recent drop in the value of the pound has come amid speculation over the future of Brexit. ""When sentiment moves towards a higher likelihood of a hard Brexit, then we see a fall in the pound,"" Mr Hickman said. The reverse is also true, shown by the rebound after thecabinet gave its backing to Mrs May's planfor her Withdrawal Agreement Bill, including compromises intended to attract the support of Labour MPs. Sterling is also affected indirectly by the continuingtrade war between the US and China. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, said the pound was ""suffering from the renewed uncertainty of Brexit, while investors flood to the relatively safer US dollar amidst the ongoing trade war"". ""Looking forward, headwinds look stronger than tailwinds for the pound, particularly with another Brexit vote not set to take place for a few weeks yet. But perhaps the only real hope would come from Donald Trump pressing the pause button with regards to the trade war,"" he added. Alana Parsons, from foreign exchange firm Caxton, said: ""Getting the most value for your travel money can be tricky, but not if we spend as much time planning our finances as we do researching our holiday destinations.""

"The restaurant sector is hardly sizzling at the moment. Last month burger chain Byron agreed a rescue plan with lenders and landlords which could lead to the closure of up to 20 restaurants. Also in January, Jamie Oliver's restaurant group said 12 of its 37 outlets would shut their doors -the second wave of closuresin the space of a year. And since the beginning of 2015, shares in the Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie and Bennys and Garfunkels, have lost two thirds of their value. So what's causing the gloom? Serial entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who helped expand Pizza Express in the 1990s, says the whole of the food sector in the UK is under pressure at the moment. Businesses in the sector are having to pay the new living wage, the apprenticeship levy, and deal with ""upwards-only rent reviews"", he says. Mr Johnson, whoamong his many business interests,externalis the chairman of casual-dining chain 3Sixty Restaurants, adds that ""food and ingredients costs are affecting the whole eating-out market"". That is certainly the case for Jamie's Italian, which said the rising price of ingredients was partly behind its troubles. It buys many ingredients from Italy and they have become more expensive due to the slide in the value of the pound since Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Roger Tejwani, head of consumer sector at stockbrokers Finncap, says there are just too many restaurants. ""There is too much capacity in the market with consumers having a considerable amount of choice,"" he says. He says there needs to be a big decrease in the number of outlets some chains have. Customers have so much choice that there is little loyalty, and social media lets people be more aware of a wider range of food, Mr Tejwani says. Fast-casual restaurant firms have to work hard to persuade people to spend - especially as people are already spending more on experiences. ""They are all competing against each other and other forms of entertainment,"" he says. So to win customers restaurant chains have had to discount, making life even tougher. Mr Tejwani argues that restaurants need to move with the times and start taking account of consumer technology. Younger customers expect to be able to document what they are doing and ""want to be seen in a cool place"", which means restaurants have to be ""Instagrammable"", he says. Creating that cool environment will require investment, and there's less of that to go around, says Mr Johnson. ""The banks are pulling in debt lines where they can,"" he says, while private equity is also getting harder to come by. Uncertainties caused by the Brexit process arehaving an impact on the casual dining sector as a whole,external, according to consultancy firm Deloitte. Consumer confidence steadily fell throughout 2017, putting a squeeze on spending on non-essential items, says Deloitte. ""2018 is going to be a challenging year for restaurants, and they will need a tightly-run ship to survive,"" says Sarah Humphreys, lead partner for casual dining at Deloitte. ""Consumer tastes such as healthy eating, sustainable food sourcing and informal or experiential dining should not be ignored. ""Operators should consider how adaptable their models are to changing tastes, or else face the risk of missing out,"" she says. Consumer spending in general took a hit in 2017, having its worst year since 2012,according to payments processor Visa,external. That's partly because wages have been rising at a slower pace than inflation, leaving consumers worse off. Taking out Food delivery firms such as Just Eat and Deliveroo are a double-edged sword for the sector. They can increase sales, and on balance, they increase profit, says Ms Humphreys. But they can put pressure on restaurants if there's not enough staff to fill the takeaway orders and keep the customers in the restaurant happy, says Mr Tejwani. There are other downsides. Food delivery firms charge a high commission for delivery, and also restaurants lose the opportunity to sell profitable extras like drinks. However, Luke Johnson says that while the market is ""tough"" at the moment, he remains hopeful for the sector. ""Generally speaking the industry remains in reasonable health â¦ I'm sure it will remain profitable in five to ten years time.""

"Theresa May is setting out the details of a series of compromises designed to try and win the support of Labour MPs for her Brexit plan. The cabinet earlier agreed the idea of a temporary customs relationship until the next general election, and measures on the environment and workers' rights. These will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, to be put to a vote in the Commons in early June. The SNP and some Tory Brexiteers have already said they will vote against. The PM briefed MPs and ministers on the contents of the speech - entitled ""A new Brexit deal - seeking common ground in Parliament"" - beforehand. Allow Twitter content?

The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is legislation required to bring the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU into British law. MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement three times, and talks with Labour on finding a compromise deal acceptable to their MPs broke down last week. Heseltine loses Tory whip over EU vote PM plans 'bold offer' to get support for deal Tory MPs launch rival campaign groups Downing Street said there was a ""shared determination"" in cabinet to find a way of passing the legislation although it conceded ""strong opinions"" had been aired on how best to do this. At the meeting, Mrs May told her ministers: ""The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is the vehicle which gets the UK out of the EU and it is vital to find a way to get it over the line."" No 10 said the bill, when it was published, would contain ""some significant new aspects"". International Development Secretary Rory Stewart suggested on Sunday that the government and Labour were ""half an inch apart"" on key issues and ""sensible"" Labour MPs could be won round. But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said she believed her colleagues would vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill as she had heard there was ""no radical difference"" in what was being offered. The easy bit? Theresa May is hoping to win over enough Labour MPs to counteract Tory rebellion For Theresa May getting her cabinet behind her plan for another push towards a Brexit deal was the easy bit. Ministers agreed legislation to deliver Brexit should be the vehicle for compromises to bring enough Labour MPs on board to counteract the still strong rebellion by those on her own side. The plan supersedes the idea of so-calledindicative votesin the Commons on Brexit options. The problem is that opposition on the Conservative side has probably hardened, not softened, since her last failed attempt. The hope in Downing Street is that those wanting another referendum or a form of Brexit that keeps us closer to the EU may back this bill and try and get their way during later detailed debate. The emphasis now is on hope and perhaps not very much of it. Ms Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today thatShe said Labour was still pushing for a customs unionwith the EU and close alignment with the single market after Brexit. However, Commons leader and Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom said she would back the bill ""so long as it continues to be leaving the European Union"", which she defined as being outside both of those structures. She also stressed the need to be prepared for a no-deal Brexit, telling Today: ""What I do think is that for any negotiation to succeed, you have to be prepared to walk away."" Remaining within a customs union would avoid the need for tariffs (taxes) to be imposed on goods moving between the UK and the EU, but many Brexiteers feel it would also prevent Britain making the clean break from Brussels that they want. If the bill passes its first parliamentary hurdle - known as second reading - in early June, MPs will then have an opportunity to propose changes as they examine it in detail. It is thought some Labour MPs who oppose Brexit and want another referendum might be tempted to back the bill in the hope of inserting another public vote into it later on. However, several Tories - including former Brexit Secretary David Davis - have said they will vote against the bill at the first opportunity precisely to stop this happening. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? What happens next? Ex-minister Mark Francois, a vocal critic of the prime minister, said if the vote was held today the bill would be defeated by a huge margin. He told the BBC that MPs who had backed the PM in the past would be ""more reluctant"" to do so if the party got a drubbing in the European elections and she would have to rely on Labour votes to get her way. ""Unless she is rescued by a Marxist, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. Mr Francois dismissed comments to be made later by Philip Hammond, who will warn prospective Conservative leadership contenders against ""hijacking"" Brexit by ""knowingly inflicting"" a damaging no-deal exit on the economy. The chancellor will tell business leaders that there is ""no mandate"" for such a no-deal exit and that even with ""all the preparation in the world"" it would be highly damaging. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? Mr Francois said the chancellor was a ""Remain fanatic"" and he suggested the public increasingly backed leaving with a deal andtrading with the EU using World Trade Organization rules. On Sunday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said that was now""the only way the democratic will of the people can be delivered"". The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back when MPs failed to approve Mrs May's deal. When the new deadline was announced, the government said it would ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning.

"Mr Oliver shot to fame 20 years ago Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has said he is ""devastated"" after his restaurant group went into administration, with 1,000 jobs being lost. The group, which includes the Jamie's Italian chain, Barbecoa and Fifteen, has appointed KPMG as administrators. Twenty two of the 25 restaurants in Jamie Oliver's restaurant group have now closed. Mr Oliver, who put in Â£4m cash this year, said: ""I appreciate how difficult this is for everyone affected."" Two Jamie's Italian restaurants and Jamie Oliver's Diner at Gatwick Airport will continue to trade in the short term while the administrators explore options for the outlets. ""The group had recently undertaken a process to secure additional investment into the business and, since the beginning of this year, Jamie Oliver has made available additional funds of Â£4m to support the fundraising,"" said the administrators in a statement. ""However, with no suitable investment forthcoming and in light of the very difficult current trading environment, the directors resolved to appoint administrators."" Jamie Oliver's Fifteen Cornwall at Watergate Bay, which operates under a franchise, is unaffected.  The international restaurants trading as Jamie's Italian, Jamie's Pizzeria and Jamie's Deli will also continue to trade as normal. Mr Oliver tweeted that: ""I'm devastated that our much-loved UK restaurants have gone into administration."" And in a statement he added: ""I would also like to thank all the customers who have enjoyed and supported us over the last decade, it's been a real pleasure serving you. ""We launched Jamie's Italian in 2008 with the intention of positively disrupting mid-market dining in the UK High Street, with great value and much higher quality ingredients, best-in-class animal welfare standards and an amazing team who shared my passion for great food and service. And we did exactly that."" This video can not be played Jamie Oliver restaurant worker 'devastated' Notices have appeared in the windows of the 22 branches which have already closed. The Unite union said the development was a ""devastating blow for the chain's hardworking and loyal workforce"". ""Restaurants are not being helped by the current economic uncertainty, although those businesses like Jamie Oliver's that dashed for expansion in recent years seem particularly precarious.  As ever, it is the workers at the restaurant and in the supply chain who bear the heavy cost of boardroom decisions."" The union also asked for assurances that staff will be ""protected and paid all the money they're owed, including wages, holiday and redundancy"". One Jamie's Italian worker in Birmingham, Valentine Balbinot, said: ""It was just so devastating, we were not expecting this... it is really brutal."" Mr Oliver is known for his Naked Chef books and TV shows, broadcast in dozens of countries, after first being shown in the UK 20 years ago. He has also campaigned for healthier eating, including in school meals. His chain is the latest victim of a tough trading environment on the UK High Street. Earlier this year, cafe chain Patisserie Valerie fell into administration, and 70 outlets closed, with the loss of 920 jobs, although 96 shops were saved. Other mid-market chains that have struggled in recent years have included Byron Burger, Prezzo and Carluccio's. Mr Oliver's business has faced difficulties over the past two years, with a number of Jamie's Italian and Barbecoa restaurants shutting. Closed notices have been posted on a number of outlets, including Jamie's in Glasgow In 2017, he closed the last of his Union Jacks restaurants and also shut his magazine Jamie, which had been running for almost 10 years. In December of that year the chef also put Â£3m of his own money into his restaurant businesses. Simon Mydlowski, a partner at law firm Gordons and an expert in the hospitality industry, said Jamie's had failed to keep up with changing trends. ""To be successful in this sector you have to be constantly evolving - from the menus and the drinks choice, to the way you engage with customers."" ""Faced with higher rent, rising food prices and increased competition, restaurants need a point of difference - it's no coincidence that smaller brands with the freedom and flexibility to keep things fresh are currently the ones performing well.""

"This video can not be played Facial recognition: 'Law has not caught up with technology' The first major legal challenge to police use of automated facial recognition surveillance has begun in Cardiff today. Ed Bridges, whose image was taken while he was shopping, says weak regulation means AFR breaches human rights. The civil rights group Liberty says current use of the tool is equivalent to the unregulated taking of DNA or fingerprints without consent. South Wales Police defends the tool but has not commented on the case. In December 2017, Mr Bridges was having a perfectly normal day. ""I popped out of the office to do a bit of Christmas shopping and on the main pedestrian shopping street in Cardiff, there was a police van,"" he told BBC News. ""By the time I was close enough to see the words 'automatic facial recognition' on the van, I had already had my data captured by it. ""That struck me as quite a fundamental invasion of my privacy."" The case could provide crucial guidance on the lawful use of facial technology. Newsbeat: What is Automated Facial Recognition? Face recognition police tools 'staggeringly inaccurate' 2,000 wrongly matched with criminals at Champions League It is a far more powerful policing tool than traditional CCTV - as the cameras take a biometric map, creating a numerical code of the faces of each person who passes the camera. These biometric maps are uniquely identifiable to the individual. ""It is just like taking people's DNA or fingerprints, without their knowledge or their consent,"" said Megan Goulding, a lawyer from the civil liberties group Liberty which is supporting Mr Bridges. However, unlike DNA or fingerprints, there is no specific regulation governing how police use facial recognition or manage the data gathered. Liberty argues that even if there were regulations, facial recognition breaches human rights and should not be used. South Wales Police is the biggest user of facial recognition technology The tool allows the facial images of vast numbers of people to be scanned in public places such as streets, shopping centres, football crowds and music events. The captured images are then compared with images on police ""watch lists"" to see if they match. ""If there are hundreds of people walking the streets who should be in prison because there are outstanding warrants for their arrest, or dangerous criminals bent on harming others in public places, the proper use of AFR has a vital policing role,"" said Chris Phillips, former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office. ""The police need guidance to ensure this vital anti-crime tool is used lawfully."" Facial recognition's usefulness for spotting, for example, terrorist suspects and preventing atrocities is clear but Liberty says the technology is being used for much more mundane policing, such as catching pickpockets. Liberty also says: images of people on watch lists can come from anywhere police have not ruled out taking watch list images from social media some lists include people not wanted for any crime AFR has been used to look for people with mental health conditions Mr Bridges had his image captured by facial recognition for a second time at a peaceful protest against the arms trade. His legal challenge argues the use of the tool breached his human right to privacy as well as data protection and equality laws. Three UK police forces have used facial recognition in public spaces since June 2015: South Wales Police Metropolitan Police Leicestershire Police Liberty believes South Wales Police has used facial recognition the most of the three forces, at about 50 deployments, including during the policing of the Champions League final in Cardiff in June 2017, where it emerged that, of the 2,470 potential matches made, 92% (2,297) were wrong. South Wales Police has gone to considerable lengthsto explain its use of facial recognition,externaland last year described it as ""lawful and proportionate"". When thetechnology was tested recently in London, one man was fined for a public order offence. BBC News alsoreported that at least three chances to assess how well the systems dealt with ethnicity had been missedby police over five years. Civil liberties groups say studies have shown facial recognition discriminates against women and those from ethnic minorities, because it disproportionately misidentifies those people. ""If you are a woman or from an ethnic minority and you walk past the camera, you are more likely to be identified as someone on a watch list, even if you are not,"" said Ms Goulding. ""That means you are more likely to be stopped and interrogated by the police. ""This is another tool by which social bias will be entrenched and communities who are already over-policed simply get over-policed further."" Liberty says the risk of false-positive matches of women and ethnic minorities has the potential to change the nature of public spaces. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding says recent evidence suggests AFR misidentifies women and ethnic minorities Last week San Francisco becamethe first US city to ban the use of the technology, following fears about its reliability and infringement of people's liberty and privacy. The information commissioner and the surveillance camera commissioner have both become involved in Mr Bridges's case, as has the Home Office, indicating the high level of interest and concern about the parameters within which facial recognition can lawfully operate. The case is expected to last three days, with judgment reserved to a later time.

"The remains of Niki Lauda's Ferrari after a horrific accident during the German Grand Prix in 1976 Three-time Formula 1 world champion Niki Lauda produced the ""most courageous act of any sportsman"" in returning to racing so soon after a horrific crash, says former team-mate John Watson. Austrian Lauda, who won the drivers championship in 1975, 1977 and 1984, died aged 70 on Monday. He almost died following a crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. Despite suffering severe burns and inhaling hot toxic fumes, he resumed racing 40 days later. F1 legend Lauda dies aged 70 Lauda obituary: 'A remarkable life lived in Technicolor' Listen: Lauda discusses Nurburgring crash World champion Lewis Hamilton said he was ""struggling to believe you are gone"". The Briton addedon Twitter:,external""I will miss our conversations, our laughs, the big hugs after winning races together. God rest your soul. ""Thank you for being a bright light in my life. I'll always be here for your family should they ever need me. Love you man."" Watson was a team-mate of Lauda at Brabham and McLaren in the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the first people to attend to him after the crash. ""I came around shortly after the accident and the other drivers that were there managed to get him out of the cockpit and walked him away,"" Watson told the BBC. ""We lay him down and I put his head in my lap and he was able to communicate. ""Nobody realised the actual damage to Niki. The real danger he was in was not from the superficial injuries that we could see but from the deeper injury which was that to his lung. ""He'd suffered inhalation of toxic fumes from the burning fibreglass and we didn't appreciate the severity of the injury that he'd suffered. ""It was only after two or three days that the story came out that it was the lung damage that was the injury putting his life in danger. ""Racing 40 days after that accident was the most courageous act of any sportsman I've ever seen in my life."" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Watson, 73, added: ""What was really more remarkable was the speed of his recovery and what he was able to achieve. ""His courage, his commitment, focus, determination and bloody-mindedness. All the naysayers were saying that 'Lauda is finished' but his health and condition at Monza was just remarkable. ""He was winning the world title in 1976 by a country mile up to that accident and it was this year where there was this battle between Niki and James Hunt, so there was a lot of motivation to get back into the car."" Three-time world championSir Jackie Stewarttold BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""During that accident he died twice and was resuscitated. ""Recovering from that accident, he came to Monza [for the Italian Grand Prix], which I was doing commentary for. He shouldn't have been there but wanted to get back to racing. ""I will never forget him putting his helmet on and he was suffering so much pain. When he came out from driving at the end I was there and the blood was running down out of his helmet. ""It's very sad news. I've known Niki for a long time and he was just entering grand prix racing when I was retiring. We had a season together. He always had great integrity and was one the smoothest, best drivers I've ever seen."" Actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger paid tribute to his 'dear friend' Niki Lauda As non-executive chairman of Mercedes, Lauda helped them win both the drivers' and constructors' title in each of the past five seasons.

""Niki will always remain one of the greatest legends of our sport - he combined heroism, humanity and honesty inside and outside the cockpit. ""His passing leaves a void in Formula 1. We haven't just lost a hero who staged the most remarkable comeback ever seen, but also a man who brought precious clarity and candour to modern Formula 1. He will be greatly missed as our voice of common sense. ""Our Mercedes team has also lost a guiding light. ""As a team-mate over the past six and a half years, Niki was always brutally honest - and utterly loyal. It was a privilege to count him among our team and moving to witness just how much it meant to him to be part of the team's success.""

On Tuesday, Bruhl paid tribute to Lauda andwrote on Instagram:,external""The bravest man, I've ever met, not only because he was an F1 world champion in the crazy '70s and had the most incredible comeback in sport's history, but also because of how he treated people.

"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is closing six of his 42 UK Jamie's Italian restaurants. The Aberdeen, Cheltenham, Exeter, Tunbridge Wells and in London, the Ludgate and Richmond outlets are all scheduled to close soon. The move will affect 120 staff, whom the company said it would try to place in other parts of the chain. The company said that the market was ""tough"" and the uncertainties caused by Brexit had intensified the pressures. The price of ingredients bought in Italy has gone up because of the fall in the value of the pound against the euro since the vote to leave the EU. Chief executive Simon Blagden said: ""As every restaurant owner knows, this is a tough market and, post-Brexit, the pressures and unknowns have made it even harder."" He said each restaurant in the chain needed to attract 3,000 diners a week to be profitable. Jamie's Italian has 28 overseas outlets and the company also said it planned to open another 22 outside the UK. Last year, Jamie Oliver said he would buy back the Jamie's Italian restaurants business in Australia. He moved after Keystone Group, which ran the operation, went into receivership and put the franchise up for sale.

"This video can not be played In Scunthorpe, residents fear the town will ""shut down"" if British Steel collapses Labour has urged the government to nationalise British Steel in order to protect jobs and the steel industry. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the collapse of British Steel would have a ""devastating impact"" on Scunthorpe. British Steel is on the verge of administration as it continues to lobby for government backing, sources say. The UK's second-biggest steel maker had been trying to secure Â£75m in financial support to help it to address ""Brexit-related issues"". If the firm does not get the cash it would put 5,000 jobs at risk and endanger 20,000 in the supply chain. ""If an agreement cannot be struck with British Steel, the government must act to take a public stake in the company to secure the long term future of the steelworks and protect peoples' livelihoods and communities,"" said Mr Corbyn. The government said it would leave ""no stone unturned"" in its support for the steel industry. British Steel's main plant is at Scunthorpe, but it also has a site in Teesside. Are you a British Steel worker? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external What are the EU rules about state aid? Speaking in the House of Commons, Business Minister Andrew Stephenson said: ""I can reassure the House that, subject to strict legal bounds, the government will leave no stone unturned in its support for the steel industry."" UK Steel's director general, Gareth Stace, said: ""The statement from the business minister today provided a glimmer of hope for the Scunthorpe site. ""This does provide some breathing space for the company, its employees, and the wider steel sector, providing a potential route towards a stable and sustainable future."" The request for emergency financial support from the government is understood to have been reduced from Â£75m to about Â£30m. In April, British Steel borrowed Â£100m from the government to enable it to pay an EU carbon bill, so it could avoid a steep fine. Reports have said that British Steel shareholder Greybull Capital and lenders have agreed to pump new money into the firm. However, unless a deal is reached by Tuesday afternoon, the firm could go into administration within 48 hours. EY would be expected to be appointed as administrators on Wednesday. If a company goes into administration, then the insolvency practitioners appointed to run the business will try to rescue it by selling it, or parts of it, as a going concern. But if that is not possible it will be liquidated, meaning that it will be closed down and its saleable assets will be sold. For staff in Scunthorpe, it's a waiting game. This video can not be played 'They're all quite scared' The BBC's consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith spoke to a British Steel staff member who was too worried to be named. He said that two of his colleagues have just got mortgages and are petrified they won't be able to make payments. News that the company is in trouble isn't a surprise though, as there are piles of finished steel on the factory floor, with no customers to send it to, he said. ""We're doing a bit at work, but it's mostly sitting around doing nothing as the orders just aren't there"". He said staff feel let down by the owners. ""They've just stripped this company and now they're putting nothing back. Our only hope is a government bailout, but this time it feels different. I don't think they'll save us."" Sources close to Greybull Capital say its lenders have told them that unless they can secure a Â£30m lifeline they will pull the plug on British Steel tomorrow. The timing of this could hardly be worse for the government coming as it does right before the European elections. Cynics might suggest that Greybull is not unhappy with the timescale of the plea. Business Secretary Greg Clark has avery tough decision, as I've already written. The question may be whether the government can put this down to Brexit mitigation and tap the same source of contingency funds Chris Grayling disastrously used to procure emergency ferry capacity. At least there would be an immediate dividend - to stave off the collapse of a firm that employs 4,500 people directly and has 20,000 more at risk in the supply chain. However, having already lent Â£100m to cover a genuinely Brexit-related carbon emissions bill - further assistance to a private company struggling in a deeply challenged industry may be a precedent they would rather not set. Last Thursday, British Steel said it had the backing of shareholders and lenders and that operations were continuing as usual while it sought a ""permanent solution"" from the government to its financial troubles. It is understood that along with administration, nationalisation or a management buyout are being discussed as fall-back options for the company. British Steel's troubles have been linked to a slump in orders from European customers âdue to uncertainty over the Brexit process. The firm has also been struggling with the weakness of the pound since the EU referendum in June 2016 and the escalating trade US-China trade war. One of its biggest customers is Network Rail, 95% of whose rails are supplied by British Steel's Scunthorpe plant. In 2007, India's Tata conglomerate entered the UK steel market after it bought the Anglo Dutch group, Corus. In 2010, the business was renamed Tata Steel Europe. After a difficult few years, Tata sold the Scunthorpe long products division to private equity firm Greybull Capital for a nominal Â£1. Greybull's rescue came during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016 and saved more than 4,000 jobs. It then rebranded the company as British Steel and recently returned it to profit. On Monday, the government, trade unions and employers signed a UK Steel Charter in Parliament.  The charter calls on the government and large companies to buy British to boost UK industry.

"""I know he wanted to kill me,"" Robert Piersant told the court about his attacker An American tourist who was stabbed in the head, face and back in the London Bridge attack has paid tribute to those who saved him after ""flatlining twice"". Speaking at the inquests into deaths of eight victims, Robert Piersant singled out a Metropolitan Police officer. He said PC Sam Philpot ""never left my side"" after the attack on 3 June 2017. He told the Old Bailey: ""The doctors did great things putting me back together but if it wasn't for that PC I would not have got to the hospital."" London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Mr Piersant and his wife Joyce, who was stabbed but also survived, were among the 48 people injured when Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, launched a van and knife attack in 2017. The first 10 days of the inquests focused on the eight people killed in the first few minutes of the attack. The hearing has now begun to look into the next phase of the attack - as Redouane, Butt and Zaghba continued stabbing people in bars, restaurants and on streets in the Borough Market area. Returning to London to give evidence at the inquests, Mr Piersant explained that when he was first approached by an attacker, he initially thought he had been barged into by a drunk - but then he saw a knife. ""As I pushed him back, I'm looking at him. He started looking back towards me. He had an angry look,"" he said. ""When he took a step towards me, I took a step back. That's when I felt something at my left waist and that's when I blacked out."" Mr Piersant, from Colorado Springs, was visiting his daughter and her husband in London that summer and had been to dinner that evening with his wife and his son. by Alice Evans, BBC News, at the inquests Joyce Piersant said when she first glimpsed the pink knife in the hand of one of the attackers, she thought the bright colour meant it was just a toy. The court held its breath as her statement described two of the men landing blows on her husband, Robert, before one of them rounded on her. ''[The knifeman] looked me in the eye and hesitated. I would describe him as having questioning eyes,'' her statement said. He then stabbed her in the throat. ''I know he wanted to kill me. I can't explain why... it was in his eyes,'' she recalled. The couple, who had spent the day sightseeing around the capital, survived the attack. The packed public gallery listened in stunned silence as Mr Piersant described the moment he realised he had no pulse after being stabbed in the back and the head. After the judge thanked Mr Piersant for his evidence, the survivor asked to say one more thing. His voice catching with emotion, he thanked the medics and police officers who worked to revive him - including one officer who threw himself across Mr Piersant when they heard bursts of gunfire. The hearing was told that Mr Piersant was taken to hospital in an ambulance, but he did not have a pulse. ""I remember that very vividly, just like you hear on TV. I didn't have a pulse, I didn't have breaths. I recall flatlining twice,"" he said. The court also heard from Gerard Vowls, who chased after the attackers throwing a chair, pint glasses and bottles. Mr Vowls said he had been watching the Champions League final earlier in the evening when he saw a young woman being stabbed repeatedly by the three terrorists, who had an expression of ""hatred"". Gerard Vowls threw a chair, pint glasses and bottles at the attackers He broke down in court as he recalled her pleas for help. ""That is the worst part. That's what gives me the nightmares. She kept saying, 'help, help me',"" he said. ""I heard one of them say 'This is for Allah'."" Mr Vowls said he ran after the attackers, swearing at them, calling them ""cowards"" and saying: ""Come and get me."" ""I don't think they were taking any notice of me,"" he said, describing the attackers as ""jogging left and right"" looking for victims. Mr Vowls told the court he hoped to distract the men away from the people they were attacking and lure them into an area where they could be shot by armed police. CCTV images showed him picking up a chair and throwing it at Butt, and he said he later grabbed pint glasses and bottles from outside the Wheatsheaf pub, shouting ""terrorist cowards"" as he threw them. His makeshift weapons missed. Instead, he tried to warn people inside the Black and Blue restaurant by gesturing through the glass front, but he said at least two people were stabbed when the attackers went inside. Mr Vowls went to look for police help. But then he heard the shots from police marksmen and saw the three attackers lying dead. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were all killed in the attack, which was brought to an end in less than 10 minutes when the attackers were shot.

"This video can not be played Join police officers as they raid an address in Hastings Nearly 600 suspected members of county lines drugs gangs have been arrested across the UK in the past week, the National Crime Agency has said. Police forces led by the National County Lines Coordination Centre also seized cocaine worth Â£176,780, Â£312,649 in cash and 46 weapons. The NCA estimates there are about 2,000 city-based gangs exploiting young people to sell drugs in smaller towns. It says tackling the gangs is a ""national law enforcement priority"". In the operation between 13 and 20 May: 500 men and 86 women were arrested in raids in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cheshire, Bedfordshire and other areas 519 vulnerable adults and 364 children in need of support were helped 30 people were identified as potential victims of slavery or human trafficking Four guns were seized, as well as swords, machetes, an axe, knives, samurai swords, and a crossbow Drugs including cocaine with a street value of Â£176,780, crack worth Â£36,550 and Â£17,950 of heroin were recovered County line drugs gangs - linked by a network of mobile phone lines and often coercing children and vulnerable adults - travel out of their usual urban territory and into rural areas to sell drugs. Most come out of London, Birmingham and Merseyside, said NCA County Lines lead Nikki Holland. Some raids were on so-called cuckooed houses, which is a home taken over by drugs gangs from a drug user or vulnerable person. Ms Holland likened gangs' exploitation of children to grooming for sex, saying these children often did not see themselves as victims because they enjoyed the attention and the gifts of drugs. Gangs then used coercion, intimidation and violence to control the children, to keep them involved in running the drugs and to act as a ""shield"" from arrest and violence by rival gangs, she added. Ms Holland appealed to parents and the public to trust their instincts and look out for children travelling long distances with older people or children going missing and having new and older friends. The NCA said it did not have details yet of the ages of the 364 children who were picked up in the raids. But they could be dealt with in a number of ways, it said, including being returned home if missing, referred to local services, referred to the National Referral Mechanism - which identifies victims of human trafficking or placed under a protection order. This is the third week that police forces across the UK have co-ordinated raids. The latest police operation ""demonstrated the power of a whole-system response to a complex problem that we're seeing in every area of the UK"", said Ms Holland. Ms Holland called on professionals working with people at risk of being involved in county line operations to assist, saying: ""It's the nurses, teachers, social workers, GPs, and anyone who works with young or vulnerable people, that can really help to make a difference."" County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Train patrols target drug dealers '100 county lines drug networks in Wales' Nathaniel Peat, founder of the Safety Box, an organisation which delivers programmes to young people to reduce violence, notes that many young people who serve prison sentences for drugs are exposed to more violence in prison. ""They can become even more vulnerable in prison, they're often under pressure to beat people up or will be beat up themselves. They go in for drugs and come out violent, and that's when the knife crime rises."" Last week three drug dealers from London and Kent who used vulnerable teenagers to traffic crack cocaine and heroin to Portsmouth werejailed in a ""landmark case"". They are believed to have been the first to have been charged with modern slavery offences. Other recent cases before the courts includetwo brothers from Birmingham who ran a network supplying heroin and crack cocaine in Hereford, while apolice operation on 1 Mayresulted in 24 arrests and raids in Newcastle, Stevenage, Norwich, Glasgow and London. Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the charity had heard ""shocking stories of children being groomed with money and drugs before the life of glamour they have been promised quickly descends into a nightmare"". She said while it was good to see police are stepping up their fight against the gangs ""too many children exploited through county lines are still... failing to get help from an independent advocate to ensure they are supported as victims"".

"Theresa May is setting out the details of a series of compromises designed to try and win the support of Labour MPs for her Brexit plan. The cabinet earlier agreed the idea of a temporary customs relationship until the next general election, and measures on the environment and workers' rights. These will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, to be put to a vote in the Commons in early June. The SNP and some Tory Brexiteers have already said they will vote against. The PM briefed MPs and ministers on the contents of the speech - entitled ""A new Brexit deal - seeking common ground in Parliament"" - beforehand. Allow Twitter content?

At the meeting, Mrs May told her ministers: ""The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is the vehicle which gets the UK out of the EU and it is vital to find a way to get it over the line.""

International Development Secretary Rory Stewart suggested on Sunday that the government and Labour were ""half an inch apart"" on key issues and ""sensible"" Labour MPs could be won round. But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said she believed her colleagues would vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill as she had heard there was ""no radical difference"" in what was being offered. The easy bit? Theresa May is hoping to win over enough Labour MPs to counteract Tory rebellion For Theresa May getting her cabinet behind her plan for another push towards a Brexit deal was the easy bit. Ministers agreed legislation to deliver Brexit should be the vehicle for compromises to bring enough Labour MPs on board to counteract the still strong rebellion by those on her own side. The plan supersedes the idea of so-calledindicative votesin the Commons on Brexit options. The problem is that opposition on the Conservative side has probably hardened, not softened, since her last failed attempt. The hope in Downing Street is that those wanting another referendum or a form of Brexit that keeps us closer to the EU may back this bill and try and get their way during later detailed debate. The emphasis now is on hope and perhaps not very much of it. Ms Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today thatShe said Labour was still pushing for a customs unionwith the EU and close alignment with the single market after Brexit. However, Commons leader and Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom said she would back the bill ""so long as it continues to be leaving the European Union"", which she defined as being outside both of those structures. She also stressed the need to be prepared for a no-deal Brexit, telling Today: ""What I do think is that for any negotiation to succeed, you have to be prepared to walk away."" Remaining within a customs union would avoid the need for tariffs (taxes) to be imposed on goods moving between the UK and the EU, but many Brexiteers feel it would also prevent Britain making the clean break from Brussels that they want. If the bill passes its first parliamentary hurdle - known as second reading - in early June, MPs will then have an opportunity to propose changes as they examine it in detail. It is thought some Labour MPs who oppose Brexit and want another referendum might be tempted to back the bill in the hope of inserting another public vote into it later on. However, several Tories - including former Brexit Secretary David Davis - have said they will vote against the bill at the first opportunity precisely to stop this happening. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? What happens next? Ex-minister Mark Francois, a vocal critic of the prime minister, said if the vote was held today the bill would be defeated by a huge margin. He told the BBC that MPs who had backed the PM in the past would be ""more reluctant"" to do so if the party got a drubbing in the European elections and she would have to rely on Labour votes to get her way. ""Unless she is rescued by a Marxist, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. Mr Francois dismissed comments to be made later by Philip Hammond, who will warn prospective Conservative leadership contenders against ""hijacking"" Brexit by ""knowingly inflicting"" a damaging no-deal exit on the economy. The chancellor will tell business leaders that there is ""no mandate"" for such a no-deal exit and that even with ""all the preparation in the world"" it would be highly damaging. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? Mr Francois said the chancellor was a ""Remain fanatic"" and he suggested the public increasingly backed leaving with a deal andtrading with the EU using World Trade Organization rules. On Sunday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said that was now""the only way the democratic will of the people can be delivered"". The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back when MPs failed to approve Mrs May's deal. When the new deadline was announced, the government said it would ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning.

"This video can not be played Join police officers as they raid an address in Hastings Nearly 600 suspected members of county lines drugs gangs have been arrested across the UK in the past week, the National Crime Agency has said. Police forces led by the National County Lines Coordination Centre also seized cocaine worth Â£176,780, Â£312,649 in cash and 46 weapons. The NCA estimates there are about 2,000 city-based gangs exploiting young people to sell drugs in smaller towns. It says tackling the gangs is a ""national law enforcement priority"". In the operation between 13 and 20 May: 500 men and 86 women were arrested in raids in Norfolk, Suffolk, Cheshire, Bedfordshire and other areas 519 vulnerable adults and 364 children in need of support were helped 30 people were identified as potential victims of slavery or human trafficking Four guns were seized, as well as swords, machetes, an axe, knives, samurai swords, and a crossbow Drugs including cocaine with a street value of Â£176,780, crack worth Â£36,550 and Â£17,950 of heroin were recovered County line drugs gangs - linked by a network of mobile phone lines and often coercing children and vulnerable adults - travel out of their usual urban territory and into rural areas to sell drugs. Most come out of London, Birmingham and Merseyside, said NCA County Lines lead Nikki Holland. Some raids were on so-called cuckooed houses, which is a home taken over by drugs gangs from a drug user or vulnerable person. Ms Holland likened gangs' exploitation of children to grooming for sex, saying these children often did not see themselves as victims because they enjoyed the attention and the gifts of drugs. Gangs then used coercion, intimidation and violence to control the children, to keep them involved in running the drugs and to act as a ""shield"" from arrest and violence by rival gangs, she added. Ms Holland appealed to parents and the public to trust their instincts and look out for children travelling long distances with older people or children going missing and having new and older friends. The NCA said it did not have details yet of the ages of the 364 children who were picked up in the raids. But they could be dealt with in a number of ways, it said, including being returned home if missing, referred to local services, referred to the National Referral Mechanism - which identifies victims of human trafficking or placed under a protection order. This is the third week that police forces across the UK have co-ordinated raids. The latest police operation ""demonstrated the power of a whole-system response to a complex problem that we're seeing in every area of the UK"", said Ms Holland. Ms Holland called on professionals working with people at risk of being involved in county line operations to assist, saying: ""It's the nurses, teachers, social workers, GPs, and anyone who works with young or vulnerable people, that can really help to make a difference."" County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Train patrols target drug dealers '100 county lines drug networks in Wales' Nathaniel Peat, founder of the Safety Box, an organisation which delivers programmes to young people to reduce violence, notes that many young people who serve prison sentences for drugs are exposed to more violence in prison. ""They can become even more vulnerable in prison, they're often under pressure to beat people up or will be beat up themselves. They go in for drugs and come out violent, and that's when the knife crime rises."" Last week three drug dealers from London and Kent who used vulnerable teenagers to traffic crack cocaine and heroin to Portsmouth werejailed in a ""landmark case"". They are believed to have been the first to have been charged with modern slavery offences. Other recent cases before the courts includetwo brothers from Birmingham who ran a network supplying heroin and crack cocaine in Hereford, while apolice operation on 1 Mayresulted in 24 arrests and raids in Newcastle, Stevenage, Norwich, Glasgow and London. Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the charity had heard ""shocking stories of children being groomed with money and drugs before the life of glamour they have been promised quickly descends into a nightmare"". She said while it was good to see police are stepping up their fight against the gangs ""too many children exploited through county lines are still... failing to get help from an independent advocate to ensure they are supported as victims"".

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Niki Lauda, who has died aged 70, was a three-time Formula 1 world champion, non-executive chairman of the world champion Mercedes team, and one of the biggest names in motorsport. He was also a pilot and successful businessman, who set up two airlines and continued to occasionally captain their planes into his late 60s. But he will be remembered most for the remarkable bravery and resilience he showed in recovering from a fiery crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix at the fearsome Nurburgring. Lauda - leading the World Championship, having won his first title a year earlier - suffered third-degree burns to his head and face that left him scarred for life, inhaled toxic gases that damaged his lungs, and received the last rites in hospital. Yet he returned to racing just 40 days later - finishing fourth in the Italian Grand Prix. By the end of the race, his unhealed wounds had soaked his fireproof balaclava in blood. When he tried to remove the balaclava, he found it was stuck to his bandages, and had to resort to ripping it off in one go. It was one of the bravest acts in the history of sport. At the time, Lauda played down his condition. Later, in his disarmingly frank autobiography, he admitted he had been so scared he could hardly drive. ""I said then and later that I had conquered my fear quickly and cleanly,"" Lauda wrote in To Hell And Back. ""That was a lie. But it would have been foolish to play into the hands of my rivals by confirming my weakness. At Monza, I was rigid with fear."" Lauda drove that weekend because he felt it was the ""best thing"" for his physical and mental wellbeing. ""Lying in bed ruminating about the 'Ring would have finished me,"" he said. F1 legend Lauda dies at 70 'The most courageous act of any sportsman' - tributes paid to 'legend' Lauda Sporting Witness: Lauda crashes Listen: Lauda discusses Nurburgring crash The accident ended the notorious Nurburgring's time as a Formula 1 circuit. Lauda had been warning for some time that the circuit was too dangerous for F1. Its 14 miles twisting through the Eifel mountains meant the emergency services were stretched too far, he said, and any driver who had a serious crash was therefore at a disproportionately high risk in an era that was already extremely dangerous. What happened on 1 August proved him right. For unknown reasons, Lauda lost control at a flat-out kink before a corner called Bergwerk, hit an embankment and his car burst into flames. Trapped in the wreckage, but conscious, he was dragged clear by four fellow drivers - but not before he had suffered severe injuries. Lauda carried the scars, including a mostly missing right ear, for the rest of his life and always had a matter-of-fact approach to his disfigurement. It didn't bother him, he said, and if others felt differently, that was their problem. His injuries, in fact, were often the butt of his merciless wit. Once it was pointed out to him that, owing to the rule that says the original start of a race does not count if there is a restart, he had not officially taken part in the 1976 German Grand Prix. ""Oh yes,"" he said, in his clipped tones. ""So what happened to my ear?"" The accident came at a time when Lauda appeared to be cruising to a second consecutive world title for Ferrari, and his determination to return was founded in his desire to shore up a lead that was rapidly diminishing in his absence from competition, under assault from British McLaren driver James Hunt. The compelling narrative of that season was effectively the kick-start for F1's current global popularity. The storyline had something for everyone - the ascetic Austrian racing driver-cum-engineer, renowned for his clinical approach and lack of emotions, driving for Ferrari;the handsome, playboy Englishman bon vivantfor McLaren. Lauda's crash and awe-inspiring recovery only added to the frisson. By the final round in Japan, Lauda was only three points ahead, and when raceday brought torrential rain, he pulled out after two laps, saying it was too dangerous. Lauda admitted he was ""panic-stricken"" - feelings rooted in his crash - but later said he regretted the decision. Ferrari remonstrated with him and tried to convince him to race, but he refused, and Hunt took the third place he needed to win the title by one point. Their battle has been turned into a Hollywood film, but it misrepresented them as enemies - in fact, Lauda and Hunt were close friends. So much so they had next-door rooms that weekend in Japan and, on race morning, with Hunt in bed with a girlfriend, Lauda goose-stepped into the room and barked out: ""Today, I vin the Vorld Championship."" Listen: Hunt v Lauda Hunt (right) narrowly beat Lauda to the world title in 1976 It was unarguably the most dramatic, inspiring and fascinating part of Lauda's career, but his life was one lived in Technicolor, and remarkable in its entirety. He was a singular personality, brusque and matter of fact, but with a wicked sense of humour and independent mind. After success in the lower categories, Lauda bought his way into F1 in 1971, against the wishes of his well-heeled family, by way of a bank loan secured against his life insurance policy, and started his career with March. He needed a second loan to move to BRM two years later. It was the move that made his career. He impressed team-mate Clay Regazzoni, and when the Swiss was signed by Ferrari for 1974, he recommended Lauda. The legendary Italian team had been in the doldrums in 1973, but were about to start a strong recovery under the management of the brilliant Luca di Montezemolo. In 1974, Lauda lost out on the title to McLaren's Emerson Fittipaldi only through inexperience, but that was the precursor to dominating in 1975 in the now legendary Ferrari 312T. After narrowly missing out on the title in 1976, Lauda won again in 1977, despite falling out with Enzo Ferrari, whose lack of support following the Nurburgring crash fatally fractured their relationship. The atmosphere chilly, amid Lauda's fall-out with the owner and distaste for his new team-mate Carlos Reutemann, Lauda stayed at Ferrari in 1977 only long enough to clinch the title, and pulled out of the final two races before a move to Bernie Ecclestone's Brabham team for 1978. The Brabham was beautiful to look at, but its Alfa Romeo engine was uncompetitive, and Lauda began to lose interest in F1. At the Canadian Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the 1979 season, he got out of his car part-way through a practice session and told Ecclestone he was retiring, saying he was ""bored of driving around in circles"". He returned to Austria to run his airline, Lauda Air, full-time. But just over two years later he was back in F1, tempted out of retirement by McLaren boss Ron Dennis, on a $3m salary - by far the largest in the sport at the time. Lauda won his third race back - in Long Beach, California - and in 1984 the team were dominant with the new MP4/2, powered by a Porsche engine funded by McLaren's new backer TAG. Lauda was out-paced by new team-mate Alain Prost but won five races to Prost's seven, most as a result of the Frenchman's bad luck or retirement, and clinched the title by half a point, the closest margin in history. He stayed for one more year, 1985, when he was uncompetitive but still managed to win in the Netherlands - holding off a charge from Prost - before finally calling it a day for good, aged 36. Through both his periods in F1, his driving was characterised by elegant stylishness, all economy of effort and fluidity, which matched his belief it was the driver's job to work as hard as possible on the technical aspects of the car, to make it work for him, and let it do the work. It was not spectacular, but it was certainly effective - as proved by Prost himself, and Jackie Stewart, who shared a similar approach and won a further seven titles between them. The end of Lauda's driving career, though, did not mean the end of his links with F1. In 1993, Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari, though that did not last long into the management of the team's new boss that year - Jean Todt, who went on to mastermind the dominant Michael Schumacher era. In 2001, Lauda took charge of the Ford-owned Jaguar team, only to be sacked at the end of 2002 along with 70 other key figures when the performance failed to improve. From then, he largely combined running his new airline Niki - founded in 2003, after the sale of Lauda Air to Austrian Airlines in 1999 - with an analyst's role on the German TV channel RTL's F1 coverage. But then, in September 2012, he was appointed a non-executive director of the Mercedes F1 team, a decision made by the Mercedes board, who were unhappy at the team's lack of competitiveness under Ross Brawn, and wanted Lauda as an effective spy in the camp. Along with Brawn, Lauda played a key role in the signing of Lewis Hamilton to replace Schumacher at the end of 2012. And in early 2013, he became a 10% shareholder in Mercedes, at the same time as Toto Wolff took on 30%. Wolff, initially appointed executive director, replaced Brawn as team boss in 2014, and after that - as Mercedes dominated the sport in the era of turbo hybrid engines - Lauda had attended races and acted as an adviser to Wolff and the Mercedes board. In July 2018, he was diagnosed with a severe lung infection and had a double lung transplant. In November, he and the team posted a message on social media with a video of Lauda saying he would be back at work ""soon"". But in January he was diagnosed with pneumonia and taken back into hospital in Vienna. Lauda leaves his second wife Birgit, their twins Max and Mia - born in 2009, two sons from his first wife Marlene Knaus - Mathias and Lukas, and a son - Christoph - born from a third relationship.

"The remains of Niki Lauda's Ferrari after a horrific accident during the German Grand Prix in 1976 Three-time Formula 1 world champion Niki Lauda produced the ""most courageous act of any sportsman"" in returning to racing so soon after a horrific crash, says former team-mate John Watson. Austrian Lauda, who won the drivers championship in 1975, 1977 and 1984, died aged 70 on Monday. He almost died following a crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring.

Watson was a team-mate of Lauda at Brabham and McLaren in the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the first people to attend to him after the crash. ""I came around shortly after the accident and the other drivers that were there managed to get him out of the cockpit and walked him away,"" Watson told the BBC. ""We lay him down and I put his head in my lap and he was able to communicate. ""Nobody realised the actual damage to Niki. The real danger he was in was not from the superficial injuries that we could see but from the deeper injury which was that to his lung. ""He'd suffered inhalation of toxic fumes from the burning fibreglass and we didn't appreciate the severity of the injury that he'd suffered.

"Theresa May is setting out the details of a series of compromises designed to try and win the support of Labour MPs for her Brexit plan. The cabinet earlier agreed the idea of a temporary customs relationship until the next general election, and measures on the environment and workers' rights.

No 10 said the bill, when it was published, would contain ""some significant new aspects"". International Development Secretary Rory Stewart suggested on Sunday that the government and Labour were ""half an inch apart"" on key issues and ""sensible"" Labour MPs could be won round. But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said she believed her colleagues would vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill as she had heard there was ""no radical difference"" in what was being offered. The easy bit? Theresa May is hoping to win over enough Labour MPs to counteract Tory rebellion For Theresa May getting her cabinet behind her plan for another push towards a Brexit deal was the easy bit. Ministers agreed legislation to deliver Brexit should be the vehicle for compromises to bring enough Labour MPs on board to counteract the still strong rebellion by those on her own side. The plan supersedes the idea of so-calledindicative votesin the Commons on Brexit options. The problem is that opposition on the Conservative side has probably hardened, not softened, since her last failed attempt. The hope in Downing Street is that those wanting another referendum or a form of Brexit that keeps us closer to the EU may back this bill and try and get their way during later detailed debate. The emphasis now is on hope and perhaps not very much of it. Ms Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today thatShe said Labour was still pushing for a customs unionwith the EU and close alignment with the single market after Brexit. However, Commons leader and Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom said she would back the bill ""so long as it continues to be leaving the European Union"", which she defined as being outside both of those structures. She also stressed the need to be prepared for a no-deal Brexit, telling Today: ""What I do think is that for any negotiation to succeed, you have to be prepared to walk away."" Remaining within a customs union would avoid the need for tariffs (taxes) to be imposed on goods moving between the UK and the EU, but many Brexiteers feel it would also prevent Britain making the clean break from Brussels that they want. If the bill passes its first parliamentary hurdle - known as second reading - in early June, MPs will then have an opportunity to propose changes as they examine it in detail. It is thought some Labour MPs who oppose Brexit and want another referendum might be tempted to back the bill in the hope of inserting another public vote into it later on. However, several Tories - including former Brexit Secretary David Davis - have said they will vote against the bill at the first opportunity precisely to stop this happening. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? What happens next? Ex-minister Mark Francois, a vocal critic of the prime minister, said if the vote was held today the bill would be defeated by a huge margin. He told the BBC that MPs who had backed the PM in the past would be ""more reluctant"" to do so if the party got a drubbing in the European elections and she would have to rely on Labour votes to get her way. ""Unless she is rescued by a Marxist, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. Mr Francois dismissed comments to be made later by Philip Hammond, who will warn prospective Conservative leadership contenders against ""hijacking"" Brexit by ""knowingly inflicting"" a damaging no-deal exit on the economy. The chancellor will tell business leaders that there is ""no mandate"" for such a no-deal exit and that even with ""all the preparation in the world"" it would be highly damaging. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? Mr Francois said the chancellor was a ""Remain fanatic"" and he suggested the public increasingly backed leaving with a deal andtrading with the EU using World Trade Organization rules. On Sunday, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said that was now""the only way the democratic will of the people can be delivered"". The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back when MPs failed to approve Mrs May's deal. When the new deadline was announced, the government said it would ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning.

"The remains of Niki Lauda's Ferrari after a horrific accident during the German Grand Prix in 1976 Three-time Formula 1 world champion Niki Lauda produced the ""most courageous act of any sportsman"" in returning to racing so soon after a horrific crash, says former team-mate John Watson. Austrian Lauda, who won the drivers championship in 1975, 1977 and 1984, died aged 70 on Monday. He almost died following a crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. Despite suffering severe burns and inhaling hot toxic fumes, he resumed racing 40 days later. F1 legend Lauda dies aged 70 Lauda obituary: 'A remarkable life lived in Technicolor' Listen: Lauda discusses Nurburgring crash World champion Lewis Hamilton said he was ""struggling to believe you are gone"". The Briton addedon Twitter:,external""I will miss our conversations, our laughs, the big hugs after winning races together. God rest your soul. ""Thank you for being a bright light in my life. I'll always be here for your family should they ever need me. Love you man."" Watson was a team-mate of Lauda at Brabham and McLaren in the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the first people to attend to him after the crash. ""I came around shortly after the accident and the other drivers that were there managed to get him out of the cockpit and walked him away,"" Watson told the BBC. ""We lay him down and I put his head in my lap and he was able to communicate. ""Nobody realised the actual damage to Niki. The real danger he was in was not from the superficial injuries that we could see but from the deeper injury which was that to his lung. ""He'd suffered inhalation of toxic fumes from the burning fibreglass and we didn't appreciate the severity of the injury that he'd suffered. ""It was only after two or three days that the story came out that it was the lung damage that was the injury putting his life in danger. ""Racing 40 days after that accident was the most courageous act of any sportsman I've ever seen in my life."" This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Watson, 73, added: ""What was really more remarkable was the speed of his recovery and what he was able to achieve. ""His courage, his commitment, focus, determination and bloody-mindedness. All the naysayers were saying that 'Lauda is finished' but his health and condition at Monza was just remarkable. ""He was winning the world title in 1976 by a country mile up to that accident and it was this year where there was this battle between Niki and James Hunt, so there was a lot of motivation to get back into the car."" Three-time world championSir Jackie Stewarttold BBC Radio Four's Today programme: ""During that accident he died twice and was resuscitated. ""Recovering from that accident, he came to Monza [for the Italian Grand Prix], which I was doing commentary for. He shouldn't have been there but wanted to get back to racing. ""I will never forget him putting his helmet on and he was suffering so much pain. When he came out from driving at the end I was there and the blood was running down out of his helmet. ""It's very sad news. I've known Niki for a long time and he was just entering grand prix racing when I was retiring. We had a season together. He always had great integrity and was one the smoothest, best drivers I've ever seen."" Actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger paid tribute to his 'dear friend' Niki Lauda As non-executive chairman of Mercedes, Lauda helped them win both the drivers' and constructors' title in each of the past five seasons. Team principalToto Wolffsaid: ""First of all, on behalf of the team and all at Mercedes, I wish to send our deepest condolences to Birgit, Niki's children, his family and close friends. ""Niki will always remain one of the greatest legends of our sport - he combined heroism, humanity and honesty inside and outside the cockpit. ""His passing leaves a void in Formula 1. We haven't just lost a hero who staged the most remarkable comeback ever seen, but also a man who brought precious clarity and candour to modern Formula 1. He will be greatly missed as our voice of common sense. ""Our Mercedes team has also lost a guiding light. ""As a team-mate over the past six and a half years, Niki was always brutally honest - and utterly loyal. It was a privilege to count him among our team and moving to witness just how much it meant to him to be part of the team's success."" Nico Rosberg,who won the world title in 2016 with Mercedes, tweeted: ""Dear Niki. Thank you for everything that you did for me. I learned so much from you. ""Your passion, your fighting spirit, to never give up, you belief that you always meet twice in life, and even your patience with us youngsters. ""Myself and all of your 100 million fans around the world whom you also so strongly inspired to never give up in the hardest of times are thinking of you and your family and wish that you rest in peace."" Actor Daniel Bruhl presented Niki Lauda with a lifetime achievement award at the Laureus World Sports Awards in 2016 ActorDaniel Bruhlplayed the role of Niki Lauda in the film 'Rush', which focused on the 1976 Formula 1 title battle between Lauda and Briton James Hunt. On Tuesday, Bruhl paid tribute to Lauda andwrote on Instagram:,external""The bravest man, I've ever met, not only because he was an F1 world champion in the crazy '70s and had the most incredible comeback in sport's history, but also because of how he treated people. ""Always honest, straight forward, blunt. Niki told you the truth in your face, no matter how uncomfortable. He was totally unpretentious and incredibly funny. I learned a lot from him and deeply admired him. ""I know how much you enjoyed flying. Race the sky in peace immortal champ, we'll miss you."" Ferrari:""Everyone at Ferrari is deeply saddened at the news of the death of our dear friend Niki Lauda. ""He won two of his three world championships with us and will always be in our hearts and in those of all Ferrari fans. ""Our sincere condolences go to all his family and friends."" Former world champion Damon Hill:""He was a remarkable individual in every way. I was certainly one person that looked at Niki and thought 'I'll never be half the man he was. ""His career was stylised and characterised by his intelligent approach. When he came up against Alain Prost, he knew he couldn't beat him on speed so he beat him on tactics. ""He was thoughtful, intelligent, pragmatic and just got the job done."" Former world champion Jenson Button:""A legend has left us. Rest in peace Niki."" Red Bull driver Max Verstappen:""Shocked by the loss of Niki Lauda. He was a true legend in our sport and someone I had great respect for. May he rest in peace."" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner:""Rest in peace to an F1 legend that I was lucky enough to call a friend. A very sad day for the entire motorsport community. ""All at Red Bull Racing share their thoughts with Niki's family and friends at this time. Godspeed Niki."" McLaren:""Niki will forever be in our hearts and enshrined in our history."" Former driver Johnny Herbert:""A real loss to sport and a big hole in our hearts. Courageous, chatty, and extremely funny.

"Three handwritten wills have been found at the home of Aretha Franklin, months after the ""Queen of Soul's"" death. Franklin died from pancreatic cancer in August and family members said at the time that she had left no will. But three documents were found earlier this month.,externalTwo from 2010 were recovered from a locked cabinet after a key was located. One, dated March 2014, was hidden under living room cushions, a lawyer for Franklin's estate said. The will, which was written inside a spiral notebook, appears to leave her assets to her family, said the lawyer, David Bennett. Some of the writing is very hard to decipher and the four pages have words scratched out and phrases written in the margins. Bennett, who was Franklin's lawyer for more than 40 years, filed the wills on Monday. He told a judge that he's not sure if they are legal under Michigan law. He added that the wills had been shared with Franklin's four sons or their lawyers, but they had not reached a deal on whether any of them should be considered valid. A statement from the Franklin estate said two sons object to the wills. A hearing is scheduled for 12 June. In a separate court filing, Franklin's son Kecalf Franklin said his mother wanted him to serve as representative of the estate in the 2014 will but the estate statement confirmed that Sabrina Owens, an administrator at the University of Michigan, will continue to serve as its representative. Mr Franklin is currently objecting to plans to sell a piece of land next to his mother's Oakland County home for $325,000 (Â£255,960). Aretha Franklin was one of the most celebrated soul vocalists of the 60s and 70s.

"Jordan Adlard Rogers said he would trade anything to go back and know his father while he was alive A former care worker has inherited a manor house after a DNA test proved he was the heir to a country estate. Jordan Adlard Rogers, 31, only found out his father was Charles Rogers after his death in 2018,Cornwall Live reported,external. Mr Rogers' family had lived in the 1,536-acre Penrose Estate between Helston and Porthleven for generations. The family gifted the estate to the National Trust in 1974 in exchange for a 1,000-year lease to live there. Mr Adlard Rogers said he knew from the age of eight that Mr Rogers may be his father and made several unsuccessful attempts to get a DNA test done. He said after his father died he was finally able to get the test completed. The striking resemblance between the pair can be seen clearly in a photograph of Charles Rogers when he was younger An inquest last week heard Mr Rogers spent 40 years living as a drug addict and a recluse before dying in his car following an overdose on a heroin substitute. Charles Rogers' brother had been a pilot with the RAF and his dad a lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy, ""so he had big shoes to fill"", Mr Adlard Rogers said. ""He was under huge pressure taking it on, but he was different and a free spirit."" ""There was always a pressure of him trying to match expectation,"" Mr Adlard Rogers added. The estate makes money from investments in stocks and shares and renting a number of parcels of land to local farmers. Mr Adlard Rogers plans to set up a charity to help people in nearby Porthleven and Helston Mr Adlard Rogers told Cornwall Live he plans to set up a charity to help people in nearby Porthleven and Helston with his new-found wealth.

The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back when MPs failed to approve Mrs May's deal. When the new deadline was announced, the government said it would ""continue to make all necessary preparations"" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning.

"This video can not be played Facial recognition: 'Law has not caught up with technology' The first major legal challenge to police use of automated facial recognition surveillance has begun in Cardiff today. Ed Bridges, whose image was taken while he was shopping, says weak regulation means AFR breaches human rights. The civil rights group Liberty says current use of the tool is equivalent to the unregulated taking of DNA or fingerprints without consent. South Wales Police defends the tool but has not commented on the case. In December 2017, Mr Bridges was having a perfectly normal day. ""I popped out of the office to do a bit of Christmas shopping and on the main pedestrian shopping street in Cardiff, there was a police van,"" he told BBC News. ""By the time I was close enough to see the words 'automatic facial recognition' on the van, I had already had my data captured by it. ""That struck me as quite a fundamental invasion of my privacy."" The case could provide crucial guidance on the lawful use of facial technology. Newsbeat: What is Automated Facial Recognition? Face recognition police tools 'staggeringly inaccurate' 2,000 wrongly matched with criminals at Champions League It is a far more powerful policing tool than traditional CCTV - as the cameras take a biometric map, creating a numerical code of the faces of each person who passes the camera. These biometric maps are uniquely identifiable to the individual. ""It is just like taking people's DNA or fingerprints, without their knowledge or their consent,"" said Megan Goulding, a lawyer from the civil liberties group Liberty which is supporting Mr Bridges. However, unlike DNA or fingerprints, there is no specific regulation governing how police use facial recognition or manage the data gathered. Liberty argues that even if there were regulations, facial recognition breaches human rights and should not be used. South Wales Police is the biggest user of facial recognition technology The tool allows the facial images of vast numbers of people to be scanned in public places such as streets, shopping centres, football crowds and music events. The captured images are then compared with images on police ""watch lists"" to see if they match. ""If there are hundreds of people walking the streets who should be in prison because there are outstanding warrants for their arrest, or dangerous criminals bent on harming others in public places, the proper use of AFR has a vital policing role,"" said Chris Phillips, former head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office. ""The police need guidance to ensure this vital anti-crime tool is used lawfully."" Facial recognition's usefulness for spotting, for example, terrorist suspects and preventing atrocities is clear but Liberty says the technology is being used for much more mundane policing, such as catching pickpockets. Liberty also says: images of people on watch lists can come from anywhere police have not ruled out taking watch list images from social media some lists include people not wanted for any crime AFR has been used to look for people with mental health conditions Mr Bridges had his image captured by facial recognition for a second time at a peaceful protest against the arms trade. His legal challenge argues the use of the tool breached his human right to privacy as well as data protection and equality laws. Three UK police forces have used facial recognition in public spaces since June 2015: South Wales Police Metropolitan Police Leicestershire Police Liberty believes South Wales Police has used facial recognition the most of the three forces, at about 50 deployments, including during the policing of the Champions League final in Cardiff in June 2017, where it emerged that, of the 2,470 potential matches made, 92% (2,297) were wrong. South Wales Police has gone to considerable lengthsto explain its use of facial recognition,externaland last year described it as ""lawful and proportionate"". When thetechnology was tested recently in London, one man was fined for a public order offence. BBC News alsoreported that at least three chances to assess how well the systems dealt with ethnicity had been missedby police over five years. Civil liberties groups say studies have shown facial recognition discriminates against women and those from ethnic minorities, because it disproportionately misidentifies those people. ""If you are a woman or from an ethnic minority and you walk past the camera, you are more likely to be identified as someone on a watch list, even if you are not,"" said Ms Goulding. ""That means you are more likely to be stopped and interrogated by the police. ""This is another tool by which social bias will be entrenched and communities who are already over-policed simply get over-policed further."" Liberty says the risk of false-positive matches of women and ethnic minorities has the potential to change the nature of public spaces. Liberty lawyer Megan Goulding says recent evidence suggests AFR misidentifies women and ethnic minorities Last week San Francisco becamethe first US city to ban the use of the technology, following fears about its reliability and infringement of people's liberty and privacy. The information commissioner and the surveillance camera commissioner have both become involved in Mr Bridges's case, as has the Home Office, indicating the high level of interest and concern about the parameters within which facial recognition can lawfully operate. The case is expected to last three days, with judgment reserved to a later time.

"Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has remained defiant towards US moves against his company, saying the US ""underestimates"" its abilities. Speaking to Chinese state media, Mr Ren downplayed the impact of recent US curbs and said no-one could catch up to its 5G technology in the near future. Last week the US added Huawei to a list of companies that American firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. The move marked an escalation in US efforts to block the Chinese company.

"Theresa May is setting out the details of a series of compromises designed to try and win the support of Labour MPs for her Brexit plan. The cabinet earlier agreed the idea of a temporary customs relationship until the next general election, and measures on the environment and workers' rights. These will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, to be put to a vote in the Commons in early June. The SNP and some Tory Brexiteers have already said they will vote against. The PM briefed MPs and ministers on the contents of the speech - entitled ""A new Brexit deal - seeking common ground in Parliament"" - beforehand. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is legislation required to bring the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU into British law. MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement three times, and talks with Labour on finding a compromise deal acceptable to their MPs broke down last week. Heseltine loses Tory whip over EU vote PM plans 'bold offer' to get support for deal Tory MPs launch rival campaign groups Downing Street said there was a ""shared determination"" in cabinet to find a way of passing the legislation although it conceded ""strong opinions"" had been aired on how best to do this. At the meeting, Mrs May told her ministers: ""The Withdrawal Agreement Bill is the vehicle which gets the UK out of the EU and it is vital to find a way to get it over the line."" No 10 said the bill, when it was published, would contain ""some significant new aspects"". International Development Secretary Rory Stewart suggested on Sunday that the government and Labour were ""half an inch apart"" on key issues and ""sensible"" Labour MPs could be won round. But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said she believed her colleagues would vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill as she had heard there was ""no radical difference"" in what was being offered. The easy bit? Theresa May is hoping to win over enough Labour MPs to counteract Tory rebellion For Theresa May getting her cabinet behind her plan for another push towards a Brexit deal was the easy bit. Ministers agreed legislation to deliver Brexit should be the vehicle for compromises to bring enough Labour MPs on board to counteract the still strong rebellion by those on her own side. The plan supersedes the idea of so-calledindicative votesin the Commons on Brexit options. The problem is that opposition on the Conservative side has probably hardened, not softened, since her last failed attempt. The hope in Downing Street is that those wanting another referendum or a form of Brexit that keeps us closer to the EU may back this bill and try and get their way during later detailed debate. The emphasis now is on hope and perhaps not very much of it. Ms Thornberry told BBC Radio 4's Today thatShe said Labour was still pushing for a customs unionwith the EU and close alignment with the single market after Brexit. However, Commons leader and Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom said she would back the bill ""so long as it continues to be leaving the European Union"", which she defined as being outside both of those structures. She also stressed the need to be prepared for a no-deal Brexit, telling Today: ""What I do think is that for any negotiation to succeed, you have to be prepared to walk away."" Remaining within a customs union would avoid the need for tariffs (taxes) to be imposed on goods moving between the UK and the EU, but many Brexiteers feel it would also prevent Britain making the clean break from Brussels that they want. If the bill passes its first parliamentary hurdle - known as second reading - in early June, MPs will then have an opportunity to propose changes as they examine it in detail. It is thought some Labour MPs who oppose Brexit and want another referendum might be tempted to back the bill in the hope of inserting another public vote into it later on. However, several Tories - including former Brexit Secretary David Davis - have said they will vote against the bill at the first opportunity precisely to stop this happening. Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? What happens next? Ex-minister Mark Francois, a vocal critic of the prime minister, said if the vote was held today the bill would be defeated by a huge margin. He told the BBC that MPs who had backed the PM in the past would be ""more reluctant"" to do so if the party got a drubbing in the European elections and she would have to rely on Labour votes to get her way. ""Unless she is rescued by a Marxist, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead on arrival,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. Mr Francois dismissed comments to be made later by Philip Hammond, who will warn prospective Conservative leadership contenders against ""hijacking"" Brexit by ""knowingly inflicting"" a damaging no-deal exit on the economy. The chancellor will tell business leaders that there is ""no mandate"" for such a no-deal exit and that even with ""all the preparation in the world"" it would be highly damaging.

"This video can not be played Kirk Ellis said he was 'absolutely devastated' to find he had infected blood Welsh victims of the contaminated blood scandal have said it is not fair they get less financial help than people affected in England and Scotland. Kirk Ellis, 38, from Caerphilly, receives Â£18,500 a year after he contracted hepatitis C when he was given infected blood as a child. But in April, Theresa May increased funding to patients in England, worth an extra Â£10,000 in Mr Ellis's case. The UK government said it was liaising with Welsh ministers on greater parity. Apublic inquiry into the scandalis looking at why thousands of people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. Each of the UK nations has its own financial support scheme for infected patients. In Wales, 175 people receive payments. Mr Ellis said the UK government should increase the funding, not the Welsh Government, as ""we were under one government when infected"". ""How can it be fair? We were infected under the same system,"" he told BBC Wales. ""I've got the same medical condition, same damage done to my body, living with the same anxiety and depression as somebody living in those places."" How infected blood products gave me HIV 'Infected blood has ruined my life' Blood scandal victims' testimonies The father of one, who was diagnosed with haemophilia as a toddler, believes he was infected by his first dose of the clotting agent Factor VIII. But he did not find out until he was a teenager. ""I was devastated, absolutely devastated,"" he said. Mr Ellis is classed as having hepatitis C at stage two because he has cirrhosis of the liver. Since April, patients in England in the same position as Mr Ellis have been entitled to Â£28,000 a year. In Scotland it is Â£27,000 after it made changes to its payments in 2017, although Northern Ireland has the same payment scheme as Wales. 175 people receive payments in Wales Campaigners met ministers from the UK and devolved governments, including Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, in January. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the meeting agreed there would be a UK-wide approach to support for patients. But in April, at the start of the public inquiry, the prime minister announced an extra Â£29m for English patients. About 50 people in Wales are in Mr Ellis's situation with stage 2 Hepatitis C. Norman Hutchinson, of Benllech, Anglesey, cares for his wife Jennifer who developed Hepatitis C as a result of the scandal - a diagnosis that ""devastated"" her health and ""turned both our lives upside down"", he said. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""This is the problem of the Welsh Government. It's about time they stopped political bickering and took a hard look at the people who are suffering."" But Plaid Cymru AM Dai Lloyd, a GP, said Westminster governments had ""run away"" from their responsibility to patients. The Scottish government had more money to spend than Wales, he told BBC Radio Cymru. Lynne Kelly, chair of Haemophilia Wales, said there was a ""patchwork"" of support payments across the UK, but victims had not been compensated as no government has ever accepted it was at fault for the scandal. The Infected Blood Inquiry is hearing evidence around the UK. It is in Belfast this week, and will come to Cardiff in July. The Welsh Government said additional support was announced in March for infected patients. As well as money, it provided ""extensive wrap around services, which include psychological support"" for victims, a spokesman said. He added the government was ""committed to working across the UK to ensure parity of the schemes"", although there were no extra resources for Wales as a result of the English announcement. The UK government said it was liaising with the Welsh Government about ""how greater parity can be achieved between infected blood support schemes across the UK"".

"Mr Widodo - known as Jokowi - has cultivated a ""man of the people"" image Joko Widodo has been re-elected as Indonesia's president after last month's vote, beating former general Prabowo Subianto. The result was released a day ahead of schedule in the early hours of Tuesday, amid fears of unrest. Around 32,000 security personnel were deployed across the capital Jakarta, AFP news agency reports. Mr Prabowo rejected the result and said he would pursue ""legal avenues"", but urged his supporters to stay calm. Ahead of the final tally he had alleged ""widespread cheating"" and warned of potential street protests. In 2014 Mr Prabowo challenged an election defeat by Mr Widodo in Indonesia's constitutional court, but lost. The latest vote followed a bitter campaign in which religion played a key role, but independent observers have said it was free and fair. A short guide to Indonesia's election A thousand Indonesias at stake in one election Mr Widodo won 55.5% of the vote to Mr Prabowo's 44.5%, the election commission said. More than 192 million people were eligible to vote in the 17 April poll, choosing 20,000 local and national lawmakers. Prabowo Subianto is a former general who also ran against Mr Widodo in 2014 Azis Subekti, a witness from the retired general's campaign team, refused to sign the results. ""We won't give up in the face of this injustice, cheating, lies, and these actions against democracy,"" he said. Authorities have appealed for calm and increased security measures in a bid to manage tensions. Security personnel have been stationed in front of the election commission's office, backed by razor wire and water cannon. On Friday police said they had arrested dozens of suspected terrorists with links to Islamic State (IS), some of whom had allegedly planned to bomb political rallies when the vote result was released. The same day, the US embassy issued a travel warning advising its citizens in Indonesia to avoid demonstrations and political gatherings. The two rival election campaigns focused on the economy, infrastructure and corruption. Religion was also a core issue. Though Indonesia has no official state religion and the right to practise other faiths is enshrined in the constitution, some 80% of the country is Muslim. Conservative Muslim groups have grown increasingly vocal in recent years, and observers say the presidential candidates both sought to tout their Islamic credentials. Why Indonesia's next leader will need China Did an election kill 500 people? Mr Widodo, himself a religious moderate, picked powerful cleric Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate, while Mr Prabowo promised to protect Islamic leaders and increase funding for religious schools. President Joko Widodo pictured voting in the election with his wife, Iriana In 2016, Jakarta's Chinese-Christian governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama - known as Ahok - was accused by hardliners of blasphemy against Islam. After mass rallies in the streets, he was imprisoned for two years. Though 80% of the country is Muslim, Indonesia has no official state religion and the right to practise other faiths is enshrined in the constitution. Joko Widodo has been president since 2014 when he also beat Mr Prabowo in a hotly-contested vote. The 57-year old comes from humble beginnings and has focused his campaigns very much around his image as a ""man of the people"". He first came to international prominence by becoming governor of Jakarta in 2012. Where Chinese workers are causing controversy Indonesia country profile This video can not be played Horses, boats and planes: Getting ballot boxes to Indonesia's remote villages Under his presidency, Indonesia's economy has grown steadily. Yet he has disappointed some supporters by abandoning campaign promises to resolve human rights violations. He has also courted massive Chinese infrastructure investment, which some in the country view as controversial. His political rival, Mr Prabowo, 67, is closely associated with Indonesia's traditional political elite. He was previously married to the daughter of former dictator General Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 30 years. Mr Prabowo has been accused of complicity in human rights abuses committed under Gen Suharto, but has maintained his innocence. Despite his background, during the campaign he sought to distance himself from the political class and railed against the ""evil elites in Jakarta"".

"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Niki Lauda, who has died aged 70, was a three-time Formula 1 world champion, non-executive chairman of the world champion Mercedes team, and one of the biggest names in motorsport. He was also a pilot and successful businessman, who set up two airlines and continued to occasionally captain their planes into his late 60s. But he will be remembered most for the remarkable bravery and resilience he showed in recovering from a fiery crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix at the fearsome Nurburgring. Lauda - leading the World Championship, having won his first title a year earlier - suffered third-degree burns to his head and face that left him scarred for life, inhaled toxic gases that damaged his lungs, and received the last rites in hospital. Yet he returned to racing just 40 days later - finishing fourth in the Italian Grand Prix. By the end of the race, his unhealed wounds had soaked his fireproof balaclava in blood. When he tried to remove the balaclava, he found it was stuck to his bandages, and had to resort to ripping it off in one go. It was one of the bravest acts in the history of sport. At the time, Lauda played down his condition. Later, in his disarmingly frank autobiography, he admitted he had been so scared he could hardly drive. ""I said then and later that I had conquered my fear quickly and cleanly,"" Lauda wrote in To Hell And Back. ""That was a lie. But it would have been foolish to play into the hands of my rivals by confirming my weakness. At Monza, I was rigid with fear."" Lauda drove that weekend because he felt it was the ""best thing"" for his physical and mental wellbeing. ""Lying in bed ruminating about the 'Ring would have finished me,"" he said. F1 legend Lauda dies at 70 'The most courageous act of any sportsman' - tributes paid to 'legend' Lauda Sporting Witness: Lauda crashes Listen: Lauda discusses Nurburgring crash The accident ended the notorious Nurburgring's time as a Formula 1 circuit. Lauda had been warning for some time that the circuit was too dangerous for F1. Its 14 miles twisting through the Eifel mountains meant the emergency services were stretched too far, he said, and any driver who had a serious crash was therefore at a disproportionately high risk in an era that was already extremely dangerous. What happened on 1 August proved him right. For unknown reasons, Lauda lost control at a flat-out kink before a corner called Bergwerk, hit an embankment and his car burst into flames. Trapped in the wreckage, but conscious, he was dragged clear by four fellow drivers - but not before he had suffered severe injuries. Lauda carried the scars, including a mostly missing right ear, for the rest of his life and always had a matter-of-fact approach to his disfigurement. It didn't bother him, he said, and if others felt differently, that was their problem. His injuries, in fact, were often the butt of his merciless wit. Once it was pointed out to him that, owing to the rule that says the original start of a race does not count if there is a restart, he had not officially taken part in the 1976 German Grand Prix. ""Oh yes,"" he said, in his clipped tones. ""So what happened to my ear?"" The accident came at a time when Lauda appeared to be cruising to a second consecutive world title for Ferrari, and his determination to return was founded in his desire to shore up a lead that was rapidly diminishing in his absence from competition, under assault from British McLaren driver James Hunt. The compelling narrative of that season was effectively the kick-start for F1's current global popularity. The storyline had something for everyone - the ascetic Austrian racing driver-cum-engineer, renowned for his clinical approach and lack of emotions, driving for Ferrari;the handsome, playboy Englishman bon vivantfor McLaren. Lauda's crash and awe-inspiring recovery only added to the frisson. By the final round in Japan, Lauda was only three points ahead, and when raceday brought torrential rain, he pulled out after two laps, saying it was too dangerous. Lauda admitted he was ""panic-stricken"" - feelings rooted in his crash - but later said he regretted the decision. Ferrari remonstrated with him and tried to convince him to race, but he refused, and Hunt took the third place he needed to win the title by one point. Their battle has been turned into a Hollywood film, but it misrepresented them as enemies - in fact, Lauda and Hunt were close friends. So much so they had next-door rooms that weekend in Japan and, on race morning, with Hunt in bed with a girlfriend, Lauda goose-stepped into the room and barked out: ""Today, I vin the Vorld Championship."" Listen: Hunt v Lauda Hunt (right) narrowly beat Lauda to the world title in 1976 It was unarguably the most dramatic, inspiring and fascinating part of Lauda's career, but his life was one lived in Technicolor, and remarkable in its entirety. He was a singular personality, brusque and matter of fact, but with a wicked sense of humour and independent mind. After success in the lower categories, Lauda bought his way into F1 in 1971, against the wishes of his well-heeled family, by way of a bank loan secured against his life insurance policy, and started his career with March. He needed a second loan to move to BRM two years later. It was the move that made his career. He impressed team-mate Clay Regazzoni, and when the Swiss was signed by Ferrari for 1974, he recommended Lauda. The legendary Italian team had been in the doldrums in 1973, but were about to start a strong recovery under the management of the brilliant Luca di Montezemolo. In 1974, Lauda lost out on the title to McLaren's Emerson Fittipaldi only through inexperience, but that was the precursor to dominating in 1975 in the now legendary Ferrari 312T. After narrowly missing out on the title in 1976, Lauda won again in 1977, despite falling out with Enzo Ferrari, whose lack of support following the Nurburgring crash fatally fractured their relationship. The atmosphere chilly, amid Lauda's fall-out with the owner and distaste for his new team-mate Carlos Reutemann, Lauda stayed at Ferrari in 1977 only long enough to clinch the title, and pulled out of the final two races before a move to Bernie Ecclestone's Brabham team for 1978. The Brabham was beautiful to look at, but its Alfa Romeo engine was uncompetitive, and Lauda began to lose interest in F1. At the Canadian Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the 1979 season, he got out of his car part-way through a practice session and told Ecclestone he was retiring, saying he was ""bored of driving around in circles"". He returned to Austria to run his airline, Lauda Air, full-time. But just over two years later he was back in F1, tempted out of retirement by McLaren boss Ron Dennis, on a $3m salary - by far the largest in the sport at the time. Lauda won his third race back - in Long Beach, California - and in 1984 the team were dominant with the new MP4/2, powered by a Porsche engine funded by McLaren's new backer TAG. Lauda was out-paced by new team-mate Alain Prost but won five races to Prost's seven, most as a result of the Frenchman's bad luck or retirement, and clinched the title by half a point, the closest margin in history. He stayed for one more year, 1985, when he was uncompetitive but still managed to win in the Netherlands - holding off a charge from Prost - before finally calling it a day for good, aged 36. Through both his periods in F1, his driving was characterised by elegant stylishness, all economy of effort and fluidity, which matched his belief it was the driver's job to work as hard as possible on the technical aspects of the car, to make it work for him, and let it do the work. It was not spectacular, but it was certainly effective - as proved by Prost himself, and Jackie Stewart, who shared a similar approach and won a further seven titles between them. The end of Lauda's driving career, though, did not mean the end of his links with F1. In 1993, Montezemolo offered him a consulting role at Ferrari, though that did not last long into the management of the team's new boss that year - Jean Todt, who went on to mastermind the dominant Michael Schumacher era. In 2001, Lauda took charge of the Ford-owned Jaguar team, only to be sacked at the end of 2002 along with 70 other key figures when the performance failed to improve. From then, he largely combined running his new airline Niki - founded in 2003, after the sale of Lauda Air to Austrian Airlines in 1999 - with an analyst's role on the German TV channel RTL's F1 coverage. But then, in September 2012, he was appointed a non-executive director of the Mercedes F1 team, a decision made by the Mercedes board, who were unhappy at the team's lack of competitiveness under Ross Brawn, and wanted Lauda as an effective spy in the camp. Along with Brawn, Lauda played a key role in the signing of Lewis Hamilton to replace Schumacher at the end of 2012. And in early 2013, he became a 10% shareholder in Mercedes, at the same time as Toto Wolff took on 30%. Wolff, initially appointed executive director, replaced Brawn as team boss in 2014, and after that - as Mercedes dominated the sport in the era of turbo hybrid engines - Lauda had attended races and acted as an adviser to Wolff and the Mercedes board. In July 2018, he was diagnosed with a severe lung infection and had a double lung transplant. In November, he and the team posted a message on social media with a video of Lauda saying he would be back at work ""soon"". But in January he was diagnosed with pneumonia and taken back into hospital in Vienna. Lauda leaves his second wife Birgit, their twins Max and Mia - born in 2009, two sons from his first wife Marlene Knaus - Mathias and Lukas, and a son - Christoph - born from a third relationship.

"Mohammad Javad Zarif has insisted that Iran does not want a war Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has dismissed US President Donald Trump's ""genocidal taunts"" and warned him not to threaten the country. Amid rising tensions, Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday: ""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran."" Mr Zarif said the US president should look to history. ""Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone... Try respect - it works!"" The US has deployed additional warships and planes to the Gulf in recent days. But Mr Trump's tweet marked a shift in tone after recent attempts by him to downplay the possibility of a military conflict with Iran. When asked by reporters on Thursday if the US was going to war, he said: ""I hope not."" Iranian state media reported on Monday that the country had increased by fourfold its production of low-enriched uranium, which was limited to a 300kg stockpile by the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Is the United States heading for war with Iran? Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI), said Iran would ""go beyond the 300kg limit in the not too distant future"". This video can not be played ""US now in isolation over Iran,"" says James Clapper, former director of US national intelligence ""If they want us to maintain this limit, it would be better for European countries to take the measures they want to implement as soon as possible."" Mr Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear deal last year, but the European parties say they remain committed to it. The US president's warning to Iran on Sunday was issued hours after a rocket was fired into the heavily fortified Green Zone in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, and hit a building about 0.5km (0.3 miles) from the US embassy. The US recently evacuated non-emergency staff from the mission because of what it called a ""serious"" threat reportedly linked to Iran-backed forces in Iraq. A rocket landed half a kilometre from the US embassy in central Baghdad on Sunday Writing on Twitter on Monday, Iran's foreign minister said the US president was being ""goaded"" by what he called the ""B Team"" - a reference to US National Security Adviser John Bolton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Mr Trump ""hopes to achieve what Alexander [the Great], Genghis [Khan] & other aggressors failed to do. Iranians have stood tall for millennia while aggressors all gone. #EconomicTerrorism & genocidal taunts won't 'end Iran',"" he added. ""#NeverThreatenAnIranian. Try respect - it works!"" Tensions began rising earlier this month, whenthe US ended exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying from Iran. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue. Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that he wants to renegotiate. Days later, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saidhis country was suspending several commitments under the dealand threatened to step up uranium enrichment if European countries did not act to protect its oil and banking industries from the effects of the US sanctions with two months. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The White House then announced that the US was sending an aircraft carrier, B-52 bombers and a Patriot missile defence battery to the region because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. Last week,four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates said were sabotage attacks, and drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline. Iran has denied that it was behind two incidents. There were also unconfirmed reports, citing US and regional security officials, that Iran had loaded missiles onto boats in Iranian ports and that Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary fighters had positioned rockets near facilities in Iraq used by US troops. ""I would say to the Iranians: do not underestimate the resolve on the US side,"" UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told reporters in Geneva on Monday. ""They don't want a war with Iran. But if American interests are attacked, they will retaliate."" The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group has been deployed to the Gulf ""We want the situation to de-escalate, because this is a part of the world where things can get triggered accidentally,"" he added. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said the kingdom ""does not want a war, is not looking for it and will do everything to prevent it"". ""But at the same time, if the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with strength and determination to defend itself and its interests."" The foreign minister of Oman, which has brokered secret talks between the US and Iran in the past, visited Tehran to discuss regional issues with Mr Zarif on Monday.
