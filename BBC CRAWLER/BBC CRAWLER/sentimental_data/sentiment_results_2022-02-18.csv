"Western leaders repeated warnings that a Russian invasion could come in the next few days The British Embassy office in the capital Kyiv is temporarily relocating to the western city of Lviv Russia has been accused of staging a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine as a pretext for invasion Russian President Vladimir Putin said the situation in Eastern Ukraine was deteriorating Russia has been backing rebels in separatist-held areas there since 2014 Russia continues to increase the number of troops around Ukraine according to US officials Moscow continues to deny planning an invasion of Ukraine and accuses the West of stoking ""hysteria"" Edited by Deirdre Finnerty We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a round-up of some of Friday's key developments: Keep up with all thelatest developments here. A former high-ranking US national security official believes that Russia is working to manipulate media perceptions at home and abroad ahead of a potential invasion of Ukraine. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, an ex-senior analyst at the CIA and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said she believes Russia is ""accelerating its efforts in the information domain"" to build the case for conflict. As examples, she pointed to Russian media coverage of purported mass graves discovered in separatist areas or the recent shelling of a kindergarten, which Russian-backed separatists blamed on Ukraine. ""The Russian media is really trying to spin this all up as Ukraine mounting an offensive,"" she said. ""It creates justification."" Kendall-Taylor added that Russian military doctrine views the ""information space"" as a key part of their competition with the US and the West. She added that this sort of media is aimed both at the Russian public and at external observers across the world. ""They're going to flood the information space with fabricated stories and half-truths in order to confuse and disorient, and make it hard for outside observers to discern the truth,"" she said.  The BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg sounds a note of scepticism about Russian claims of Ukrainian shelling in an eastern breakaway region. Allow Twitter content?

Kyiv's Independence Square, pictured on Friday President Biden says that Russian forces intend to strike at Ukraine's capital Kyiv. In his remarks at the White House, Biden said that the US believes that Russian forces are likely to act ""in the coming week"". ""We believe that they will target Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people,"" he said. Biden added that the US is ""calling out"" Russia's plans repeatedly in a bid to ""remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving"". Biden is asked if the Ukrainian president's decision to attend the Munich Security Conference tomorrow is wise given the tensions with Russia, to which he says it is the president's call.  ""To be clear, you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine, is that what you just said?"" Biden is asked. ""Yes,"" he replies. Mr Biden says that Russia is pushing out ""more and more disinformation to the Russia public"" including allegations that Ukraine is planning an offensive into rebel-held territory. ""There is simply no evidence for these assertions and it defies basic logic,"" he says. He says that Ukraine would not make any military advances in the region while the Russian build-up of troops along its borders continues. ""Throughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgement and restraint,"" Mr Biden adds. ""They refuse to let the Russian troops bait them into war."" He goes on to call for Russia to avoid a ""catastrophic and needless war of choice"". ""Russia has still choose diplomacy. It's not too late to return to the negotiation table."" Biden says Nato allies are ""united and resolved"" in the face of Russian disinformation. He accuses Russia of trying to ""set up false justification"" for war against Ukraine. The White House has just provided a readout of Mr Biden's call with western leaders. The 45-minute meeting was held to discuss ""the likelihood of further Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" according to the statement. The leaders also ""expressed deep concern over Russiaâs continued build-up of forces, reiterated their strong support for Ukraineâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and discussed the importance of further economic assistance to Ukraine"". The group also pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy and discussed efforts to ""ensure the defence and security of Nato's eastern flank"". The call was joined by the leaders of Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Nato the European Commission and the European Council. President Biden has started speaking about the situation in Ukraine, beginning by describing calls he has made with the US Congress and with US allies. Video being widely shared on social media purports to show a large explosion in Luhansk, the capital and administrative centre of the Russian-backed separatist Luhansk People's Republic. The video could not be immediately verified, but has been reported as being from a gas pipeline that caught on fire. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. Tensions have been high in the region following repeated US claims that Russia is planning a ""false flag"" operation to give it a pretext to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade Ukraine.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has become the latest Western nation to accuse Russian intelligence of being behind a cyberattack on the Ukrainian government and bank websites earlier this week. Earlier, US officials claimed Russia was behind the hack that targeted the Ukrainian defence ministry and two of the country's biggest financial institutions. Moscow has denied responsibility for the attacks. The UK foreign office says the attacks had ""involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate"". It adds: ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underline the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity"". The video of separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik ordering an evacuation was recorded two days ago, according to metadata As Ukraine accuses Russia of trying to create a fake crisis in the breakaway eastern region of Donbas, the BBC has obtained evidence that casts doubt on claims made by pro-Russian separatists that a Ukrainian assault is imminent. Earlier today, the leadership of the pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk rebel republics in eastern Ukraine released videos giving details of the evacuation of residents. In one of the videos, the leader claims that, due to Ukrainian shelling, the order has been given to evacuate civilians, saying: âToday, Friday 18 Februaryâ¦"". Following reports on social media, the BBC has checked the metadata of the videos posted, and has found that the metadata shows they were recorded on Wednesday 16 February - two days ago, before the recent flare-up in hostilities. This suggests that the escalation was pre-planned. President Biden is due to make a televised address in the coming moments. It comes after a 45-minute phone call he held earlier today with western leaders. The White House says that it is up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to decide whether to leave his country to attend a security conference in Munich, Germany. ""Regardless of what decision he makes, he will have the support of the United States,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. The Munich Security Conference was founded in 1963 as a way for Western leaders to discuss threats and dangers. Russia is not attending for first time since 1999. The US is prepared to unleash major sanctions that would inhibit Russia's ability to import technology from other countries, including China, according to a top US economic official. Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh said the US was prepared to launch crippling sanctions in the event that Russia ""weaponises its energy supply"" by cutting off supplies to western Europe. He added that measures to ban Russia from the Swift electronic financial system - a network used by global banks to transfer money - are not likely to be included in the initial sanctions package in the event of invasion. As we await to hear from President Joe Biden at 21:00GMT, here's a round-up of the key events in the Ukraine crisis so far today: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says that the US continues to believe that Russia is preparing to invade, adding that the evacuations from rebel-held provinces in Ukraine today are an example of Moscow using misinformation as a pretext for war. ""If Russia doesn't invade we would be relieved,"" she told reporters on Friday. She refused to say whether President Biden read the lengthy list of Russian demands that Moscow submitted to the US ambassador on Thursday. The news conference comes as Mr Biden holds a conference call with transatlantic Nato leaders. The call, she said, is ""an effort to have a conversation with his counterparts about what we are seeing, where things stand and continue that close co-ordination that's been going on for months now.""

"Covid passes have been required for large events such as football matches since last October People no longer have to show a Covid pass by law to get into large events, cinemas and nightclubs in Wales as rules are scrapped. Venues are no longer required to ask customers for proof of two Covid jabs, or a recent negative lateral flow test result, as of Friday. Ministers had said the pass would help businesses to stay open, but critics had raised ethical concerns. A theatre director said it was the right decision at the right time. Introduced in October, anyone over the age of 18 was legally required to show a pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, to get into certain events, cinemas and nightclubs. Opponents had questioned the effectiveness of the scheme, which was one of Wales' last remaining Covid rules, and the Welsh Conservatives said they have ""never shown any sign of success"". It comes after a civil liberties group said Welsh ministers told them in 2021 the passes might have a ""small, and probably unmeasurable"" impact on serious Covid cases. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Lateral flow test rule for Covid pass tightened Should all coronavirus restrictions end in Wales? The Covid pass law expired at 0000 GMT on Friday morning. While they will no longer have to be shown as a legal requirement, events and venues can still ask for them if they choose to. Scrapping Covid passes is the first step in a three week plan to further ease Wales' coronavirus rules. On 28 February, facemasks regulations will be reduced so they are only required in shops, including hairdressers and salons, on public transport and in health and social care. They will no longer be required in other venues - including museums and cinemas - from that date. Welsh ministers could scrap the remaining regulations, including self-isolation restrictions and the mask rules,by the end of next month. No precise date has been fixed, although ministers are expected to make their decision on or around 3 March. Mask rules have already been repealed in England and self-isolation restrictionscould end there this month. Theatr Clwyd's executive director said it was the right decision at the right time Liam Evans-Ford, the executive director of Theatr Clwyd, in Mold, said his staff were ""overjoyed"" as policing the passes had become more challenging. ""Audience members have become a little less accepting of having to do it,"" he said. ""I think it's the right decision at the right time."" Scrapping the passes is ""a huge operational relief"" that gets rid of extra costs, he said. Covid passes have split opinion Liam Watkins, Marketing Manager at Sin City in Swansea, said the team were ""completely relieved"" that Covid passes had been scrapped. He said in one session the nightclub and gig venue could see up to 900 people passing through its doors, and that they had to create a separate queues for people renewing Covid passes. He explained that ""the lines have been longer, the waits have been longer"" and this had slowed down drinks sales and put pressure on staff. Almost two years on from the start of the pandemic, Liam said getting back to normality would be ""huge"". ""Six, seven months leading up to the whole pandemic we would be rammed every single session. ""We're hoping to get back to that point where we are back to being the golden ticket in town."" Cinemas were among the venues where the passes were required Silke Carlo of Big Brother Watch questioned how lawful the passes were if they had ""no noticeable effect on public health"". The civil liberties group claimed that last November Welsh ministers said the scheme ""might make only a small, and probably unmeasurable, contribution to reducing (or slowing the growth in) serious cases of Covid-19, hospitalisations and deaths"". The campaigners said ministers made the comment in a letter responding to their proposed legal action against the passes, which is not now going ahead. But the Welsh government disputed the group's interpretation. It said it was given advice last December that it would be ""challenging"" to identify the specific impact of the scheme. This video can not be played Cinema owner told to close for not requiring Covid passes said the scheme was discriminatory In their response to the legal challenge ministers argued that this was the reason the effect may be unmeasurable, not because the impact would be too small to be detectable. In a statement the Welsh government said the Covid passes were ""one measure - among many - to help keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. ""The venues where the Covid pass is required have been chosen because they are mostly indoors and they see large numbers of people congregating closely together for prolonged periods of time. ""As we know, the longer large numbers of people are close together, especially indoors, the greater the risk of transmission."" The Welsh government has in the past pointed to aone study,externalof Italy, Germany and France, which introduced Covid certificates, suggested they increased take up of the vaccine, prevented economic losses and reduced pressure on intensive care. The move to scrap Covid passes comes as cases continue to fall. One in 25 people in Wales had Covid in the week to 7 February, or 112,600 people, according to ONS stats provided by the infection survey, Hospital figures also continue to fall and less than 100 a day are primarily being treated for Covid. The average number of patients with confirmed Covid in hospital is 455 a day, down 15% in a week. It was nearly twice as high this time a year ago. Welsh Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport, Dawn Bowden, said: ""With increasing numbers of people vaccinated and boosted and thanks to the hard work and efforts of everyone across Wales, we are confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said: ""I am delighted to finally see the back of these totally failed, coercive, ineffective, costly, and unproven vaccine passports."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, urged Welsh Government to move forward ""as swiftly as possible"" to publish a plan for moving to ""the next, endemic phase"". ""But the pandemic isn't over, and in talking about rapidly lifting all measures at once UK Government appears to be looking to forget the seriousness of Covid, rather than sensibly learning to live with it."" Covid passes came into force aftera knife-edge votein the Senedd last year, which was described by hospitality industry leaders as a ""shambles"". Opposition from the Conservatives, Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds and, at the time, Plaid Cymru could have stopped them coming into force, but a single Tory Member of the Senedd away at party conference failed to vote.

"A photo of people helping the ambulance was shared on Fubar News Facebook page where hundreds of people wished the family well An ambulance rushing a baby girl to hospital in Aberdeenshire was rescued by members of the public after it became stuck in heavy snow. Ten-month-old Jessica Louise Macleod, who spent the first six months of her life in hospital with a congenital heart defect, became ill after developing breathing difficulties on Friday. At the same time, heavy snow from Storm Eunice was causing massive disruption to roads in the north east. The ambulance became stuck in snow as it raced to hospital in Aberdeen. Jessica Louise's mum, Melissa, 32, was amazed at how the public jumped immediately to help. She told BBC Scotland: ""It got stuck in the snow on the A96 while trying to get past other vehicles that were at a standstill. Jessica Louise Macleod was being taken to hospital in the ambulance when it became stuck ""Prior to this, there were vehicles not moving out of the way for the ambulance, so a lorry driver got out his vehicle and started walking down the road in the snow to tell people to move. ""Then the road went down to one treated lane and to get past, the ambulance had to drive on the untreated part of the road, where it became stuck. Literally within seconds there were people pushing the ambulance to free it."" Millions told to stay at home to avoid 90mph winds Railways reopen after Storm Dudley repairs Storms Dudley and Eunice: What you need to know They were freed quickly but the worry continued as a journey that would usually take 45 minutes in a car on a normal day, took the ambulance two hours with flashing lights and siren. Melissa added: ""I worried how long it was going to take to get there, but at that point Jessica Louise was stable and getting oxygen, plus she had been given some nebulisers at the GP which helped her breathe easier so she wasn't in any discomfort - thankfully."" Jessica Louise had been fighting a bug for the past two weeks. Her cough worsened on Tuesday and by Friday, Melissa called the doctor. The GP asked them to come to the surgery and it was on the car journey there that the baby deteriorated. The doctor diagnosed a respiratory infection and called an ambulance for oxygen support as the baby was transferred to hospital. After a dramatic journey, she is now on the mend at Aberdeen Children's hospital. Melissa and Donald Macleod are now looking after their daughter Jessica Louise in hospital Melissa said: ""Since we've been here a few hours and she has been started on medications she has perked up a bit, however I foresee us being in here for a few days to a week. ""But we went through a lot with Jessica Louise when she was born, so we are a little used to medical dramatics. Thankfully, this one is nowhere near anything like what we have been through with her before."" Jessica Louise's dad Donald took four hours to battle the snow on the A96 to bring things from home for the hospital stay. The relieved mum wanted to thank those who went the extra mile. ""Thank you to the paramedics for getting us there safely against all odds. Thank you to everyone who cleared the way for the ambulance to get past and the lorry driver who got out his vehicle to tell people to move over even though he was wearing shorts. ""And a special thank you to all of those who pushed the ambulance when it was stuck in the snow, had you not done this I'm not sure when we would have got to the hospital."" Storm Eunice cased the closure of hundreds of schools on Friday with Aberdeenshire hit the worst. Most of Scotland was under a Met Office yellow weather warning for snow from the early hours until 18:00. A yellow warning for ice then took over and will be in place until 09:00 on Saturday. Three people diedas fierce winds swept across the UK. Police in the north east of Scotland warned drivers only to travel if their journey was necessary, and said there were large tailbacks and significant delays in some areas. Some minor roads roads around Angus, parts of Aberdeenshire and Argyll and Bute were also affected by heavy snow. The Scottish government also urged people to exercise caution and follow the latest travel advice. Deputy First Minister John Swinney chaired the Scottish government's resilience room meeting on Thursday evening in response to Storms Dudley and Eunice.

"A photo of people helping the ambulance was shared on Fubar News Facebook page where hundreds of people wished the family well An ambulance rushing a baby girl to hospital in Aberdeenshire was rescued by members of the public after it became stuck in heavy snow. Ten-month-old Jessica Louise Macleod, who spent the first six months of her life in hospital with a congenital heart defect, became ill after developing breathing difficulties on Friday. At the same time, heavy snow from Storm Eunice was causing massive disruption to roads in the north east. The ambulance became stuck in snow as it raced to hospital in Aberdeen. Jessica Louise's mum, Melissa, 32, was amazed at how the public jumped immediately to help. She told BBC Scotland: ""It got stuck in the snow on the A96 while trying to get past other vehicles that were at a standstill. Jessica Louise Macleod was being taken to hospital in the ambulance when it became stuck ""Prior to this, there were vehicles not moving out of the way for the ambulance, so a lorry driver got out his vehicle and started walking down the road in the snow to tell people to move. ""Then the road went down to one treated lane and to get past, the ambulance had to drive on the untreated part of the road, where it became stuck. Literally within seconds there were people pushing the ambulance to free it."" Millions told to stay at home to avoid 90mph winds Railways reopen after Storm Dudley repairs Storms Dudley and Eunice: What you need to know They were freed quickly but the worry continued as a journey that would usually take 45 minutes in a car on a normal day, took the ambulance two hours with flashing lights and siren. Melissa added: ""I worried how long it was going to take to get there, but at that point Jessica Louise was stable and getting oxygen, plus she had been given some nebulisers at the GP which helped her breathe easier so she wasn't in any discomfort - thankfully."" Jessica Louise had been fighting a bug for the past two weeks. Her cough worsened on Tuesday and by Friday, Melissa called the doctor. The GP asked them to come to the surgery and it was on the car journey there that the baby deteriorated. The doctor diagnosed a respiratory infection and called an ambulance for oxygen support as the baby was transferred to hospital. After a dramatic journey, she is now on the mend at Aberdeen Children's hospital. Melissa and Donald Macleod are now looking after their daughter Jessica Louise in hospital Melissa said: ""Since we've been here a few hours and she has been started on medications she has perked up a bit, however I foresee us being in here for a few days to a week. ""But we went through a lot with Jessica Louise when she was born, so we are a little used to medical dramatics. Thankfully, this one is nowhere near anything like what we have been through with her before."" Jessica Louise's dad Donald took four hours to battle the snow on the A96 to bring things from home for the hospital stay. The relieved mum wanted to thank those who went the extra mile. ""Thank you to the paramedics for getting us there safely against all odds. Thank you to everyone who cleared the way for the ambulance to get past and the lorry driver who got out his vehicle to tell people to move over even though he was wearing shorts. ""And a special thank you to all of those who pushed the ambulance when it was stuck in the snow, had you not done this I'm not sure when we would have got to the hospital."" Storm Eunice cased the closure of hundreds of schools on Friday with Aberdeenshire hit the worst. Most of Scotland was under a Met Office yellow weather warning for snow from the early hours until 18:00. A yellow warning for ice then took over and will be in place until 09:00 on Saturday. Three people diedas fierce winds swept across the UK. Police in the north east of Scotland warned drivers only to travel if their journey was necessary, and said there were large tailbacks and significant delays in some areas. Some minor roads roads around Angus, parts of Aberdeenshire and Argyll and Bute were also affected by heavy snow.

"Former Titans members told the BBC they had stopped participating in the sport they loved An elite swimming club is to be wound down after an investigation found widespread failures to protect child members who had suffered eating disorders, bullying and serious mental health issues. Former members of Ellesmere College Titans, where several world-class athletes trained, have told the BBC a toxic environment had ruined their love of the sport. An investigation into the club, based at independent boarding school Ellesmere College, in Shropshire, began in 2020 when parents contacted governing body Swim England concerned about children's welfare. A year-long probe by a child safeguarding expert uncovered more than 70 separate complaints concerning some coaches' behaviour and the club management's failure to deal with multiple serious issues concerning the children. Allegations in the confidential report, which the BBC has seen and is publishing excerpts from in the public interest, include a number of children's attempted suicides not being reported as well as incidents of self-harm. Warning: This article contains details some people may find distressing Derogatory comments were allegedly made towards swimmers, including sexual and personal remarks, the July 2021 report found. Some girls developed eating disorders which were linked to a controversial regime of weighing the children as young as 10, with the results publicised among teammates. Former members have told the BBC they were fat-shamed by their coaches, leading them to become ""obsessed"" with losing weight. ""Swimming was my life and I only spoke out about what happened to me so I could stop other young people experiencing eating disorders and the anxiety that I suffered with for years,"" one swimmer said. Titans' director of swimming, world silver medallist Alan Bircher, was suspended and subsequently stopped from forming part of Team GB's Tokyo 2020 coaching squad last year. Coach Danny Proffitt was also suspended for four months and has recently returned to work at the club. Alan Bircher, pictured in his competing days, helped to run Ellesmere College Titans Ellesmere College Titans was formed in 2008 and has had huge success nurturing young talent. Elite swimmers who trained there before representing their country include Freya Anderson, who won Olympic gold in the mixed relay at Tokyo 2020; Hector Pardoe, who made his Olympic open water swimming debut for Team GB at those games; and backstroke specialist Cassie Wild. Titans' reputation for producing world-class swimmers means children come from all over the UK to train there, with about two-thirds of club members, some as young as 10, attending Ellesmere College. Some families relocate to Shropshire to make life easier for their sons and daughters at the school, which costs up to Â£35,000 a year to attend. The passion of the youngsters is evident - many dream of competing for their country, while others simply have a love of the sport and want to progress as far as they can. The club takes its name from the Titans in Greek mythology - a race of ""godlike giants"", says its website - and swimmers train before and after lessons; the top squad are in the pool for more than 20 hours a week. ""Many people have had good experiences at Titans,"" said a former swimmer. ""If you were swimming well, then you were OK. But the favourites did not have the same experience as some of the rest of us."" Many Titans swimmers, including Olympic gold medallist Freya Anderson, have gone on to have hugely successful careers The BBC has spoken to multiple complainants who have voiced serious concerns about practices at the club. Three of those have shared their stories concerning their time at Titans when they were teenagers. They include being body-shamed in front of others, regularly sworn and shouted at, forced to train while injured and highly-offensive sexual comments being made about female swimmers. Zara* said she had developed an eating disorder after becoming fixated with losing weight following comments made by Mr Bircher. ""We were weighed by Alan every week from an early age,"" she said. ""It was in front of the whole squad and our names were on a white board. ""It was noted if we put on any weight at all - even 0.2kg,"" she said. ""And then if we didn't swim well, he'd suggest it was because we'd put weight on. ""We were young women, our bodies were changing all the time, but Alan made it feel like, if you lost weight, you'd be the best."" It was when she didn't think she was losing weight quickly enough that Zara's eating disorder became very serious. ""It became such an obsession - I just wanted to be a better swimmer,"" she said. Help and support is available at BBC Action Line Swim England changed its policy on weighing swimmers after hearing the testimonies of Ellesmere members She eventually told a senior member of Titans about the severity of her condition but said she had never received any help from the club and her problems had continued for some years. ""Alan wasn't there as a coach, he wasn't supportive,"" she said. ""I had no idea why but he made me feel like [not losing weight] was my fault. ""I was really damaged by it all and suffered anxiety attacks. I still struggle with body image today and it's taken a lot of support for me to get over it."" Another swimmer, Rachel*, said she too was traumatised by having her weight publicised and also developed eating issues. ""One week I was told I needed to lose 10kg,"" she said. ""Alan would give us tips on how to lose weight - such as chew your food 100 times, that sort of thing. ""He'd also watch us in the dining room. We'd go and have breakfast after training and he'd turn up to see what we were eating. If it was a hash brown, he'd say we shouldn't be having it. ""I lost a lot of weight really quickly. At my previous club we had food logs, where our coaches would see if we were getting the right nutrition for our training. ""But at Titans you felt like you had to eat as little as possible and that you were constantly being watched. It's left a lasting impression on me."" After his suspension, many swimmers came out in support of Alan Bircher Rachel said offensively swearing at the swimmers was part of Mr Bircher's regime, especially when he did not think a student had performed well in the pool. ""Even if he thought he was doing it to motivate us, you just can't speak to a 12 or 13-year-old girl like that. ""I felt so alone, there was just no support. And you felt like you couldn't say anything about what was happening because you'd be kicked out."" Louise* said she remembered regularly crying while speaking to her mum following training, after being constantly put down by her coach Danny Proffitt. ""It reached a point so bad that we were exploring the option of pulling me out of boarding, renting a cottage and mum moving hours away from our family to support me,"" she said. Her optimism at training with Titans, she said, had been ""shattered"" by Mr Proffitt, who she said would often resort to ""shouting abuse, harsh punishments, constant criticisms and negative comparisons"". ""I dreaded going to training and crossed my fingers every day that Danny would be in a good mood, which meant less mental anguish and abuse for us,"" she said. She too had comments made about her weight, she said. ""He would say things such as 'you're looking a bit big there' or 'you need to eat a bit less and train harder'. ""I lost a lot of weight very quickly as a result."" The Titans website said Mr Proffitt began coaching at 18 Louise also said Mr Proffitt did not take the swimmers' injuries or illnesses seriously. She said while recovering from one injury, he had been ""pushing me way beyond my physical abilities and punishing me or others with excruciating physical punishments if we didn't make turn-around times. ""One was wall sits for many minutes until we were screaming with pain."" Even when highly inappropriate comments were made, Louise said she was still fearful of reporting Mr Proffitt, who she described as unprofessional and immature. She was told by other swimmers Mr Proffitt had made an offensive and insulting sexual comment about her and some of the other girls. When they confronted him, Louise said he had started laughing and made another sexual remark. ""The boys started laughing uncontrollably and the girls of the squad stood in utter disbelief,"" said Louise. ""It was completely and utterly unacceptable and inappropriate."" She said Mr Proffitt had later apologised when the girls complained, but she wished action had been taken against him. ""I was continuously threatened they could remove me from the club, so I kept quiet so that I could keep my scholarship."" When Alan Bircher and Danny Proffitt were suspended, more than 80 past and current swimmers signed a letter of support saying none of them had experienced ""any hurtful or damaging behaviour"" from them. The letter said Mr Bircher created a ""fun, exciting and elite training environment"". There is still a widely held belief among some club supporters the complaints have been instigated by vindictive parents whose children did not progress as far as they had wished. Hector Pardoe, who was injured during his Olympic debut, was among more than 80 swimmers backing the coaches For those who had raised serious concerns with Swim England, the letter was a devastating blow. ""I know that other people saw how we were treated,"" said Rachel. ""Just because it didn't happen to them doesn't mean it didn't happen. They knew how upsetting it was for others."" Rachel said she had had such high hopes of being a part of Titans. ""It was once an incredible club to be part of, but I watched it crumble. I could not function as a swimmer. ""Alan Bircher destroyed any hopes of some of these swimmers and the goals they wanted to reach. ""He took away something I loved and turned it into something I hated."" The BBC put all these allegations to the two coaches. Mr Proffitt said he had been advised not to comment. Mr Bircher issued a statement through the British Swimming Coaches Association which said: ""Alan Bircher proactively participated in a Swim England investigation into concerns raised at Ellesmere Titans. ""This investigation and its findings were confidential. Mr Bircher's involvement in related matters concluded in October 2021 and he is no longer involved in swimming in any capacity. ""He will make no further comment."" Swim England recentlychanged its guidance,externalon weighing swimmers following its investigation into Titans and now says only those under 18 on a ""nationally-supported pathway"" should be weighed as part of their training. No welfare concerns about swimmers were ever escalated from the Titans club to Swim England, the report said Titans swimming club was formed due to a ""meeting of minds"" between Ellesmere College and the parents of top swimmers to create ""an ambitious, positive and competitive swimming programme"", the club's website states. The two are run separately but there were ""clear overlaps"" due to the college's deputy head of pastoral, Ranjit Chatterjee, being chairman of Titans and other college staff on the club committee, the Swim England report found. Mr Chatterjee was also welfare officer of the club at the time many of the complaints by pupils and parents are said to have been made. The report found the swimming club's systems for dealing with safeguarding concerns raised were ""woefully inadequate"" and key members were untrained. No welfare concerns about swimmers were escalated to Swim England, it added. Mr Chatterjee was suspended from all Swim England activity for two years following the investigation. Ellesmere College gives out scholarships to young swimmers from across the country Last year the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) assessed Ellesmere College and as part of this looked into the care of its students who swim with Titans. It concluded the school""fails to ensure it provides a safe environment in which children can learn while they are taking part in the activities of the swimming club"". It also found the school's annual review of safeguarding ""does not include adequate consideration of the safeguarding of pupils"" who are members of Titans, and that it fails to make ""effective assessment of the potential risks"" in the swimming club. The college has been asked to make changes to its processes which will be reviewed, the ISI said. Neither headmaster Brendan Wignall nor Mr Chatterjee wished to comment publicly when approached by the BBC. However, the school has told the BBC Titans was not run by Ellesmere College and it now intended to establish its own swimming academy. But without accreditation to Swim England, it will rule children out of recognised competitions. The school added it was not aware of any incidents related to the Titans club. Swim England, which had been reviewing Titans' progress since its investigation concluded, said ""further and ongoing concerns"" had been raised which had resulted in its decision to dissolve the club. ""Following further careful consideration of all the information available, Swim England (alongside statutory agencies) have determined that there will be no affiliated club based at Ellesmere College going forward,"" it said. There are up to 60 children who are currently members of Titans and now face having to move clubs if they intend to compete. Many parents have contacted the BBC to say how worried they are about the impact of the changes on their children's education and swimming pursuits. Swim England said it would ""provide total support to the swimmers in transitioning to another affiliated club"". Some former swimmers are still having counselling years after leaving Titans, the Swim England report found It added: ""The welfare and wellbeing of all Swim England club members is of paramount importance, as is ensuring that all of our members have a positive experience in all of our aquatic sports. ""Our affiliated clubs are required to operate to high safeguarding standards at all times and critically to ensure they maintain a safe child-centred environment that is embedded into its culture. ""We are deeply troubled and saddened by any negative experiences children have in our sports and it is something we take extremely seriously and will continue to do so."" Itasked anyone with safeguarding concerns in the sport to report them,external. The new committee of Titans, formed in the summer of 2021, said it was ""very disappointed"" with Swim England's decision. ""We've addressed the concerns of Swim England's original findings and completed any remediation activities required by them,"" it said. ""We are shocked given the hard work that has been put in across the club over many months. We've worked closely with Swim England and Ellesmere College throughout this period to enable our talented swimmers to continue to pursue their ambitions as Ellesmere College Titans. ""As a committee, we would like to thank the interim and new coaching staff, poolside assistants, parent volunteers and officials who have allowed the club to continue to operate throughout this period, drawing a clear line under the historical allegations made against the club."" It added it was ""proud"" of the current swimmers dealing with the impact of the decision on ""the club that they love"". Shropshire Council said it was ""liaising with Swim England and Ellesmere College to manage and resolve any allegations"". Children's charity the NSPCC said it had been made aware of the investigation into Ellesmere College Titans. ""Coaches, above all else, must safeguard young people while all organisations should set minimum professional standards whether they are affiliated to a national governing body or not. ""Any breaches of these should be reported and robustly investigated alongside statutory child protection agencies and appropriate action taken, if necessary."" *All names of swimmers have been changed Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval, comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, in 2008 Brad Pitt is suing his ex-wife Angelina Jolie for selling her stake in the French vineyard they bought together. The couple purchased a controlling interest in Chateau Miraval in 2008 and got married there six years later. Pitt says he and his former wife agreed not to sell their stakes in the venue without the permission of the other. But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to the lawsuit. Jolie has not yet commented. Lawyers for the Oscar-winning actor said Chateau Miraval, comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, had ""become Pitt's passion"" and, under his stewardship, had grown into a ""multimillion-dollar international success story"". The Miraval estate is in the village of Correns in south-east France The legal documents, filed in Los Angeles on Thursday, said Pitt helped ensure the profitability of vineyard, which was ""one of the world's most highly regarded producers of rose wine"". He said Jolie sold her stake without his knowledge to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian businessman Yuri Shefler. ""She sold her interest with the knowledge and intention that Shefler and his affiliates would seek to control the business to which Pitt had devoted himself and to undermine Pitt's investment in Miraval,"" the lawsuit claimed. His lawyers said the move had intended to cause ""gratuitous harm"" to Pitt, who had ""poured money and sweat equity into the wine business"". Jolie and Pitt got divorced in 2016 The Miraval estate, in the village of Correns in south-east France, was reportedly bought by the couple for around 25 million euros (Â£20.9m). Pitt and Jolie dated for 10 years before marrying in 2014.She filed for divorcein 2016. Jolie ""informed Pitt in writing"" of her decision to sell to Shefler in January 2021, saying she had reached a ""painful decision, with a heavy heart"", the suit alleges. Lawyers for Pitt have requested a trial by jury. The BBC has contacted Jolie's representatives for comment.

"Western leaders repeated warnings that a Russian invasion could come in the next few days The British Embassy office in the capital Kyiv is temporarily relocating to the western city of Lviv Russia has been accused of staging a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine as a pretext for invasion Russian President Vladimir Putin said the situation in Eastern Ukraine was deteriorating Russia has been backing rebels in separatist-held areas there since 2014 Russia continues to increase the number of troops around Ukraine according to US officials Moscow continues to deny planning an invasion of Ukraine and accuses the West of stoking ""hysteria"" Edited by Deirdre Finnerty We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a round-up of some of Friday's key developments: Keep up with all thelatest developments here. A former high-ranking US national security official believes that Russia is working to manipulate media perceptions at home and abroad ahead of a potential invasion of Ukraine. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, an ex-senior analyst at the CIA and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said she believes Russia is ""accelerating its efforts in the information domain"" to build the case for conflict. As examples, she pointed to Russian media coverage of purported mass graves discovered in separatist areas or the recent shelling of a kindergarten, which Russian-backed separatists blamed on Ukraine. ""The Russian media is really trying to spin this all up as Ukraine mounting an offensive,"" she said. ""It creates justification."" Kendall-Taylor added that Russian military doctrine views the ""information space"" as a key part of their competition with the US and the West. She added that this sort of media is aimed both at the Russian public and at external observers across the world. ""They're going to flood the information space with fabricated stories and half-truths in order to confuse and disorient, and make it hard for outside observers to discern the truth,"" she said.  The BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg sounds a note of scepticism about Russian claims of Ukrainian shelling in an eastern breakaway region. Allow Twitter content?

Russian media is reporting a fire at a gas pipeline has reportedly been put out. The BBC could not independently verify the reports. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. State media agency RIA has reported the director of the energy company that operates the pipeline has blamed ""sabotage"". It is unclear whether a second blaze reported in the Luhansk area has also been put out. US officials have said Russia may attempt to manufacture a reason to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russian has denied the allegations. Russian news agencies have reported a second explosion in the separatist-held Luhansk area. A number of Russian media outlets, including Tass, Ria Novosti and Interfax - citing separatist sources - have reported the blast, which came approximately 40 minutes after another explosion was reported at a gas pipeline in the area. The causes of the explosions remain unclear. No casualties have so far been reported. Unverified video being shared on Twitter appears to show flames at the site of the explosion.

Kyiv's Independence Square, pictured on Friday President Biden says that Russian forces intend to strike at Ukraine's capital Kyiv. In his remarks at the White House, Biden said that the US believes that Russian forces are likely to act ""in the coming week"". ""We believe that they will target Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people,"" he said. Biden added that the US is ""calling out"" Russia's plans repeatedly in a bid to ""remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving"". Biden is asked if the Ukrainian president's decision to attend the Munich Security Conference tomorrow is wise given the tensions with Russia, to which he says it is the president's call.  ""To be clear, you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine, is that what you just said?"" Biden is asked. ""Yes,"" he replies. Mr Biden says that Russia is pushing out ""more and more disinformation to the Russia public"" including allegations that Ukraine is planning an offensive into rebel-held territory. ""There is simply no evidence for these assertions and it defies basic logic,"" he says. He says that Ukraine would not make any military advances in the region while the Russian build-up of troops along its borders continues. ""Throughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgement and restraint,"" Mr Biden adds. ""They refuse to let the Russian troops bait them into war."" He goes on to call for Russia to avoid a ""catastrophic and needless war of choice"". ""Russia has still choose diplomacy. It's not too late to return to the negotiation table."" Biden says Nato allies are ""united and resolved"" in the face of Russian disinformation. He accuses Russia of trying to ""set up false justification"" for war against Ukraine. The White House has just provided a readout of Mr Biden's call with western leaders. The 45-minute meeting was held to discuss ""the likelihood of further Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" according to the statement. The leaders also ""expressed deep concern over Russiaâs continued build-up of forces, reiterated their strong support for Ukraineâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and discussed the importance of further economic assistance to Ukraine"". The group also pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy and discussed efforts to ""ensure the defence and security of Nato's eastern flank"". The call was joined by the leaders of Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Nato the European Commission and the European Council. President Biden has started speaking about the situation in Ukraine, beginning by describing calls he has made with the US Congress and with US allies. Video being widely shared on social media purports to show a large explosion in Luhansk, the capital and administrative centre of the Russian-backed separatist Luhansk People's Republic. The video could not be immediately verified, but has been reported as being from a gas pipeline that caught on fire. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. Tensions have been high in the region following repeated US claims that Russia is planning a ""false flag"" operation to give it a pretext to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade Ukraine.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has become the latest Western nation to accuse Russian intelligence of being behind a cyberattack on the Ukrainian government and bank websites earlier this week. Earlier, US officials claimed Russia was behind the hack that targeted the Ukrainian defence ministry and two of the country's biggest financial institutions. Moscow has denied responsibility for the attacks. The UK foreign office says the attacks had ""involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate"". It adds: ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underline the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity"". The video of separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik ordering an evacuation was recorded two days ago, according to metadata As Ukraine accuses Russia of trying to create a fake crisis in the breakaway eastern region of Donbas, the BBC has obtained evidence that casts doubt on claims made by pro-Russian separatists that a Ukrainian assault is imminent. Earlier today, the leadership of the pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk rebel republics in eastern Ukraine released videos giving details of the evacuation of residents. In one of the videos, the leader claims that, due to Ukrainian shelling, the order has been given to evacuate civilians, saying: âToday, Friday 18 Februaryâ¦"". Following reports on social media, the BBC has checked the metadata of the videos posted, and has found that the metadata shows they were recorded on Wednesday 16 February - two days ago, before the recent flare-up in hostilities. This suggests that the escalation was pre-planned. President Biden is due to make a televised address in the coming moments. It comes after a 45-minute phone call he held earlier today with western leaders. The White House says that it is up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to decide whether to leave his country to attend a security conference in Munich, Germany. ""Regardless of what decision he makes, he will have the support of the United States,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. The Munich Security Conference was founded in 1963 as a way for Western leaders to discuss threats and dangers. Russia is not attending for first time since 1999. The US is prepared to unleash major sanctions that would inhibit Russia's ability to import technology from other countries, including China, according to a top US economic official. Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh said the US was prepared to launch crippling sanctions in the event that Russia ""weaponises its energy supply"" by cutting off supplies to western Europe. He added that measures to ban Russia from the Swift electronic financial system - a network used by global banks to transfer money - are not likely to be included in the initial sanctions package in the event of invasion. As we await to hear from President Joe Biden at 21:00GMT, here's a round-up of the key events in the Ukraine crisis so far today: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says that the US continues to believe that Russia is preparing to invade, adding that the evacuations from rebel-held provinces in Ukraine today are an example of Moscow using misinformation as a pretext for war. ""If Russia doesn't invade we would be relieved,"" she told reporters on Friday. She refused to say whether President Biden read the lengthy list of Russian demands that Moscow submitted to the US ambassador on Thursday. The news conference comes as Mr Biden holds a conference call with transatlantic Nato leaders. The call, she said, is ""an effort to have a conversation with his counterparts about what we are seeing, where things stand and continue that close co-ordination that's been going on for months now.""

"Western leaders repeated warnings that a Russian invasion could come in the next few days The British Embassy office in the capital Kyiv is temporarily relocating to the western city of Lviv Russia has been accused of staging a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine as a pretext for invasion Russian President Vladimir Putin said the situation in Eastern Ukraine was deteriorating Russia has been backing rebels in separatist-held areas there since 2014 Russia continues to increase the number of troops around Ukraine according to US officials Moscow continues to deny planning an invasion of Ukraine and accuses the West of stoking ""hysteria"" Edited by Deirdre Finnerty We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a round-up of some of Friday's key developments: Keep up with all thelatest developments here. A former high-ranking US national security official believes that Russia is working to manipulate media perceptions at home and abroad ahead of a potential invasion of Ukraine. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, an ex-senior analyst at the CIA and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said she believes Russia is ""accelerating its efforts in the information domain"" to build the case for conflict. As examples, she pointed to Russian media coverage of purported mass graves discovered in separatist areas or the recent shelling of a kindergarten, which Russian-backed separatists blamed on Ukraine. ""The Russian media is really trying to spin this all up as Ukraine mounting an offensive,"" she said. ""It creates justification."" Kendall-Taylor added that Russian military doctrine views the ""information space"" as a key part of their competition with the US and the West. She added that this sort of media is aimed both at the Russian public and at external observers across the world. ""They're going to flood the information space with fabricated stories and half-truths in order to confuse and disorient, and make it hard for outside observers to discern the truth,"" she said.  The BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg sounds a note of scepticism about Russian claims of Ukrainian shelling in an eastern breakaway region. Allow Twitter content?

Russian media is reporting a fire at a gas pipeline has reportedly been put out. The BBC could not independently verify the reports. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. State media agency RIA has reported the director of the energy company that operates the pipeline has blamed ""sabotage"". It is unclear whether a second blaze reported in the Luhansk area has also been put out. US officials have said Russia may attempt to manufacture a reason to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russian has denied the allegations. Russian news agencies have reported a second explosion in the separatist-held Luhansk area. A number of Russian media outlets, including Tass, Ria Novosti and Interfax - citing separatist sources - have reported the blast, which came approximately 40 minutes after another explosion was reported at a gas pipeline in the area. The causes of the explosions remain unclear. No casualties have so far been reported. Unverified video being shared on Twitter appears to show flames at the site of the explosion.

Kyiv's Independence Square, pictured on Friday President Biden says that Russian forces intend to strike at Ukraine's capital Kyiv. In his remarks at the White House, Biden said that the US believes that Russian forces are likely to act ""in the coming week"". ""We believe that they will target Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people,"" he said. Biden added that the US is ""calling out"" Russia's plans repeatedly in a bid to ""remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving"". Biden is asked if the Ukrainian president's decision to attend the Munich Security Conference tomorrow is wise given the tensions with Russia, to which he says it is the president's call.  ""To be clear, you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine, is that what you just said?"" Biden is asked. ""Yes,"" he replies. Mr Biden says that Russia is pushing out ""more and more disinformation to the Russia public"" including allegations that Ukraine is planning an offensive into rebel-held territory. ""There is simply no evidence for these assertions and it defies basic logic,"" he says. He says that Ukraine would not make any military advances in the region while the Russian build-up of troops along its borders continues. ""Throughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgement and restraint,"" Mr Biden adds. ""They refuse to let the Russian troops bait them into war."" He goes on to call for Russia to avoid a ""catastrophic and needless war of choice"". ""Russia has still choose diplomacy. It's not too late to return to the negotiation table."" Biden says Nato allies are ""united and resolved"" in the face of Russian disinformation. He accuses Russia of trying to ""set up false justification"" for war against Ukraine. The White House has just provided a readout of Mr Biden's call with western leaders. The 45-minute meeting was held to discuss ""the likelihood of further Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" according to the statement. The leaders also ""expressed deep concern over Russiaâs continued build-up of forces, reiterated their strong support for Ukraineâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and discussed the importance of further economic assistance to Ukraine"". The group also pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy and discussed efforts to ""ensure the defence and security of Nato's eastern flank"". The call was joined by the leaders of Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Nato the European Commission and the European Council. President Biden has started speaking about the situation in Ukraine, beginning by describing calls he has made with the US Congress and with US allies. Video being widely shared on social media purports to show a large explosion in Luhansk, the capital and administrative centre of the Russian-backed separatist Luhansk People's Republic. The video could not be immediately verified, but has been reported as being from a gas pipeline that caught on fire. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. Tensions have been high in the region following repeated US claims that Russia is planning a ""false flag"" operation to give it a pretext to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade Ukraine.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has become the latest Western nation to accuse Russian intelligence of being behind a cyberattack on the Ukrainian government and bank websites earlier this week. Earlier, US officials claimed Russia was behind the hack that targeted the Ukrainian defence ministry and two of the country's biggest financial institutions. Moscow has denied responsibility for the attacks. The UK foreign office says the attacks had ""involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate"". It adds: ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underline the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity"". The video of separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik ordering an evacuation was recorded two days ago, according to metadata As Ukraine accuses Russia of trying to create a fake crisis in the breakaway eastern region of Donbas, the BBC has obtained evidence that casts doubt on claims made by pro-Russian separatists that a Ukrainian assault is imminent. Earlier today, the leadership of the pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk rebel republics in eastern Ukraine released videos giving details of the evacuation of residents. In one of the videos, the leader claims that, due to Ukrainian shelling, the order has been given to evacuate civilians, saying: âToday, Friday 18 Februaryâ¦"".

"People who dusted off their insurance policies when Storm Eunice hit the UK should keep them handy as more bad weather is on the way - this time with Storm Franklin. The Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for Northern Ireland for Monday morning and yellow ones for parts of the UK from Sunday. It has said that Storm Franklin's high winds could cause further power cuts, transport delays and damage to properties. Storm Franklin: More wind warnings after Storm Eunice The insurance company Aviva says a storm generally involves violent winds, accompanied by rain, hail or snow which is ""capable of causing damage to a building in a one-off event"". According to its own research, about 6.4 million households have previously experienced damage to their homes due to extreme weather. Storms Dudley and Eunice: What you need to know What's the best way to prevent flooding? People should check their buildings and contents insurance policies, but most insurers will cover damage caused by storms. However, it is important to check the wording as some things are not covered. For example, most building insurance policies will not pay out for storm damage to fences, hedges or gates. Insurers don't generally cover damage to buildings which are already damaged or have maintenance issues, such as: Cement or mortar deterioration on brickwork and chimneys Failed render on the outside of the building Existing deterioration to any part of the roof or building Aged flat roofs Aviva says it is useful if customers have receipts and photographs of items that might be missing. Meanwhile, if your car is damaged, Swinton Insurance says if you have comprehensive insurance - which pays out regardless of who is at fault of the damage - you should be covered. In a scenario where a tree falls from someone's garden and hits a car on the street, the owner of the car would have to claim on their own policy, Aviva says. Most insurers will cover damage caused by storms If your home or belongings have been damaged, you should contact your insurer as soon as possible and let them know what's happened. You should also make a list of the damage to your property and avoid throwing anything away in case it's required during a claims process. Taking photos of the damage is also recommended. Typical damage to properties from storms can include: Tiles or slates being dislodged Entire felt roofs lifted off Damage caused by fallen trees Water damage due to flooding Most insurance policies won't pay out for damaged fences This will depend on the extent and the type of damage. According to consumer website Money Saving Expert, home insurance nearly always includes cover for alternative accommodation, if you are unable to live in your own property. If you claim on your insurance because of storm damage, you may have to pay for the excess on your policy, according to price comparison website Money Supermarket. It says premiums might also go up after making a claim, or you may lose any no claims bonus - though some insurers protect this in the event of storm damage. Storm damage often falls under the ""at-fault"" category on claims, as it is considered an act of nature. So an insurer won't be able to claim the costs against another driver at fault, as they might in the event of a car accident. Rising insurance premiums will also depend on the individual circumstances of the customer, which is based on a wide range of factors, such as any previous claims.

" It was just a snowman. But as winter descended on a starving Afghan population, the heavy snow brought joy to a small corner of Kabul. A group of young women had stopped next to the snowman to take selfies. As they giggled and looked at their phones, they could have been anywhere. Then three Taliban fighters spotted them. They came closer - the women fled. With a smile, one stepped towards the snowman - which perhaps he thought was un-Islamic. He tore off the stick arms, carefully removed the stone eyes, the nose too. Finally, a swift beheading. I had just arrived back in Kabul after 10 years away and had already been lectured by a member of the Taliban about my lack of understanding of Afghan culture. He claimed to know what was best for Afghan women. ""Blue-eyed devils"" (Westerners) had corrupted the country, he appeared to suggest. Rather than take his word for it, I wanted to hear from women themselves. Many are in hiding, all fear for their future and some for their lives. There are still women on the streets of Kabul, some still in Western clothes and headscarves, but their freedom is under attack - the freedom to work, study, move freely and to lead independent lives. I met women who had been forced into the shadows of a new Afghanistan, who took great risks to express their views freely. They could only do so anonymously - except for Fatima, who insisted on showing her face. The Taliban have stolen Fatima’s future twice. The last time they ruled Afghanistan, she was forced into marriage at the age of 14 and her education came to an abrupt end. This time around, the 44-year-old midwife may still have a job, but like many women I spoke to, every-day life has diminished. Fatima’s education and employment were hard won. After getting married, she didn’t resume her studies until she was 32. By then, the Taliban had long gone from power. But it still wasn’t easy - even under the new democratic Afghan republic. I humbly request the Taliban do not meddle in women’s rights to education and employment. Otherwise, they are amputating one arm from the body of society She says she did a number of fast-track courses within a short space of time - but there were times when she wasn’t allowed to study. “They would take one look at my ID card and say, ‘You are too old to sit in classes with other students.’” She finally completed her degree two years ago - but again she faced another hurdle. “It was hard enough for a girl to get educated in Afghanistan, imagine how difficult it was for an old married wife to get hired.” But Fatima succeeded and has since delivered thousands of babies. “I wanted to work in an area where I would be able to train women,” she says. “When a woman is educated, she raises healthy and fruitful children. By doing so, she can present a meaningful child to society - one that will bring about change.” Fatima appears to accept that Taliban control is likely to be permanent, but hopes this time around, they can govern differently.  “I humbly request the Taliban do not meddle in women’s right to education and employment,” she tells me. “Otherwise, they are amputating one arm from the body of society. Our society is made of two pillars, a pillar of men and another pillar of women. How can you run your life one-sided and one-handed?” Fatima is fortunate in that she still has a job. “The Taliban cannot ban me from working in the hospital because they know that it is needed,” she says. But she hasn’t been paid in months - and for that she blames Western sanctions, not the Taliban. “America and the international community have blocked Afghanistan’s money,” she says. Fatima often works a 24-hour shift, delivering as many as 23 babies in that time. But there's no money to feed the patients or staff. And she has a message for the US and the international community: “Sanctions on the Taliban will kill us faster than the violation of our rights by the Taliban. A girl dies from hunger and a mother either sells her daughter because of hunger or from pressure to marry her by force. The issue of their education and literacy is meaningless when you’re dying from hunger.” Life, of course, isn’t just about work - and Fatima grieves for everything she has lost. She says she lies awake long into the night worrying. Her hair has started to fall out from the stress of the past five months. And there have been other changes too. In her spare time, she is a tapestry artist. She shows me her work - representations of traditional scenes, such as the country’s national sport Buzkashi, where men on horseback fight to score goals with an animal carcass. But her more recent work captures many of the changes of the past few months. There are tapestries depicting the evacuation of men and women from Kabul airport in the days following the Taliban’s arrival in the city. Others show women being stared at and women clad in burkas. Her work, she says, now focuses on the missing in Afghan society - those who left the country, the women who have disappeared from her neighbourhood, and those who never leave the house. The evacuation of Kabul inspired Fatima's latest tapestries Fatima used to teach other women to sew - women who, she says, were able to make good money from selling their work. But the Taliban view the tapestries as un-Islamic, and those women are now stuck at home. “We were taking part in exhibitions within Afghanistan and outside - and we were making a profit,” Fatima explains. “[Those women] were the breadwinners of their families.” Private spaces for women are vanishing. “I had a friend who I shared my life stories with - my secrets. But now she’s working in one hospital and I in another.” Fatima laments that they can no longer meet alone. And she tells me how she went to the beauty parlour recently, only to find a picture of a woman which had been defaced - ink had been thrown all over it. “I asked why the woman’s picture had been scratched out. They replied that the Taliban had warned them three times to cover it. “I have cried a lot for the women and for that picture with the blotted-out face on the door of the beauty salon.” For 29-year-old Ameena, beauty salons are the least of her concerns. She says she is scared for her life. On 15 August, she started the day by visiting a safe house belonging to the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the Afghan intelligence service. She had been pulling long days and nights, as province after province fell to the Taliban, bringing female agents back to what she thought would be the safety of Kabul. There she gave them money and paid their expenses, before heading to the NDS headquarters on the road to Kabul airport. The biggest pride for someone in the military is a weapon. It is very painful for us when a terrorist comes and disarms you “I was able to secure the transfer of around 100 NDS female staff from across the country. It was totally unbelievable to me that Kabul would fall into the hands of the Taliban,” she told me over a cup of green tea. “When I arrived at the office, I saw everybody upset and fleeing. I asked them where they were going. They said, ‘Madam, please leave the office - the Taliban have arrived.’” But Ameena returned to her desk joking, that because of the bad Kabul traffic she didn’t think the Taliban would be able to make it to NDS headquarters until the next morning. She says that, later on, human resources staff came to her and asked her what they should do as all the staff were leaving. “I asked them, ‘Where are all the officers?’” She learned that they had all left - apart from two of the deputy commanders. By around half past two that afternoon, Ameena left for home with an armed escort. She wouldn’t return to the NDS headquarters again. Earlier she had watched President Ashraf Ghani flanked by his minister of defence and the head of the NDS issue an order that Kabul must be saved by any means possible. Now, at home, she saw on the television that the Taliban were inside the presidential palace. President Ghani, too, had fled. Months later, she is still furious that he abandoned the country. “It was his responsibility to resist until his last breath because he was the chief commander of the entire Afghan national security forces,” she says. “A person taking the lead of the security forces must not flee and must stand to the last drop of his blood - the final moment of his life in the world.”  The following days were a nightmare. The Taliban searched her home but she had already left in fear of her life. The Taliban, she says, took her vehicle and a gun that she had left at home. ""The biggest pride for someone in the military is a weapon. It is very painful for us when a terrorist comes and disarms you."" Despite the Taliban’s steady takeover of the country, she believes Afghan forces were betrayed by politicians’ backroom deals. And perhaps in a state of denial, she hopes the West will again come to Afghanistan’s aid. Afghan forces endured “a huge amount of casualties”, she says. “I felt like their sacrifice and the sacrifice of my close colleagues have gone to dust.” She ends with a final plea to the US and UK: “The world and the international community must never forget our sacrifice, our endeavours and our efforts against the terrorist Taliban. And [not forget] the fact that we established a government over the past 20 years.” Mina makes no pleas to the West, except this: “Leave us alone,” she says firmly. After 20 years of Western assistance in Afghanistan, women’s rights were still under threat, even before the Taliban returned, she says. Mina is a brilliant student, having finished near the top of Afghanistan’s “Kankur” national exams, through which 300,000 students apply for some 50,000 places at university. After four years of study, she was just one month from graduation when the Taliban arrived. She says that “in a few hours” her future was altered. There would be no university diploma now.  Mina had hoped to become a diplomat like others in her family, and perhaps study at Oxford. But serving Afghanistan was always going to be a priority. “Without our education, our jobs are also under question and doubt. We don’t have bright prospects for our future,” she says. Without our education, we don't have bright prospects for our future Mina is quietly spoken but firm in her determination to succeed. The battle she describes to become educated, and independent, is not uncommon for Afghan women. “When I was born, my aunties cried out in shock, ‘Why a girl!’” Mina is a reminder that even before the Taliban, Afghanistan came bottom of almost every index on women’s rights. She grew up during the democratic Afghan republic, but still she says she had to fight for every little freedom. “Many people and relatives told me that law and political science is not good for girls.”  For Mina, and tens of thousands like her, all of those hard-won victories vanished overnight. Now she finds her world is much smaller. She spends most of her time in her room, working on her writing. But the picture she paints is complicated. She says there is less harassment on the streets now that the Taliban, with their reputation for brutality and swift justice, are in power. “One positive thing now is that we faced real problems on the street, many people used abusive words for girls, but now they can’t,” she says. When I ask why, she replies that they will be punished. But still she worries about going out. Many women say they fear they will be harassed at Taliban checkpoints for not being fully covered in a traditional veil, or for travelling alone without a male guardian. The Taliban have also been accused of searching women’s mobile phones for content they regard as inappropriate. She still speaks to her friends, but mostly via chat apps on her phone. And she hasn’t given up. Even as we sit there in a darkened room, with her identity obscured, she says she hopes not to be silenced. “I want to serve my country and speak for my gender's rights. I want to fight for my rights, my generation's rights,” she says. “I think it's a pleasure to fight for our rights, to fight for my family, my colleagues and my friends. I'm able to raise my voice.” Removing women from education will have long-term effects, but removing them from the workforce - as the Taliban have done in droves - is being felt immediately as Afghanistan faces its worst humanitarian crisis in a generation. Many women were the only breadwinners in their families. Zahra and Samira could star in their own buddy cop show. The two policewomen have known each other since childhood. They laugh and joke together and show me their target practice from the shooting range. Most of the shots are dead centre. American funding greatly expanded the number of women serving in the police force and the military. But that money disappeared when the last US troops left. Zahra remained at her post until the fall of Laghman Province east of Kabul. When the Taliban overwhelmed their forces, she thought about taking her own life. “We don’t know whether we live in our own country or somewhere else,” she says. “It is extremely hard now. It’s as if I can’t breathe. My children were attending schools, courses and universities, but not now.” I still stand ready to serve - I am waiting for that day to arrive Zahra She says the economic problems are getting worse by the day. “We’re stuck at home with no jobs and no earnings to support our lives.” And the women have lost more than just their incomes. Nodding in agreement beside her friend, Samira says: “I used to solve the biggest challenges of my life, but not now. I could go to my daughter’s school and walk freely in bazaars. I had money, had the power to buy things, and could introduce myself to others with pride, but not now. I have lost my sense of self. There is no identity left for me now.”  Samira reflects on the days after the Taliban seized power - when she sat in a quiet corner of her rooftop in Kabul watching the planes ascend into the skies, taking thousands of her countrywomen and men to safety. Zahra describes the months since then as if “black ink had been poured over white”. The women are afraid. Suspicious when new people arrive in their neighbourhood. The Taliban claim to have offered an amnesty for those who served the former government. However,  the UN says it has credible information that more than 100 people who served with the previous government have been killed since the Taliban takeover. I used to have money, have the power to buy things, and could introduce myself to others with pride, but not now because I have lost my sense of self Samira Alia Azizi, a police officer and head of a women’s prison, has been missing for four months. She has not been seen since she was called to work by Taliban officials. A social media campaign #FreeAliaAzizi is calling for her release. And four women who vanished with family members after attending a march for women’s rights in Kabul, were this week released. The Taliban consistently said it did not have the women. It also says it is not holding Alia Azizi. Zahra says because of these fears, her children say they wish their mother hadn’t served in the security services. “I tell them it is OK and I hope one day they will know that we have offered great services by sacrificing our lives, putting ourselves in huge danger and still standing ready to serve. So I am waiting for that day to arrive.” And she adds, “America and Nato encouraged us to take these jobs. We had training from so many ladies from America, Canada, Germany, Holland, Poland and a great many other countries. They said they would stand beside us - shoulder to shoulder - but in the end they have left us alone, abandoned.” Other than Fatima, the names of the women we spoke to have been changed to protect their identities.

"Covid passes have been required for large events such as football matches since last October People no longer have to show a Covid pass by law to get into large events, cinemas and nightclubs in Wales as rules are scrapped. Venues are no longer required to ask customers for proof of two Covid jabs, or a recent negative lateral flow test result, as of Friday. Ministers had said the pass would help businesses to stay open, but critics had raised ethical concerns. A theatre director said it was the right decision at the right time. Introduced in October, anyone over the age of 18 was legally required to show a pass to prove they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, to get into certain events, cinemas and nightclubs. Opponents had questioned the effectiveness of the scheme, which was one of Wales' last remaining Covid rules, and the Welsh Conservatives said they have ""never shown any sign of success"". It comes after a civil liberties group said Welsh ministers told them in 2021 the passes might have a ""small, and probably unmeasurable"" impact on serious Covid cases. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Lateral flow test rule for Covid pass tightened Should all coronavirus restrictions end in Wales? The Covid pass law expired at 0000 GMT on Friday morning. While they will no longer have to be shown as a legal requirement, events and venues can still ask for them if they choose to. Scrapping Covid passes is the first step in a three week plan to further ease Wales' coronavirus rules. On 28 February, facemasks regulations will be reduced so they are only required in shops, including hairdressers and salons, on public transport and in health and social care. They will no longer be required in other venues - including museums and cinemas - from that date. Welsh ministers could scrap the remaining regulations, including self-isolation restrictions and the mask rules,by the end of next month. No precise date has been fixed, although ministers are expected to make their decision on or around 3 March. Mask rules have already been repealed in England and self-isolation restrictionscould end there this month. Theatr Clwyd's executive director said it was the right decision at the right time Liam Evans-Ford, the executive director of Theatr Clwyd, in Mold, said his staff were ""overjoyed"" as policing the passes had become more challenging. ""Audience members have become a little less accepting of having to do it,"" he said. ""I think it's the right decision at the right time."" Scrapping the passes is ""a huge operational relief"" that gets rid of extra costs, he said. Covid passes have split opinion Liam Watkins, Marketing Manager at Sin City in Swansea, said the team were ""completely relieved"" that Covid passes had been scrapped. He said in one session the nightclub and gig venue could see up to 900 people passing through its doors, and that they had to create a separate queues for people renewing Covid passes. He explained that ""the lines have been longer, the waits have been longer"" and this had slowed down drinks sales and put pressure on staff. Almost two years on from the start of the pandemic, Liam said getting back to normality would be ""huge"". ""Six, seven months leading up to the whole pandemic we would be rammed every single session. ""We're hoping to get back to that point where we are back to being the golden ticket in town."" Cinemas were among the venues where the passes were required Silke Carlo of Big Brother Watch questioned how lawful the passes were if they had ""no noticeable effect on public health"". The civil liberties group claimed that last November Welsh ministers said the scheme ""might make only a small, and probably unmeasurable, contribution to reducing (or slowing the growth in) serious cases of Covid-19, hospitalisations and deaths"". The campaigners said ministers made the comment in a letter responding to their proposed legal action against the passes, which is not now going ahead. But the Welsh government disputed the group's interpretation. It said it was given advice last December that it would be ""challenging"" to identify the specific impact of the scheme. This video can not be played Cinema owner told to close for not requiring Covid passes said the scheme was discriminatory In their response to the legal challenge ministers argued that this was the reason the effect may be unmeasurable, not because the impact would be too small to be detectable. In a statement the Welsh government said the Covid passes were ""one measure - among many - to help keep businesses open while also helping to control the spread of the virus and protect the NHS. ""The venues where the Covid pass is required have been chosen because they are mostly indoors and they see large numbers of people congregating closely together for prolonged periods of time. ""As we know, the longer large numbers of people are close together, especially indoors, the greater the risk of transmission."" The Welsh government has in the past pointed to aone study,externalof Italy, Germany and France, which introduced Covid certificates, suggested they increased take up of the vaccine, prevented economic losses and reduced pressure on intensive care. The move to scrap Covid passes comes as cases continue to fall. One in 25 people in Wales had Covid in the week to 7 February, or 112,600 people, according to ONS stats provided by the infection survey, Hospital figures also continue to fall and less than 100 a day are primarily being treated for Covid. The average number of patients with confirmed Covid in hospital is 455 a day, down 15% in a week. It was nearly twice as high this time a year ago. Welsh Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport, Dawn Bowden, said: ""With increasing numbers of people vaccinated and boosted and thanks to the hard work and efforts of everyone across Wales, we are confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said: ""I am delighted to finally see the back of these totally failed, coercive, ineffective, costly, and unproven vaccine passports."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru's health spokesman, urged Welsh Government to move forward ""as swiftly as possible"" to publish a plan for moving to ""the next, endemic phase"". ""But the pandemic isn't over, and in talking about rapidly lifting all measures at once UK Government appears to be looking to forget the seriousness of Covid, rather than sensibly learning to live with it."" Covid passes came into force aftera knife-edge votein the Senedd last year, which was described by hospitality industry leaders as a ""shambles"". Opposition from the Conservatives, Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds and, at the time, Plaid Cymru could have stopped them coming into force, but a single Tory Member of the Senedd away at party conference failed to vote.

"Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she feels ""duty bound to speak up and help others"" after her own court case Last year, Haileigh Ashton Lamont saw her abuser jailed. The Belfast woman waived her anonymity to speak about the decade of childhood sexual abuse she had suffered at the hands of her stepfather. Tommy Harris receiveda 16-year sentence - eight to be spent in prison and eight on licence -after admitting 42 charges of sexual assault. Now, Haileigh wants to help other victims and survivors navigate the court system. She says the criminal justice system must change, and believes that change must start within society. ""By not speaking about child sexual abuse, the perpetrators are getting away with it,"" she told BBC News NI. ""There's absolutely no shame in talking about it and raising awareness to make people who are suffering feel supported. ""I'm never going to stop talking about this and I'm doing it because I don't want anyone to suffer the way I did because it was so tough. ""I feel duty bound to speak up and help others."" Haileigh believes that victims being given more information on the legal process, and being more involved, would improve the experience. ""Having gone through each stage of the process myself, I understand why some victims want to wash their hands of the process because it is re-traumatising,"" she said. ""And not knowing what to expect is hard. If victims were better prepared and had more knowledge, they could go to court with insight and support."" Haileigh is also calling for two legal changes. She does not think that defendants who plead guilty in historic abuse cases should be given reduced sentences. ""For me, the people who carried out this abuse had time to come forward. They're only in court because they were brought there, years later, so why should they get credit?"" she said. She also wants victims to be given the chance to deliver what is known as a victim impact statement in court. During her case, Haileigh was not allowed to read her statement in front of her abuser. ""That was so important for me, to face him like that, and I wasn't allowed to do it. And I felt brave and empowered to do it, but I wasn't allowed to,"" she said. ""It's not so much the words that you would say. It's the sound of your voice in a courtroom in front of other people saying: 'I've exposed you, you didn't get away with it. There are consequences.' ""We're not nameless or faceless statistics, and there's no shame so I think that victims should be able to stand in court and read out a statement and then choose, if they want to, to leave, never want to talk about it again - or confidently use their voice and be supported in doing that. ""We're not weak. What was done to us hasn't made us weak. ""Other people will want their anonymity and of course they should have that, but the choice should be there."" Haileigh Ashton Lamont last spoke to BBC News NI on the day her stepfather was jailed for abusing her Haileigh's case ended with a conviction but many other cases involving sexual abuse do not have the same outcome. The last available figures from the Public Prosecution Service show that between 2020 and 2021: 608 people were charged or reported for rape 26 defendants were brought to Crown Court for rape Eight people were convicted of rape ""My message has never been to encourage other victims to come forward,"" Haileigh said. ""I'm not saying you will go to police and your journey will be the same as mine, I know that's not the reality, and the statistics reflect that it's not going to be the same as my journey. ""All I want to do is to share my story to give other people hope and to better prepare victims for what to expect, if and when they do come forward. ""Whenever people hear a victim's story, I feel as though those sympathetic eyes need to turn to - what can we do to help? How are we going to change this? What can we do to come together and make a change? ""I respect that change will take time, but it does need to happen."" Haileigh has met Justice Minister Naomi Long to discuss her concerns. Naomi Long said the experience of abuse victims is crucial in shaping legislation to improve the justice system The minister told BBC News NI her department had introduced a two-year pilot scheme providing victims of sexual assault with sexual offences legal advisors to help guide them through the legal process. Ms Long said change takes time, but she is listening. ""We need to hear those real lived-in experiences that are sometimes less than perfect in order to challenge ourselves to do better,"" she said. ""Genuinely sitting down and listening to what victims have been through, working with them to try to address any deficit in the system, is to me one of the most important things we do as a department. ""It leads to real change, and I hope that Haileigh will see that too."" 'It has been a war, but today is my victory day' Man jailed for eight years for abusing stepdaughter 'While I was quiet, I was protecting a paedophile' After all that she has been through, would Haileigh go to court again? ""Every day I get up and I ask myself - if you'd have known everything you know now - back on the seventh of July 2020, when you walked into the police station, would you have still walked in?"" she said. ""And the answer is always, absolutely.""

"Pitt and Jolie bought Chateau Miraval, comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, in 2008 Brad Pitt is suing his ex-wife Angelina Jolie for selling her stake in the French vineyard they bought together. The couple purchased a controlling interest in Chateau Miraval in 2008 and got married there six years later. Pitt says he and his former wife agreed not to sell their stakes in the venue without the permission of the other. But Jolie sold her share to a spirits manufacturer owned by a Russian oligarch, according to the lawsuit. Jolie has not yet commented. Lawyers for the Oscar-winning actor said Chateau Miraval, comprising a home and vineyard in the south of France, had ""become Pitt's passion"" and, under his stewardship, had grown into a ""multimillion-dollar international success story"". The Miraval estate is in the village of Correns in south-east France The legal documents, filed in Los Angeles on Thursday, said Pitt helped ensure the profitability of vineyard, which was ""one of the world's most highly regarded producers of rose wine"". He said Jolie sold her stake without his knowledge to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian businessman Yuri Shefler. ""She sold her interest with the knowledge and intention that Shefler and his affiliates would seek to control the business to which Pitt had devoted himself and to undermine Pitt's investment in Miraval,"" the lawsuit claimed. His lawyers said the move had intended to cause ""gratuitous harm"" to Pitt, who had ""poured money and sweat equity into the wine business"". Jolie and Pitt got divorced in 2016 The Miraval estate, in the village of Correns in south-east France, was reportedly bought by the couple for around 25 million euros (Â£20.9m). Pitt and Jolie dated for 10 years before marrying in 2014.She filed for divorcein 2016. Jolie ""informed Pitt in writing"" of her decision to sell to Shefler in January 2021, saying she had reached a ""painful decision, with a heavy heart"", the suit alleges. Lawyers for Pitt have requested a trial by jury. The BBC has contacted Jolie's representatives for comment.

"Thomas was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was five years old Thomas Hebbron is one of the forgotten victims of the pandemic. He was diagnosed with leukaemia in February 2019 - a year before Covid hit the UK. The eight-year-old, from Leeds, has been treated with chemotherapy which has continued throughout the pandemic, but his health has suffered in other ways - and his mother believes the unrelenting focus on the virus is to blame. Pre-pandemic he was seen in person by doctors every two weeks. But that changed to monthly video calls, and liver and urinary problems went undetected. His treatment also affected his fine motor skills and has weakened his legs, but he has not seen an occupational therapist since before the pandemic. ""I want to take this pain away from him,"" says his mother, Gemma. ""I don't want to sit and watch him in this pain, but I can't do anything. I just feel completely helpless."" Thomas's story is not unique.An analysis by the Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation,,externalshared exclusively with the BBC, has for the first time laid bare how access to core health services in England has been squeezed, threatening to leave behind a generation of young people. The review has looked at both physical and mental health services and come to the same conclusion - support has been badly disrupted and the plight of children overlooked. For physical health services it found: The proportion of under-16s with suspected cancer waiting more than two weeks to see a cancer doctor has nearly trebled to 16% since the pandemic started The waiting list for planned treatments has risen by nearly a quarter in the past seven months alone In a sign the physical health of children is deteriorating, urgent referrals to hospital by GPs has jumped by nearly half during the pandemic Keris, 13, had an operation on her left leg cancelled twice Another child who has been affected is Keris Keen, from Nottingham. The 13-year-old was born with hip dysplasia and as a result her left leg is longer than her right. Two years ago she had plates fitted to try to slow down the growth of her left leg. But then complications developed and her leg became infected. She needed another operation and was put on a waiting list in August. It was first cancelled in October and then again in November - both times she had to isolate for two days, before it was cancelled at short notice. It finally went ahead in January. Her mother, Keri, said: ""She was in pain, she kept getting infections in her knee, sometimes she couldn't walk. ""It wasn't nice to see, she was getting angry, crying sometimes. She isolated herself as well, which was hard because we've always been quite close - it's hard when you just want to help her as much as you can."" Demand for mental health services has also risen, with researchers saying lockdowns and the disruption caused to education and social activities have taken a huge toll. The analysis highlighted: An 81% jump in referrals for child mental health services between April and September 2021, with growing numbers facing long waits More than 15,000 crisis referrals during the same period, a 59% jump on the same period in 2019 A quadrupling in the number of under-19s waiting for treatment for eating disorders since the start of the pandemic, with more than 2,000 on the waiting list Fifteen-year-old Sam (not his real name) is one of those who has struggled. He had anxiety before the pandemic, but became very isolated during the first lockdown and stopped eating, becoming - in the words of his family - painfully thin. They have struggled to get him help and he was recently admitted to hospital for two weeks. His mother said: ""We're terrified and we don't know what to do as we cannot keep him safe. He needs to be in a specialist children's unit, but there are no beds. ""We cannot watch him 24 hours a day and I fear he will end up dying."" The Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation have been joined by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in calling for a dedicated plan for children to help them recover from the pandemic. Dr Camilla Kingdon, RCPCH president, said the figures ""do not take into account the many other 'hidden' waiting lists of children waiting for community therapies and diagnostic assessments, especially for autism"". She added that children are ""struggling"" and, despite services being stretched, no-one should be deterred from speaking to a health professional. Jessica Morris, from the Nuffield Trust, says: ""In many ways, the wider effects of the pandemic and nationwide lockdowns on children and young people have been greater than the Covid infection itself. ""Despite being much less at risk of hospitalisation from the virus, the youngest members of our society have not escaped unscathed and we can see a heavy toll on their mental wellbeing and access to health services."" In response to Thomas's case, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust told the BBC it is committed to achieving timely and safe care for all patients. The Department of Health says it is investing billions of pounds into recovering the backlog of care built up during the pandemic. It said it was investing in staff and services with the creation of school-based mental health services. A government spokesman said improving health outcomes for children was ""fundamental"" to their plans to recover from the pandemic. The report looked at data for England only, but the other UK nations have said child health also continues to be a priority and they are investing in mental and physical health services too.

"Former Titans members told the BBC they had stopped participating in the sport they loved An elite swimming club is to be wound down after an investigation found widespread failures to protect child members who had suffered eating disorders, bullying and serious mental health issues. Former members of Ellesmere College Titans, where several world-class athletes trained, have told the BBC a toxic environment had ruined their love of the sport. An investigation into the club, based at independent boarding school Ellesmere College, in Shropshire, began in 2020 when parents contacted governing body Swim England concerned about children's welfare. A year-long probe by a child safeguarding expert uncovered more than 70 separate complaints concerning some coaches' behaviour and the club management's failure to deal with multiple serious issues concerning the children. Allegations in the confidential report, which the BBC has seen and is publishing excerpts from in the public interest, include a number of children's attempted suicides not being reported as well as incidents of self-harm. Warning: This article contains details some people may find distressing Derogatory comments were allegedly made towards swimmers, including sexual and personal remarks, the July 2021 report found. Some girls developed eating disorders which were linked to a controversial regime of weighing the children as young as 10, with the results publicised among teammates. Former members have told the BBC they were fat-shamed by their coaches, leading them to become ""obsessed"" with losing weight. ""Swimming was my life and I only spoke out about what happened to me so I could stop other young people experiencing eating disorders and the anxiety that I suffered with for years,"" one swimmer said. Titans' director of swimming, world silver medallist Alan Bircher, was suspended and subsequently stopped from forming part of Team GB's Tokyo 2020 coaching squad last year. Coach Danny Proffitt was also suspended for four months and has recently returned to work at the club. Alan Bircher, pictured in his competing days, helped to run Ellesmere College Titans Ellesmere College Titans was formed in 2008 and has had huge success nurturing young talent. Elite swimmers who trained there before representing their country include Freya Anderson, who won Olympic gold in the mixed relay at Tokyo 2020; Hector Pardoe, who made his Olympic open water swimming debut for Team GB at those games; and backstroke specialist Cassie Wild. Titans' reputation for producing world-class swimmers means children come from all over the UK to train there, with about two-thirds of club members, some as young as 10, attending Ellesmere College. Some families relocate to Shropshire to make life easier for their sons and daughters at the school, which costs up to Â£35,000 a year to attend. The passion of the youngsters is evident - many dream of competing for their country, while others simply have a love of the sport and want to progress as far as they can. The club takes its name from the Titans in Greek mythology - a race of ""godlike giants"", says its website - and swimmers train before and after lessons; the top squad are in the pool for more than 20 hours a week. ""Many people have had good experiences at Titans,"" said a former swimmer. ""If you were swimming well, then you were OK. But the favourites did not have the same experience as some of the rest of us."" Many Titans swimmers, including Olympic gold medallist Freya Anderson, have gone on to have hugely successful careers The BBC has spoken to multiple complainants who have voiced serious concerns about practices at the club. Three of those have shared their stories concerning their time at Titans when they were teenagers. They include being body-shamed in front of others, regularly sworn and shouted at, forced to train while injured and highly-offensive sexual comments being made about female swimmers. Zara* said she had developed an eating disorder after becoming fixated with losing weight following comments made by Mr Bircher. ""We were weighed by Alan every week from an early age,"" she said. ""It was in front of the whole squad and our names were on a white board. ""It was noted if we put on any weight at all - even 0.2kg,"" she said. ""And then if we didn't swim well, he'd suggest it was because we'd put weight on. ""We were young women, our bodies were changing all the time, but Alan made it feel like, if you lost weight, you'd be the best."" It was when she didn't think she was losing weight quickly enough that Zara's eating disorder became very serious. ""It became such an obsession - I just wanted to be a better swimmer,"" she said. Help and support is available at BBC Action Line Swim England changed its policy on weighing swimmers after hearing the testimonies of Ellesmere members She eventually told a senior member of Titans about the severity of her condition but said she had never received any help from the club and her problems had continued for some years. ""Alan wasn't there as a coach, he wasn't supportive,"" she said. ""I had no idea why but he made me feel like [not losing weight] was my fault. ""I was really damaged by it all and suffered anxiety attacks. I still struggle with body image today and it's taken a lot of support for me to get over it."" Another swimmer, Rachel*, said she too was traumatised by having her weight publicised and also developed eating issues. ""One week I was told I needed to lose 10kg,"" she said. ""Alan would give us tips on how to lose weight - such as chew your food 100 times, that sort of thing. ""He'd also watch us in the dining room. We'd go and have breakfast after training and he'd turn up to see what we were eating. If it was a hash brown, he'd say we shouldn't be having it. ""I lost a lot of weight really quickly. At my previous club we had food logs, where our coaches would see if we were getting the right nutrition for our training. ""But at Titans you felt like you had to eat as little as possible and that you were constantly being watched. It's left a lasting impression on me."" After his suspension, many swimmers came out in support of Alan Bircher Rachel said offensively swearing at the swimmers was part of Mr Bircher's regime, especially when he did not think a student had performed well in the pool. ""Even if he thought he was doing it to motivate us, you just can't speak to a 12 or 13-year-old girl like that. ""I felt so alone, there was just no support. And you felt like you couldn't say anything about what was happening because you'd be kicked out."" Louise* said she remembered regularly crying while speaking to her mum following training, after being constantly put down by her coach Danny Proffitt. ""It reached a point so bad that we were exploring the option of pulling me out of boarding, renting a cottage and mum moving hours away from our family to support me,"" she said. Her optimism at training with Titans, she said, had been ""shattered"" by Mr Proffitt, who she said would often resort to ""shouting abuse, harsh punishments, constant criticisms and negative comparisons"". ""I dreaded going to training and crossed my fingers every day that Danny would be in a good mood, which meant less mental anguish and abuse for us,"" she said. She too had comments made about her weight, she said. ""He would say things such as 'you're looking a bit big there' or 'you need to eat a bit less and train harder'. ""I lost a lot of weight very quickly as a result."" The Titans website said Mr Proffitt began coaching at 18 Louise also said Mr Proffitt did not take the swimmers' injuries or illnesses seriously. She said while recovering from one injury, he had been ""pushing me way beyond my physical abilities and punishing me or others with excruciating physical punishments if we didn't make turn-around times. ""One was wall sits for many minutes until we were screaming with pain."" Even when highly inappropriate comments were made, Louise said she was still fearful of reporting Mr Proffitt, who she described as unprofessional and immature. She was told by other swimmers Mr Proffitt had made an offensive and insulting sexual comment about her and some of the other girls. When they confronted him, Louise said he had started laughing and made another sexual remark. ""The boys started laughing uncontrollably and the girls of the squad stood in utter disbelief,"" said Louise. ""It was completely and utterly unacceptable and inappropriate."" She said Mr Proffitt had later apologised when the girls complained, but she wished action had been taken against him. ""I was continuously threatened they could remove me from the club, so I kept quiet so that I could keep my scholarship."" When Alan Bircher and Danny Proffitt were suspended, more than 80 past and current swimmers signed a letter of support saying none of them had experienced ""any hurtful or damaging behaviour"" from them. The letter said Mr Bircher created a ""fun, exciting and elite training environment"". There is still a widely held belief among some club supporters the complaints have been instigated by vindictive parents whose children did not progress as far as they had wished. Hector Pardoe, who was injured during his Olympic debut, was among more than 80 swimmers backing the coaches For those who had raised serious concerns with Swim England, the letter was a devastating blow. ""I know that other people saw how we were treated,"" said Rachel. ""Just because it didn't happen to them doesn't mean it didn't happen. They knew how upsetting it was for others."" Rachel said she had had such high hopes of being a part of Titans. ""It was once an incredible club to be part of, but I watched it crumble. I could not function as a swimmer. ""Alan Bircher destroyed any hopes of some of these swimmers and the goals they wanted to reach. ""He took away something I loved and turned it into something I hated."" The BBC put all these allegations to the two coaches. Mr Proffitt said he had been advised not to comment. Mr Bircher issued a statement through the British Swimming Coaches Association which said: ""Alan Bircher proactively participated in a Swim England investigation into concerns raised at Ellesmere Titans. ""This investigation and its findings were confidential. Mr Bircher's involvement in related matters concluded in October 2021 and he is no longer involved in swimming in any capacity. ""He will make no further comment."" Swim England recentlychanged its guidance,externalon weighing swimmers following its investigation into Titans and now says only those under 18 on a ""nationally-supported pathway"" should be weighed as part of their training. No welfare concerns about swimmers were ever escalated from the Titans club to Swim England, the report said Titans swimming club was formed due to a ""meeting of minds"" between Ellesmere College and the parents of top swimmers to create ""an ambitious, positive and competitive swimming programme"", the club's website states. The two are run separately but there were ""clear overlaps"" due to the college's deputy head of pastoral, Ranjit Chatterjee, being chairman of Titans and other college staff on the club committee, the Swim England report found. Mr Chatterjee was also welfare officer of the club at the time many of the complaints by pupils and parents are said to have been made. The report found the swimming club's systems for dealing with safeguarding concerns raised were ""woefully inadequate"" and key members were untrained. No welfare concerns about swimmers were escalated to Swim England, it added. Mr Chatterjee was suspended from all Swim England activity for two years following the investigation. Ellesmere College gives out scholarships to young swimmers from across the country Last year the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) assessed Ellesmere College and as part of this looked into the care of its students who swim with Titans. It concluded the school""fails to ensure it provides a safe environment in which children can learn while they are taking part in the activities of the swimming club"". It also found the school's annual review of safeguarding ""does not include adequate consideration of the safeguarding of pupils"" who are members of Titans, and that it fails to make ""effective assessment of the potential risks"" in the swimming club. The college has been asked to make changes to its processes which will be reviewed, the ISI said. Neither headmaster Brendan Wignall nor Mr Chatterjee wished to comment publicly when approached by the BBC. However, the school has told the BBC Titans was not run by Ellesmere College and it now intended to establish its own swimming academy. But without accreditation to Swim England, it will rule children out of recognised competitions. The school added it was not aware of any incidents related to the Titans club. Swim England, which had been reviewing Titans' progress since its investigation concluded, said ""further and ongoing concerns"" had been raised which had resulted in its decision to dissolve the club. ""Following further careful consideration of all the information available, Swim England (alongside statutory agencies) have determined that there will be no affiliated club based at Ellesmere College going forward,"" it said. There are up to 60 children who are currently members of Titans and now face having to move clubs if they intend to compete. Many parents have contacted the BBC to say how worried they are about the impact of the changes on their children's education and swimming pursuits. Swim England said it would ""provide total support to the swimmers in transitioning to another affiliated club"". Some former swimmers are still having counselling years after leaving Titans, the Swim England report found It added: ""The welfare and wellbeing of all Swim England club members is of paramount importance, as is ensuring that all of our members have a positive experience in all of our aquatic sports. ""Our affiliated clubs are required to operate to high safeguarding standards at all times and critically to ensure they maintain a safe child-centred environment that is embedded into its culture. ""We are deeply troubled and saddened by any negative experiences children have in our sports and it is something we take extremely seriously and will continue to do so."" Itasked anyone with safeguarding concerns in the sport to report them,external. The new committee of Titans, formed in the summer of 2021, said it was ""very disappointed"" with Swim England's decision. ""We've addressed the concerns of Swim England's original findings and completed any remediation activities required by them,"" it said. ""We are shocked given the hard work that has been put in across the club over many months. We've worked closely with Swim England and Ellesmere College throughout this period to enable our talented swimmers to continue to pursue their ambitions as Ellesmere College Titans. ""As a committee, we would like to thank the interim and new coaching staff, poolside assistants, parent volunteers and officials who have allowed the club to continue to operate throughout this period, drawing a clear line under the historical allegations made against the club."" It added it was ""proud"" of the current swimmers dealing with the impact of the decision on ""the club that they love"". Shropshire Council said it was ""liaising with Swim England and Ellesmere College to manage and resolve any allegations"". Children's charity the NSPCC said it had been made aware of the investigation into Ellesmere College Titans. ""Coaches, above all else, must safeguard young people while all organisations should set minimum professional standards whether they are affiliated to a national governing body or not. ""Any breaches of these should be reported and robustly investigated alongside statutory child protection agencies and appropriate action taken, if necessary."" *All names of swimmers have been changed Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Working from home for part of the week has become the norm for some employees, a survey of managers has suggested. More than 80% said their firms had adopted hybrid working - most since the pandemic, a survey for the Chartered Institute of Management (CMI) found. But senior leaders are also actively encouraging employees to return to the workplace, a majority of managers said. The institute said firms should embrace hybrid work as ""best practice"". ""It would be very short sighted of bosses not to see some correlation in the shift in the working world, and the move towards hybrid [working],"" said CMI chief executive Ann Francke. ""We are experiencing an uptick in productivity, and an uptick in many companies results. We're not saying everyone should work from home 100% of the time, we're saying the best practice is to have a blend, so when you come into the office you can do those things that are very difficult to do remotely."" Should I be working from home now? Working-from-home guidance shift 'may not save my shop' The survey for the professional body, exclusively shared with the BBC, found that 84% of managers said their firms had adopted hybrid working and two-thirds said this had been prompted by the Covid pandemic. Large companies were more likely than small ones to have brought in hybrid working practices, while jobs in factories, transport and trades were less likely to offer the option. The survey found that firms offered staff flexibility to choose which days they came into the office. Work from home guidance in England, which was put in place in December to try to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, was lifted in January. Similar guidance was relaxed in Scotland, but remains in place in Northern Ireland and Wales. As Covid restrictions have eased, commuter numbers have risen. But more than a fifth of train services that were running before the Covid pandemichave not returned. The survey polled 1,237 managers, with 41% working in the private sector, and 59% the public and non-profit sectors. Aoife Fitzmaurice, chief of staff at Sage, which provides accounting, payroll and payment systems, plans to keep hybrid working in place. While there was ""huge demand"" from employees to have the option to work from home, Ms Fitzmaurice said they were also ""missing the human connection"". Ms Fitzmaurice explained that a ""framework of flexibility"" was necessary so that agreements could be made by each team to set the ""sweet spot"" of a combination of home and office work.

"Western leaders repeated warnings that a Russian invasion could come in the next few days The British Embassy office in the capital Kyiv is temporarily relocating to the western city of Lviv Russia has been accused of staging a fake crisis in a breakaway eastern region of Ukraine as a pretext for invasion Russian President Vladimir Putin said the situation in Eastern Ukraine was deteriorating Russia has been backing rebels in separatist-held areas there since 2014 Russia continues to increase the number of troops around Ukraine according to US officials Moscow continues to deny planning an invasion of Ukraine and accuses the West of stoking ""hysteria"" Edited by Deirdre Finnerty We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a round-up of some of Friday's key developments: Keep up with all thelatest developments here. A former high-ranking US national security official believes that Russia is working to manipulate media perceptions at home and abroad ahead of a potential invasion of Ukraine. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, an ex-senior analyst at the CIA and Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said she believes Russia is ""accelerating its efforts in the information domain"" to build the case for conflict. As examples, she pointed to Russian media coverage of purported mass graves discovered in separatist areas or the recent shelling of a kindergarten, which Russian-backed separatists blamed on Ukraine. ""The Russian media is really trying to spin this all up as Ukraine mounting an offensive,"" she said. ""It creates justification."" Kendall-Taylor added that Russian military doctrine views the ""information space"" as a key part of their competition with the US and the West. She added that this sort of media is aimed both at the Russian public and at external observers across the world. ""They're going to flood the information space with fabricated stories and half-truths in order to confuse and disorient, and make it hard for outside observers to discern the truth,"" she said.  The BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg sounds a note of scepticism about Russian claims of Ukrainian shelling in an eastern breakaway region. Allow Twitter content?

Russian media is reporting a fire at a gas pipeline has reportedly been put out. The BBC could not independently verify the reports. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. State media agency RIA has reported the director of the energy company that operates the pipeline has blamed ""sabotage"". It is unclear whether a second blaze reported in the Luhansk area has also been put out. US officials have said Russia may attempt to manufacture a reason to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russian has denied the allegations. Russian news agencies have reported a second explosion in the separatist-held Luhansk area. A number of Russian media outlets, including Tass, Ria Novosti and Interfax - citing separatist sources - have reported the blast, which came approximately 40 minutes after another explosion was reported at a gas pipeline in the area. The causes of the explosions remain unclear. No casualties have so far been reported. Unverified video being shared on Twitter appears to show flames at the site of the explosion.

Kyiv's Independence Square, pictured on Friday President Biden says that Russian forces intend to strike at Ukraine's capital Kyiv. In his remarks at the White House, Biden said that the US believes that Russian forces are likely to act ""in the coming week"". ""We believe that they will target Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people,"" he said. Biden added that the US is ""calling out"" Russia's plans repeatedly in a bid to ""remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving"". Biden is asked if the Ukrainian president's decision to attend the Munich Security Conference tomorrow is wise given the tensions with Russia, to which he says it is the president's call.  ""To be clear, you are convinced that President Putin is going to invade Ukraine, is that what you just said?"" Biden is asked. ""Yes,"" he replies. Mr Biden says that Russia is pushing out ""more and more disinformation to the Russia public"" including allegations that Ukraine is planning an offensive into rebel-held territory. ""There is simply no evidence for these assertions and it defies basic logic,"" he says. He says that Ukraine would not make any military advances in the region while the Russian build-up of troops along its borders continues. ""Throughout these tense moments, the Ukrainian forces have shown great judgement and restraint,"" Mr Biden adds. ""They refuse to let the Russian troops bait them into war."" He goes on to call for Russia to avoid a ""catastrophic and needless war of choice"". ""Russia has still choose diplomacy. It's not too late to return to the negotiation table."" Biden says Nato allies are ""united and resolved"" in the face of Russian disinformation. He accuses Russia of trying to ""set up false justification"" for war against Ukraine. The White House has just provided a readout of Mr Biden's call with western leaders. The 45-minute meeting was held to discuss ""the likelihood of further Russian aggression against Ukraine,"" according to the statement. The leaders also ""expressed deep concern over Russiaâs continued build-up of forces, reiterated their strong support for Ukraineâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, and discussed the importance of further economic assistance to Ukraine"". The group also pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy and discussed efforts to ""ensure the defence and security of Nato's eastern flank"". The call was joined by the leaders of Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Nato the European Commission and the European Council. President Biden has started speaking about the situation in Ukraine, beginning by describing calls he has made with the US Congress and with US allies. Video being widely shared on social media purports to show a large explosion in Luhansk, the capital and administrative centre of the Russian-backed separatist Luhansk People's Republic. The video could not be immediately verified, but has been reported as being from a gas pipeline that caught on fire. The cause of the fire and subsequent blast are not immediately clear. Tensions have been high in the region following repeated US claims that Russia is planning a ""false flag"" operation to give it a pretext to launch a military operation in Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it plans to invade Ukraine.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The UK has become the latest Western nation to accuse Russian intelligence of being behind a cyberattack on the Ukrainian government and bank websites earlier this week. Earlier, US officials claimed Russia was behind the hack that targeted the Ukrainian defence ministry and two of the country's biggest financial institutions. Moscow has denied responsibility for the attacks. The UK foreign office says the attacks had ""involved the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate"". It adds: ""The decision to publicly attribute this incident underline the fact that the UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity"". The video of separatist leader Leonid Pasechnik ordering an evacuation was recorded two days ago, according to metadata As Ukraine accuses Russia of trying to create a fake crisis in the breakaway eastern region of Donbas, the BBC has obtained evidence that casts doubt on claims made by pro-Russian separatists that a Ukrainian assault is imminent. Earlier today, the leadership of the pro-Russian Donetsk and Luhansk rebel republics in eastern Ukraine released videos giving details of the evacuation of residents. In one of the videos, the leader claims that, due to Ukrainian shelling, the order has been given to evacuate civilians, saying: âToday, Friday 18 Februaryâ¦"". Following reports on social media, the BBC has checked the metadata of the videos posted, and has found that the metadata shows they were recorded on Wednesday 16 February - two days ago, before the recent flare-up in hostilities. This suggests that the escalation was pre-planned. President Biden is due to make a televised address in the coming moments. It comes after a 45-minute phone call he held earlier today with western leaders. The White House says that it is up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to decide whether to leave his country to attend a security conference in Munich, Germany. ""Regardless of what decision he makes, he will have the support of the United States,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. The Munich Security Conference was founded in 1963 as a way for Western leaders to discuss threats and dangers. Russia is not attending for first time since 1999. The US is prepared to unleash major sanctions that would inhibit Russia's ability to import technology from other countries, including China, according to a top US economic official. Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh said the US was prepared to launch crippling sanctions in the event that Russia ""weaponises its energy supply"" by cutting off supplies to western Europe. He added that measures to ban Russia from the Swift electronic financial system - a network used by global banks to transfer money - are not likely to be included in the initial sanctions package in the event of invasion. As we await to hear from President Joe Biden at 21:00GMT, here's a round-up of the key events in the Ukraine crisis so far today: White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says that the US continues to believe that Russia is preparing to invade, adding that the evacuations from rebel-held provinces in Ukraine today are an example of Moscow using misinformation as a pretext for war. ""If Russia doesn't invade we would be relieved,"" she told reporters on Friday. She refused to say whether President Biden read the lengthy list of Russian demands that Moscow submitted to the US ambassador on Thursday. The news conference comes as Mr Biden holds a conference call with transatlantic Nato leaders. The call, she said, is ""an effort to have a conversation with his counterparts about what we are seeing, where things stand and continue that close co-ordination that's been going on for months now.""

"The neighbourhood of Morro da Oficina was all but destroyed by a mudslide Alarms rang out across the Brazilian city of PetrÃ³polis on Thursday, warning of more heavy rain to come after floods and landslides killed at least 117 people with more than 100 missing. The rescue mission has been temporarily called off and some people, fearing more destruction, are fleeing the city. One volunteer rescuer said that finding survivors under the rubble was now ""practically impossible"". This week's rainfall in PetrÃ³polis was the heaviest in nearly a century. The downpours on Tuesday alone exceeded the average for the whole of February, triggering landslides and floods in the city north of Rio and turning streets into rivers of mud. Homes were engulfed and vehicles swept away. The first funerals took place on Thursday for the victims who had been formally identified, with the stories of those who died starting to come to light - like that of Helena, who had started at nursery just a few days before the landslide destroyed the home she shared with her family. ""I enjoyed my baby's company for little more than one year,"" her mother Giselli Carvalho, who also lost her mother and niece in the disaster, told Brazilian news channel Globo TV. In Morro da Oficina, the BBC found residents struggling to comprehend the landslide which had swept through the middle of their once-crowded neighbourhood, wiping out everything in its wake. Nilson de Oliveira Vargas Jr and his brother had been waiting for news of their sister, Marilene, for two days. ""She was in the kitchen with my niece,"" he told the BBC's Katy Watson. ""When she heard the roar coming down the hill, she pushed her daughter out of the door and told her to run. My niece was saved, but my sister was left behind."" At the bottom of the destroyed area, a mother arrives to recover her daughter's body, flanked by a family with shovels in hand. Families and authorities worked in unison as they searched through the rubble, picking apart the mangled steel and broken concrete mixed in with metres of thick red mud. Residents need the experts to dig safely, but the rescue workers can't do it without the local knowledge. This video can not be played Deluge of rainfall causes a landslide and flooding in PetrÃ³polis, Brazil However, hopes are fading: the death toll slowly rose through the day, but no more survivors were pulled from the wreckage, according to Brazil's National Civil Defence, which has been providing updates on Twitter. And while relatives don't want to let go of hope in finding people alive, many were realistic this is a recovery operation now, not a rescue mission. The local morgue, already under strain, has been forced to use a refrigerated truck for extra space. ""Unfortunately, it is going to be difficult to find survivors,"" volunteer Luciano Goncalves told AFP, completely covered in mud. ""It is practically impossible. But we must do our utmost to be able to return the bodies to the families."" Nilson is one of those saying that help didn't come soon enough. ""I know my sister's case isn't the only one,"" he said. ""We all deserve attention but for that very reason, we need to spread everyone out in an organised manner and start work."" For others, the alarms warning residents of more downpours indicated it was time to leave. Nataly and her family carried plastic bags with food and their belongings. They were getting out of danger's way. The deadly mudslide in Morro da Oficina had narrowly missed their house, but it was terrifying, she told our correspondent. She doesn't want to go through that again. Caique da Silva Vieira and his partner Pamella want to find somewhere safer to live with their baby Caique da Silva Vieira and his partner Pamella are also now looking to move somewhere safer with their eight-month-old daughter, after they decided to stay put during Tuesday's downpours, witnessing the disaster for themselves. ""We heard a bang and we thought it was the electricity cables,"" Caique explained. ""When we went out on to the terrace we saw everything coming down; it was a horrific scene."" PetrÃ³polis, usually a popular tourist getaway to escape the summer heat, is now a city in trauma. The neighbourhood has been ripped apart, yet brought together in the worst possible circumstances, united in grief and pain.

"Simon Coveney is visiting Northern Ireland for the first time since the executive collapsed Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has played down the prospect of a breakthrough on the Northern Ireland Protocol in UK-EU talks next week. He was speaking as he arrived in Belfast for talks with the Stormont parties. Mr Coveney was asked about the next UK-EU joint committee meeting due to happen on Monday. He said it was more likely to be a ""staging post"" for the two sides to issue a statement on progress so far. Mr Coveney has previously said he believes negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocolmust conclude by the end of this month. The Irish foreign minister also told the media in Belfast on Thursday that the Irish and British governments are not ""bystanders"" in trying to resolve the latest political crisis at Stormont. It is the first time the minister has visited since thepower-sharing executive collapsed earlier this month. He is to have talks with four of the five main parties to discuss the political crisis, as well as negotiations over the protocol. Mr Coveney said Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is travelling and would be unable to meet him in person on Thursday, but they would remain in contact. Following a meeting with the European Commission vice-president MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Thursday, Sir Jeffrey warned that ""unionism is rapidly losing faith that a negotiated solution is possible"". ""It is time for the government to take action which restores fairness and reinstates Northern Ireland's access to the UK internal market,"" he said in a statement. ""This is the only way to build a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" Mr Coveney said officials in London, Dublin and Brussels were all actively involved in trying to find solutions to the Northern Ireland Protocol. However, he added that it was up to the Stormont parties alone to return to government together and that he would continue to support them to reach a resolution. Mr Coveney is also expected to meet civic society leaders in Armagh during his visit. The minister was involved in negotiations that helped lead to the signing of theNew Decade New Approach,externalagreement in January 2020, restoring Stormont's institutions after a three-year impasse. The UK government has insisted it wants to reach a solution urgently, in light of the latest crisis at Stormont. Its lead negotiator, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, met her EU counterpart last Friday for a further round of talks. Liz Truss said she wants to work with the EU towards solutions that deliver for people in Northern Ireland Earlier, Mr Coveney said those involved in the negotiations are ""putting in a lot of time"" to make progress before the upcoming assembly elections on 5 May. ""Liz Truss and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ were the two key negotiators on each side but are very much supported by the Irish government and many others who want to try a way forward here,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He described the decision of the DUP to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister as part of its ongoing opposition to the Irish Sea border as ""very unfortunate"". The party has argued that unless the arrangements are changed, political institutions in Northern Ireland cannot continue as normal. ""We're trying to find a way of ensuring that the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of an international agreement that the UK government designed, helped to write and then ratified, can be implemented in a way that's acceptable for all sides, including unionists,"" Mr Coveney said. ""The Irish government is going to work closely with the British government and the EU to try to find a solution that everybody can live with."" Sinn FÃ©in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said she believed the UK government had moved back from its threat to override part of the protocol by triggering Article 16. She said the issue had been raised during her meetings with Mr Coveney and the EU's chief negotiator, Maros Sefcovic on Thursday. ""It appears off the boil for now - but the Tory government has shown before there are many twists and turns still to go but we'll continue doing all we can to work with the EU and find a solution to make the protocol work."" UK and EU to continue 'intensive' protocol talks Protocol negotiations 'need to end by February' A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Speaking after his meeting with Mr Coveney and Mr Å efÄoviÄ, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said they were ""as far away now as we were last year"" in reaching a deal on the protocol. ""We're far away from any form of solution,"" he said. ""But what I do think they want on February 21 is to finish the joint committee and come out with a positive statement of intent that we're going in a particular direction"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he believed there would not be much progress before May's assembly election, warning that the DUP's decision to collapse the executive had not sparked a change in negotiations. ""This will end in tears for the DUP, what they've set out as red lines were always going to be in achievable,"" he added. Without a first and deputy first minister in place it is not yet clear who will attend a meeting of the joint committee on behalf of the Northern Ireland institutions, but it is likely that a senior civil servant could take part instead.

"Working from home for part of the week has become the norm for some employees, a survey of managers has suggested. More than 80% said their firms had adopted hybrid working - most since the pandemic, a survey for the Chartered Institute of Management (CMI) found. But senior leaders are also actively encouraging employees to return to the workplace, a majority of managers said. The institute said firms should embrace hybrid work as ""best practice"". ""It would be very short sighted of bosses not to see some correlation in the shift in the working world, and the move towards hybrid [working],"" said CMI chief executive Ann Francke. ""We are experiencing an uptick in productivity, and an uptick in many companies results. We're not saying everyone should work from home 100% of the time, we're saying the best practice is to have a blend, so when you come into the office you can do those things that are very difficult to do remotely."" Should I be working from home now? Working-from-home guidance shift 'may not save my shop' The survey for the professional body, exclusively shared with the BBC, found that 84% of managers said their firms had adopted hybrid working and two-thirds said this had been prompted by the Covid pandemic. Large companies were more likely than small ones to have brought in hybrid working practices, while jobs in factories, transport and trades were less likely to offer the option. The survey found that firms offered staff flexibility to choose which days they came into the office. Work from home guidance in England, which was put in place in December to try to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, was lifted in January. Similar guidance was relaxed in Scotland, but remains in place in Northern Ireland and Wales. As Covid restrictions have eased, commuter numbers have risen. But more than a fifth of train services that were running before the Covid pandemichave not returned. The survey polled 1,237 managers, with 41% working in the private sector, and 59% the public and non-profit sectors. Aoife Fitzmaurice, chief of staff at Sage, which provides accounting, payroll and payment systems, plans to keep hybrid working in place. While there was ""huge demand"" from employees to have the option to work from home, Ms Fitzmaurice said they were also ""missing the human connection"". Ms Fitzmaurice explained that a ""framework of flexibility"" was necessary so that agreements could be made by each team to set the ""sweet spot"" of a combination of home and office work.

"The neighbourhood of Morro da Oficina was all but destroyed by a mudslide Alarms rang out across the Brazilian city of PetrÃ³polis on Thursday, warning of more heavy rain to come after floods and landslides killed at least 117 people with more than 100 missing. The rescue mission has been temporarily called off and some people, fearing more destruction, are fleeing the city. One volunteer rescuer said that finding survivors under the rubble was now ""practically impossible"". This week's rainfall in PetrÃ³polis was the heaviest in nearly a century. The downpours on Tuesday alone exceeded the average for the whole of February, triggering landslides and floods in the city north of Rio and turning streets into rivers of mud. Homes were engulfed and vehicles swept away. The first funerals took place on Thursday for the victims who had been formally identified, with the stories of those who died starting to come to light - like that of Helena, who had started at nursery just a few days before the landslide destroyed the home she shared with her family. ""I enjoyed my baby's company for little more than one year,"" her mother Giselli Carvalho, who also lost her mother and niece in the disaster, told Brazilian news channel Globo TV. In Morro da Oficina, the BBC found residents struggling to comprehend the landslide which had swept through the middle of their once-crowded neighbourhood, wiping out everything in its wake. Nilson de Oliveira Vargas Jr and his brother had been waiting for news of their sister, Marilene, for two days. ""She was in the kitchen with my niece,"" he told the BBC's Katy Watson. ""When she heard the roar coming down the hill, she pushed her daughter out of the door and told her to run. My niece was saved, but my sister was left behind."" At the bottom of the destroyed area, a mother arrives to recover her daughter's body, flanked by a family with shovels in hand. Families and authorities worked in unison as they searched through the rubble, picking apart the mangled steel and broken concrete mixed in with metres of thick red mud. Residents need the experts to dig safely, but the rescue workers can't do it without the local knowledge. This video can not be played Deluge of rainfall causes a landslide and flooding in PetrÃ³polis, Brazil However, hopes are fading: the death toll slowly rose through the day, but no more survivors were pulled from the wreckage, according to Brazil's National Civil Defence, which has been providing updates on Twitter. And while relatives don't want to let go of hope in finding people alive, many were realistic this is a recovery operation now, not a rescue mission. The local morgue, already under strain, has been forced to use a refrigerated truck for extra space. ""Unfortunately, it is going to be difficult to find survivors,"" volunteer Luciano Goncalves told AFP, completely covered in mud. ""It is practically impossible. But we must do our utmost to be able to return the bodies to the families."" Nilson is one of those saying that help didn't come soon enough. ""I know my sister's case isn't the only one,"" he said. ""We all deserve attention but for that very reason, we need to spread everyone out in an organised manner and start work."" For others, the alarms warning residents of more downpours indicated it was time to leave. Nataly and her family carried plastic bags with food and their belongings. They were getting out of danger's way. The deadly mudslide in Morro da Oficina had narrowly missed their house, but it was terrifying, she told our correspondent. She doesn't want to go through that again. Caique da Silva Vieira and his partner Pamella want to find somewhere safer to live with their baby Caique da Silva Vieira and his partner Pamella are also now looking to move somewhere safer with their eight-month-old daughter, after they decided to stay put during Tuesday's downpours, witnessing the disaster for themselves. ""We heard a bang and we thought it was the electricity cables,"" Caique explained. ""When we went out on to the terrace we saw everything coming down; it was a horrific scene."" PetrÃ³polis, usually a popular tourist getaway to escape the summer heat, is now a city in trauma. The neighbourhood has been ripped apart, yet brought together in the worst possible circumstances, united in grief and pain.

"People who dusted off their insurance policies when Storm Eunice hit the UK should keep them handy as more bad weather is on the way - this time with Storm Franklin. The Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for Northern Ireland for Monday morning and yellow ones for parts of the UK from Sunday. It has said that Storm Franklin's high winds could cause further power cuts, transport delays and damage to properties. Storm Franklin: More wind warnings after Storm Eunice The insurance company Aviva says a storm generally involves violent winds, accompanied by rain, hail or snow which is ""capable of causing damage to a building in a one-off event"". According to its own research, about 6.4 million households have previously experienced damage to their homes due to extreme weather. Storms Dudley and Eunice: What you need to know What's the best way to prevent flooding? People should check their buildings and contents insurance policies, but most insurers will cover damage caused by storms. However, it is important to check the wording as some things are not covered. For example, most building insurance policies will not pay out for storm damage to fences, hedges or gates. Insurers don't generally cover damage to buildings which are already damaged or have maintenance issues, such as: Cement or mortar deterioration on brickwork and chimneys Failed render on the outside of the building Existing deterioration to any part of the roof or building Aged flat roofs Aviva says it is useful if customers have receipts and photographs of items that might be missing. Meanwhile, if your car is damaged, Swinton Insurance says if you have comprehensive insurance - which pays out regardless of who is at fault of the damage - you should be covered. In a scenario where a tree falls from someone's garden and hits a car on the street, the owner of the car would have to claim on their own policy, Aviva says. Most insurers will cover damage caused by storms If your home or belongings have been damaged, you should contact your insurer as soon as possible and let them know what's happened. You should also make a list of the damage to your property and avoid throwing anything away in case it's required during a claims process. Taking photos of the damage is also recommended. Typical damage to properties from storms can include: Tiles or slates being dislodged Entire felt roofs lifted off Damage caused by fallen trees Water damage due to flooding Most insurance policies won't pay out for damaged fences This will depend on the extent and the type of damage. According to consumer website Money Saving Expert, home insurance nearly always includes cover for alternative accommodation, if you are unable to live in your own property. If you claim on your insurance because of storm damage, you may have to pay for the excess on your policy, according to price comparison website Money Supermarket. It says premiums might also go up after making a claim, or you may lose any no claims bonus - though some insurers protect this in the event of storm damage. Storm damage often falls under the ""at-fault"" category on claims, as it is considered an act of nature. So an insurer won't be able to claim the costs against another driver at fault, as they might in the event of a car accident. Rising insurance premiums will also depend on the individual circumstances of the customer, which is based on a wide range of factors, such as any previous claims.
