"Tony Bellew won the WBC cruiserweight title in May 2016 Tony Bellew's WBC cruiserweight champion status has been changed as a result of potential ongoing involvement in the heavyweight division. Bellew, 34, has held the title since May, but beat fellow BritonDavid Hayeat heavyweight earlier this month. As he is yet to make clear which weight he will fight at, the WBC has made him Emeritus Champion - so he can return to contest the title at any time. Saturday's fight between Mairis Briedis and Marco Huck will be for the title. ""Tony Bellew has become a major attraction in the heavyweight division and is at this moment uncertain of his next steps following his life changing victory,"" said the WBC in a statement. ""The Emeritus Champion designation is a privilege, which has been successfully used by some of the great champions of the history of our organisation including Vitali Klitschko, Floyd Mayweather, Bernard Hopkins, Erik Morales and other greats."" Listen to 5 live's boxing podcast with Costello and Bunce The WBC's board ""unanimously voted"" to amend Bellew's title status and said the Liverpudlian has ""represented the WBC in the best way"". Bellew won his first world title against Ilunga Makabu at Goodison Park but, after beating BJ Flores in October, called out Haye and stopped the former WBA heavyweight champion at London's O2 Arena earlier this month. After the victory,Bellew stated he would consider retirementbut admitted the financial rewards his next fight would likely offer would be too big to turn down. He has stated a rematch with Haye - who is recovering from Achilles surgery - is a possibility, while bouts against WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder or WBO title-holder Joseph Parker have also been touted.

"This video can not be played Cricketer Freddie Flintoff and rapper Professor Green joined a ""national conversation"" on mental health A national campaign, led by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, has released a film featuring celebrities talking about how they faced their own mental health problems. Rapper Professor Green, cricketer Freddie Flintoff, comedian Ruby Wax and others say admitting their problems for the first time made them realise they were not alone. But for many, asking for help can be much harder. ""We didn't really know what we were being sent to,"" Dan Farnworth, a paramedic in the north-west, says. ""The next thing I knew, a child was just placed into my arms."" It was 2015, and Dan had just been sent to a 999 call that would change his life. ""When we arrived we knocked on the front door, but we couldn't get in. We didn't know what had happened inside,"" the 31-year-old told theVictoria Derbyshire programme. It quickly became apparent the call involved the murder of a young child. Dan, left, says a text message to his friend Rich changed his life ""All of a sudden this little girl was just placed in my arms,"" Dan, a father-of-four, says. ""I just remember looking at her. I remember thinking she looked like one of my own children. She had the same colour hair as one of my children. ""I just felt like I froze. It was scary. It is the worst thing I have ever seen in 12 years of doing this job."" That night, the horror of what Dan had witnessed began to dawn on him. He finished his shift early and went home, but couldn't sleep. He soon realised something more serious was wrong. ""I started having nightmares and flashbacks,"" he says. ""My mind started filling in the gaps, seeing things happen that I hadn't actually seen. ""It was awful. I had flashbacks during the day and I was becoming like a recluse and not talking to people at work."" In the days and weeks that followed, Dan says he became ""a different person"". ""I realised something was wrong but didn't know where to turn. It was like I was in a deep dark hole, I was scared and drinking and smoking more heavily."" Dan says he was struggling to deal with his mental health problems, but feared being honest with his employers might have seen him lose his job. He had always wanted to work in the emergency services. Starting in the ambulance control room answering 999 calls, he then spent time dispatching the air ambulance, before finally applying for a job as an emergency medical technician. He had been on the road since 2010. ""I was actually scared that by opening up and talking about what was going on, someone would turn round and say 'this job isn't for you'."" Eventually Dan reached out to his friend and fellow paramedic Rich Morton. Dan says he typed out a text message, telling Rich what had been going on. However, he deleted it before he could send it. He re-wrote the message, but again deleted it. He wrote the message for a third time, and this time pressed send. Dan was so scared of what his friend would say that he hid his mobile phone under a pillow. ""He texted me straight back, saying 'put the kettle on, I'm coming over',"" he says now. ""That text message was the first day of the rest of my life."" The Duchess of Cambridge listened to Dan at a World Mental Health Day event last year Dan was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He was signed off work for five months. He says he was offered ""unbelievable"" support from his GP and received counselling. According to the charity Mind,external, he is not alone in working in the emergency services and suffering mental health problems. The charity says nearly 90% of blue light staff have reported stress and poor mental health at work. Emergency workers are twice as likely to identify problems at work as the main cause of those mental health problems as the general workforce, Mind says. Dan and Rich have since started their own charity, calledOur Blue Light,external, aimed at improving the mental health of blue light services workers. And through their involvement with Mind, Dan and Rich have also rubbed shoulders with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Last year, the threeroyals launched a new campaigncalled Heads Together, aimed at ending the stigma surrounding mental health. On Wednesday, Heads Together released a series of films to encourage ""a national conversation"" about mental health. Celebrities including cricketer Freddie Flintoff, comedian Ruby Wax and ex-Downing Street communications director Alastair Campbell have released films about their mental health struggles. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry want to end the ""stigma"" of mental health In a statement, the royals said: ""We have seen time and time again that shattering stigma on mental health starts with simple conversations. ""When you realise that mental health problems affect your friends, neighbours, children and spouses, the walls of judgement and prejudice around these issues begin to fall."" The royals say attitudes towards mental health are now ""at tipping point."" As for Dan, Prince Harry had a more specific challenge. ""He told me we should run the London Marathon,"" Dan says, ""so we started running the very next day."" ""Stigmas still exist and [mental health] is a taboo subject,"" Dan says. ""People think mental health is a big issue, but I'm Dan, I'm 31 years old with a job and a family and my life is normal. But I have a mental health problem.""

"There have been long-running arguments about how much testing is right for primary schools If news stories could have a soundtrack, then this scrapping of tests in the early years of primary school would have the creaking sound of a pendulum slowly swinging back. The Department for Education is proposing thatnational curriculum tests taken by seven-year-olds in England could be ditched. Instead there would be an assessment of five-year-olds by a teacher - a so-called ""baseline test"" - which would be used as a starting point for measuring progress through primary school. It represents a step backwards from more and more testing - a shift in attitude as much as policy. And it raises again the thorny question of what kind of tests young children should face in primary school. Are such tests a helpful indicator for identifying pupils' needs? Or are they an unnecessary pressure - a case of too much, too young? And are such tests going to mean a paper mountain of extra bureaucracy for teachers, hindering rather than helping learning? The teachers' unions have broadly given their support to the government's announcement to row back on the tests for seven year olds in reading, writing, maths and science. But the National Union of Teachers still says the idea of a baseline test for four or five-year-olds remains a ""triumph of hope over experience"". The teachers' union questions whether this can ever be a sufficiently reliable test to be used as a fixed point against which to measure all the following years of a child's progress. But the counter-argument to this is that you have to start somewhere. If schools are to be held to account for how much progress children have made by the age of 11 - then it has to be measured against a starting point. And isn't the natural starting point in the first year? There is also a strong argument that it is the low achievers and the disadvantaged who will be most in need of the extra help that a test might identify. And at the last general election, all three main political parties were sympathetic to the principle of baseline testing. But the announcement on testing also raises another great back and forth of the education pendulum. How much data is too much? Parents' evenings, with spreadsheets and targets, can feel like a chat with the accountants. And for the schools themselves, the accumulation and analysis of data has become a major part of their working lives. It is make or break too, because Ofsted inspectors will also be using the same crowded panel of charts and indicators, tracking progress on computer screens like mission control following a space probe or some trader overseeing the foreign exchange markets. This has often prompted the accusation that an over-emphasis on testing undermines those cultural and mind-expanding things that can't be tested - like putting on plays, debating ideas and playing sport. And there is an argument that tests shape all around them. Once a test is set, with rewards and penalties, then that metric becomes the priority that overrides everything else. It isn't so much the testing, as the use to which it is put and the consequences built upon it. But Sats tests have been part of primary school life in England for more than 25 years - and there is little chance of them completely disappearing. Supporters of testing will point to the importance of holding schools to account for all their pupils. Tests have been seen as a way of focusing attention. It means that schools that are failing their pupils can be identified and improved. If there were no tests and targets, wouldn't it be easier for an underachieving youngster to drift through school without recognition of the support and intervention they might need? England's relative success in education rankings compared with Wales has been claimed as being linked to the absence of Sats tests and league tables in Wales. But the battle over testing will continue - often as much about perception as anything else. The international TIMSS tests - the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study - which have been measuring international education standards since the 1990s, recently examined the almost universally-accepted truth that testing had becoming increasingly frequent and pupils were under more scrutiny and pressure. Except, when this was investigated across a wide range of countries, it was broadly speaking untrue. Testing was not particularly more common than in the 1990s. The Sats tests in England were once at the ages of seven, 11 and 14 - with the test for 14 year olds scrapped when Ed Balls was education secretary. And in striking out the test for seven-year-olds, the education secretary has pushed the pendulum a little further away from testing.

"Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May has signed the letter that will formally begin the UK's departure from the European Union, following June's referendum which resulted in a vote to leave the EU. To mark this moment, Polish photographer Piotr Malecki has flown into London and is making his way from the outskirts of the capital to the centre, capturing the mood and the thoughts of some of those he meets. ""I think Brexit is sad and I feel sorry  for those people who don't really know what's happening, who are thinking they should leave the country. There are some mums at school who are really lovely, really involved with the school, great kids - and they're just thinking that they might have to move. They don't know whether they should get ahead of the game or stay, which is sad for the community."" ""Personally, I'm sad for my children that they can't be a part of Europe as I grew up. It's a shame."" ""As long as I can work, I don't see any problem. ""You know, we work legally, we pay taxes. I hope they won't see any problem in us being here, why would they? I came here to work, in 2010. ""As long as they won't close the borders, it's OK."" ""I felt insecure three months ago and I still do. I don't understand it, I don't know what they're fighting for, I don't know what's going to happen. I think they're just trying to scare us, but, in reality, nothing will change. ""They can't just get rid of us, because who's going to work here? Who? Tell me. And who's going to pay taxes? All this big business, shops, services, they are Polish. ""What will happen in the future?"" ""I just finished nights so I'm just going to sleep a little bit and then later on I'll go and pick up my children from school. ""If we're in the EU or not, nothing changes for me."" ""I voted to stay. ""We should be making bridges, not demolishing bridges. That's my view on life. You know, we're all the same. We may have different beliefs, different views. But at the end of the day, we want the same thing in life which is to raise our families in peace an harmony. ""What else do we want in life? Care, a little bit of consideration to our health service, our roads, our infrastructure. You know, these things are important but we allow silly prejudice to blind us from what we really need in life. What else can I add to that really."" ""Well, I think the country is a bit undecided - still. But we'll see how it goes. You know, we're an ambitious country. We like to put our first foot forward and see where we land. ""We're still not sure, we're undecided. But we made a statement, to see what's going to progress, maybe by not going in. That's what I can tell you for the meantime."" ""My wife works. I'm looking after the kids. ""I know it's Brexit, but I'm not really sure what that means for anyone. I don't think it'll really affect me much."" ""When I was new in this country I didn't see that many people in the train, or buses. Nowadays, it's a nightmare, forget about sitting down in the train, especially at six in the morning. ""If you go in the train - the people, the way act and they way talk - it's not like England anymore. They're shouting, on the phone. There are so many good people, so many hardworking, very nice people. I'm not blaming anything or anyone - I'm seeing the difference."" ""The view in the community is divided - like in the whole country. Some are very for Brexit, some are very against Brexit. Me myself, I'm very against it. ""I haven't got any national motives - just plain common sense.  I mean, I have a lot of children out of the country. I have to send them money. If sterling is weak, I have to send more. That's one thing. We, as a Jewish community, have a lot of food that is imported, because it has to be kosher. It's done in the USA, in Israel, wherever. All the food is going up, because it comes from outside. The sterling is weak, all the prices of the food are up."" ""I'm happy being part of the EU because you feel more united. ""I've met so many people from out of London who have actually created the culture in London. They work hard hours. They work in positions that Londoners are not working in, so I'd like to know how they will be replaced. That's the reason why I'm against Brexit.

"The claim:Brexit Secretary David Davis said in March that the repeal bill would allow the UK Parliament and Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland administrations to scrap, amend and improve laws. Reality Check verdict:The bill will repeal the European Communities Act, but it will not change EU laws - it will turn them into UK laws. The UK could, if it wanted to, make changes to those laws after it leaves the EU, probably in 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May says that after Brexit, UK laws will be ""made not in Brussels but in Westminster"". In order to do this, her government will use its Brexit repeal bill, officially calledthe European Union (Withdrawal) Bill,external. The bill will do two things. First, the bill will repeal the European Communities Act, the British law that took the UK into the European Community in 1973 and established the supremacy of EU law over domestic legislation. Second, it will transpose the entire body of EU legislation into domestic law. The UK Parliament currently has no power to repeal EU legislation. It is hard to calculate exactly what proportion of UK laws come from the EU -estimates range from 13% to 60%. Transposing EU legislation into domestic law will not be a simple ""copy and paste"" job.The House of Commons library says,externalit could be ""one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK"". Many EU laws, for example on the environment, refer to EU agencies that the UK will no longer be part of when it leaves the Union. The repeal bill will have to find new ways of making those rules part of UK law. Any rules that cannot be transferred will have to be repealed. The government has controversial plans to give ministers the power to make changes to some laws without full Parliamentary scrutiny, which could add further complications. They are known as Henry VIII clauses, after the Statute of Proclamations 1539, which gave the king power to legislate by proclamation. Some opposition politicians are concerned this could mean an executive power grab - the government changing laws without proper scrutiny by MPs. The government says these powers will only be used to deal with EU-related gaps in the law, not to make substantive policy changes. After the bill comes into effect, probably in March 2019, the UK Parliament, and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will be able to amend, scrap or keep laws that originated from the EU. That process is likely to take many years. UPDATE 13 July 2017: This article was updated to include the publication of the bill and its official name.

"The BBC has learned that US officials ""verified"" a key claim in a report about Kremlin involvement in Donald Trump's election - that a Russian diplomat in Washington was in fact a spy. So far, no single piece of evidence has been made public proving that the Trump campaign joined with Russia to steal the US presidency - nothing. But the FBI Director, James Comey, told a hushed committee room in Congress last week that this is precisely what his agents are investigating. Stop to let that thought reverberate for a moment. ""Investigation is not proof,"" said the president's spokesman. Trump's supporters are entitled to ask why - with the FBI's powers to subpoena witnesses and threaten charges of obstructing justice - nothing damning has emerged. Perhaps there is nothing to find. But some former senior officials say it is because of failings in the inquiry, of which more later. The roadmap for the investigation, publicly acknowledged now for the first time, comes from Christopher Steele, once of Britain's secret intelligence service MI6. He wrote a series of reports for political opponents of Donald Trump about Trump and Russia. Steele's ""dossier"", as the material came to be known, contains a number of highly contested claims. At one point he wrote: ""A leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the US presidential election operationâ¦ would be exposed in the media there."" There was no diplomat called Kulagin in the Russian embassy; there was a Kalugin. One of Trump's allies, Roger Stone, said to me of Steele, scornfully: ""If 007 wants to be taken seriously, he ought to learn how to spell."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said Kalugin was head of the embassy's economics section. The Russian embassy in Washington, where Kalugin worked He had gone home in August 2016 at the end of a six-year posting. The man himself emailed journalists to complain about a ""stream of lies and fake news about my person"". If anyone looks like a harmless economist, rather than a tough, arrogant KGB man, it is the bland-faced Kalugin. But sources I know and trust have told me the US government identified Kalugin as a spy while he was still at the embassy. It is not clear if the American intelligence agencies already believed this when they got Steele's report on the ""diplomat"", as early as May 2016. But it is a judgment they made using their own methods, outside the dossier. A retired member of a US intelligence agency told me that Kalugin was being kept under surveillance before he left the US. In addition, State Department staff who dealt with Russia did not come across Kalugin, as would have been expected with a simple diplomat. ""Nobody had met him,"" one former official said. ""It's classic. Just classic [of Russian intelligence]."" Last month,the McClatchy news website,externalsaid he was under ""scrutiny"" by the FBI as he left the US. They did not report, as my sources say, that he was a member of one of Russia's spying organisations, the SVR or GRU. Mikhail Kalugin, Head of Economic Section for the Russian Embassy in the US, in an interview with CGTN America Steele's work remains fiercely controversial, to some a ""dodgy dossier"" concocted by President Trump's enemies. But on this vitally important point - Kalugin's status as a ""spy under diplomatic cover"" - people who saw the intelligence agree with the dossier, adding weight to Steele's other claims. But then they knew him already. I understand - from former officials - that from 2013-16, Steele gave the US government extensive information on Russia and Ukraine. This was work done for private clients, but which Steele wanted the US authorities to see. One former senior official who saw these reports told me: ""It was found to be of value by the people whose job it was to look at Russia every day. ""They said things like, 'How can he get this so quickly? This fits exactly with what we have.' It was validated many times."" Sign up to get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Another who dealt with this material in government said: ""Sometimes he would get spun by somebody. [But] it was always 80% there."" None of these reports touched on the nature of Trump's relationship with Russia. But last June, Steele began sending pages of what would later be called his dossier. In light of his earlier work, the US intelligence community saw him as ""credible"" (their highest praise). The FBI thought the same; they had worked with Steele going back to his days in MI6. Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who wrote the dossiers on Trump's team and Russia He flew to Rome in August to talk to the FBI. Then in early October, he came to the US and was extensively debriefed by them, over a week. He gave the FBI the names of some of his informants, the so-called ""key"" to the dossier. But the CIA never interviewed him, and never sought to. This comes from several people who are in a position to know. They are alarmed at how the investigation is going, and worry it is being fumbled. Russia; The scandal Trump can't shake Russian media no longer dazzled by Trump Echoes of Watergate resurface One said: ""The FBI doesn't know about Russia, the CIA knows about Russia. ""Any sources Steele has in Russia, the FBI doesn't know how to evaluate. ""The Agency doesâ¦ Who's running this thing from Moscow? The FBI just aren't capable on that side, of even understanding what Chris has."" Another reflected growing frustration with the inquiry among some who served in the Obama administration: ""We used to call them the Feebs. They would make the simple cases, but never see, let alone understand and go after, the bigger picture."" (My editors have asked me to explain, for readers outside North America, that feeb is slang for someone feeble-minded, used above as a contraction of the initials FBI.) I understand that Steele himself did not ask to brief the CIA because he had a long-standing relationship with the FBI. The Russia people at the CIA had moved on and he felt he did not have the personal contacts he would need. The CIA and the FBI would not comment on any of this. But the FBI is said to have a large presence at the US embassy in Moscow and has long experience of investigating Russian organised crime in the US. The FBI director, Comey, also said in his testimony to Congress: ""This investigation began in late July, so for counter-intelligence investigation that's a fairly short period of time."" This video can not be played 'Putin hates Clinton' and other things the FBI learned about Russia Several sources have told me that late last year Steele himself grew increasingly disillusioned with the FBI's progress. ""He really thought that what he had would sway the election,"" said one. So in October, pages from his reports were seen by a few journalists, including me. Most news organisations that got this material decided it was not solid enough to publish. In early December, the whole thing, 35 pages, was sent to Senator John McCain, who pressed the FBI director to investigate exhaustively. The following month, the intelligence agencies briefed both then-President Barack Obama and Trump about the dossier - and the entire contents were published by Buzzfeed. In the report, Steele spoke of an ""established operational liaison between the TRUMP team and the Kremlinâ¦ an intelligence exchange had been running between them for at least 8 years."" Members of the Obama administration believe, based on analysis they saw from the intelligence community, that the information exchange claimed by Steele continued into the election. ""This is a three-headed operation,"" said one former official, setting out the case, based on the intelligence: Firstly, hackers steal damaging emails from senior Democrats. Secondly, the stories based on this hacked information appear on Twitter and Facebook, posted by thousands of automated ""bots"", then on Russia's English-language outlets, RT and Sputnik, then right-wing US ""news"" sites such as Infowars and Breitbart, then Fox and the mainstream media. Thirdly, Russia downloads the online voter rolls. Trump 'compromising' claims: How and why did we get here? The people around Donald Trump The voter rolls are said to fit into this because of ""microtargeting"". Using email, Facebook and Twitter, political advertising can be tailored very precisely: individual messaging for individual voters. ""You are stealing the stuff and pushing it back into the US body politic,"" said the former official, ""you know where to target that stuff when you're pushing it back."" This would take co-operation with the Trump campaign, it is claimed. Trump has accused his predecessor of ""wire tapping"" him, without any proof ""If you need to ensure that white women in Pennsylvania don't vote or independents get pissed in Michigan so they stay home: that's voter suppression. You can figure what your target demographics and locations are from the voter rolls. Then you can use that to target your bot."" This is the ""big picture"" some accuse the FBI of failing to see. It is, so far, all allegation - and not just the parts concerning Donald Trump and his people. For instance, the US intelligence agencies said last October that the voter rolls had been""scanned and probed"",externalfrom a server in Russia. But the Russian government wasnever shown to have been responsible,external. There are either a series of coincidences or there is a conspiracy of such reach and sophistication that it may take years to unravel. ""I hear a lot of people comparing this to Watergate,"" said Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee. ""Let me just tell you, the complexity of this case is unlike anything we've ever seen. ""Watergate doesn't even come close. That was a burglary in the Metro section of the Washington Post. ""It doesn't have the international waypoints [of this]. Russia's M.O. is to avoid attribution. This investigation is going to take time."" In his testimony, the FBI director gave away nothing of the details of the inquiry.As I wrote in January, it is being done by a ""counter-intelligence taskforce"" that includes the CIA, with the FBI leading. I wrote then that the secret US intelligence court had granted an order, a so-called Fisa warrant, to intercept the electronic records of two Russian banks. The White House cited this report several times as evidence for President Trump's tweets that ""Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Towerâ¦ This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"" It isn't. Since Watergate, no president can simply order the CIA or FBI to tap someone's phone. I wrote that: ""Neither Trump nor his associates are named in the Fisa order."" If they were, the court would have to see ""probable cause"" that they were agents of a foreign power. It is possible that the communications of Trump associates were picked up in monitoring of foreign entities, such as the Russian banks, so-called ""incidental collection"". This is presumably what the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, is talking about when he asks Congress to investigate an ""abuse of power"" by the Obama administration. Comey was careful in his testimony to say the investigation was into ""co-ordination"" rather than collusion. ""Collusion is not a term, a legal term of art,"" he said, ""and it's one I haven't used here today, as we're investigating to see whether there was any co-ordinationâ¦"" Comey's testimony confirmed there was an open investigation over the links between the Trump campaign and Russia - but not much more ""Explicit or implicit coordination?"" a Congressman asked. ""Knowing or unknowing,"" Comey replied. The investigation, then, is into a range of possibilities: at one end, unwitting co-operation with Russia by members of the Trump campaign; at the other conscious ""co-ordination"". Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook, said that if Trump's aides knew of Russia's plans, there should be charges of treason. Trump's enemies ask us to believe that some of his people were either traitors or dupes. The president himself has another version of events: there was no ""co-ordination""; the whole thing is a monstrous lie created by the Obama administration, fed by the intelligence community and amplified by the ""dishonest"" media, billowing black clouds of smoke but no fire. When the dossier was released, he tweeted: ""Are we living in Nazi Germany?"" These two stories cannot be reconciled. With each new drip of information, option three - the chance that this is all a giant mistake, an improbable series of coincidences - seems further out of reach. Increasingly, the American people are being asked to choose between two unpalatable versions of events: abuse of power by one president or treason that put another in the White House. It cannot be both.

"Jessica Whitchurch The number of women who died in prison in England and Wales reached a record high of 22 last year, and more than half of them took their own lives, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Nigel Newcomen reported this week. ""Behind the statistics are stories of avoidable tragedy,"" says Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest. Most women who end up in prison have experienced a range of problems, such as addiction, mental illness, abusive relationships or homelessness - and if these problems had been addressed, Coles argues, things might have turned out differently. Here are two of the stories behind the grim statistics of 2016. Jessica grew up in Nailsea near Bristol with her parents and three siblings, Ben - the oldest - Emma and Beth. ""We had a real rough childhood but we had good times as well,"" says Ben. Jessica Whitchurch and her sisters Emma and Beth Together the family enjoyed holidays abroad in France, Spain and Greece. And there were other happy family occasions - birthdays and Christmases, for example: the two would overlap because Jessica's birthday was on Boxing Day. But they all had spells in foster care - both parents struggled with alcohol and would fight. One day their father disappeared to live abroad, and in 2002 their mother died after a long battle with addiction to prescription drugs and alcohol. Ben was an adult by then, but the three girls were sent to different foster homes. Beth, the youngest, was 12, Emma had just turned 15 and Jess was 17. ""Out of us four kids, with everything we went through, I suppose one of us had to take the wrong turn,"" says Emma. Jessica struggled to find a job and would get into relationships with abusive and violent men. Things spiralled. She began to drink and take drugs - heroin, crack, anything - and turned to shoplifting to pay for them. Her life became chaotic and her siblings would struggle to keep track of where she was and with whom. ""Jess was free-spirited, fun-loving and creative. She could speak German and Spanish,"" remembers Ben. ""But she was also very vulnerable and a lot of her prison sentences were to do with her violent relationships with men."" According to the Prison Reform Trust, 46% of women in jail report having suffered a history of domestic abuse. Ben explains that she had wanted to be a youth worker - a job she would have been good at - but criminal convictions made that difficult. ""Jess was a good person, she was the kindest person. She used to do anything for anybody, but drugs and alcohol took over,"" says Beth. By the time their sister was sentenced for the final time, she'd been in Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire at least seven times. Beth and Emma spent many hours visiting her there over the course of four or five years. ""We'd get a call from her in prison - 'I'm OK,' she'd say and then we'd go and see her,"" Beth says. When she died in May last year she was serving her longest-ever sentence - 16 months for street robbery. ""Jess seemed like she was thinking about the future - she was talking about going into rehab when she got out and she wanted to get into counselling,"" says Beth, who visited her three days before her death. While in prison she was diagnosed with a personality disorder and severe depression. ""They finally know what's wrong with me,"" she wrote in a letter to her family in March. In prison she'd fill her free time with crocheting, knitting and drawing. Bristol charity one25 would send her crafts, books and magazines - they had supported Jessica while she was on and off the streets too. ""She made us some beautiful cards and she knitted a doll which she gave to my daughter the last time we visited her,"" says Beth. Prison visits were normally upbeat. ""We'd spend it laughing, she was so funny,"" Beth remembers. Jessica was keen to catch up on news about life beyond the confines of the prison. But she also complained that she was being bullied by other inmates, say her siblings. She had been placed on a care plan known as ACCT, used for those thought to be at risk of self-harm or suicide. When the 31-year-old killed herself she only had two months left to go on her sentence. On 20 May, two days after being rushed to hospital, she was pronounced brain-dead and her life support was turned off. She left behind a handmade birthday card for one of her nieces and a note that said: ""To Em, Beth and Ben - I'm really sorry, I had to do this. Be strong. I'm with mum and dad now."" Jessica was one of three women to kill themselves at Eastwood Park in 2016. When her siblings saw her body, it was covered with scars resulting from self-harm. ""Jess should not have been in prison, she should have been in a mental health facility,"" says Emma. ""She needed peace. That root of all evil needed to be found, and putting her in prison just tormented her."" Charlotte grew up on Hayling Island near Portsmouth and was the middle child of three. ""When she was really little, she was an absolute darling,"" says her mother, Sue. ""She was very clever and she could talk anyone round - even the police when she got older. She endeared herself to people."" ""She was so funny, and fiercely loyal - but she was also a very troubled person,"" says her older sister Rachel, describing some of her sister's aggressive, erratic behaviour. Her family now know that Charlotte had a severe personality disorder - it was diagnosed as an adult. ""As a child she was very sneaky and was never scared of anything; we all just thought she was hard work - we didn't know she had real mental health problems,"" says Sue. Charlotte Nokes as a child It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when her life began to take the turn that it did, but at about 12, Charlotte began taking drugs and drinking. ""Charlotte was gay and where we lived had a very small-town mentality and she had a lot of trouble with people - she would walk down the road and get beaten up,"" her mother says. She started carrying a knife and got a teardrop tattoo on her face - often the symbol of a killer or gang member. At 18 she moved in with friends in Portsmouth and began stealing to feed her drug addiction, which by that time had graduated from cannabis to crack cocaine and heroin. Her life became increasingly chaotic. ""Her whole day became about finding money to buy drugs,"" says her mother.  ""It didn't matter what we did or didn't do, we made things worse; we were often the trigger."" Charlotte's record of offences begins with shoplifting, drug possession, parking fines. By the time she was sentenced for the final time, she had more than 50 convictions for petty offences, says her mother Sue. Prison wasn't working and had become a revolving door. Samaritans provides emotional support, 24 hours a day for people who are experiencing feelings of distress or thoughts of suicide Its number is 116 123 Rethink Mental Illness has more than 200 mental health services and 150 support groups across England Its number is 0300 5000 927 On her 30th birthday, 27 October 2007, Charlotte was supposed to have gone to the cinema with her mother to celebrate. Instead she was arrested for street robbery and carrying a bladed weapon. Inebriated, she'd asked a passer-by for 40p and had staggered towards the woman with a knife. Fearing she might get stabbed the woman ran across the road and was later taken to hospital with chest pains. Charlotte was arrested close by, waving the knife above her head. She was convicted of street robbery, in January 2008. By this time her mother had given up on going to sentencings - she had been to so many. Charlotte was handed an indeterminate sentence for public protection - known as an IPP sentence. It carried a minimum of 15 months and her freedom would depend on passing probation reviews. When Charlotte died, she had been in prison for eight and a half years. Her family say the IPP sentence she'd been handed by the judge gave her no hope - she struggled to cope and would grow more volatile with each rejection of her parole. Charlotte would self-harm and told her mother about attempts to kill herself. Like Jessica, she was also on the ACCT care plan. ""She had black moods she just couldn't get out of,"" says her sister, Rachel. ""She had done things she wasn't happy about and it always tormented her."" This didn't always show. ""She used to phone me at work - sometimes she'd phone once a month, sometimes every day. Sometimes she was crying, sometimes laughing, sometimes you couldn't get her off the phone,"" says her mother. At other times she would not want visits or calls from anyone. Prisoners serving IPPs have one of the highest rates of self-harm. On average each year there are 550 incidents per 1,000 people serving an indeterminate sentence, compared with 324 per 1,000 for those on determinate sentences, according to the Prison Reform Trust (PRT). Although IPP sentences were abolished in 2012 more than 3,000 people are still serving these sentences, the PRT says, and 84% of them have already served their minimum tariff. The one thing which Charlotte found rewarding in prison, and would calm her down, was painting. Nightmare Mise-en-Scene by Charlottle Nokes ""She would paint on anything she could get her hands on - bits of cardboard, doors, signs,"" says her mother. She was allowed to paint murals all around Peterborough prison and would take commissions from the other women, decorating their cells for them and making birthday cards for their children on the outside. ""She always cared and looked after other people - she just couldn't do the same for herself,"" says her mother. Charlotte got support from criminal justice charities such as Women in Prison and the Michael Varah Memorial foundation and her work was exhibited by the Koestler Trust. ""By the end I couldn't afford to even buy her paintings,"" says her mother. ""Things were really taking off for her and her mentors expected great things."" She had even been offered a scholarship to the esteemed Central St Martins art school on her release. But the thing which boosted Charlotte the most was the prospect of being transferred from HMP Peterborough to a secure psychiatric unit, say her family. It was all to be settled at her next parole hearing, and this made her happier than she had been for a very long time, says her mother. ""She had things to look forward to, she thought she'd be looked after properly and get the help she needed,"" she says. But at breakfast on 23 July 2016, the lifers' wing for women in HMP Peterborough went into lockdown. The women serving sentences there knew that they were being kept in their cells because something bad had happened. They initiated their own roll call, one by one they shouted their names through the hatches in their doors. When it was Charlotte's turn, silence. The 38-year-old had been found dead, sitting up in bed in her cell by prison staff. Charlotte's family say it is suspected she died from a strain on the heart. Of the 22 women who died in prison last year, her death is one of the three that are yet to be classified by Inquest. No date has yet been set for the coroner's inquest. ""I don't know if her life could have been saved, but I know that prison isn't where she should have died,"" says Sue. ""But we have memories - we have more than some people, and we'd like Charlotte to be remembered through her art."" Alarm over the number of women dying in prison - six in one prison alone in a 13-month period - gave rise tothe Corston Report,external, published 10 years ago this month. In it, Baroness Jean Corston called for women's prisons to be completely dismantled over a 10-year period in favour of small custodial units. The demand was rejected by the Labour government at the time, but has since been adopted by the Scottish government. The trigger was the death of six women in Cheshire's Styal prison over a 13-month period in 2002-3. Corston noted that most women who go to prison have not committed a violent crime - the Prison Reform Trust says 85% have been sentenced for a non-violent offence, compared with 70% of male prisoners - and argued that in such cases they should not receive custodial sentences at all. Instead they should be referred to ""women's centres"" - support and supervision centres in the community - to receive help for problems such as addiction, mental illness, homelessness and domestic violence. The custodial units used for the minority of women considered dangerous should also emphasise therapeutic care, Corston suggested, and should be located in places that are easier for families to visit - in city centres rather than isolated rural areas. Corston made a total of 43 recommendations and 40 were accepted by government. But it's not only campaigners who argue that progress has been limited. ""The sweeping whole-system reform envisaged has yet to be delivered,"" writes Prison and Probation Ombudsman Nigel Newcomen in hisbulletin on female prison suicide,externalthis week. While some women's centres have been opened, their work has been frustrated by a failure to invest in mental health services, the closure of domestic violence refuges due to funding cuts and a worsening housing crisis, argues Claire Cain of the charity Women in Prison. ""Ten years after the Corston Report we are seeing the same vulnerable women put in prison and the same vulnerable women dying,"" says Deborah Coles of Inquest. ""We continue to see the prison system as a panacea for all social ills, but it isn't working because we see women return to prison time and again. It is a revolving door.""

"Vessels have had to be escorted by armed coast guard officials in the Philippines Across the world there has been a decline in piracy and sea robbery, but one precarious expanse of ocean waters in South East Asia is bucking that trend, as maritime defence expert Swee Lean Collin Koh explains. There was a time when news of pirates and kidnap-for-ransom dramas in the waters off Somalia dominated global news headlines. In 2011, at the height of the crisis, a total of 237 incidents were reported in the area. Since then, however, piracy has decreased significantly off the Horn of Africa, despite a recent attack against a Comoros-flagged tanker and one reported incident in the third quarter of last year. In Asia, there are reasons to be optimistic: reported piracy and sea robbery incidents, including cases of fuel-oil siphoning, have more than halved from 2015 to 2016, due to measures undertaken by both government agencies and shippers. But there is one small stretch of ocean waters in South East Asia that could potentially be one of the riskiest regions in the maritime world. Abu Sayyaf militants have kidnapped and murdered sailors, including from this yacht found drifting in the Sulu Sea Few people will have heard of it and it has barely hit the global headlines, compared to key waterways such as the Malacca Strait, but the Sulu-Celebes Sea, encompassing the waters around Indonesia, Malaysia's eastern Sabah state and the Philippines, has become an area of growing concern. Since March 2016, a spate of kidnap-for-ransom incidents have been reported there and in the waters off eastern Sabah. These attacks were attributed mainly to the Abu Sayyaf militant group operating out of the southern Philippines, although some appear to be criminal groups. What is worrying is their evolving modus operandi. They initially targeted slow-moving, low-freeboard vessels such as tugboats (typically towing barges laden with coal bound from Indonesia to the southern Philippines) and fishing trawlers. But they have since become more brazen, making attempts on larger ships in the area. Notably, a South Korean-flagged heavy-load carrier was attacked in southern Philippine waters in October 2016. With thousands of islands and busy shipping lanes, the region offers rich pickings for pirates Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have held a series of high-level meetings and issued joint statements envisaging the creation of something called a Trilateral Co-operative Arrangement (TCA). A four-point action plan was agreed between the three countries' foreign ministers back in May 2016, but progress has not been as swift as some might have expected, even though a model exists in the form of joint co-ordinated patrols in the Malacca Strait. Jakarta initiated this proposal and has eagerly pushed for the TCA's implementation, given that many of the kidnap-for-ransom victims are Indonesians. But frustration within the Indonesian government at the slow progress led to it imposing a moratorium on coal shipments to the Philippines, to be extended ""until there is a guarantee for security from the Philippine government"". Fishing boats like this one sinking in waters in the southern Philippines, are among the targets The two countries later forged an agreement - based on a 1975 border pact - which allows Indonesian forces to conduct ""hot pursuit"" into Philippine territory. Successive joint statements continued to agree to explore measures such as co-ordinated patrols and a safe vessel transit corridor through the Sulu-Celebes Sea. The growing threat posed by the Islamic State hastened moves by the three countries including, notably, an agreement to establish command posts in Bongao in the Philippines, Tawau in Malaysia and Tarakan in Indonesia. Stop-gap measures were put in place while the three nations worked with their domestic institutions on a deal. For example, Jakarta and Manila formalised co-ordinated patrols to take place twice a year. Following a spate of attacks on East Malaysia-registered fishing boats crewed by Indonesians late last year, Jakarta sought assurances from the Sabah local authorities regarding the safety of roughly 6,000 Indonesian fishing crew working in Malaysian waters. Piracy is widely associated with Somalia (shown) but southeast Asia is also a hotbed of maritime crime Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte also chimed in, appearing to hint at his frustration about the slow progress in the TCA when he remarked ""Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines [must] talk about this and once for all, come up with a solution"". ""There's a need for usâ¦ to talk about this seriously and to put a stop to it because it has somehow paralysed the trade and commerce in that area,"" he added. International shippers have shied away from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao because of the attacks, denying the Philippine region much-needed foreign investment. In December, Malaysian security forces clashed for the first time with Filipino gunmen in waters off Semporna, killing three of them and capturing three others. This seems to have had an effect. Late that month, Kuala Lumpur revealed that it was in final talks with Jakarta and Manila on implementing the TCA. But a spate of new attacks this year - on a Sabah-registered fishing vessel and a Vietnamese vessel - highlighted the urgent need to go beyond mere talks. Manila has asked both China and the United States to contribute to maritime security in international waters in the area. And in March, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines finally agreed to begin patrolling the proposed transit corridor. Shippers could heave a sigh of relief, at last. Countries in the region have long conducted counter-piracy exercises, without ending the problem However, successfully carrying out this trilateral maritime security framework will require all three governments to sustain their commitments, including the need to put aside political concerns - such as the question of sovereignty between Kuala Lumpur and Manila over Sabah, since Mr Duterte has insisted that his administration ""will stick to our claim"". If the TCA succeeds, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines would not only prove to the international community that the Sulu-Celebes Sea is not a ""new Somalia"", but also demonstrate their ability to put aside political and diplomatic concerns to pool their efforts to deal with a common threat. Swee Lean Collin Koh is a research fellow with the Maritime Security Programme at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, part of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, based in Singapore.

"Max Verstappen finished fifth in Melbourne for Red Bull while Daniel Ricciardo was forced to retire Red Bull were one of the prime movers behind the push for faster, more demanding Formula 1 cars this season, so it is somewhat ironic that they started the season off the pace of Ferrari and Mercedes. All is not lost, however, for the team that just over three years ago were celebrating their fourth consecutive world title double. Red Bull were the only team to beat Mercedes last year and finished second in the championship. But although Red Bull were clearly the third best team in Melbourne, there is good reason to believe they will make it a three-way fight at the front in 2017. Red Bull admit they have work to do with both their chassis and the Renault engine, but improvements to obvious faults are on the way. Red Bull qualified 1.3 seconds off pole position in Australia. Which sounds a lot - indeed, it is a lot. But it is worth bearing in mind that last year, which they ended with two victories and could have had three, they were 1.6 seconds off the pace at Albert Park. In the race, their pace was hard to judge - Daniel Ricciardo was never really in it after what team boss Christian Horner said was a ""weekend from hell"". And Max Verstappen spent much of the afternoon bottled up behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. There were only a handful of laps in the first stint in which Verstappen was more than two seconds behind Raikkonen - the gap at which drivers say their car starts to be affected by aerodynamic turbulence from following another car. Max Verstappen was about 0.7secs off the pace of leaders Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel in Melbourne On average, on those 'clean-air' laps, Verstappen was about 0.7secs off the pace of leaders Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. After his pit stop, the Dutchman was pretty much on the leaders' pace - sometimes quicker, sometimes slower, sometimes about the same - but then the picture was skewed by the fact that he was on a softer, faster tyre. In all, Horner reckoned Red Bull needed to find ""a good half a second to get into that fight with the cars ahead"". Coincidentally, 0.5secs is about the margin Red Bull believe they are losing as a result of the Renault engine in race pace - and as much as 0.6-0.7secs in qualifying. The Renault, which has been redesigned for this season, has had reliability problems this year and fixes for these had a direct impact on performance in Australia. Primarily, Renault were suffering in pre-season testing with overheating of the MGU-K - the part of the hybrid system that recovers energy from the rear axle. Red Bull believe they are losing as much as 0.5 seconds because of their Renault engine The temporary fix for this was to use last year's MGU-K, which is 5kg heavier than the 2017-spec design and also requires an extra air bottle, which is at least another 1kg. That weight accounts for about 0.2secs in lap time itself, and a revised version of the new MGU-K is set to be introduced for the fourth race of the season in Russia. Renault will then introduce a major upgrade for either Monaco - the sixth race - or, more likely, the subsequent event in Canada. This is referred to by Red Bull as ""significant"" - which is code for about 0.3-0.4secs in lap time. Horner said the lap-time deficit of the Red Bull-Renault to Mercedes and Ferrari was ""probably an equal share"" between car and engine. And it was clear the Red Bull was far from its best in Australia. Both drivers struggled to find the right set-up - complaining of the balance switching too easily between extremes. The car, in its current form, has what is known in F1 as ""a narrow set-up window"" - it is hard to home in on the correct balance - as well as a performance shortfall to the Ferrari and the Mercedes. But Horner says: ""It's still early days. The regulations are still very immature. We've chosen a different concept. I believe there's really good development potential in the concept that we have."" What does he mean by ""different concept""? The key is in the aerodynamics - and particularly in the design of the front wing. In all F1 cars, the front wing is crucial in setting up the airflow around the rest of the car. It creates what are known as vortices that sweep around the sides of the car and then under the floor in front of the rear wheels. The faster these vortices can be made to travel, the more aerodynamic downforce will be created by the floor between the rear wheels. Red Bull's inner flaps point upwards, in order to direct the airflow higher up around the car. These vortices start at the inner tips of the flaps on either side of the front wing. Most teams send them between the front wheels and over the various fins and curved plates that can be seen in front of the side pods - the bodywork either side of the cockpit. But because it is so crucial that the airflow hits all these pieces of bodywork, that means that overall downforce of the car can be badly affected in less than perfect conditions - such as in a cross-wind, or in traffic. The Red Bull has far fewer of these additional pieces of bodywork than the other front-running teams, and that's a conscious choice by Red Bull's aerodynamic team under chief technical officer Adrian Newey. They wanted a car that was more consistent in changing conditions. The key to the way it differs from other cars can be seen in the front wing. On the Mercedes and Ferrari, the inboard ends of the series of flaps on either side of the wing point downwards towards the wing mainplane. Red Bull's inner flaps point upwards - because they are directing the airflow higher up around the car. That means there is reduced need for the intricate cascading flaps downstream. It's a classic example of the philosophy long-espoused by Red Bull design chief Newey, whose genius resides in not only producing great performance, but also in doing it in a manner which means the driver can access more of it more of the time. The performance is not there at the moment, but as Horner put it: ""I think development is going to be incremental at every event. Looking at the amount of notes Adrian has taken away from this weekend, for sure it's going to keep our design office pretty busy."" Last year, after Red Bull were 1.6 seconds off the pace at the first race, Max Verstappen won the fifth race in Spain. That win was only possible because Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out on the first lap. But two weeks later, Daniel Ricciardo took a brilliant pole in Monaco and would have won but for a delay caused by a pit-stop mix-up. Red Bull's Christian Horner says his design team will be ""pretty busy"" in the wake of the Australian Grand Prix From then on, Red Bull were usually Mercedes' main challenger - Ricciardo again came close in Singapore and then did finally win a week later in Malaysia, albeit this time after a Hamilton engine failure. At this early stage, the pattern looks very similar - a deficit in Australia, a major engine upgrade at the sixth or seventh race, consistent chassis improvements. On that basis, it is easy to believe Horner when he says: ""There's a lot of positives to take out of Australia, at a track where we have not been competitive for the last couple of years. I'm sure that we can build on this over the coming races. ""We have a good basis and a good direction and as the regulations are quite immature, I think things will move quite quickly. So I honestly believe we will get ourselves into a competitive situation this year.""

"Philip Moulin is head wine detective at wine merchant Berry Brothers & Rudd Philip Moulin intently studies the label on a bottle of expensive wine with a magnifying glass. He then shines a blue ultraviolet light at the bottle, before picking it up and weighing it in his hands. ""Counterfeit bottles can often be much lighter,"" he says. Mr Moulin is standing at his workbench at the main warehouse of UK wine merchant Berry Brothers & Rudd (BBR). A cavernous facility in the Hampshire town of Basingstoke, more than 2.7 million bottles of wine are stored there at a constant 12C, stretching from floor to ceiling in endless rows. Mr Moulin uses a UV light to spot security marks on legitimate bottles While Mr Moulin's official job tile is ""fine wine and authentication manager"", he is in fact BBR's head wine detective, tasked with preventing any counterfeit bottles entering the facility. It is a vital role at BBR because the company is one of the world's largest sellers of fine wines, the very expensive bottles that canretail,externalfor more than $10,000 (Â£8,000). And as demand for fine wine has soared over the past 20 years, fuelled by China, fraudsters are unfortunately continuing to target the industry. In the most high profile example of recent years, a man called Rudy Kurniawan wasjailed for 10 yearsin California in 2014 after being found guilty of making and selling fake wines. Rudy Kurniawan made counterfeit bottles of red wine - such as these - for more than 10 years At his home in Los Angeles he created a counterfeiting workshop where he would make fake versions of famous and rare bottles, using labels he printed out, and filling old bottles with cheaper wine. The Indonesian national, who was 37 when he was sentenced, was so skilled at the ruse that according to some estimates he faked more than $500m of wine between 2002 and 2012. With some of Mr Kurniawan's bottles said to still be floating about on the global fine wine market, as well as those made by other fraudsters, Mr Moulin aims to stop any of them getting into BBR's facilities. ""There is not a problem with the wines we buy as a company, but where we have to be very careful is the wines that our customers buy from auctions or elsewhere, and then pay to store with us, and/or sell via us. That's the really potentially tricky stuff,"" he says. BBR's main warehouse is home to 2.7 million bottles of wine ""We check these bottles and their paper trail, vigorously when they come in... about 200 cases a week. ""I have two men in my team who check the bottles first. We are looking at everything from the labels, to the weight of the glass, the capsule (that covers the top of the bottle), and the depth of the punt (the indent at the bottom of the bottle). ""If the lads aren't sure they give me a shout, and if I'm not sure we panic."" Mr Moulin says that he and his team intercept a fake bottle ""once every two or three months"" and then immediately inform the owner. This label is fake because it should say ""imprime"" with an ""m"" not ""imprine"" with an ""n"" ""We ask them to come and collect the bottle or bottles asap,"" he says. ""As far as we are concerned, we are doing them a favour, but people get really upset about it - no-one likes to think they have been taken for a ride."" The wines most often targeted by counterfeiters are those from the top producers in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy, especially from highly coveted older vintages, stocks of which are now limited. These wines are typically sold by auction, and auction house Sotheby's is one of the industry's biggest players. Last year it sold$74m of fine wine,external, a 22% increase on 2015. Mr Moulin and his team break into wooden cases of fine wine to check each bottle Jamie Ritchie, worldwide head of wine at Sotheby's, says the company has stringent procedures in place to prevent any counterfeit bottles being auctioned. ""We train all our specialists to determine the authenticity of bottles, matched to appropriate provenance, and always have two or more senior specialists review high-value bottles,"" he says. ""We use high-powered magnifying camera loupes to review labels, and our internal library of resources to research authenticity issues. Where required, we research the provenance, which includes contacting the producers."" Wine counterfeiters will often reuse old corks Wine blogger Jamie Goode says that fraud remains ""a massive problem"" for the industry. Regarding counterfeit bottles, he says that when it comes to very old bottles, the weakness is that ""so few people have got any frame of reference as to how the real wine should taste"". ""For example, it is said that the 1945 vintage of Mouton Rothschild (one of the finest red wines from Bordeaux) was incredible, but very few people alive have actually tasted it. That is what Rudy Kurniawan was manipulating. ""If you are ever buying fine wine, only go to the most reputable of auction houses, and don't settle for any vague answers regarding provenance."" Counterfeiters will make fake labels With fine wine being so valuable fraudsters are not just producing counterfeit bottles, they are also using fraudulent means to try to steal genuine bottles, as London Michelin-star restaurant Pied a Terre found to its cost a few years ago. Owner David Moore says that the wine fraudster pretended to be working for a wealthy Russian. ""We had a phone call, late at night, apparently from a party organiser, who said that his Russian client was out of Cristal (a very expensive champagne), and could we help,"" says Mr Moore, Pied a Terre's owner. The tools of Mr Moulin's trade ""He said it didn't matter what the cost was. A very naive member of staff thought he was doing a good deed and put the sale through the till, three magnums at Â£1,200 each. And all seemed fine. ""A taxi driver then turned up to collect the champagne... and of course a few days later the credit card company refused to pay - the card had been stolen. It was a real schoolboy error on our part. ""Now no bottle leaves the restaurant without a debit or credit card being pushed into a chip-and-pin machine."" As blogger Jamie Goode puts it: ""If you are buying or selling wine, and it looks too good to be true, then it probably is.""

"Mombasa county governor, Ali Hassan Joho is being investigated over his educational credentials In our series of letters from African journalists, Joseph Warungu looks at why Kenya insists that its senior political leaders must hold a university degree. There is a whirl of activity online at the moment as Kenyans try to ""find"" their old school mates to stand by them in case they are required to prove that they did in fact attend school and sat national examinations. It is all a light-hearted mock of the serious situation in which the Governor of Mombasa, Ali Hassan Joho, has found himself in. Police are investigating whether Mr Joho forged his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) as alleged by the Kenya National Examinations Council. He denies any wrongdoing but if these allegations are proven, Mr Joho could be in danger of criminal charges and could be stripped of the degrees he subsequently obtained at university. A person vying for the position of governor is required by law to hold a degree from a recognised university. This means Mr Joho could potentially be locked out of the race to defend his seat in the August general election. It is this last point that leads Mr Joho to describe the whole situation as attempts to intimidate him. Joseph Warungu: ""Some of the worst cases of abuse of power have involved highly educated people."" Mr Joho, who is a member of the opposition ODM party, is a fierce critic of the ruling Jubilee Party government and is never afraid to clash publicly with the president. It is unlikely that the learned men and women who drafted the 2010 constitution of Kenya had Mr Joho in mind when they included a university degree requirement for holders of the office of president, governor and deputy governor. The thinking was that the president is the CEO of the country while governors are the CEOs of Kenya's 47 regional county governments. These positions require governance experience and a visionary leadership that is partly the product of a mind broadened by education. But perhaps the big issue the constitution was trying to address was the culture of the 1980s and early 1990s, when the Kenyan president tended to be surrounded by half-educated sycophants. These handfuls of men who had the ear of the president were so powerful they could influence public policy on just about anything. The story is told of how in a bid to stem anti-government sentiments at public universities, one of these semi-literate leaders said: ""The government has enough resources to hunt down and arrest thisKaro Makisiwho is inciting the students to riot"". The poor politician was convinced that Karl Marx was a man physically present at the universities and was causing trouble for the government. Was Karl Marx really causing trouble on Kenyan campuses? No-one had educated him on popular social, economic and political ideologies. Another of the inner-circle politicians who barely went to school is famously said to have proposed a great solution to the frequent unrest and clamour for political change taking place in public universities. ""If all that the students want isdayarog, they should be given thedayarogto eat so that calm returns to the institutions."" He mistook the students' demand for dialogue as a type of food that was missing from their menu. This is how far Kenya has come in the evolution of its political leaders. Now fearful of being barred from running for the lucrative position of governor, many politicians who did not go to university have been studying day and night to obtain degrees. But based on experience of poor leadership, Kenyans know that a university degree does not define a leader nor guarantee competent leadership. Some of the worst cases of mismanagement of resources and abuse of power have involved highly educated people. On the contrary, Kenya has in the past witnessed brilliant leaders who were elected into office without degrees and who have gone on to personify exemplary leadership. The constitution of Kenya has another provision on leadership and integrity. This requires people vying for public office to be elected on the basis of personal integrity, selfless service and honesty. However, these core leadership principles have been reduced to a mere process of certifying that the candidate is of good conduct and free from corruption charges. The clearance procedure is open to manipulation and abuse, and judging by the number of leaders who have been involved in grand corruption over the last five years, it is an exercise in futility. So Kenyans can be forgiven for turning Mr Joho's education pain into a national pastime online. Light-hearted Kenyans on social media have seized the Joho affair to joke about the necessity of getting in touch with long-lost classmates No matter how progressive the constitution is or how comprehensive the laws are, it is only when the people breathe life into its letter and spirit and defend it with their lives that transformation can truly begin to take place. For now, because I'm not sure who else might be reading this, excuse me for a moment as I try to find my long lost classmates â¦ just in case.

"This video can not be played Wenger future 'not completely sorted out yet' Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is confident Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil want to stay at the club but says his own future is ""not sorted completely"". Contract talks with Ozil, 28, and Sanchez are on hold until the summer. Sanchez, 28, has been quoted stating he wants to stay in London at a club with a ""winning mentality"", prompting speculation of a move to Chelsea. ""I personally believe both of them want to stay and I hope the club will find an agreement with them,"" said Wenger. Both players are under contract until June 2018 but speculation over their futures has been widespread during the current campaign. The Arsenal manager, 67, stressed the situation was ""not an immediate concern"" and that there was no need to sell key players, unlike in past seasons when the club did so based on their financial position. Chilean Sanchez was quoted in his homeland saying: ""I'm happy in London [home of both Arsenal and current Premier League leaders Chelsea] and I want to finish my contract. I like to stay in one place, one city, where the team fights for titles."" Wenger emphasised he took Sanchez's words in ""a very positive way"". ""Alexis said he wants to win the championship, that's what everybody wants,"" added Wenger. Download BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast Wenger was offered a new contract earlier this season but several ex-Arsenal playershave stated his 21 years at the club are coming to an endin the face of mounting fan frustration at perceived underachievement. The Gunners remain in the FA Cup but have exited the Champions League and sit sixth in the Premier League, form which has seen sections of supporters hold banners and sing songs asking Wenger to leave. He promised clarity on his future ""soon"" less than two weeks ago, but on Thursday said: ""It's a subject that at the moment it is not sorted completely out. ""I'm very clear in my mind. Do I stay two months or two years? My commitment will be exactly the same all the time. It does not influence my attitude."" Some sections of Arsenal's support have called for Wenger to leave Striker Lucas Perezhas told Spanish media that Wenger has not communicated any decision,externalto the players, but that he expects the manager to stay. Arsenal have lost six of their last nine games but, asked if the issue was creating a distraction, Wenger added: ""I believe the priority in life is to focus on what is important, not to look for excuses."" Arsenal meet hosts Manchester City on Sunday and the visitors' boss Pep Guardiola has called criticism of Wenger ""unacceptable"". In turn Wenger said: ""I respect him hugely as a manager, exceptional career, once he's been at Man City 20 years don't worry, he'll get the same treatment."" Wenger confirmed midfielder Santi Cazorla's season was over because of the ankle injury which has kept him out since October, while Petr Cech could also miss the next two fixtures. The former Monaco boss also praised the impact of video technology inSpain's 2-0 win in Franceon Tuesday, stating the move ""should have happened a long time ago"". The use of technology saw an Antoine Griezmann goal ruled out and later a Gerard Deulofeu goal awarded after a 40-second wait while the decision was made.

"Shakeel Ahmad has been selling meat since the 1970s and knows no other way of making a living The government's crackdown on meat shops in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has left many traders and butchers without much work and money. The BBC's Vikas Pandey meets them in Allahabad city. ""I have no money since my shop shut two weeks ago. I don't know how to feed my children and aging parents. Is it because I am a Muslim, or a meat trader?"" Shakeel Ahmad, 52, asks. He is angry with the state's new chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, who opposes the slaughter and consumption of cows, considered sacred by India's Hindu majority. Authorities have closed many slaughterhouses since Mr Adityanath's BJP party won the state elections earlier in the month. Small shops selling goat and chicken have also been forced to shut, despite the slaughter of these animals being legal. Most butchers are Muslims and many suspect that they are being targeted unfairly. They allege that their businesses are being shut on technicalities. One meat traders associationwent on strike,alleging harassment by state authorities. This video can not be played The crackdown on ""illegal"" slaughterhouses is causing heartache in the state. Mr Ahmad says he understands the crackdown on slaughterhouses which sell beef ""because it was one of the BJP's campaign promises"". India meat traders strike over closures Who's the Hindu hardliner running India's most populous state? Why beef ban in Indian state undermines secularism ""But why punish small shop owners who sell goat and sheep meat? Most butchers like me earn daily, and don't have any other skill after being in the business for decades,"" he says. Shakeel Ahmad's family of 10 members lives in a small two-room house He adds that municipal authorities recently rejected his application to renew his licence. ""They want me to set up a waste disposal unit, but I don't have the money needed for it."" Mr Ahmad lives in a small house with nine other family members in a densely populated area, mostly inhabited by the Muslim Qureshi community. Fatima Begum says she is running out of the medicine she needs, and has no money to buy any more His mother, Fatima Begum, says that the community in this area has traditionally earned its livelihood through the meat trade. ""Men in this community don't have any other skill. We are already poor, and now we are not sure where the next meal is going to come from. They may as well kill us,"" she says. Ms Begum says she needs regular medication because of her old age. ""I am running out of my medicines, but I haven't told this to my son because I don't want to add to his troubles,"" she says. Husna Begum says she fears that her children's education may get affected Mr Ahmad's wife, Husna Begum, is worried about her children's education. ""I want my children to get a good education and come out of poverty.  If the government thinks meat shops are bad, then give us something else to do. ""Is it a crime to dream about a good future for your children?"" she asks. A few blocks away, I meet Mohamed Shariq who has also shut his shop. ""I have the licence needed to run my shop, but I fear attacks from right-wing groups,"" he says. Mr Shariq's fear is not unfounded. Media reports suggest that several meat shops,externalhave been attacked in the state in the past two weeks. Mohamed Shariq says he can't even sell chicken these days Mr Shariq invites me to his house, and asks a question. ""Just look around. My house is already breaking apart. I have to feed 10 people. Is it fair to ban our only source of livelihood?"" His brother P Qureshi and other members of the family also join the conversation. A family of 10 members depends on P Qureshi's earnings They are all worried about their future. ""I hope and pray that the chief minister understands our problems and stops people who are misusing his name. We know there is no official ban on slaughtering sheep and goats, but we are still scared,"" Mr Qureshi says. Every house in this community has similar stories. Abdul Qureshi, who ferries animals in his cycle rickshaw, says the crackdown seems so unreasonable because Hindus too eat meat. Abdul Qureshi hasn't gone out to work for 10 days ""Most of the customers in this market are Hindus. Even the Indian Army people buy from our shops. I don't understand how banning a food item proves anybody is more or less religious,"" he says. Gulzar Qureshi is the community leader here, and he explains that ""people don't understand that this is not just Muslims' problem"". ""Most people who rear sheep and goats are Hindus. I know so many Hindus who have come here from their villages to sell their animals and are now stuck,"" he says. Chunni Lal is one of them. Chunni Lal says he has been selling goats and sheep to Muslims for decades ""I am running out of money to feed the five goats I have brought with me. Nobody is willing to buy them,"" Mr Lal says. Gulzar Qureshi says people who believe that the meat trade ban has only affected butchers and slaughterhouse owners are wrong. ""That's just over simplification. Cattle farmers, middlemen who buy animals and butchers are all affected,"" he says. He adds that even rickshaw pullers who ferry these animals, and tannery workers who need leather don't have much work these days. ""We are not asking for fancy roads and schools. Just let us earn whatever little amount we make for our children. I think that's the least a citizen can expect from his government,"" he says.

"Will Britons be safer, more at risk, or see their security largely unchanged once the UK exits from the European Union? In thehistoric letter triggering Article 50 published on Wednesday, the Prime Minister Theresa May warned that failure to negotiate an agreement could damage security cooperation and the fight against crime and terrorism. The arguments over the security implications for the UK that circulated at the time of the June 2016 referendum are now being revived, but with rather more substance. The most serious and the most immediate security threat is that of a major terrorist attack, perhaps one even worse thanthe one in Westminster on 22 March. In police jargon, the nightmare scenario they have been rehearsing for years for is known as a ""Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack"" (MTFA) - using machine guns to kill pedestrians in a crowded public place. Given this is still an objective for the so-called Islamic State - coupled with the presence of large numbers of jihadists across Europe, especially those returning from Syria and Iraq, and the proliferation of automatic weapons available in the criminal black market on the Continent - close cooperation between the UK and its European partners will continue to be key to stopping terrorist attacks in time. Inside Europol Reality Check: Is Britain safer in or out of the EU? Brexit: Article 50 has been triggered - what now? BBC Editors: The key issues for negotiation Intelligence officers from MI5, senior policemen and women from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, the prime minister's national security adviser and the National Security Secretariat have all been studying what effect, if any, Britain's departure will have on our security. So what are the arguments for and against? In the Brexit-triggering letter, the prime minister set out her fears of what could happen if the next two years of negotiations ended in failure and Britain exited the EU without a deal. ""In security terms, a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome."" A recent study by the Rand Corporation concluded that ""both sides [the UK and EU] risk becoming weaker and less secure if Brexit talks provoke a 'zero-sum' approach to security and a 'messy divorce'"". Europol's Rob Wainwright is concerned at the impact of Brexit on the fight against crime The director general of Europol, the pan-EU police force headquartered in The Hague, has expressed grave concerns that Britain's departure will adversely affect the fight against organised crime, international terrorism and cybercrime. Rob Wainwright told the BBC: ""To help keep Britain safe from these threats, its law enforcement community has become dependent on the unique operational benefits offered by key EU instruments: over 3,000 cross-border investigations of organised crime and terrorism were initiated last year at Europol by UK agencies, a rate 25% up on the year before."" There is, however, a subtle distinction between fighting ""ordinary"" crime and countering terrorism (CT). In fighting crime, the UK has benefited from both membership of the European Arrest Warrant and Europol. But counter-terrorism officials admit privately that neither are indispensable when it comes to sharing intelligence on terror suspects. This is often gathered by highly secretive intelligence agencies who are unwilling to share sensitive material, in real-time, with Europol. One pan-European mechanism Britain's CT community does value highly is the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). This provides a framework for the timely exchange of information on suspects believed to be at large in Europe, and at risk of slipping unnoticed across borders, something the 2015 Paris attack planners managed to do with ease. But shutting Britain out of this club would be counter-productive for the rest of Europe, so officers are confident it will be retained after Brexit. Scotland is another worry. A Trident submarine makes its way out from Faslane naval base in Scotland If Brexit does result in Scotland voting for independence from London, then there will inevitably be huge implications for UK defence and security. The UK's Trident submarines, known as the ""continuous at sea deterrent"", are currently based in Scotland and would quite possibly have to be moved south of the border. Theresa May wrote in her letter that attention needed to be paid to ""the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland"". The border between north and south, which is currently open, would almost certainly be tightened. Ms May reminded everyone that the Republic of Ireland was the only EU member state with a land border with the UK, and that her government did not want a return to ""a hard border"" between the two countries. She also said nothing should be done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland. Then there is Russia. MI5's efforts to thwart espionage by Russian agents will continue post-Brexit, as will GCHQ's efforts to prevent cyber-espionage and hacking. But on the diplomatic front, there is no question that the EU's united stand towards Moscow on sanctions, Crimea and eastern Ukraine will be weakened by the departure of one of the strongest and most outspoken governments. It should be remembered though, that Nato is responsible for the military defence of Europe, not the EU, and Britain is not leaving Nato. One of the most emotive and persuasive arguments put forward by supporters of Brexit was that leaving the European Union would allow the UK to regain control of its borders, giving it back control over who it lets into the country. In the long term, the indications are there is some truth in this where EU citizens are concerned. But the mechanics are still being worked out and there are numerous exceptions and loopholes. It also ignores the fact there are an estimated 3,000 British citizens - at the minimum - whom the government is aware of having jihadist connections, contacts and sympathies. The detailed effect of Brexit on the UK's borders is as yet unknown These are people who are already living here and who in most cases have been radicalised over the internet or by their peer group without even travelling to a battlefield like Syria. One person who has been right at the cutting edge of counter-terrorism for five years is Richard Walton. He was Commander of the Met Police's SO15 Counter Terrorism Command from 2011-16, and he has firm views on this issue. ""The UK could leave both the EU and Europol with little, if any, impact on its own national security or counter-terrorism capabilities,"" he wrote recently. Based on his own frontline experience, he believes that Britain's unique expertise in this area is much too valuable for EU countries not to keep lines open and two-way information flowing. This is partly due to the close cooperation enjoyed between the police and MI5, which evolved in the wake of the 2005 London bombings, a relationship which is not mirrored in most other EU countries. (Belgium, for example, has a long way to go to improve cooperation between its various agencies). Not surprisingly perhaps, Europol's Rob Wainwright disagrees with Mr Walton. He maintains that Europol, of which the UK is currently a member, is fast becoming indispensable. ""Recent Europol reforms and improved levels of trust in it by national agencies,"" he explained to the BBC, ""have witnessed a ten-fold increase in the sharing of terrorism data with Europol in the last two years (across Europe as a whole)."" The home secretary says threats to the UK's security have not been changed by the Brexit vote But Mr Walton also argues that Britain's membership of the 5 Eyes intelligence sharing agreement gives it a special place in Europe. 5 Eyes is an extraordinarily close and trusting arrangement between the intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand. As the only European nation in this ""club"", Britain's membership will endure beyond Brexit, while EU governments will want to continue to have access to any intelligence that affects them. In December 2016, six months after the referendum, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd was quoted as saying: ""The threats and challenges to UK national security have not fundamentally changed as a result of the decision to leave."" This week, in the wake of the attack that killed four people in Westminster on 22 March, Richard Walton commented: ""Brexit will make no difference to Westminster or any subsequent counter-terror operation, proactive or reactive."" Essentially, he says, it remains business as usual.

"The procession was led by children, police and faith leaders Yellow roses and banners saying ""Islam says no to terror"" and ""please don't kill innocent people"" were in the hands of schoolchildren aged nine and 10. They were leading a procession on a packed Westminster Bridge to mark a week since Khalid Masood killed four people and injured 50 in an 82-second attack. Standing with them were senior police officers and faith leaders, many carrying banners themselves with the words ""love for all, hatred for none"". Quietly but surely the group processed towards the scene of the attack, passing some of the nurses and doctors from St Thomas' hospital who treated victims at the time. Then quiet fell as a silence was held at 14:40 BST - the exact moment a week ago that Khalid Masood began his attack. There was almost silence, apart from the noises of police helicopters overhead - a reminder of the vigilance needed to police such an event and the ongoing threat police have to guard against. After a few minutes the crowds gathered on either side of the road were pushed back to allow people to lay flowers near the scene of the attack. Police officers, medical workers, schoolchildren and religious leaders were among those who laid single roses and daffodils. A male victim of the attack, who appeared to have a broken leg, was pushed in a wheelchair to lay a flower on the bridge. Unsurprisingly for a tourist destination like Westminster, where so many come just to spend a few hours of sightseeing, many of those who had gathered to watch the service had not known beforehand it would be happening. But the sight of large crowds of police - some armed with machine guns, others on horseback - suggested this was no ordinary day in Westminster. As the crowds began to get bigger, passersby would stop to ask ""what's happening?"", or take photographs, before invariably staying to watch. Others, many from London's Muslim community, came to the event prepared with banners and placards with messages of peace and solidarity. Hundreds of members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association were among them. Many wore T-shirts with the message ""I am a Muslim, ask me anything"", while others carried whiteboards asking people what message they would like to send to Muslims. Periodically, people would stop to talk to them or shake their hands in recognition. Zafir Malik, an imam from the association, said they were asked by the police to come along to show solidarity. He said they wanted to ""show that what happened here last week had nothing to do with the so-called religious aspect that this has been given"". L-R: Zishan Ahmad, with his brother Danyal, said ""You can't divide London"" Brendan O'Connor said the service showed those who sought to divide London were ""not going to stop us"" Zishan Ahmad, a 25-year-old Imam, who is also part of the group, added: ""You can't divide London - we stand together. ""It doesn't matter if you are Muslim, Christian or Jew, or black, brown or any other race. London will never be divided. ""This is the most multicultural city in the world. I've lived in Holland and Germany but I've never seen anything like London."" Brendan O'Connor, from Holborn, central London, said the memorial service sent a message that those who would seek to divide London are ""not going to stop us"". The 59-year-old added: ""There's love here. You can't kill love with hate. Love always conquers.""

"Is your dog drinking like a fish, urinating frequently and losing weight? Is your cat restless, nervous and getting thinner by the day, despite a huge appetite? Diabetes and hyperthyroidism are just two of the common human diseases thought to be on the rise in the pet world. Human diabetes is on the increase, and Dr Stijn Niessen, of the Royal Veterinary College (RVC,) says the same trend can be seen in pet cats. He suggests about one in every 200 pet cats now has type-2 diabetes, compared with some one in 900 just three decades ago. ""Cats are designed to be hunters - but now there are lots sitting in inner-city apartments getting little exercise and being fed frequently, often as a misplaced sign of affection,"" Dr Niessen says. But he is quick to point out there are lots of fat cats that do not go on to develop diabetes. In some cases, it is more about genetics than lifestyle. When it comes to dogs, about three in every 1,000 have diabetes in the UK, according to the RVC. Dogs do not get type-2 diabetes, but they are more likely than cats to have type-1 diabetes, where the body's immune system stops it from being able to produce insulin, a key hormone that helps store sugar safely. In both cats and dogs (and sometimes monkeys, rabbits and even rats) with diabetes, owners often find their pets are constantly thirsty, urinating frequently and losing weight - diabetic symptoms humans and pets share. Treatment can include giving insulin injections. And some studies in cats suggest some can kick their diabetes into remission by getting rid of the extra pounds. Hyperactive, restless cats that are losing weight despite eating ravenously may have hyperthyroidism. Just like in humans, this condition occurs when the thyroid gland in the neck produces excess hormones. One way to treat an overactive thyroid is to give the cat an injection of radioactive iodine. The iodine ends up concentrated in the thyroid gland and emits radiation, killing overactive thyroid cells. This is a good way to cure hyperthyroidism, but cats have to be kept in isolation for several weeks after as they are likely to be emitting radiation in their litter trays for some time. Dogs, on the other hand, are more likely to suffer the opposite problem. About four in every 1,000 pet dogs in the UK are seen by vets for underactive thyroids. Owners might notice their pets are lazier and slower than usual and are piling on the pounds - some of the same symptoms humans with hypothyroidism share. And just like with their human counterparts, thyroid hormone replacement therapy can help. Dogs who are breathless or even collapse suddenly may end up being given Viagra. The drug is famous for helping men with erectile dysfunction. But before doctors prescribed it for this, scientists were studying it to see if it could be used as a treatment for high blood pressure. And vets now use it to treat pulmonary hypertension in dogs - high blood pressure in the lungs. One tells me she is sometimes asked by owners whether they can just give their own pills to their pets. But the answer is no. The drugs are licensed and formulated separately for people and pets. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) attacks the cat's immune system, leaving it unable to fight off other infections. In this way, it is similar to HIV in humans. In the US, between 1.5% and 3% of otherwise healthy cats are infected with FIV. Persistent fevers, a coat in poor condition and a loss of appetite are common in infected cats. Inflammation of the gums and chronic infections of the skin, eyes, bladder, and upper respiratory tract are often signs too. According to Prof Holger Volk of the RVC, about one in every 100 dogs has epilepsy. Cats also get the condition, but it is less common. It can cause convulsions, but in some cases the symptoms are not as easy to spot. Animals can be treated with anti-epileptic pills, but they do not work for every pet. Prof Volk's early work suggests a diet rich in certain fatty acids might help. And he is now conducting larger trials to see if these results stand up. Scientists in his department have also looked at videos featuring either animals or humans with epilepsy having seizures. And they concluded the animals often received more sympathy from onlookers. But sympathy and empathy aside, Dr Volk and Dr Niessen both say studying common diseases in pets could ultimately help us learn more about the diseases we experience ourselves.

"The BBC has learned that US officials ""verified"" a key claim in a report about Kremlin involvement in Donald Trump's election - that a Russian diplomat in Washington was in fact a spy. So far, no single piece of evidence has been made public proving that the Trump campaign joined with Russia to steal the US presidency - nothing. But the FBI Director, James Comey, told a hushed committee room in Congress last week that this is precisely what his agents are investigating. Stop to let that thought reverberate for a moment. ""Investigation is not proof,"" said the president's spokesman. Trump's supporters are entitled to ask why - with the FBI's powers to subpoena witnesses and threaten charges of obstructing justice - nothing damning has emerged. Perhaps there is nothing to find. But some former senior officials say it is because of failings in the inquiry, of which more later. The roadmap for the investigation, publicly acknowledged now for the first time, comes from Christopher Steele, once of Britain's secret intelligence service MI6. He wrote a series of reports for political opponents of Donald Trump about Trump and Russia. Steele's ""dossier"", as the material came to be known, contains a number of highly contested claims. At one point he wrote: ""A leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the US presidential election operationâ¦ would be exposed in the media there."" There was no diplomat called Kulagin in the Russian embassy; there was a Kalugin. One of Trump's allies, Roger Stone, said to me of Steele, scornfully: ""If 007 wants to be taken seriously, he ought to learn how to spell."" The Russian Foreign Ministry said Kalugin was head of the embassy's economics section. The Russian embassy in Washington, where Kalugin worked He had gone home in August 2016 at the end of a six-year posting. The man himself emailed journalists to complain about a ""stream of lies and fake news about my person"". If anyone looks like a harmless economist, rather than a tough, arrogant KGB man, it is the bland-faced Kalugin. But sources I know and trust have told me the US government identified Kalugin as a spy while he was still at the embassy. It is not clear if the American intelligence agencies already believed this when they got Steele's report on the ""diplomat"", as early as May 2016. But it is a judgment they made using their own methods, outside the dossier. A retired member of a US intelligence agency told me that Kalugin was being kept under surveillance before he left the US. In addition, State Department staff who dealt with Russia did not come across Kalugin, as would have been expected with a simple diplomat. ""Nobody had met him,"" one former official said. ""It's classic. Just classic [of Russian intelligence]."" Last month,the McClatchy news website,externalsaid he was under ""scrutiny"" by the FBI as he left the US. They did not report, as my sources say, that he was a member of one of Russia's spying organisations, the SVR or GRU. Mikhail Kalugin, Head of Economic Section for the Russian Embassy in the US, in an interview with CGTN America Steele's work remains fiercely controversial, to some a ""dodgy dossier"" concocted by President Trump's enemies. But on this vitally important point - Kalugin's status as a ""spy under diplomatic cover"" - people who saw the intelligence agree with the dossier, adding weight to Steele's other claims. But then they knew him already. I understand - from former officials - that from 2013-16, Steele gave the US government extensive information on Russia and Ukraine. This was work done for private clients, but which Steele wanted the US authorities to see. One former senior official who saw these reports told me: ""It was found to be of value by the people whose job it was to look at Russia every day. ""They said things like, 'How can he get this so quickly? This fits exactly with what we have.' It was validated many times."" Sign up to get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Another who dealt with this material in government said: ""Sometimes he would get spun by somebody. [But] it was always 80% there."" None of these reports touched on the nature of Trump's relationship with Russia. But last June, Steele began sending pages of what would later be called his dossier. In light of his earlier work, the US intelligence community saw him as ""credible"" (their highest praise). The FBI thought the same; they had worked with Steele going back to his days in MI6. Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who wrote the dossiers on Trump's team and Russia He flew to Rome in August to talk to the FBI. Then in early October, he came to the US and was extensively debriefed by them, over a week. He gave the FBI the names of some of his informants, the so-called ""key"" to the dossier. But the CIA never interviewed him, and never sought to. This comes from several people who are in a position to know. They are alarmed at how the investigation is going, and worry it is being fumbled. Russia; The scandal Trump can't shake Russian media no longer dazzled by Trump Echoes of Watergate resurface One said: ""The FBI doesn't know about Russia, the CIA knows about Russia. ""Any sources Steele has in Russia, the FBI doesn't know how to evaluate. ""The Agency doesâ¦ Who's running this thing from Moscow? The FBI just aren't capable on that side, of even understanding what Chris has."" Another reflected growing frustration with the inquiry among some who served in the Obama administration: ""We used to call them the Feebs. They would make the simple cases, but never see, let alone understand and go after, the bigger picture."" (My editors have asked me to explain, for readers outside North America, that feeb is slang for someone feeble-minded, used above as a contraction of the initials FBI.) I understand that Steele himself did not ask to brief the CIA because he had a long-standing relationship with the FBI. The Russia people at the CIA had moved on and he felt he did not have the personal contacts he would need. The CIA and the FBI would not comment on any of this. But the FBI is said to have a large presence at the US embassy in Moscow and has long experience of investigating Russian organised crime in the US. The FBI director, Comey, also said in his testimony to Congress: ""This investigation began in late July, so for counter-intelligence investigation that's a fairly short period of time."" This video can not be played 'Putin hates Clinton' and other things the FBI learned about Russia Several sources have told me that late last year Steele himself grew increasingly disillusioned with the FBI's progress. ""He really thought that what he had would sway the election,"" said one. So in October, pages from his reports were seen by a few journalists, including me. Most news organisations that got this material decided it was not solid enough to publish. In early December, the whole thing, 35 pages, was sent to Senator John McCain, who pressed the FBI director to investigate exhaustively. The following month, the intelligence agencies briefed both then-President Barack Obama and Trump about the dossier - and the entire contents were published by Buzzfeed. In the report, Steele spoke of an ""established operational liaison between the TRUMP team and the Kremlinâ¦ an intelligence exchange had been running between them for at least 8 years."" Members of the Obama administration believe, based on analysis they saw from the intelligence community, that the information exchange claimed by Steele continued into the election. ""This is a three-headed operation,"" said one former official, setting out the case, based on the intelligence: Firstly, hackers steal damaging emails from senior Democrats. Secondly, the stories based on this hacked information appear on Twitter and Facebook, posted by thousands of automated ""bots"", then on Russia's English-language outlets, RT and Sputnik, then right-wing US ""news"" sites such as Infowars and Breitbart, then Fox and the mainstream media. Thirdly, Russia downloads the online voter rolls. Trump 'compromising' claims: How and why did we get here? The people around Donald Trump The voter rolls are said to fit into this because of ""microtargeting"". Using email, Facebook and Twitter, political advertising can be tailored very precisely: individual messaging for individual voters. ""You are stealing the stuff and pushing it back into the US body politic,"" said the former official, ""you know where to target that stuff when you're pushing it back."" This would take co-operation with the Trump campaign, it is claimed. Trump has accused his predecessor of ""wire tapping"" him, without any proof ""If you need to ensure that white women in Pennsylvania don't vote or independents get pissed in Michigan so they stay home: that's voter suppression. You can figure what your target demographics and locations are from the voter rolls. Then you can use that to target your bot."" This is the ""big picture"" some accuse the FBI of failing to see. It is, so far, all allegation - and not just the parts concerning Donald Trump and his people. For instance, the US intelligence agencies said last October that the voter rolls had been""scanned and probed"",externalfrom a server in Russia. But the Russian government wasnever shown to have been responsible,external. There are either a series of coincidences or there is a conspiracy of such reach and sophistication that it may take years to unravel. ""I hear a lot of people comparing this to Watergate,"" said Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee. ""Let me just tell you, the complexity of this case is unlike anything we've ever seen. ""Watergate doesn't even come close. That was a burglary in the Metro section of the Washington Post. ""It doesn't have the international waypoints [of this]. Russia's M.O. is to avoid attribution. This investigation is going to take time."" In his testimony, the FBI director gave away nothing of the details of the inquiry.As I wrote in January, it is being done by a ""counter-intelligence taskforce"" that includes the CIA, with the FBI leading. I wrote then that the secret US intelligence court had granted an order, a so-called Fisa warrant, to intercept the electronic records of two Russian banks. The White House cited this report several times as evidence for President Trump's tweets that ""Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Towerâ¦ This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"" It isn't. Since Watergate, no president can simply order the CIA or FBI to tap someone's phone. I wrote that: ""Neither Trump nor his associates are named in the Fisa order."" If they were, the court would have to see ""probable cause"" that they were agents of a foreign power. It is possible that the communications of Trump associates were picked up in monitoring of foreign entities, such as the Russian banks, so-called ""incidental collection"". This is presumably what the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, is talking about when he asks Congress to investigate an ""abuse of power"" by the Obama administration. Comey was careful in his testimony to say the investigation was into ""co-ordination"" rather than collusion. ""Collusion is not a term, a legal term of art,"" he said, ""and it's one I haven't used here today, as we're investigating to see whether there was any co-ordinationâ¦"" Comey's testimony confirmed there was an open investigation over the links between the Trump campaign and Russia - but not much more ""Explicit or implicit coordination?"" a Congressman asked. ""Knowing or unknowing,"" Comey replied. The investigation, then, is into a range of possibilities: at one end, unwitting co-operation with Russia by members of the Trump campaign; at the other conscious ""co-ordination"". Hillary Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook, said that if Trump's aides knew of Russia's plans, there should be charges of treason. Trump's enemies ask us to believe that some of his people were either traitors or dupes. The president himself has another version of events: there was no ""co-ordination""; the whole thing is a monstrous lie created by the Obama administration, fed by the intelligence community and amplified by the ""dishonest"" media, billowing black clouds of smoke but no fire. When the dossier was released, he tweeted: ""Are we living in Nazi Germany?"" These two stories cannot be reconciled. With each new drip of information, option three - the chance that this is all a giant mistake, an improbable series of coincidences - seems further out of reach. Increasingly, the American people are being asked to choose between two unpalatable versions of events: abuse of power by one president or treason that put another in the White House. It cannot be both.

"Shakeel Ahmad has been selling meat since the 1970s and knows no other way of making a living The government's crackdown on meat shops in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has left many traders and butchers without much work and money. The BBC's Vikas Pandey meets them in Allahabad city. ""I have no money since my shop shut two weeks ago. I don't know how to feed my children and aging parents. Is it because I am a Muslim, or a meat trader?"" Shakeel Ahmad, 52, asks. He is angry with the state's new chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, who opposes the slaughter and consumption of cows, considered sacred by India's Hindu majority. Authorities have closed many slaughterhouses since Mr Adityanath's BJP party won the state elections earlier in the month. Small shops selling goat and chicken have also been forced to shut, despite the slaughter of these animals being legal. Most butchers are Muslims and many suspect that they are being targeted unfairly. They allege that their businesses are being shut on technicalities. One meat traders associationwent on strike,alleging harassment by state authorities. This video can not be played The crackdown on ""illegal"" slaughterhouses is causing heartache in the state. Mr Ahmad says he understands the crackdown on slaughterhouses which sell beef ""because it was one of the BJP's campaign promises"". India meat traders strike over closures Who's the Hindu hardliner running India's most populous state? Why beef ban in Indian state undermines secularism ""But why punish small shop owners who sell goat and sheep meat? Most butchers like me earn daily, and don't have any other skill after being in the business for decades,"" he says. Shakeel Ahmad's family of 10 members lives in a small two-room house He adds that municipal authorities recently rejected his application to renew his licence. ""They want me to set up a waste disposal unit, but I don't have the money needed for it."" Mr Ahmad lives in a small house with nine other family members in a densely populated area, mostly inhabited by the Muslim Qureshi community. Fatima Begum says she is running out of the medicine she needs, and has no money to buy any more His mother, Fatima Begum, says that the community in this area has traditionally earned its livelihood through the meat trade. ""Men in this community don't have any other skill. We are already poor, and now we are not sure where the next meal is going to come from. They may as well kill us,"" she says. Ms Begum says she needs regular medication because of her old age. ""I am running out of my medicines, but I haven't told this to my son because I don't want to add to his troubles,"" she says. Husna Begum says she fears that her children's education may get affected Mr Ahmad's wife, Husna Begum, is worried about her children's education. ""I want my children to get a good education and come out of poverty.  If the government thinks meat shops are bad, then give us something else to do. ""Is it a crime to dream about a good future for your children?"" she asks. A few blocks away, I meet Mohamed Shariq who has also shut his shop. ""I have the licence needed to run my shop, but I fear attacks from right-wing groups,"" he says. Mr Shariq's fear is not unfounded. Media reports suggest that several meat shops,externalhave been attacked in the state in the past two weeks. Mohamed Shariq says he can't even sell chicken these days Mr Shariq invites me to his house, and asks a question. ""Just look around. My house is already breaking apart. I have to feed 10 people. Is it fair to ban our only source of livelihood?"" His brother P Qureshi and other members of the family also join the conversation. A family of 10 members depends on P Qureshi's earnings They are all worried about their future. ""I hope and pray that the chief minister understands our problems and stops people who are misusing his name. We know there is no official ban on slaughtering sheep and goats, but we are still scared,"" Mr Qureshi says. Every house in this community has similar stories. Abdul Qureshi, who ferries animals in his cycle rickshaw, says the crackdown seems so unreasonable because Hindus too eat meat. Abdul Qureshi hasn't gone out to work for 10 days ""Most of the customers in this market are Hindus. Even the Indian Army people buy from our shops. I don't understand how banning a food item proves anybody is more or less religious,"" he says. Gulzar Qureshi is the community leader here, and he explains that ""people don't understand that this is not just Muslims' problem"". ""Most people who rear sheep and goats are Hindus. I know so many Hindus who have come here from their villages to sell their animals and are now stuck,"" he says. Chunni Lal is one of them. Chunni Lal says he has been selling goats and sheep to Muslims for decades ""I am running out of money to feed the five goats I have brought with me. Nobody is willing to buy them,"" Mr Lal says. Gulzar Qureshi says people who believe that the meat trade ban has only affected butchers and slaughterhouse owners are wrong. ""That's just over simplification. Cattle farmers, middlemen who buy animals and butchers are all affected,"" he says. He adds that even rickshaw pullers who ferry these animals, and tannery workers who need leather don't have much work these days. ""We are not asking for fancy roads and schools. Just let us earn whatever little amount we make for our children. I think that's the least a citizen can expect from his government,"" he says.

" After being a mildly interesting place in which to spend an hour and sleep, when a child hits the teenage years the bedroom becomes a fortress, shrine and refuge. Only the honoured or the brave may enter. And to be honest, few would actually want to. So if you’re struggling to navigate the terrifying enclave that is an adolescent’s room, here are the important elements and the psychology behind them... The adolescent room tends to somewhat contrary in terms of temperature. They’ll happily swelter with the radiator on in August with all the windows shut, wrapped in a duvet. And then fling the windows wide to let the snow blow in. This is not simply a desire to annoy, say psychologists; it’s because their bedroom is the first place in which they can control their own environment. So repeatedly saying “Gosh, it’s hot in here” will have no effect whatsoever. Signs that say ‘Keep Out’, “KNOCK!” or even, in extreme cases, a doorbell, are all ways of teenagers marking out their territory. It’s a primal thing: are you a friend or foe, are you in the tribe? Parents will find they are very probably not (unless they’re brandishing a twenty pound note or a cup of tea), younger siblings will be absolutely barred but other pack members, i.e. friends, will be fine. Teenagers very rarely had their own bedrooms before 1840. Fewer children, no live-in servants or boarders meant that it became possible for young middle class people to have their own rooms. It was also seen as a way of encouraging self-control and respecting their own environment. That worked well. Nowadays it’s more common for young people to have their own rooms, but if they do share, there’ll be an elaborate borderline made with sheets, tape or furniture. The mess has a purpose. It says “I have chosen my environment to be deliberately different from yours”. Interestingly, frequently adolescents living in chaotic homes will have very tidy rooms, and the reverse is also true. Whatever you’re doing, it’s wrong, and they’re right. So there! Stereos, laptops, mobiles - it’s no coincidence that all the chargers in the house gravitate to the teenager’s bedroom. The bedroom is a safe haven, and becoming absorbed in technology entertainment is an even safer space - it’s a world within a world. Once radios and record players became smaller and cheaper they could be bought by teenagers themselves and put in their bedrooms. Before then, the ‘home entertainment’ would be in the living room. In the 1950s products began being marketed specifically at young people, so the right posters, the right music on display, the right ‘markers’ means that the teenager is declaring their tribe, whatever that is. Either way, it’s not your tribe so don’t expect to understand it. The teen bedroom is the place where adolescents can be and express themselves. It’s a refuge and a safe space, but occasionally a lonely place. If your teen’s hiding away, don’t stop knocking completely. One day you might be let in. Laurie Taylor talks to Jason Reid, Lecturer in History at Ryerson University who charts the evolution and meaning of this sanctuary for adolescent self expression.
