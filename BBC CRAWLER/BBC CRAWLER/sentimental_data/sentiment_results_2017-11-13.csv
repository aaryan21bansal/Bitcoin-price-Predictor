"Roslyn Corrigan said: ""He dropped his hands down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze"" A woman has said she was 16 when former US President George HW Bush groped her buttocks as she posed for a photo with him and her mother. Rosyln Corrigan is the sixth woman to accuse Mr Bush of inappropriately touching her in similar circumstances. She told Time Magazine she met Mr Bush at a 2003 meeting of CIA officers in Texas, where her father worked. ""My initial reaction was absolute horror,"" she said about the incident. ""I was really, really confused."" ""I was a child,"" Ms Corrigan added. A Bush spokesman has previously acknowledged he has touched several women on the rear. On Monday, Jim McGrath, a spokesman for Mr Bush, told the BBC the 41st president, who once directed the CIA, ""simply does not have it in his heart to knowingly cause anyone harm or distress, and he again apologises to anyone he may have offended during a photo op"". Ms Corrigan said the incident occurred as Mr Bush was posing for a photo with her and her mother at the CIA office in The Woodlands, Texas, in November 2003. ""As soon as the picture was being snapped on the one-two-three he dropped his hands from my waist down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze, which would account for the fact that in the photograph my mouth is hanging wide open,"" Ms Corrigan said. Mr Bush was 79 years old at the time. ""I was like, 'Oh my goodness, what just happened?'"" Ms Corrigansaid in an interview with Time,external. ""I didn't say anything. What does a teenager say to the ex-president of the United States? Like, 'Hey dude, you shouldn't have touched me like that?'"" In late October, after several other women came forward with similar stories, Mr McGrath said that Mr Bush ""on occasion, has patted women's rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner"". He added that due to the former president's use of a wheel chair, ""his arms fall on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures"". But Mr Bush is standing up in the photos alongside Ms Corrigan, which she said bothers her because she believes the ""excuse for his senile, old man anticsâ¦ is not true"". ""When I heard that was the reason, like, 'Oh, he's just an old man and he doesn't know any better and he's just being harmless and playful and it's just where his arm fallsâ¦ I just burst into uncontrollable sobbing,"" she said. ""I just couldn't sit with that. I can't. I cannot sit with that. I can't sleep anymore, because that's not true, and it's not an excuse.""

"Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November A man and woman have been arrested on suspicion of murdering a teenager who has not been seen for nearly a week. Dorset Police said a 19-year-old man and a 71-year-old woman were arrested in connection with the disappearance of Gaia Pope, 19, who has severe epilepsy. The teenager, from Langton Matravers, was staying in Swanage when she disappeared on 7 November. Searches took place at two addresses in Swanage and the man and woman were arrested. Police said they were both known to Gaia. The last reported sighting of the teenager was by Rosemary Dinch at an address in Manor Gardens on Morrison Road in Swanage. Rosemary Dinch, a friend of the family, is believed to be the last person to see Gaia on Tuesday 7 November The family friend told the BBC Gaia ""pounded"" on her door and spent about 20 minutes at her house. She said: ""She was very upset, she slid to the floor at one point, I gave her a cuddle and she responded to me - I have no idea where she is - she just seems to have disappeared."" She was said to be wearing a red checked shirt with white buttons, grey and white woven leggings and white trainers and she went missing without her medication. On Saturday, Dorset Police released CCTV footage of what they believe was Gaia running past a house in Morrison Road at about 15:40. Det Ch Insp Neil Devoto, who is leading the investigation, said on Monday: ""It has been almost a week since Gaia's last confirmed sighting and she has not been seen or heard from since. ""We have looked through CCTV that covers the Swanage area, including transport hubs, and there is nothing to suggest she has left the area. ""Her disappearance is completely out of character and, following our extensive inquiries, we sadly now believe that she may have come to harm. ""We have not yet found Gaia and our searches will continue. ""Our specially-trained officers have updated Gaia's family and are supporting them at this very difficult time.""

"Rescue teams in Iran are looking for people in collapsed buildings A huge rescue effort is under way after a powerful earthquake struck Iran's mountainous border with Iraq, killing more than 400 people and injuring more than 7,000. Teams are looking for survivors trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. The quake is the deadliest in the world this year. Most people who died were in western Iran in Sarpol-e-Zahab, a town 15km (10 miles) from the border, and other parts of Kermanshah province. The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded people, state TV reported. A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said. Many buildings in the town appear to have collapsed,external, amateur video posted to Twitter by a radio station showed. Running water and electricity cut out in some cities, and after buildings collapsed people were forced to spend hours outdoors in parks or streets in cold weather. Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks and are vulnerable in quakes as large as Sunday's. Latest images of aftermath 'My aunt, cousin and my cousin's children died' ""We need shelter,"" a man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. ""Where is the aid? Where is the help?"" One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake, and there were reports that thousands of people were facing a second night in the cold as dusk fell. The UN said it was ""ready to assist if required"",externalin a statement from a spokesman for the secretary-general. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iranian officials said 413 people had died in the country. Some soldiers and border guards were among the dead, the Iranian army's commander-in-chief told the state news channel IRINN. After buildings collapsed in the earthquake, many victims spent the night outdoors In Iraq nine people died, a Red Crescent spokesman told the BBC. A UN office in the country said more than 500 people were injured there, and the earthquake was felt in Irbil, Sulaimaniya, Kirkuk and Basra as well as the capital, Baghdad. Landslides have made it harder for rescuers to reach those affected in rural areas, and there are fears a dam could burst after it was damaged by the earthquake. People living nearby have reportedly been asked to leave. This video can not be played The moment Iran-Iraq quake hit the Darbandikhan Dam control room The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km (19 miles) south of Darbandikhan,external, near the north-eastern border with Iran, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. More than 1.8 million people live within 100km of the epicentre, the UN estimates. Is it possible to predict a quake? The world's deadliest earthquakes The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people. Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 strong quakes last year and 19 the year before,external. Analysis by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past. In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year. In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression. Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture. Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe"" Boris Johnson has apologised for his remarks about a British-Iranian mother who is being held in prison in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was on holiday when she was arrested in 2016 - a claim the foreign secretary appeared to contradict this month. Apologising in the Commons, Mr Johnson said he would meet her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, on Wednesday and will visit Iran ""before the end of the year"". He retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". The row over the imprisonment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has been held in Iran for more than 18 months - has intensified since Mr Johnson gave evidence before a Commons committee on 1 November. During the hearing, the foreign secretary said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran - something her family and employer say is incorrect. The plight of Iran's jailed dual nationals Campaigners say she could face an increased prison sentence in Iran as a result of the comments. Responding to an urgent question in Parliament, Mr Johnson was asked to apologise for the remarks. ""Of course I apologise for the distress, for the suffering that has been caused by the impression I gave that I believed she was there in a professional capacity. She was there on holiday,"" he said. This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Mr Ratcliffe has called for his wife to be granted diplomatic protection, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national. Earlier, Downing Street said it was ""one of the options"" it was considering in the case. Asked by Labour about the prospect, Mr Johnson told MPs that he would be answering the question ""in person"" and would meet Mr Ratcliffe this week. He said he was also planning to visit Iran before the end of the year and would discuss the possibility of Mr Ratcliffe accompanying him. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were to assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one of its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Read more from James Last week, Mr Johnson said he was sorry if his remarks about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had caused anxiety to her family. However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry pushed him to ""apologise properly"" for his comments. ""If it is a matter of pride that the foreign secretary is refusing to admit that simply he has made a mistake, well then I feel bound to say to him that his pride matters not one ounce compared to Nazanin's freedom,"" she said in the Commons. ""After a week of obfuscation and bluster, will he finally take the opportunity today to state simply and unequivocally for the removal of any doubt - either here or in Tehran - that he simply got it wrong?"" Labour MP Yvette Cooper told Mr Johnson that ""words matter"", saying Mr Johnson cannot keep ""shrugging off"" comments that are ""inaccurate"" or ""damaging"". She called for him to resign. In reply, Mr Johnson said: ""It was my mistake. I should have been clearer."" He added: ""I apologise for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family."" Medical concern for Briton held in Iran 'My wife's been punished without crime' Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office following remarks made by Mr Johnson's Cabinet counterpart Michael Gove. Mr Gove had told the BBC on Sunday he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said Mr Johnson ""did promise to consider"" whether Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be eligible for diplomatic protection, which he said ""gives a different push"" to what the government can do. ""I'm reassured that it is the position of the government,"" Mr Ratcliffe adding. A Downing Street spokesman said diplomatic protection was one available option, adding: ""I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."" The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""from the outset"" and was treating it as ""a priority"". She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I apologise to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe"" Boris Johnson has apologised for his remarks about a British-Iranian mother who is being held in prison in Iran. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe says she was on holiday when she was arrested in 2016 - a claim the foreign secretary appeared to contradict this month. Apologising in the Commons, Mr Johnson said he would meet her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, on Wednesday and will visit Iran ""before the end of the year"". He retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". The row over the imprisonment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has been held in Iran for more than 18 months - has intensified since Mr Johnson gave evidence before a Commons committee on 1 November. During the hearing, the foreign secretary said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran - something her family and employer say is incorrect. The plight of Iran's jailed dual nationals Campaigners say she could face an increased prison sentence in Iran as a result of the comments. Responding to an urgent question in Parliament, Mr Johnson was asked to apologise for the remarks. ""Of course I apologise for the distress, for the suffering that has been caused by the impression I gave that I believed she was there in a professional capacity. She was there on holiday,"" he said. This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Mr Ratcliffe has called for his wife to be granted diplomatic protection, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national. Earlier, Downing Street said it was ""one of the options"" it was considering in the case. Asked by Labour about the prospect, Mr Johnson told MPs that he would be answering the question ""in person"" and would meet Mr Ratcliffe this week. He said he was also planning to visit Iran before the end of the year and would discuss the possibility of Mr Ratcliffe accompanying him. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were to assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one of its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Read more from James Last week, Mr Johnson said he was sorry if his remarks about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had caused anxiety to her family. However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry pushed him to ""apologise properly"" for his comments. ""If it is a matter of pride that the foreign secretary is refusing to admit that simply he has made a mistake, well then I feel bound to say to him that his pride matters not one ounce compared to Nazanin's freedom,"" she said in the Commons. ""After a week of obfuscation and bluster, will he finally take the opportunity today to state simply and unequivocally for the removal of any doubt - either here or in Tehran - that he simply got it wrong?"" Labour MP Yvette Cooper told Mr Johnson that ""words matter"", saying Mr Johnson cannot keep ""shrugging off"" comments that are ""inaccurate"" or ""damaging"". She called for him to resign. In reply, Mr Johnson said: ""It was my mistake. I should have been clearer."" He added: ""I apologise for the distress and anguish that has been caused to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family."" Medical concern for Briton held in Iran 'My wife's been punished without crime' Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office following remarks made by Mr Johnson's Cabinet counterpart Michael Gove. Mr Gove had told the BBC on Sunday he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said Mr Johnson ""did promise to consider"" whether Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be eligible for diplomatic protection, which he said ""gives a different push"" to what the government can do. ""I'm reassured that it is the position of the government,"" Mr Ratcliffe adding. A Downing Street spokesman said diplomatic protection was one available option, adding: ""I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."" The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""from the outset"" and was treating it as ""a priority"". She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016. The full details of the allegations against her have never been made fully public.

"Emma Dent Coad has been accused of writing a ""racist"" article in a 2010 blog piece A Conservative London Assembly member has accused a Labour MP of writing a ""racist"" article about him before she entered Parliament. Emma Dent Coad wrote a blog piece in 2010 in which she labelled Shaun Bailey a ""token ghetto boy"". Mr Bailey said the MP should apologise for the ""hate-filled, racist article"". A spokesman for Ms Dent Coat, who was elected to Kensington in June, said she had been quoting Mr Bailey's ""own comments about parts of the borough"". In the article Ms Dent Coad called Shaun Bailey the ""'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron"" In the piece Ms Dent Coad claimed Mr Bailey, who was a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, had ""stigmatised"" the area he was born in by referring to it as a ""ghetto"". ""Who can say where this man will ever fit in, however hard he tries? One day he is the 'token ghetto boy' standing behind D Cameron, the next 'looking interested' beside G Osborne. Ever felt used?,"" she wrote. After the blog post was highlighted, Mr Bailey said he had never been ""labelled a 'token ghetto boy'"" before and was ""shocked and saddened"" by the article. He said Ms Dent Coad's ""use of language should not be acceptable for an elected politician... and she should be ashamed"", he said. ""I am proud of where I am from and would certainly not use language like ghetto in a way to disparage the area I grew up in,"" the London Assembly member said.

"This video can not be played CCTV of acid attack in London club A man has been found guilty of carrying out an acid attack in a packed London club which left 22 people injured. Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, threw the corrosive substance at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April. The 25-year-old admitted throwing the liquid but had claimed he believed it was a date rape drug. He was convicted at Wood Green Crown Court. Andre Phoenix, who was accused of helping him,was found not guilty. How a night out ended in scars for life 'Arthur Collins victim- It felt like my skin was being eaten alive - BBC Newsbeat' Twenty-two people were injured, 16 of those suffering serious burns, when Collins sprayed acid over revellers inside the busy east London venue at about 01:00 BST. One man suffered third-degree chemical burns to the left side of the face and required a skin graft. Others had eye injuries. Arthur Collins had denied knowing the substance he threw was acid Phoebe Georgiou, who had been celebrating her 23rd birthday in the club that night, said she still suffers from night terrors and anxiety about being in crowded places having been hit by the substance. When she was taken to hospital she said she ""saw my reflection in the shower hold, which was so shocking because my whole chest looked like it had been ripped apart and I could see the inside of my chest and my arm"". ""I have a life sentence to deal with, with scars and mental injuries,"" she said. A solicitor for two of the other victims said Collins' ""despicable crime"" had ""changed the lives of so many people in the club that night"". Twenty-two people were injured when acid was thrown in the Mangle E8 nightclub CCTV shown in court showed clubbers clutching their faces and running off the dancefloor as they were hit with the liquid. Victims told the jury their skin began ""blistering straight away"" and described a burning smell. The liquid was later found to have a rating of pH1, equal to strong acids such as those used in battery acid. Collins told the court during the trial he had been at the club celebrating the news of Ms McCann's pregnancy, which the couple had revealed to her family the previous day. He was seen on CCTV getting into a confrontation with a group of men in the club before he sprayed liquid from a bottle over the crowd. Andre Phoenix (left) was acquitted earlier on Monday of helping Arthur Collins (right) carry out the attack Following the trial the Met said Collins had grabbed the bottle ""from the back pocket of an unidentified man"". Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, had claimed in court he had taken the bottle from that group and thought it was a date rape drug. However, the jury found him guilty of five counts of GBH with intent, and nine counts of ABH against 14 people. Collins will be sentenced on 19 December. The attack happened in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April He was not arrested for several days after the attack and was eventually detained when officers Tasered him after he tried to flee by jumping from an upstairs window of a house in Northamptonshire. Scotland Yard said he answered no comment to all questions put to him after he was detained. Det Ch Supt Simon Laurence said Collins had intended to ""inflict serious harm"" on a large number of people in a ""barbaric and cowardly act"". Collins sent a message to his sister reading: ""Tell mum to mind that little hand wash in my car acid"" The court heard Collins had sent a text to his sister a week before the attack, reading: ""Tell mum to mind that little hand wash in my car acid"". Collins claimed he was referring to hair-thickening shampoo which contained amino acid, which he needed for his hair after having two hair transplants. He had said he kept the shampoo in his car so his girlfriend did not find out about his hair loss. Lily Saw, London CPS reviewing lawyer, said the prosecution had ""proved this acid attack was no accident"". ""Acid can be as much of a weapon as a knife with equally damaging consequences,"" she said. Moment of acid attack in London club.

"This video can not be played Russia 'tries to sow discord in the West' Theresa May has launched her strongest attack on Russia yet, accusing Moscow of meddling in elections and carrying out cyber espionage. Addressing leading business figures at a banquet in London, the prime minister said Vladimir Putin's government was trying to ""undermine free societies"". Mrs May said it was ""planting fake stories"" to ""sow discord in the West"". While the UK did not want ""perpetual confrontation"" with Russia, it would protect its interests, she added. Her comments are in stark contrast to those of US President Donald Trump, who last week said he believed his Russian counterpart's denial of intervening in the 2016 presidential election. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is due to visit Russia next month. Boris Johnson set for Moscow visit Trump and Putin 'agree to defeat IS' Trump backs US agencies after Putin remark In a major foreign policy speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at London's Guildhall, which Mrs May described as a ""very simple message"" for President Putin, she said he must choose a very ""different path"" from the one that in recent years had seen Moscow annex Crimea, foment conflict in Ukraine and launch cyber attacks on governments and Parliaments across Europe. Russia could be a valuable partner of the West but only if it ""plays by the rules"", she argued. ""Russia has repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and disruption. ""This has included meddling in elections and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag among many others."" This video can not be played What Boris Johnson told MPs about Russian meddling in UK elections ""We know what you are doing and you will not succeed. Because you underestimate the resilience of our democracies, the enduring attraction of free and open societies and the commitment of Western nations to the alliances that bind us."" She said as the UK left the EU and charted a new course in the world, it remained absolutely committed to Nato and securing a Brexit deal which ""strengthens our liberal values"", adding that a strong economic partnership between the UK and EU would be a bulwark against Russian agitation in Europe. There are some countries in Europe that believe the West should engage more closely with Russia. They argue the European Union and the United States should better understand Russia's point of view, its belief that it is threatened from all sides. And that more should be done to accommodate this sense of vulnerability, by softening Nato's approach and reducing sanctions. Well, not Theresa May. In a speech in the US in February, the prime minister spoke of the need to ""engage but beware"" of Russia. She has now switched the order and the focus is very much on beware. She believes that President Putin should be called out for the threat she believes he poses both internationally and in the UK. The Electoral Commission is investigating claims that Russia used social media to meddle in the Brexit referendum. So Mrs May is willing to engage with Russia - she is sending the foreign secretary to Moscow next month. But she also wants Russia to know that Mr Johnson will come with a clear message that its destabilising activities will no longer be tolerated. Mr Johnson, who will be making his first trip to Russia since becoming foreign secretary in December, has said the UK's policy towards Moscow must be one of ""beware but engage"" following a decade of strained relations. He told MPs earlier this month that he had not seen any evidence of Russia trying to interfere in British elections or the 2016 Brexit vote, in which Moscow has insisted it remained neutral. ""We will take the necessary action to counter Russian activity,"" Mrs May added. ""But this is not where we want to be and not the relationship with Russia we want. ""We do not want to return to the Cold War or to be in a state of perpetual confrontation. ""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia has the reach and the responsibility to play a vital role in promoting international stability. ""Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path. But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend."" Responding to Mrs May's speech, former Labour cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw - who has been raising the issue of Russian interference in UK elections for nearly a year - tweeted: ""Asking why May suddenly acknowledging Russian interference now having stonewalled for months."" Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator involved in media policy, dismissed the PM's comments. ""The international system of rules must be saved not from Russia but from the advocates of intervention, coups and regime change. Russia will not accept those 'rules',"" he tweeted. ""The world order that suits May, with the seizure of Iraq, war in Libya, the rise of IS and terrorism in Europe, has had its day. You can't save it by attacking Russia."" In Mrs May's speech, she also said the authorities in Myanmar - formerly known as Burma - must take ""full responsibility"" for what ""looked like ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya people in Rakhine province.

"This video can not be played Bob Geldof hands back his Freedom of the City award The lord mayor of Dublin has criticised Bob Geldof over his decision to return his Freedom of the City award in protest against it also being conferred on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Councillor Micheal Mac Donncha said it was ""ironic"" that Geldof was keeping his honorary knighthood despite the UK's ""shameful record"" of imperialism. Ms Suu Kyi has been accused of ignoring the persecution of Rohingya Muslims. More than half a million have fled to Bangladesh following recent violence. ""Bob Geldof is entitled to return his award if he wishes to do so,"" the lord mayor was quoted as saying,externalby BreakingNews.ie. Bob Geldof returned his award on Monday morning Mr Mac Donncha is a member of Sinn Fein, a republican party that wants Britain to relinquish control of Northern Ireland ""It should be pointed out that as ardmhÃ©ara [lord mayor] I have condemned the persecution of the Rohingya people and their expulsion from their homes by the military in Myanmar and the failure of Aung San Suu Kyi to even acknowledge, let alone condemn, what the UN has described as ethnic cleansing."" Mr Mac Donncha said he had met Rohingya representatives in Ireland and had pledged to assist them. But he said there was no consensus on the issue of removing the Freedom of the City from the Myanmar leader among the groups on the city council. ""Regarding Mr Geldof himself, I find it ironic that he makes this gesture while proudly retaining his title as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, given the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe,"" he added. The lord mayor is a member of Sinn Fein, a republican party that wants Britain to relinquish control of Northern Ireland. He also criticised Mr Geldof for ""grossly insulting"" those who participated in the 1916 rising against Britain by comparing them to so-called Islamic State (IS) last year, ""causing offence to Dubliners and Irish people generally"". Mr Geldof, the musician and founder of Band Aid, argued earlier that Ms Suu Kyi's association with Dublin ""shames us all"". He said in a statement: ""We should have no truck with it, even by default. We honoured her, now she appals and shames us."" He handed back the award at City Hall in the Irish capital on Monday morning. What you need to know about the crisis What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism over her response Ms Suu Kyi has been condemned by international leaders and human rights groups over her reluctance to acknowledge the military violence, which the UN has called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". There have also been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Fellow Irish musicians U2 also criticised Ms Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, also known as Burma, urging her on Saturday to take a stronger stance against the reported violence by security forces. In a statement on the band's website, they said her failure to address the crisis was ""starting to look a lot like assent"". ""So we say to you now what we would have said to her: the violence and terror being visited on the Rohingya people are appalling atrocities and must stop."" This video can not be played Thousands of Rohingya refugees flee to Bangladesh Various British cities have also either stripped of her of honours or are in the process of doing do.

A second lynx, belonging to a zoo where one escaped and was later shot, has died following a ""handling error"". The news comes after Lilleth the lynx was""humanely destroyed"" on Fridayafterescaping from Borth Wild Animal Kingdom, Ceredigion. In a statement, the zoo confirmed an investigation was under way after the death of the second lynx, Nilly. The Lynx UK Trust called for the zoo to be closed, saying the deaths were ""unacceptable"". Ceredigion council said it was investigating this second death. Owner Tracy Tweedy said staff had given Nilly mouth to mouth after she became twisted in a catch-pole as staff tried to move her into a different enclosure ahead of a council inspection. She said she also rubbed her heart and added staff were horrified by the deaths. ""I don't regret buying this place because I know that despite all this we will make it what it should be,"" she said. ""It is a sanctuary for animals and they should be here and be safe and the fact that we have let down two of our precious lynx is just horrific. There is no excuse."" Flowers have been left outside the zoo in tribute to Lilleth Paul O'Donoghue, a scientific adviser at the Lynx UK Trust, which is trying to reintroduce them in the UK, said he had visited the zoo at the weekend. ""To have two die, it's unacceptable on every level. Serious questions need to be asked about the husbandry at this zoo,"" he said. The trust has started a petition calling for the zoo's closure which has been signed by more than 1,400 people. The zoo's owners said they had been ""working hard to make vast improvements"" over the summer and plans were in place to build a new lynx enclosure. Ceredigion council said the death of Nilly was brought to its attention ""the day after the animal had been inadvertently killed"". The council spokesman added: ""Due to an ongoing investigation, we are unable to provide further comment."" Borth Wild Animal Kingdom remains closed Meanwhile,the council has defended its decisionto have a marksman shoot Lilleth, prompting abacklashfrom the owners who had been trying to capture her with bait traps. The council said despite ""exhaustive efforts"" to recapture her, it was necessary to act because she had strayed into a populated area and ""the safety of the public was paramount"".

Among those to criticise the council's decision to shoot Lilleth was TV presenter Ben Fogle whotweeted,externalthat ""dogs cause more injury to sheep and people"".

"This video can not be played 'I was terrified' says Moore accuser A fifth woman has accused Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct as Republicans increase calls for him to ""step aside"". Beverly Young Nelson said she was 16 years old when Mr Moore allegedly tried to force himself on her after offering a ride home from her job as a waitress. ""I tried fight him off while yelling at him to stop,"" she said, adding that he locked his car to prevent her escape. Mr Moore, 70, denies the allegations, describing them as a ""witch hunt"". But Senator Cory Gardner, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, said on Monday he believes Mr Moore's accusers ""spoke with courage and truth"" and the former Alabama Supreme Court judge should be expelled if he is elected. ""If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,"" he said. Mrs Nelson's accusation comes after four other women detailed allegations of sexual misconduct by the conservative firebrand while they were teenagers in Alabama. The 56-year-old said she met Mr Moore during the late 1970s at the Olde Hickory House restaurant in Gadsen, Alabama, where she worked as a waitress while she was a teenager. She claimed Mr Moore, a 30-year-old deputy district attorney at the time, offered to sign her high school yearbook and wrote: ""To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas."" He signed it ""Love, Roy Moore, DA"", according to a copy of the yearbook page provided to reporters by her attorney, Gloria Allred. About a week or two later, he allegedly offered to drive her home and instead drove to the back of the restaurant car park. ""I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought he was going to rape me,"" she told reporters at a news conference on Monday. ""At some point he gave up and he then looked at me and he told me, 'You're just a child,' and he said, 'I am the district attorney of Etowah County. If you tell anyone about this, no one will believe you"", Mrs Nelson said, adding that her neck was bruised in the struggle. ""He finally allowed me to open the door and I either fell out or he pushed me out."" Why people are posting #MeAt14 Moore Campaign Chairman Bill Armistead denied the charges, calling Mr Moore ""an innocent man"". ""This is a witch hunt against a man who has had an impeccable career for over 30 years and has always been known as a man of high character,"" he said. Mr Moore's wife also vehemently denies the allegations, contending that her husband's accusers are being paid. Earlier on Monday US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said that he believed the women accusing Mr Moore of inappropriate behaviour. Mr McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials have considered whether another Republican could challenge Mr Moore in next month's election, through a so-called write-in challenge. He said Luther Strange, whom Mr Moore beat in the Republican primary earlier this year, was a possible option. Roy Moore said Mitch McConnell is the one who should step aside No matter what happens between now and the 12 December election, Mr Moore's name will remain on the voters' ballot, the Alabama secretary of state has confirmed. Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election. However, voters are free to ""write-in"" any name they choose and the party might encourage support for another Republican candidate. The state Republican party could also disqualify Mr Moore's nomination, meaning that if he won the most votes he would still not be declared the winner. Failing that, if Mr Moore won the election, the US Senate could vote to expel him by arguing that he lacked fitness to serve. Last week's Washington Post story quoted four women by name, including one who alleged Mr Moore initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 - beneath the legal age of consent in Alabama - while he was a prosecutor in his 30s. Mr Moore has said the Washington Post story is a fabricated smear by his political opponents, calling it ""a prime example of fake news"". Mr McConnell previously said Mr Moore should step aside only if the allegations were proven true. Conservatives back firebrand after abuse report Roy Moore on gays, Muslims and Darwin But on Monday he said flatly: ""I believe the women. Yes."" Mr Moore hit back in a tweet,external: ""The person who should step aside is @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell. He has failed conservatives and must be replaced. #DrainTheSwamp"". Mr Moore, an outspoken Christian conservative, had been a heavy favourite to win the 12 December election against Democrat Doug Jones. But an opinion poll after the allegations surfaced suggested the race was tightening. Alabama has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter of a century.

"Ann Maguire had taught Spanish at Corpus Christi Catholic College for more than 40 years A 15-year-old pupil who stabbed his teacher to death told other pupils of his plan to attack her, an inquest has heard. Ann Maguire, 61, was murdered by Will Cornick at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Leeds, in April 2014. She was stabbed seven times, including one blow which cut her jugular vein. Cornick boasted to other pupils about attacking the teacher, but they did not believe him and did not report it, Wakefield Coroners Court heard. More news from across Yorkshire The inquest heard Cornick had told at least 10 other pupils precisely what he was going to do, where he was going to do it and how he was going to do it. Det Supt Nick Wallen told the court: ""He was a young man who was prone to say things that weren't true."" Messages on Facebook about attacking Mrs Maguire were also not taken seriously by his friends at the time. Giving evidence, Det Supt Wallen said the attack had come ""completely out of the blue"" and Mrs Maguire ""stood absolutely no chance whatsoever"". She was ambushed by a ""strapping 15-year-old lad"", he said. Will Cornick is serving a life sentence for stabbing Ann Maguire The inquest heard Cornick had stormed out of a meeting involving Mrs Maguire called to discuss his work in Spanish. He later received a detention, but went off on a bowling trip instead. Det Supt Wallen said similar incidents happened in schools up and down the country. ""Is it a warning that this individual was about to kill his teacher? My answer to that would be 'no'. ""At no time did we have the impression of a disruptive, violent, angry individual who... was about to explode in a frenzy of violence such as his,"" he said. Ann Maguire's husband Don told the inquest the idea her killer had an ""irrational and historical hatred"" of his wife ""seems as strange now as it did then"". Mr Maguire told the jury: ""This was a good lad. He was bright. He was doing well at school. He was from a good home. He had a bit of a dark sense of humour. ""He did this terrible thing. There's no explanation and no logic to it."" ""I personally have always struggled a little bit with that narrative."" Mr Maguire also criticised what he called ""the poor quality"" of the review published byLeeds Safeguarding Children Board, saying there should have been a full Serious Case Review. An earlierHigh Court hearingruled that children should not be called to give evidence at the inquest. This followed an appeal by the family to have the evidence heard. The inquest continues.

The founder of groundbreaking dating site Gaydar has died in his native South Africa. Henry Badenhorst, 51,died after falling from a tower block on Saturday, news website Buzzfeed reported.,external He died a decade after his co-founder and former partner Gary Frisch fell to his death in London. The two created Gaydar, which became the world's largest dating site for gay and bisexual men, in 1999 when a friend said he was too busy to find a partner. Mr Badenhorst told the Guardian,externalin 2009: ""We put him on Excite [a search engine], which had a dating section where you could upload a picture. But it took two weeks for him to get a response, so we said that we were sure we could create something specifically for the gay market."" Africa Live: More on this and other stories At one time Gaydar boasted more than four million subscribers. The founders would go on to launch an award-winning radio station. As a result, Mr Badenhorst, who was born in Johannesburg, was named in the top five of the Independent's Pink List of influential gay men and women at least twice in the mid-2000s. He stepped back from the company in 2010, three years after Mr Frisch's death,external, which deeply affected him. But seven years later, Mr Badenhorst's legacy, both on and offline, within the LGBT community and outside it, can be felt as strongly as ever. ""He realised he changed the world in a way that surprised him,"" Rob Curtis, Gaydar's current managing director told the BBC. It has, Mr Curtis said, made it safer for all LGBT people to meet. ""It was difficult for gay men to find each other, and they were really the first gay social network - and the legacy of that has lived on,"" he added. Gaydar would go on to have more than five million users across the globe Patrick Strudwick, an LGBT editor for the news website Buzzfeed, said the entire idea was ""revolutionary"". ""The idea you can go to your computer and interact with them in real life without having to go to gay bars or cruising or gay cafes or whatever was a pivotal moment in the history of gay and bisexual men,"" he told the BBC. But it was more than just a way to meet men. ""In countries where being gay is a crime, people were now able to find new contacts and organise,"" Mr Curtis said. Even in counties where being gay or bisexual was accepted, the impact on mental wellbeing cannot be underestimated. ""Before the internet, gay people did think they were the only gay person in the world. That feeling of isolation cannot happen any more,"" Mr Strudwick said. ""What Henry and Gary did was enormous."" Not only that, but the sheer number of connections the site has made over the years - whether they be romantic, sexual or platonic - could not help but shape the community. When Gaydar first launched, the idea we would one day be ""swiping right"" as we searched for love could not have been imagined. Eighteen years later, millions of people are logging onto these apps each day - be they straight, gay or bisexual. And none of it, arguably, would have come to be had it not been for Gaydar. Millions of people now use dating apps every day ""Gaydar was revolutionary, really, in the ways that gay and bisexual men meet - and the ripples fanned out much further,"" said Mr Strudwick. ""The idea that you can both have your own profile page and also search for people by where they are - these thing really changed the wider culture. ""It was the forerunner to Facebook. The idea an individual would have their own page, it was entirely novel. The GPS element was later made an updated with things like Tinder and Grinder."" ""Before that, it was the personal ads,"" said Mr Curtis. ""Now we have GPS-based locations."" The irony, perhaps, was that Mr Badenhorst was not a user of his own product. Instead, the South African admitted to Mr Strudwick, he chose to meet people ""the old-fashioned way"". ""I go to bars,"" he said in the 2009 interview, one of the few he ever gave. This video can not be played Inside Africa's only gay radio station Mr Badenhorst was a private man, but one who was much loved and admired. Mr Strudwick and the tech millionaire became friends after the interview. He last spoke to him a few months before his death. The product, Mr Strudwick concedes, has its controversies. Making the community too selective, for one. Others have accused sites like Gaydar and Grindr of leading to the closures of gay bars. But Mr Badenhorst also used it to connect people with health workers, says Mr Strudwick. ""Henry was an incredible, clever, gentle and caring person,"" he said. ""He cared about people, he cared about his community, ""His product was controversial, but he was kind-hearted, gentle and wanted to prevent gay men suffering."" The exact details surrounding Mr Badenhorst's death remain unclear. Why are London's gay bars disappearing? Gaydar radio closes after 11 years Inside Africa's only gay radio station.

"This video can not be played The CBI chief says business wants the UK and Europe to speed up Brexit negotiations European and UK business leaders have told Prime Minister Theresa May of their Brexit concerns. At a meeting in Downing Street on Monday, representatives from groups including the CBI and BusinessEurope pressed for a transitional deal that preserves the status quo after Brexit. The CBI chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, said all those at the meeting reiterated the damage ""no deal"" would do to trade. A German lobby group also warned that no deal would cost their economy dear. The head of the German chambers of commerce, Martin Wansleben, told a newspaper the car industry alone would face annual tariffs of more than â¬2bn if trade between the UK and the EU falls under World Trade Organisation rules. Brexit: All you need to know How are the talks really progressing? Barnier: UK has 'two weeks' to clarify issues Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, said: ""Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress only one month before the decisive December European Council. ""Business aims to avoid a cliff edge and therefore asks for a 'status quo-like' transitional arrangement with the UK staying in the customs union and the single market, as this will best provide citizens and businesses with greater certainty."" The business groups met Mrs May at No 10, as well as Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay. The CBI and the Institute of Directors were represented, along with business organisations from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium. There are concerns thatfuture trade talks could collapseahead of December's EU summit. EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that the talks will only go ahead if the UK first clarifies its financial obligations to the EU. Mr Davis has said the UK was ""ready and willing"" to engage with Brussels ""as often and as quickly as needed"". Earlier, Ms Fairbairn, CBI director-general, told the BBC a CBI survey found that 10% of companies had already activated their contingency plans. The pace of planning by firms was picking up, she added, with about 60% of companies saying they would implement contingency plans by the end of next March. Bernard Spitz, a director of Medef, France's biggest business lobby group, said agreement on a transition deal was important for both UK companies as well as those ""across the European Union"". ""We know that for us, especially for the French, the relationship with the UK is absolutely key, but if business continuity is important, what is even more important is the integrity of the European market,"" he said. Michel Barnier has warned of the possible collapse of Brexit talks Property developer Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave Means Leave, said if a trade deal appeared unlikely, ""then actually we would be better to give certainty to everybody that actually we're going to do a different type of deal which is to go to WTO [World Trade Organization rules]"". BBC business editor Simon Jack says some UK business leaders in favour of Brexit are concerned that a transition period maintaining the current arrangements will delay and frustrate Britain's attempts to strike new independent deals.

"Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct Sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant's provisional cause of death was hanging, an inquest has heard. The 49-year-old married father-of-two, who had been Alyn and Deeside AM since 2003,was found deadat his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on Tuesday. He was found four days after beingsacked from his job as cabinet secretaryfor communities and children. At the opening of his inquest, coroner John Gittins said it was ""an apparent act of self harm"". Mr Gittins added he would carefully examine ""the steps taken by the assembly to have regard to Mr Sargeant's mental welfare prior to his death"". The inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, was told Mr Sargeant was found on the floor of the utility room by his wife Bernadette. Family members attempted to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived and continued those efforts, but the former minister was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later. Mr Sargeant was facing a partyinvestigation into claims about inappropriate personal conductand was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death. He was removed from his role amid allegations he had ""touched or groped"" a number of women. 'Full support' for first minister First minister orders Sargeant inquiry Sacked Labour minister found dead Carl Sargeant: Profile of AM's career Mr Gittins, coroner for North Wales East and Central, said the inquest would not consider the veracity of the allegations made against Mr Sargeant, nor would he be ""looking to Cardiff and the Welsh Assembly or the Labour Party"" about who was right or wrong and who could be trusted. He said he would be seeking statements from First Minister Carwyn Jones and possibly others at the Welsh Assembly in the coming weeks, but was not in a position to say whether Mr Jones would be called to give evidence. No date has been fixed for the full hearing as the coroner said a separate independent inquiry could have an impact on his responsibility to compile a prevention of future deaths report. He ended by assuring Mr Sargeant's family, friends and colleagues that ""there will be a full and fair examination of the matters which are relevant to my investigation and that I shall not allow the inquest to be a trial by press, politics or personality"". North Wales Police was called to Mr Sargeant's home after he was found on the floor by his wife Mr Sargeant's family called him ""the glue that bound us together"" and said they were ""devastated beyond words"". Mr Jones said he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" and paid tribute to ""a friend as well as a colleague"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Sargeant's death was ""deeply shocking news"" while Prime Minister Theresa May said her ""heart goes out to Carl Sargeant's friends and family"". Mr Jones sacked Mr Sargeant from his frontbench after the first minister learned of a number of alleged incidents involving women. There will be anindependent inquiry into how Mr Joneshandled the case. Meanwhile,fresh claimsabout bullying in the Welsh Government have been made by a former adviser to Mr Jones.

"Imran Saeed Sheikh offered to fake the college attendance of bogus students The chairwoman of Parliament's spending watchdog wants a police probe after the BBC's Panorama uncovered evidence of fraud in the student loan system. One education agent was secretly filmed offering to get bogus students admitted into a government-approved private college for a Â£200 fee. This was to allow the bogus students to fraudulently claim student loans. Then for Â£1,500 a year, the agent offered to fake attendance records and to provide all their coursework. Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""There is criminal fraud going on from what you've shown me. It needs to be referred to the police."" BBC Panorama spent 10 months investigating dishonest education agents and bogus students who are committing frauds that target private colleges - also known as alternative providers - which offer courses approved for student loans. Agents were secretly filmed supplying fake documents, including a qualification certificate to a BBC undercover researcher posing as a bogus student, who wanted to cheat their way on to courses and apply for student loans. The National Union of Students has also called for an inquiry into the abuses exposed by Panorama. ""These are horrible people who are exploiting our education system,"" said NUS President Shakira Martin. ""The student finance system is ultimately broken."" NUS president Shakira Martin said the student finance system was ""broken"" About Â£400m-a-year is received by 112 private colleges through the student loan system. The government is keen to expand the sector as part of reforms designed to make degree and diploma courses more accessible to people who might otherwise find it difficult to enter higher education. Students on government-approved courses at private colleges in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are entitled to - depending on circumstances - Â£11,000 in maintenance loans to cover living expenses and up to Â£6,000 in tuition fee loans, paid direct to colleges. This year total student loan debt, from universities and private colleges, topped Â£100bn. Acting on a tip-off, Panorama approached Imran Saeed Sheikh, an agent and fraudster who owns a chain of barber shops in east London. Mr Sheikh said that for a Â£200 fee he could get Panorama's undercover students on to a two-year Higher National Diploma (HND) business course, at Grafton College in central London, so they could get student loans. He added that once a bogus student was admitted he could provide everything they would need to stay on their course, in return for an annual cut of their loan money. ""When your first instalment comes we take Â£1,500,"" he said. ""With this we take care of your attendance for the whole year, get your eight assignments done."" He added: ""We have a relationship with the college. The money you give us with that, we'll make the system work inside."" Imran Sheikh (right) and his assistant have not responded to the BBC's allegations One of the BBC's undercover students said they had left school at 16 and so lacked the necessary qualifications to meet entry criteria for the course. For Â£600, Imran and his assistant Raza Abbas Sheikh supplied them with a backdated certificate for a course they had not studied, which was equivalent to A-Levels. The certificate apparently came from an awarding body based in the same building as Grafton College. Imran Sheikh claimed he got it from Asif Khawaja, Grafton's head of operations. Like his other claim about inside help, the BBC does not know if he is telling the truth. On the strength of the certificate, Panorama's undercover student was accepted on to the course, for which Grafton College charges Â£6,000 a year. Within days they received the first Â£3,600 instalment of their student loan money. Imran Sheikh, who was at the college on the undercover student's induction day, told them they would barely need to attend their course. ""Come at around 10.00, take two hours off from your job, mark your attendance, tick mark your name, leave after two hours,"" he said. ""You just sit like a dummy and keep nodding along. When the college gives you assignments, you don't have to do them. These go directly to our agent in Pakistan. He gets people to do them."" Neither Imran Sheikh nor his assistant responded when approached by the BBC for comment. Both the awarding body and Grafton College said they are unaware of any fraudulent activities. Asif Khawaja said he absolutely denies any involvement. The course that the BBC's undercover student was enrolled on at Grafton College is set and validated by Pearson, one of the world's biggest education companies. In a statement, Pearson said it takes all allegations of malpractice extremely seriously. It said that it had placed an immediate block on Grafton, which means that the college will not be able to register or certificate students for Pearson qualifications while an investigation is carried out. The Open University, which has recently begun offering degree courses in partnership with Grafton, said it was seeking ""urgent clarification"" from the college. Any partnership found not to be meeting its expectations on standards and behaviour would be ended with immediate effect it added. What is a degree from a UK university worth? If you're a student borrowing tuition fees and living costs, it's meant to be the proof of your hard work to take to employers. If it's possible to buy a dodgy qualification to get on to a course, or pay someone else to do the work, the minimum value of a British degree is at risk. BBC Panorama's investigation comes at a time of massive change. The government is looking at whether new businesses could offer degrees from day one on a probationary basis, which could attract interest from companies operating elsewhere in the world. The prize, insist ministers,  is the chance of fresh thinking, more short degree courses, better value for money.  The jeopardy is the risk of abuse of a taxpayer backed student finance system. Panorama also filmed undercover inside one of the UK's largest alternative providers, the Greenwich School of Management - also known as GSM London - which has more than 4,000 students at its Greenwich campus. Most GSM students are recruited by the college itself, the rest come from freelance recruiters. This video can not be played Panorama exposes education agent helping bogus students to cheat. An undercover student secretly filmed a series of meetings with one freelance, Charles Logan, who has a contract with GSM to recruit students. The BBC understands Mr Logan receives approximately Â£600 for every student he helps to enrol, which is 10% of the tuition fees paid to GSM. After the undercover student was admitted on to a three-year honours course in business management, Mr Logan put him in touch with someone who he said could do his degree-level assignments for him. The student subsequently bought two assignments for Â£526 and a third from another online company. He submitted them as his own work. The deception was not detected and the purchased assignments were awarded good marks by GSM. Those results were ratified by Plymouth University which validates and awards degrees studied at GSM. The university told Panorama that GSM is responsible for student admissions and attendance. It says it has ""long-standing and robust academic regulations and processes to prevent academic dishonesty and ensure the quality of its degrees"". The Greenwich School of Management GSM told Panorama that it has suspended its contract with Mr Logan and brought in external experts to investigate. It said if the allegations against Mr Logan are true, his actions are ""totally unacceptable"". Charles Logan's lawyer told the BBC that he ""emphatically denies acting fraudulently, either for profit or to assist students in fraudulently claiming student finance."" The Department for Education said it takes allegations of fraud and malpractice extremely seriously and was grateful to Panorama for bringing these cases to its attention. ""The use of fake qualifications or plagiarised assignments is absolutely unacceptable. ""It not only threatens to undermine the reputation of our world-class higher education sector, but also devalues the hard work of those who don't cheat,"" it added. Ms Hillier said the private college sector had expanded rapidly and the government had not created a regulatory system that was fit for purpose. ""It's got to crack down on what's happened now, really investigate it,"" she said. ""But it also has got to have a system that stops these chancers piling in and making money from the taxpayer."" The Quality Assurance Agency said the Higher Education and Research Act, passed earlier this year, would create a powerful new regulator for higher education in England called the Office for Students. It said: ""QAA advised the Government on aspects of this Act and supported the inclusion of important new powers of search and entry for the Office for Students. The absence of these powers has made tackling fraud a challenge for all parties.""

"Rescue teams in Iran are looking for people in collapsed buildings A huge rescue effort is under way after a powerful earthquake struck Iran's mountainous border with Iraq, killing more than 400 people and injuring more than 7,000. Teams are looking for survivors trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings. The quake is the deadliest in the world this year. Most people who died were in western Iran in Sarpol-e-Zahab, a town 15km (10 miles) from the border, and other parts of Kermanshah province. The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded people, state TV reported. A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said. Many buildings in the town appear to have collapsed,external, amateur video posted to Twitter by a radio station showed. Running water and electricity cut out in some cities, and after buildings collapsed people were forced to spend hours outdoors in parks or streets in cold weather. Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks and are vulnerable in quakes as large as Sunday's. Latest images of aftermath 'My aunt, cousin and my cousin's children died' ""We need shelter,"" a man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV. ""Where is the aid? Where is the help?"" One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake, and there were reports that thousands of people were facing a second night in the cold as dusk fell. The UN said it was ""ready to assist if required"",externalin a statement from a spokesman for the secretary-general. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iranian officials said 413 people had died in the country. Some soldiers and border guards were among the dead, the Iranian army's commander-in-chief told the state news channel IRINN. After buildings collapsed in the earthquake, many victims spent the night outdoors In Iraq nine people died, a Red Crescent spokesman told the BBC. A UN office in the country said more than 500 people were injured there, and the earthquake was felt in Irbil, Sulaimaniya, Kirkuk and Basra as well as the capital, Baghdad. Landslides have made it harder for rescuers to reach those affected in rural areas, and there are fears a dam could burst after it was damaged by the earthquake. People living nearby have reportedly been asked to leave. This video can not be played The moment Iran-Iraq quake hit the Darbandikhan Dam control room The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km (19 miles) south of Darbandikhan,external, near the north-eastern border with Iran, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. More than 1.8 million people live within 100km of the epicentre, the UN estimates. Is it possible to predict a quake? The world's deadliest earthquakes The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people. Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 strong quakes last year and 19 the year before,external. Analysis by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past. In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year. In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression. Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture. Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals.

"Joshua Sutcliffe said he tried to balance his beliefs with the need to treat the pupil sensitively A teacher is facing disciplinary action at his school after he referred to a transgender pupil as a girl, although the student identifies as a boy. Joshua Sutcliffe, a Christian pastor from Oxford, admitted he said ""Well done girls"" when addressing a group including the student. He described it as a ""slip of the tongue"", but said he believed biological sex was defined at birth The school said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment. Mr Sutcliffe, who teaches children aged between 11 and 18, said the incident took place on 2 November. He said a week-long investigation found he had ""misgendered"" the pupil. Church of England: Let girls and boys wear tiaras The maths teacher, who is also a pastor at the Christ Revelation church in Oxford, said he tried to balance his beliefs with the need to treat the pupil sensitively. He claimed he did this by avoiding the use of gender-specific pronouns and by referring to the pupil by name. ""While the suggestion that gender is fluid conflicts sharply with my Christian beliefs... I have never looked to impose my convictions on others"", he said He said he had apologised to the student, but said he did not consider it ""unreasonable"" to call someone a girl ""if they were born a girl"". More than 2,000 young people, aged between three and 18, were referred to a specialist NHS clinic in 2016-17, seeking help with their gender identity. The numbers have been growing every year since the start of the decade. Of 2,016 young people referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) in the most recent year, 1,400 were assigned female at birth. Polly Carmichael, a consultant clinical psychologist and director of GIDS, said there was no single explanation for the increase but said there had been ""significant progress towards the acceptance and recognition of transgender and gender diverse people in our society"". Dr Carmichael said the majority of the service's users did not take up physical treatment. There were two children referred aged three in 2016-17. The service rejected 30 referrals of people who were already 18 years old. The Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting Mr Sutcliffe, said he faced an internal disciplinary hearing on Wednesday. The state academy school where he is employed said the matter was confidential. However, it said it took equality and discrimination seriously and had a range of governor-approved policies in place to ensure it acted lawfully. LGBT charity Stonewall said ""pupils must be protected"" even if teachers may hold ""different opinions"" about sexuality and gender identity. It did not want to comment on the case involving Mr Sutcliffe, but it said ""children should always feel included and accepted for who they are"".

"This video can not be played The CBI chief says business wants the UK and Europe to speed up Brexit negotiations European and UK business leaders have told Prime Minister Theresa May of their Brexit concerns. At a meeting in Downing Street on Monday, representatives from groups including the CBI and BusinessEurope pressed for a transitional deal that preserves the status quo after Brexit. The CBI chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, said all those at the meeting reiterated the damage ""no deal"" would do to trade. A German lobby group also warned that no deal would cost their economy dear. The head of the German chambers of commerce, Martin Wansleben, told a newspaper the car industry alone would face annual tariffs of more than â¬2bn if trade between the UK and the EU falls under World Trade Organisation rules. Brexit: All you need to know How are the talks really progressing? Barnier: UK has 'two weeks' to clarify issues Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, said: ""Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress only one month before the decisive December European Council. ""Business aims to avoid a cliff edge and therefore asks for a 'status quo-like' transitional arrangement with the UK staying in the customs union and the single market, as this will best provide citizens and businesses with greater certainty."" The business groups met Mrs May at No 10, as well as Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay. The CBI and the Institute of Directors were represented, along with business organisations from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium. There are concerns thatfuture trade talks could collapseahead of December's EU summit. EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that the talks will only go ahead if the UK first clarifies its financial obligations to the EU. Mr Davis has said the UK was ""ready and willing"" to engage with Brussels ""as often and as quickly as needed"". Earlier, Ms Fairbairn, CBI director-general, told the BBC a CBI survey found that 10% of companies had already activated their contingency plans. The pace of planning by firms was picking up, she added, with about 60% of companies saying they would implement contingency plans by the end of next March. Bernard Spitz, a director of Medef, France's biggest business lobby group, said agreement on a transition deal was important for both UK companies as well as those ""across the European Union"". ""We know that for us, especially for the French, the relationship with the UK is absolutely key, but if business continuity is important, what is even more important is the integrity of the European market,"" he said. Michel Barnier has warned of the possible collapse of Brexit talks Property developer Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave Means Leave, said if a trade deal appeared unlikely, ""then actually we would be better to give certainty to everybody that actually we're going to do a different type of deal which is to go to WTO [World Trade Organization rules]"". BBC business editor Simon Jack says some UK business leaders in favour of Brexit are concerned that a transition period maintaining the current arrangements will delay and frustrate Britain's attempts to strike new independent deals.

"I know this doesn't sound that exciting unless you are as much of a nerd as I am. However, the Brexit secretary's announcement in the House of Commons in the last few minutes really matters. It matters because the Brexit deal that shapes the future of the country will now be the subject of a specific new Act of Parliament that MPs and Lords will have to approve in early 2019, before we leave the EU. It matters because Parliament will now be given specific votes, therefore, on the deal itself once the broad outlines have been agreed (Remember, the thrust of it is expected in about a year's time, although that feels hard to believe sometimes.) It matters because the decision is a big concession to the Tory rebels and Labour MPs who were threatening to vote against the government, in part, because of ministers' refusal to promise a new set of laws. And it matters because it demonstrates that the government was unlikely to be able to persuade enough of their own side to vote with them to keep the show on the road this week. A confident government wouldn't have conceded like this the day before the Brexit debate was due to come back to the Commons in earnest. This climbdown does not remotely mean that other grievances over the existing Brexit legislation will disappear. It doesn't mean that  the next few weeks will suddenly become plain sailing. And if there isn't a withdrawal deal with the rest of the EU, well, then there can't be a bill that covers the withdrawal bill. It's only in the coming days that the government will know if they have done enough to get the existing plans through. And the move also of course adds to a massive load of complicated Parliamentary business that has to be cleared before we actually leave. P.S.The signs in the last few hours about David Davis' attempt at a concession have not been good. Sources have told the BBC about a ""stormy"" meeting between the new Chief Whip Julian Smith and a group of Tory rebels this afternoon. In politics that's code for pretty grim and probably with shouting. MPs have said the offer was ""insulting"", ""disappointing"" and warned the ""government should be worried"" . But remember, this is going to be a long process of Parliamentary moves. The concession may have not moved much sentiment tonight, but both sides of the Tory Party know they are in this for the long haul, and the most troublesome votes are further down the track.

"Ann Maguire had taught Spanish at Corpus Christi Catholic College for more than 40 years A 15-year-old pupil who stabbed his teacher to death told other pupils of his plan to attack her, an inquest has heard. Ann Maguire, 61, was murdered by Will Cornick at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Leeds, in April 2014. She was stabbed seven times, including one blow which cut her jugular vein. Cornick boasted to other pupils about attacking the teacher, but they did not believe him and did not report it, Wakefield Coroners Court heard. More news from across Yorkshire The inquest heard Cornick had told at least 10 other pupils precisely what he was going to do, where he was going to do it and how he was going to do it. Det Supt Nick Wallen told the court: ""He was a young man who was prone to say things that weren't true."" Messages on Facebook about attacking Mrs Maguire were also not taken seriously by his friends at the time. Giving evidence, Det Supt Wallen said the attack had come ""completely out of the blue"" and Mrs Maguire ""stood absolutely no chance whatsoever"". She was ambushed by a ""strapping 15-year-old lad"", he said. Will Cornick is serving a life sentence for stabbing Ann Maguire The inquest heard Cornick had stormed out of a meeting involving Mrs Maguire called to discuss his work in Spanish. He later received a detention, but went off on a bowling trip instead. Det Supt Wallen said similar incidents happened in schools up and down the country. ""Is it a warning that this individual was about to kill his teacher? My answer to that would be 'no'. ""At no time did we have the impression of a disruptive, violent, angry individual who... was about to explode in a frenzy of violence such as his,"" he said. Ann Maguire's husband Don told the inquest the idea her killer had an ""irrational and historical hatred"" of his wife ""seems as strange now as it did then"". Mr Maguire told the jury: ""This was a good lad. He was bright. He was doing well at school. He was from a good home. He had a bit of a dark sense of humour. ""He did this terrible thing. There's no explanation and no logic to it."" ""I personally have always struggled a little bit with that narrative."" Mr Maguire also criticised what he called ""the poor quality"" of the review published byLeeds Safeguarding Children Board, saying there should have been a full Serious Case Review. An earlierHigh Court hearingruled that children should not be called to give evidence at the inquest. This followed an appeal by the family to have the evidence heard. The inquest continues.

"The BBC has discovered a security flaw in the office collaboration tool Huddle that led to private documents being exposed to unauthorised parties. A BBC journalist was inadvertently signed in to a KPMG account, with full access to private financial documents. Huddle is an online tool that lets work colleagues share content and describes itself as ""the global leader in secure content collaboration"". The company said it had fixed the flaw. Its software is used by the Home Office, Cabinet Office, Revenue & Customs, and several branches of the NHS to share documents, diaries and messages. ""If somebody is putting themselves out there as a world-class service to look after information for you, it just shouldn't happen,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""Huddles contain some very sensitive information."" The BBC was presented with KPMG's documents In a statement, Huddle said the bug had affected ""six individual user sessions between March and November this year"". ""With 4.96 million log-ins to Huddle occurring over the same time period, the instances of this bug occurring were extremely rare,"" it said. As well as a BBC employee being redirected to the KPMG account, Huddle said a third party had accessed one of the BBC's Huddle accounts. KPMG has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. On Wednesday, a BBC correspondent logged in to Huddle to access a shared diary that his team kept on the platform. He was instead logged in to a KPMG account, with a directory of private documents and invoices, and an address book. The BBC contacted Huddle to report the security issue. The company later disclosed that a third party had accessed the Huddle of BBC Children's programme Hetty Feather, but it said no documents had been opened. During the Huddle sign-in process, the customer's device requests an authorisation code. According to Huddle, if two people arrived on the same login server within 20 milliseconds of one another, they would both be issued the same authorisation code. This authorisation code is carried over to the next step, in which a security token is issued, letting the customer access their Huddle. Since both User A and User B present the same authorisation code, whoever is fastest to request the security token is logged in as User A. Huddle has now changed its system so that every time it is invoked, it generates a new authorisation code. This ensures no two people are ever simultaneously issued the same code. ""We wish to clarify to Huddle users that this bug has been fixed, and that we continue to work to ensure such a scenario is not repeated,"" the company told the BBC. ""We are continuing to work with the owners of the accounts that we believe may have been compromised, and apologise to them unreservedly.""

"This video can not be played Robbery in Regent Street Apple store A security guard at a central London Apple store was threatened with a hammer as he tried to stop a gang of raiders on mopeds. Ten suspects on five mopeds smashed their way into the Regent Street shop at 00:45 GMT and escaped with iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. Two iPhone Xs were later recovered near Kings Cross. The flagship store was fully operational with no visible damage later on Monday morning. Apple declined to comment. Miah Mohammad Sheful, captured video of the raid when he was waiting for a bus nearby. The Apple store on Regent Street was fully operational later on Monday morning The 28-year-old said it took the suspects several attempts to break in the door of the tech giant's store. Passing cars started beeping their horns to prevent the burglary as they realised what was unfolding, he said. The moped gang got away within seconds. The suspects, described as wearing dark clothing, are said to have made off northbound along Regent Street. The man who threatened the guard was described as black. The raid comes one month after a gang riding mopeds attacked a jeweller's in the same street. Three suspects are believed to have used a hammer, axe and bats to break into Mappin & Webb on 9 October.

"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Offering a British-Iranian mother in prison in Iran diplomatic protection is ""one of the options"" being considered in the case, Downing Street has said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and accused of trying to overthrow the regime there - a charge she denies. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has criticised the UK's response and said it could offer diplomatic protection. Number 10 said it was working to find the ""most beneficial"" course of action. In a phone call, Mr Ratcliffe asked Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to consider diplomatic protection for his wife, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national. Taking such a measure would effectively escalate the case from an individual consular matter to a formal legal dispute between Britain and Iran, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. Asked about the possibility, Downing Street said it was an option, adding: ""I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."" The government ""will look"" at Mr Ratcliffe's comments ""very closely"" and decide the ""best course of action to secure her release"", the Number 10 spokesman added. Medical concern for Briton held in Iran Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' 'My wife's been punished without crime' Mr Johnson and fellow cabinet minister Michael Gove have been accused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. The foreign secretary told MPs last week that he believed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching in Iran before she was arrested, while Mr Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran. Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Asked about the government's official position, Downing Street said: ""The government's position on this is clear. She was there on holiday. It wasn't for any other purpose. ""The foreign secretary reiterated that in his conversation with the Iranian foreign minister last week."" The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""from the outset"" and was treating it as ""a priority"". She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Read more from James Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office followingremarks made by Mr Gove. He said Mr Johnson ""did promise to consider whether she'll be eligible for diplomatic protection"" which ""gives a different push"" to what the government can do for his wife. ""I'm reassured that it is the position of the government,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. Asked about his conversation with Mr Ratcliffe, Mr Johnson told the BBC Foreign Office officials were working ""very, very hard"" on the case. ""On Iran - and on consular cases generally - they are all very sensitive and I think the key thing to understand is that we are working very, very hard and intensively and impartially on all those cases,"" he added. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016. The full details of the allegations against her have never been made fully public. But speaking in Westminster on 1 November, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict her own account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and Mr Johnson's remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears that her five-year sentence could be extended. Labour have since called for the foreign secretary's resignation, but Mr Ratcliffe has said he believes it is not in his wife's interests for anyone to resign. The UK government's policy fordual British nationals arrested abroad,external, is that UK authorities ""won't get involved if someone's arrested in a country for which they hold a valid passport, unless there's a special humanitarian reason to do so"". Iran, however, does not recognise dual nationality, and so does not allow consular assistance from the foreign office or the British embassy. Should Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe be granted diplomatic protection, the UK government could make representations at a political and diplomatic level instead. Mr Ratcliffe says a call for his wife's release from the United Nations last month had not been endorsed by government. In October, JosÃ© Antonio Guevara BermÃºdez, chair-rapporteur of the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Ms Asma Jahangir, special rapporteur on human rights for Iran, called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's immediate release. She had been ""deprived of her liberty"",they said,external. ""The UK didn't endorse that call,"" Mr Ratcliffe said.  ""It hasn't ever acknowledged a violation of her rights, which I find staggering."" But he still hopes his family will be reunited by the end of the year. ""I think the best chance Nazanin has of coming home this side of Christmas is all of the weight of the Foreign Office and the foreign secretary being focused on doing that,"" he said.

"Consumption of coal has grown once again in China after three years of decline Global emissions of CO2 in 2017 are projected to rise for the first time in four years, dashing hopes that a peak might soon be reached. The main cause of the expected growth has been greater use of coal in China as its economy expanded. Researchers are uncertain if the rise in emissions is a one-off or the start of a new period of CO2 build-up. Scientists say that a global peak in CO2 before 2020 is needed to limit dangerous global warming this century. Trump emissions threat to US car industry Record surge in atmospheric CO2 in 2016 A brief history of the Earth's CO2 Guide: What is climate change? TheGlobal Carbon Project,externalhas been analysing and reporting on the scale of emissions of CO2 since 2006. Carbon output has grown by about 3% per year in that period, but growth essentially declined or remained flat between 2014 and 2016.Concern at first CO2 rise in four years The latest figures indicate that in 2017, emissions of CO2 from all human activities grew by about 2% globally. There is some uncertainty about the data but the researchers involved have concluded that emissions are on the rise again. ""Global CO2 emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period. This is very disappointing,"" said the lead author of the study, Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia. ""With global CO2 emissions from human activities estimated at 41 billion tonnes for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2 degrees C, let alone 1.5C."" The most important element in causing this rise has been China, which is responsible for around 28% of the global total. Emissions there went up 3.5% in 2017, mainly because of increased coal use, driven in the main by a growing economy. US coal production has increased slightly this year mainly due to export demand Another important factor in China has been lower water levels in rivers which have seen a drop in the amount of electricity made from hydro-power, with utilities turning to coal and gas to make up the shortfall. US emissions have continued to decline but the fall has been less than expected. Higher prices saw a drop in the use of natural gas for electricity - with renewables and hydro-power picking up the slack. Coal use has also grown slightly in the US this year, with consumption up about a half of one percent. India's emissions are projected to grow by about 2%, which is a considerable decrease from around 6% per year over the last decade. However, experts believe that this may be a temporary drop-off caused by a number of factors that have hampered the consumption of oil and cement. Europe also saw a smaller decline than expected, falling by 0.2% compared with 2.2% over the last 10 years. One common theme around the world is continued use of gas and oil, says Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. ""There have been lots of ups and downs in the use of coal but in the background there has been no weakening in the use of oil and gas. And that is quite worrisome."" The report has been launched in Bonn where UN negotiators are trying to move forward with the rules for the Paris climate agreement. Researchers involved with the study say they are not moving fast enough. ""Lots of diplomats are working out the rules but that is all a little bit meaningless unless they go back home to their countries and ratchet up climate action and that is where the gap is,"" said Dr Glen Peters, from theCentre for International Climate Research,externalin Norway. ""These countries have to be pushing on with the policies, but everything keeps getting pushed back."" Demonstrators at UN talks in Bonn demand faster cuts in carbon The report is sure to increase tensions in Bonn between developed and developing nations. There is increasing resentment about the fact that all the focus is on future commitments made under the Paris climate agreement but very little on the years before it becomes active. Poorer countries want the richer ones to increase their carbon-cutting actions over the next three years. ""The climate will not let us wait until 2020 when the Paris agreement comes into force,"" said Nicaragua's chief negotiator, Paul Oquist. ""Climate change is happening now and it's vital that immediate actions to cut emissions become a feature of this summit.""

"This video can not be played Bob Geldof hands back his Freedom of the City award The lord mayor of Dublin has criticised Bob Geldof over his decision to return his Freedom of the City award in protest against it also being conferred on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Councillor Micheal Mac Donncha said it was ""ironic"" that Geldof was keeping his honorary knighthood despite the UK's ""shameful record"" of imperialism. Ms Suu Kyi has been accused of ignoring the persecution of Rohingya Muslims. More than half a million have fled to Bangladesh following recent violence. ""Bob Geldof is entitled to return his award if he wishes to do so,"" the lord mayor was quoted as saying,externalby BreakingNews.ie. Bob Geldof returned his award on Monday morning Mr Mac Donncha is a member of Sinn Fein, a republican party that wants Britain to relinquish control of Northern Ireland ""It should be pointed out that as ardmhÃ©ara [lord mayor] I have condemned the persecution of the Rohingya people and their expulsion from their homes by the military in Myanmar and the failure of Aung San Suu Kyi to even acknowledge, let alone condemn, what the UN has described as ethnic cleansing."" Mr Mac Donncha said he had met Rohingya representatives in Ireland and had pledged to assist them. But he said there was no consensus on the issue of removing the Freedom of the City from the Myanmar leader among the groups on the city council. ""Regarding Mr Geldof himself, I find it ironic that he makes this gesture while proudly retaining his title as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, given the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe,"" he added. The lord mayor is a member of Sinn Fein, a republican party that wants Britain to relinquish control of Northern Ireland. He also criticised Mr Geldof for ""grossly insulting"" those who participated in the 1916 rising against Britain by comparing them to so-called Islamic State (IS) last year, ""causing offence to Dubliners and Irish people generally"". Mr Geldof, the musician and founder of Band Aid, argued earlier that Ms Suu Kyi's association with Dublin ""shames us all"". He said in a statement: ""We should have no truck with it, even by default. We honoured her, now she appals and shames us."" He handed back the award at City Hall in the Irish capital on Monday morning. What you need to know about the crisis What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism over her response Ms Suu Kyi has been condemned by international leaders and human rights groups over her reluctance to acknowledge the military violence, which the UN has called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". There have also been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Fellow Irish musicians U2 also criticised Ms Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, also known as Burma, urging her on Saturday to take a stronger stance against the reported violence by security forces. In a statement on the band's website, they said her failure to address the crisis was ""starting to look a lot like assent"". ""So we say to you now what we would have said to her: the violence and terror being visited on the Rohingya people are appalling atrocities and must stop."" This video can not be played Thousands of Rohingya refugees flee to Bangladesh Various British cities have also either stripped of her of honours or are in the process of doing do.

"A lack of devolution at Stormont means the budget will be passed into law using Westminister legislation Northern Ireland's budget for 2017/18 has been published and shows an increase in health spending of 5.4%. The bill has gone through the House of Commons, backed by all parties without a vote. It will go to the House of Lords on Tuesday. NI Secretary James Brokenshire said that public services would begin to run out of money if a budget was not in place by the end of November. Stormont deadlock: what you need to know Sticking points in power-sharing talks He said he regretted having to bring a budget to Westminster but was hopeful an executive could be formed. Northern Ireland has been without a Stormont executive for 10 months. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the passing of budget legislation ""should not be a barrier to to negotiations to continue, but the ongoing lack of agreement has had tangible consequences for people and public services in Northern Ireland"". Faced by DUP calls for the immediate appointment of direct-rule ministers, the secretary of state said: ""That is a step that I do not intend to take while there is an opportunity for an executive to be formed."" He continued: ""This measure I am taking today with the utmost reluctance and only because there is no other option available."" It comes afterthe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in failed to reach a deal in political talks. Overall, the amount of money available for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, meaning no real increase when inflation is considered. Analysis: Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI business correspondent Better late than never, Northern Ireland finally has a budget for the 2017-18 financial year. It means a cliff-edge of running out of cash has been avoided. Civil servants have been controlling the finances since the executive collapsed before a budget was set. Overall, the allocation for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, or about Â£330m, on 2016-17. However, because of inflation, the budget has really flat-lined in real terms. The budget does not include any of the Â£1bn windfall that the DUP extracted for propping up the Conservative government; that is to come separately. InApril, indicative figures suggestedthe education budget would be cut, causing an outcry from teachers and parents. However, the education budget is up by 1.5% compared to last year, the justice budget is down by 0.4% and the agriculture and environment budget is down by 3%. Health economists usually estimate that health service spending needs to rise by an annual rate of 3% - 5% to cope with rising demand. The Department of Finance has cautioned that the budget is not fully comparable to the 2016/17 budget, due to timing differences. The 2016/17 budget was published before the start of the financial year while this budget comes mid-year and includes in-year reallocations. Analysis: Mark Devenport, BBC News NI political editor Is this direct rule or not direct rule? It depends who you talk to. The SDLP says it is direct rule, and blames the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Alliance party says it is a ""slippery slope"" towards direct rule, but both James Brokenshire and Theresa May dismiss that. Mr Brokenshire is fearful of ""full-fat"" direct rule because it would be very hard to get back out of it. He might, therefore, try and get away with this halfway house solution, at least until the end of the year. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds welcomed the budget move as the ""right thing"" to do in the absence of a deal to restore devolution. He said the decision by the secretary of state is ""not full blown direct rule"". The North Belfast MP also said that if a deal is not forthcoming to restore devolution, direct rule ministers of  ""some ilk will have to be appointed"". He said the failure to restore power sharing rests with Sinn FÃ©in and that the DUP and other parties were ready to set up an executive ""in the morning"". He added that the Â£1bn promised by the government for Northern Ireland as part of theTory-DUP confidence and supply arrangement would be ""detailed in the coming days"". NI Secretary James Brokenshire said a budget is needed in the absence of a devolved government However, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader said the reason for the budget was ""DUP opposition to a rights-based society"". Michelle O'Neill said that the UK government had been ""complicit in this, backing the DUP's refusal to honour the commitments previously made and blocking the delivery of equality."" She also said her party had told Prime Minister Theresa May that direct rule was ""not an option"". ""These issues aren't going away. It is now the responsibility of the two governments to look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and for a British-Irish intergovernmental conference to meet as soon as possible. ""We have sought urgent meetings with both the taoiseach [Irish prime minister] and the British prime minister. ""The way forward now is for the two governments to fulfil their responsibility as co-guarantors of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements, to honour outstanding commitments, and to deliver rights enjoyed by everyone else on these islands to people here."" Mr Brokenshire has said he would be willing to withdraw the budget bill if an executive is formed before December. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a ""significant day"" with ""decisions being taken in London which should have been taken in Belfast"". ""This is British direct rule, delivered by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in,"" he added. Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken said: ""We need to have executive ministers in place in January at the absolute latest because we need to get policy decisions made so we can shape the 18-19 budget for everybody in Northern Ireland - if we don't do that we're in real danger."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the budget ""doesn't redirect money to where it's needed now, it simply disperses the money on the basis of decisions that were taken by the last executive and that's now quite considerably out of date"".

"Irish musician and activist Bob Geldof said he is ""shamed"" to share the honour with Suu Kyi Bob Geldof has said he will return his Freedom of the City of Dublin in protest against the Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who also holds the award. Mr Geldof said ""her association with our city shames us all"". Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism over her failure to address allegations of ethnic cleansing against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims. More than half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh following recent violence. Mr Geldof, the musician and founder of Band Aid, said in a statement: ""Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honoured her, now she appals and shames us."" He is handing back the award at City Hall in the Irish capital on Monday morning. What you need to know about the crisis What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism over her response to reported atrocities Ms Suu Kyi has been condemned by international leaders and human rights groups over her reluctance to acknowledge the military violence, which the UN has called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". There have also been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Reacting to Mr Geldof's announcement, Lord Mayor Micheal Mac Donnacha of Dublin City Council said on Monday: ""I find it ironic that he makes this gesture while proudly retaining his title as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, given the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe."" Fellow Irish musicians U2 also criticised Ms Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, also known as Burma, urging her on Saturday to take a stronger stance against the reported violence by security forces. In a statement on the band's website, they said her failure to address the crisis was ""starting to look a lot like assent"". ""So we say to you now what we would have said to her: the violence and terror being visited on the Rohingya people are appalling atrocities and must stop."" This video can not be played Thousands of Rohingya refugees flee to Bangladesh Last month,Oxford City Council decided to strip Ms Suu Kyi of the freedom of the city,which she was awarded in 1997, in an ""unprecedented step"" for the local authority. The City of London is also toconsider a similar step. Earlier this month, she was alsostripped of the freedom of the cities of SheffieldandGlasgowbecause of her response to the Rohingya crisis. St Hugh's College at Oxford University, where Ms Suu Kyi read politics, has removed a portrait of her from display. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims had to decide what to bring and what to leave. The violence in Rakhine erupted on 25 August when Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Myanmar's Rakhine state, triggering a military crackdown. Scores of people have been killed in the crackdown and there are widespread allegations of villages being burned and Rohingya being driven out. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. About 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since 25 August.

"In Italy, Asia and New Zealand, long-range earthquake predictions from self-taught forecasters have recently had people on edge. But is it possible to pinpoint when a quake will strike? It's a quake prediction based on the movements of the moon, the sun and the planets, and made by a self-taught scientist who died in 1979. But on 11 May 2011, many people planned to stay away from Rome, fearing a quake forecast by the late Raffaele Bendandi - even though his writings contained no geographical location, nor a day or month. In New Zealand too, the quake predictions of a former magician who specialises in fishing weather forecasts have caused unease. After a 6.3 quake scored a direct hit on Christchurch in February, Ken Ring forecast another on 20 March, caused by a ""moon-shot straight through the centre of the earth"". Rattled residents fled the city. Predicting quakes is highly controversial, says Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the British Geological Survey. Many scientists believe it is impossible because of the quasi-random nature of earthquakes. ""Despite huge efforts and great advances in our understanding of earthquakes, there are no good examples of an earthquake being successfully predicted in terms of where, when and how big,"" he says. Many of the methods previously applied to earthquake prediction have been discredited, he says, adding that predictions such as that in Rome ""have little basis and merely cause public alarm"". Can animals pick up quake signals? Seismologists do monitor rock movements around fault lines to gauge where pressure is building up, and this can provide a last-minute warning in the literal sense, says BBC science correspondent Jonathan Amos. ""InJapan,externalandCalifornia,external, there are scientists looking for pre-cursor signals in rocks. It is possible to get a warning up to 30 seconds before an earthquake strikes your location. That's enough time to get the doors open on a fire station, so the engines can get out as soon as it is over."" But any longer-range prediction is much harder. ""It's like pouring sand on to a pile, and trying to predict which grain of sand on which side of the pile will cause it to collapse. It is a classic non-linear system, and people have been trying to model it for centuries,"" says Amos. In Japan, all eyes are on the faults that lace its shaky islands. On Monday, Trade and Industry Minister Banri Kaieda urged that the Hamaoka nuclear plant near a fault line south-west of Tokyo be shut down, pending the construction of new tsunami defences. Seismologists have long warned that a major earthquake is overdue in this region. But overdue earthquakes can be decades, if not centuries, in coming. And this makes it hard to prepare, beyond precautions such as construction standards and urging the populace to lay in emergency supplies that may never be needed. Later this year, a satellite is due to launch to test the as-yet unproven theory that there is a link between electrical disturbances on the edge of our atmosphere and impending quakes on the ground below. Then there are the hypotheses that animals may be able to sense impending earthquakes. Last year, the Journal of Zoologypublished a study into a population of toads,externalthat left their breeding colony three days before a 6.3 quake struck L'Aquila, Italy, in 2009. This was highly unusual behaviour. But it is hard to objectively and quantifiably study how animals respond to seismic activity, in part because earthquakes are rare and strike without warning. Countries in the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire"", like New Zealand, are regularly shaken by quakes ""At the moment, we know the parts of the world where earthquakes happen and how often they happen on average in these areas,"" says Dr Baptie. This allows seismologists to make statistical estimates of probable ground movements that can be use to plan for earthquakes and mitigate their effects. ""However, this is still a long way from earthquake prediction,"" he says. And what of the ""prophets"" who claim to predict these natural disasters? ""Many regions, such as Indonesia and Japan, experience large earthquakes on a regular basis, so vague predictions of earthquakes in these places requires no great skill.""

"Jupiter and Venus were photographed here above Brighton Pier Jupiter and Venus - the two brightest planets - have appeared together in the morning sky. The planetary conjunction was visible to the naked eye across much of the UK, with the time before dawn being the best to catch the spectacle. Experts said the planets were so close as to appear almost on top of each other. One astronomer said it would probably be ""decades rather than years"" before they appeared as close together. Watch: The dog that orbited the earth The astronaut who was told she would never go to space While the planets have been visible to the unaided eye, viewers with a telescope have also been able to see Jupiter's four Galilean moons. People in the UK have taken to social media to share their photos of the planetary display. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Viewed from London, the planets began appearing shortly before 06:00 GMT with the conjunction occurring just after. Those on high ground with a clear view of the eastern horizon had the best chance of witnessing the planetary display. This image of the planetary display was captured by Alexandra Palace in London The planets were spotted here in the Merseyside skyline The conjunction of the planets looks like a bright star In 2004, the planet Venus could be seen crossing the Sun as a small black dot Mark Thompson, an astronomer and former presenter on the BBC show Stargazing Live, said conjunctions occur when planets line up in such a way that they appear from Earth to be next to each other - despite in this case being hundreds of millions of miles apart. Mr Thompson told the BBC the cloudy atmospheres of the two planets made them appear bright to the naked eye. He said the event was not uncommon - Venus and Jupiter appeared together in 2015 and 2016, also on 13 November - but it was much rarer for them to appear so close to each other. ""There have certainly been cases where they've been close in the sky but they've not been this close in recent years, certainly the last couple of planetary conjunctions. ""This is actually quite a good conjunction because they're so close, and over the next few years they'll pass each other and be close but not this closeâ¦ ""One as close as this, you're probably looking decades rather than years."" The conjunction can also be seen in countries in the mid-northern latitudes, including parts of the US. Those who missed the event will be able to see the two planets again on Tuesday morning, but they will not be as close together. According to Nasa, stargazers will be treated to another planetary pairing later this month, when Saturn will meet Mercury on the western horizon at dusk on 24 and 28 November.

"This video can not be played Robbery in Regent Street Apple store A security guard at a central London Apple store was threatened with a hammer as he tried to stop a gang of raiders on mopeds. Ten suspects on five mopeds smashed their way into the Regent Street shop at 00:45 GMT and escaped with iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. Two iPhone Xs were later recovered near Kings Cross. The flagship store was fully operational with no visible damage later on Monday morning. Apple declined to comment. Miah Mohammad Sheful, captured video of the raid when he was waiting for a bus nearby. The Apple store on Regent Street was fully operational later on Monday morning The 28-year-old said it took the suspects several attempts to break in the door of the tech giant's store. Passing cars started beeping their horns to prevent the burglary as they realised what was unfolding, he said. The moped gang got away within seconds. The suspects, described as wearing dark clothing, are said to have made off northbound along Regent Street. The man who threatened the guard was described as black. The raid comes one month after a gang riding mopeds attacked a jeweller's in the same street. Three suspects are believed to have used a hammer, axe and bats to break into Mappin & Webb on 9 October. They escaped with a high-value haul. Offences involving scooters and mopedsare on the risein London. Figures suggest that in the year to September, there were more than 19,385 ""moped enabled"" crimes in the capital - an average of 53 a day - including thefts and robberies. Last month, a moped gang that robbed more than 100 people, including former Chancellor George Osborne,was jailed.

"Joshua Sutcliffe said he tried to balance his beliefs with the need to treat the pupil sensitively A teacher is facing disciplinary action at his school after he referred to a transgender pupil as a girl, although the student identifies as a boy. Joshua Sutcliffe, a Christian pastor from Oxford, admitted he said ""Well done girls"" when addressing a group including the student. He described it as a ""slip of the tongue"", but said he believed biological sex was defined at birth The school said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment. Mr Sutcliffe, who teaches children aged between 11 and 18, said the incident took place on 2 November. He said a week-long investigation found he had ""misgendered"" the pupil. Church of England: Let girls and boys wear tiaras The maths teacher, who is also a pastor at the Christ Revelation church in Oxford, said he tried to balance his beliefs with the need to treat the pupil sensitively. He claimed he did this by avoiding the use of gender-specific pronouns and by referring to the pupil by name. ""While the suggestion that gender is fluid conflicts sharply with my Christian beliefs... I have never looked to impose my convictions on others"", he said He said he had apologised to the student, but said he did not consider it ""unreasonable"" to call someone a girl ""if they were born a girl"". More than 2,000 young people, aged between three and 18, were referred to a specialist NHS clinic in 2016-17, seeking help with their gender identity. The numbers have been growing every year since the start of the decade. Of 2,016 young people referred to the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) in the most recent year, 1,400 were assigned female at birth. Polly Carmichael, a consultant clinical psychologist and director of GIDS, said there was no single explanation for the increase but said there had been ""significant progress towards the acceptance and recognition of transgender and gender diverse people in our society"". Dr Carmichael said the majority of the service's users did not take up physical treatment. There were two children referred aged three in 2016-17. The service rejected 30 referrals of people who were already 18 years old. The Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting Mr Sutcliffe, said he faced an internal disciplinary hearing on Wednesday. The state academy school where he is employed said the matter was confidential. However, it said it took equality and discrimination seriously and had a range of governor-approved policies in place to ensure it acted lawfully. LGBT charity Stonewall said ""pupils must be protected"" even if teachers may hold ""different opinions"" about sexuality and gender identity. It did not want to comment on the case involving Mr Sutcliffe, but it said ""children should always feel included and accepted for who they are"".

"The traffic lights will be on the link roads between the M6 and the eastbound M62 Traffic lights are to be placed on two busy link roads between the M6 and the eastbound M62 under plans to ease motorway congestion. Testing has begun on the system, near Warrington in Cheshire, and it will be turned on fully in December, according to Highways England. A spokesman said if the Â£7m trial was successful, it could be rolled out on motorway link roads across the country. Previously, traffic lights have only been installed on motorway slip roads. Highways England said electronic information signs and variable mandatory speed limits on the M62 will also be used to ""provide smoother traffic flows"". The aim is to ease traffic at the Croft Interchange, where Junction 21A of the M6 meets Junction 10 of the M62. The Highways England spokesman said it was ""an opportunity to combine existing technology and traffic management systems in a novel way"" to provide ""lower journey times during peak hours and smoother, more reliable journeys"".

"Most of the deaths were reported in Iran's Kermanshah province A 7.3-magnitude earthquake has shaken the northern border region between Iran and Iraq, killing at least 396 people and injuring thousands more. More than 7,000 people are also said to have been injured in the quake, the world's deadliest this year. Most of those who died were in Iran's western Kermanshah province, where a search for survivors has started. Nine more people died in Iraq, where residents fled from their homes into the streets in the capital, Baghdad. ""I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,"" a Baghdad resident, Majida Ameer, told Reuters news agency. ""I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: 'Earthquake!'"" Latest images of aftermath The world's deadliest earthquakes In the latest updates from Iran: State news agency Irna quoted an emergency official as saying 6,603 people were injured in Iran alone Most of the victims were in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 15km (10 miles) from the border, emergency services chief Pir Hossein Koolivand said The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded, state TV reported A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake. Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks and are vulnerable in quakes as large as Sunday's. This video can not be played A Kurdish TV channel was live on air during the earthquake In Sarpol-e Zahab, a city of about 85,000 people, the sides of a number of tall buildings collapsed, forcing many people to spend the night outdoors in freezing conditions. Rescue teams were being hampered by landslides, emergency workers said. The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km south-west of Halabja, near the north-eastern border with Iran,the US Geological Survey (USGS) said,external. About 1.8 million people live within 100km of the epicentre, the UN estimates. On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan in the Kurdistan Region. ""The situation there is very critical,"" Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters news agency. Is it possible to predict a quake? Yaseen Abbas of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society told the BBC that 425 people had been wounded in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, where Turkey has already delivered aid. The BBC's Rami Ruhayem, in the regional capital Irbil, said shaking there had lasted for more than a minute. ""For a few seconds at first it was barely detectable, I wasn't sure whether it was a minor tremor or just my imagination,"" he said. ""But soon enough it was unmistakable as the building started swaying from side to side."" This huge rock fell from a mountain in Darbandikhan, Iraq The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people. Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 last year and 19 the year before,external. Analysis by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past. In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year. In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression. Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture. Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals. Are you in the area?

"This video can not be played The CBI chief says business wants the UK and Europe to speed up Brexit negotiations European and UK business leaders have told Prime Minister Theresa May of their Brexit concerns. At a meeting in Downing Street on Monday, representatives from groups including the CBI and BusinessEurope pressed for a transitional deal that preserves the status quo after Brexit. The CBI chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, said all those at the meeting reiterated the damage ""no deal"" would do to trade. A German lobby group also warned that no deal would cost their economy dear. The head of the German chambers of commerce, Martin Wansleben, told a newspaper the car industry alone would face annual tariffs of more than â¬2bn if trade between the UK and the EU falls under World Trade Organisation rules. Brexit: All you need to know How are the talks really progressing? Barnier: UK has 'two weeks' to clarify issues Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, said: ""Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress only one month before the decisive December European Council. ""Business aims to avoid a cliff edge and therefore asks for a 'status quo-like' transitional arrangement with the UK staying in the customs union and the single market, as this will best provide citizens and businesses with greater certainty."" The business groups met Mrs May at No 10, as well as Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay. The CBI and the Institute of Directors were represented, along with business organisations from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium. There are concerns thatfuture trade talks could collapseahead of December's EU summit. EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that the talks will only go ahead if the UK first clarifies its financial obligations to the EU. Mr Davis has said the UK was ""ready and willing"" to engage with Brussels ""as often and as quickly as needed"". Earlier, Ms Fairbairn, CBI director-general, told the BBC a CBI survey found that 10% of companies had already activated their contingency plans. The pace of planning by firms was picking up, she added, with about 60% of companies saying they would implement contingency plans by the end of next March. Bernard Spitz, a director of Medef, France's biggest business lobby group, said agreement on a transition deal was important for both UK companies as well as those ""across the European Union"". ""We know that for us, especially for the French, the relationship with the UK is absolutely key, but if business continuity is important, what is even more important is the integrity of the European market,"" he said. Michel Barnier has warned of the possible collapse of Brexit talks Property developer Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave Means Leave, said if a trade deal appeared unlikely, ""then actually we would be better to give certainty to everybody that actually we're going to do a different type of deal which is to go to WTO [World Trade Organization rules]"". BBC business editor Simon Jack says some UK business leaders in favour of Brexit are concerned that a transition period maintaining the current arrangements will delay and frustrate Britain's attempts to strike new independent deals.

"Irish musician and activist Bob Geldof said he is ""shamed"" to share the honour with Suu Kyi Bob Geldof has said he will return his Freedom of the City of Dublin in protest against the Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who also holds the award. Mr Geldof said ""her association with our city shames us all"". Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism over her failure to address allegations of ethnic cleansing against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims. More than half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh following recent violence. Mr Geldof, the musician and founder of Band Aid, said in a statement: ""Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honoured her, now she appals and shames us."" He is handing back the award at City Hall in the Irish capital on Monday morning. What you need to know about the crisis What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? Who are the Rohingya group behind attacks? Aung San Suu Kyi has faced widespread criticism over her response to reported atrocities Ms Suu Kyi has been condemned by international leaders and human rights groups over her reluctance to acknowledge the military violence, which the UN has called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". There have also been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Reacting to Mr Geldof's announcement, Lord Mayor Micheal Mac Donnacha of Dublin City Council said on Monday: ""I find it ironic that he makes this gesture while proudly retaining his title as Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, given the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe."" Fellow Irish musicians U2 also criticised Ms Suu Kyi, the civilian leader of Myanmar, also known as Burma, urging her on Saturday to take a stronger stance against the reported violence by security forces. In a statement on the band's website, they said her failure to address the crisis was ""starting to look a lot like assent"". ""So we say to you now what we would have said to her: the violence and terror being visited on the Rohingya people are appalling atrocities and must stop."" This video can not be played Thousands of Rohingya refugees flee to Bangladesh Last month,Oxford City Council decided to strip Ms Suu Kyi of the freedom of the city,which she was awarded in 1997, in an ""unprecedented step"" for the local authority. The City of London is also toconsider a similar step. Earlier this month, she was alsostripped of the freedom of the cities of SheffieldandGlasgowbecause of her response to the Rohingya crisis. St Hugh's College at Oxford University, where Ms Suu Kyi read politics, has removed a portrait of her from display. This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims had to decide what to bring and what to leave. The violence in Rakhine erupted on 25 August when Rohingya militants attacked security posts in Myanmar's Rakhine state, triggering a military crackdown. Scores of people have been killed in the crackdown and there are widespread allegations of villages being burned and Rohingya being driven out. Myanmar's military says it is fighting Rohingya militants and denies targeting civilians. About 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since 25 August.

"This video can not be played Robbery in Regent Street Apple store A security guard at a central London Apple store was threatened with a hammer as he tried to stop a gang of raiders on mopeds. Ten suspects on five mopeds smashed their way into the Regent Street shop at 00:45 GMT and escaped with iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. Two iPhone Xs were later recovered near Kings Cross. The flagship store was fully operational with no visible damage later on Monday morning. Apple declined to comment. Miah Mohammad Sheful, captured video of the raid when he was waiting for a bus nearby. The Apple store on Regent Street was fully operational later on Monday morning The 28-year-old said it took the suspects several attempts to break in the door of the tech giant's store. Passing cars started beeping their horns to prevent the burglary as they realised what was unfolding, he said. The moped gang got away within seconds. The suspects, described as wearing dark clothing, are said to have made off northbound along Regent Street. The man who threatened the guard was described as black. The raid comes one month after a gang riding mopeds attacked a jeweller's in the same street. Three suspects are believed to have used a hammer, axe and bats to break into Mappin & Webb on 9 October. They escaped with a high-value haul. Offences involving scooters and mopedsare on the risein London. Figures suggest that in the year to September, there were more than 19,385 ""moped enabled"" crimes in the capital - an average of 53 a day - including thefts and robberies. Last month, a moped gang that robbed more than 100 people, including former Chancellor George Osborne,was jailed.

"The remaining videos about Awlaki are news items and documentaries, says YouTube YouTube has removed nearly 50,000 videos featuring radical Islamist preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a drone strike in 2011. Awlaki was renowned for preaching violence as a religious duty, although at the time of his death his family denied he was a terrorist. The remaining videos are mainly documentaries and news items,reports the New York Times.,external The BBC understands this is a result of human review, not machine learning. To help ensure that the videos stay off YouTube, once humans flag a video for removal it is run through a formatting system that creates a digital fingerprint or ""hash"". Uploaded videos are compared to this hash to spot when people are trying to share copies of banned content. Awlaki posted many different types of videos to YouTube. Some were explicit calls to violence, but others were commentaries on Islam and its history. Most of these videos are believed to have been purged from the site. If he were alive today, Awlaki would have been banned from owning a YouTube channel because he was named as a terrorist on UK and US government lists. Anti-extremism groups lodged their first complaints about Awlaki's videos in 2009, but until last year it was still possible to find copies of his most explicitly violent material on YouTube. A long series of complaints and reports from groups working to counter extremism detailed Awlaki's influence and called on YouTube to act. Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, from George Washington University's research programme on extremism, told the New York Times that YouTube ""deserved credit"" for removing the videos. YouTube's design often led people to discover Awlaki's content inadvertently, he said. However, he added, Awlaki's videos were still easy to find on other video sites and social networks.

"Shareholders in the Nisa convenience store group have approved the chain's Â£137m takeover by the Co-operative Group. The deal was backed by 75.79% of shareholders' votes at an emergency meeting, narrowly exceeding the 75% threshold required to approve the deal. Nisa is a member-owned business that has more than 3,000 stores and operates a wholesale business. The deal still needs to be approved by the Competition and Markets Authority. The Nisa board said the deal was in the ""best interests"" of members. Nisa chairman Peter Hartley said: ""The convenience store environment is changing rapidly, and is unrecognisable from that which existed when Nisa was founded more than 40 years ago. ""Co-op will add buying power and product range to our offering, while respecting our culture of independence."" Under the deal, Nisa members will still have the option of choosing not to buy goods through the Co-op. Nisa shareholders will receive an equal initial payment of Â£20,000, plus deferred payments depending on how many shares they hold. However, there was opposition from some Nisa members who were unhappy about, among other things, the size of the initial payout. ""The threshold was only surpassed by a fraction, showing that there is still a large amount of discontent around the deal,"" said Molly Johnson-Jones, senior retail analyst at GlobalData. ""Many independent retailers are fearful of what the market consolidation will do to their autonomy, and there was dissidence around the idea of being owned by a large corporation."" The retail industry is undergoing a  period of consolidation. A shift in shopping habits, fierce competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl, and the arrival of Amazon has prompted retailers such as the Co-op to look to bolster their businesses by buying food wholesalers. Earlier this year Sainsbury's began talks with Nisa about a takeover, before pulling out. Tesco is awaiting the results of an in-depth competition inquiry into its proposed Â£3.7bn takeover of wholesale giant Booker, which supplies goods to convenience stores, pubs and restaurants. Nisa has nearly 1,200 members, who operate more than 3,200 stores among them, some under the Nisa brand and others under their own names. In the year to 2 April, Nisa reported revenues of Â£1.25bn. with pre-tax profits of Â£2.8m. ""Nisa has futureproofed itself for the increasingly competitive and monopolised convenience market,"" said GlobalData's Ms Johnson-Jones. ""Tesco-Booker will operate at a larger scale than any food retail company in the past, and will fundamentally change the structure of the market. ""It is essential that symbol groups move to acquire greater buying power to avoid being pushed out of the market by the big four [supermarket chains] wielding their new-found convenience and wholesale capabilities. Nisa would now be in a better position to protect its members, she added. However, she said rising costs and high demand for convenience store spaces mean that ""it's not going to be easy to be an independent retailer over the medium term, even with a partnership of this size"".

"Carl Sargeant was found dead after an investigation was launched into his conduct Sacked Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant's provisional cause of death was hanging, an inquest has heard. The 49-year-old married father-of-two, who had been Alyn and Deeside AM since 2003,was found deadat his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, on Tuesday. He was found four days after beingsacked from his job as cabinet secretaryfor communities and children. At the opening of his inquest, coroner John Gittins said it was ""an apparent act of self harm"". Mr Gittins added he would carefully examine ""the steps taken by the assembly to have regard to Mr Sargeant's mental welfare prior to his death"". The inquest in Ruthin, Denbighshire, was told Mr Sargeant was found on the floor of the utility room by his wife Bernadette. Family members attempted to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived and continued those efforts, but the former minister was pronounced dead about 30 minutes later. Mr Sargeant was facing a partyinvestigation into claims about inappropriate personal conductand was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death. He was removed from his role amid allegations he had ""touched or groped"" a number of women. 'Full support' for first minister First minister orders Sargeant inquiry Sacked Labour minister found dead Carl Sargeant: Profile of AM's career Mr Gittins, coroner for North Wales East and Central, said the inquest would not consider the veracity of the allegations made against Mr Sargeant, nor would he be ""looking to Cardiff and the Welsh Assembly or the Labour Party"" about who was right or wrong and who could be trusted. He said he would be seeking statements from First Minister Carwyn Jones and possibly others at the Welsh Assembly in the coming weeks, but was not in a position to say whether Mr Jones would be called to give evidence. No date has been fixed for the full hearing as the coroner said a separate independent inquiry could have an impact on his responsibility to compile a prevention of future deaths report. He ended by assuring Mr Sargeant's family, friends and colleagues that ""there will be a full and fair examination of the matters which are relevant to my investigation and that I shall not allow the inquest to be a trial by press, politics or personality"". North Wales Police was called to Mr Sargeant's home after he was found on the floor by his wife Mr Sargeant's family called him ""the glue that bound us together"" and said they were ""devastated beyond words"". Mr Jones said he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" and paid tribute to ""a friend as well as a colleague"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Sargeant's death was ""deeply shocking news"" while Prime Minister Theresa May said her ""heart goes out to Carl Sargeant's friends and family"". Mr Jones sacked Mr Sargeant from his frontbench after the first minister learned of a number of alleged incidents involving women. There will be anindependent inquiry into how Mr Joneshandled the case. Meanwhile,fresh claimsabout bullying in the Welsh Government have been made by a former adviser to Mr Jones.

"Both leaders are known for their controversial comments US President Donald Trump said he has a ""great relationship"" with Philippine counterpart Rodrigo Duterte, after a highly anticipated meeting in Manila. It was unclear whether Mr Trump raised human rights violations in the country, despite calls for him to do so. The previous US administration had spoken out against Mr Duterte's war on drugs, which has killed almost 4,000 people. Mr Trump is almost at the end of an extensive Asia tour. The first meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Duterte, which took place at the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) summit, was closely watched as both are known for striking a controversially outspoken and direct tone. This video can not be played Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte was in fine voice during the Asean summit. After the private meeting, the US president did not respond to questions about whether he had raised the subject of human rights while a spokesman for Mr Duterte said the topic had not been discussed. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later said the topic was mentioned briefly in their private meeting, in the context of the war on drugs, but did not give further details. Trump v Duterte - who said what? Why the Philippines matters to the US Trump's Asia tour leaves observers perplexed On Friday, Mr Dutertesaid he stabbed a person to deathwhen he was a teenager. His spokesman later said the remark had been ""in jest"". Riot police used water cannons against anti-Trump protesters Since coming into office in 2016, Mr Duterte has presided over a massive crackdown on crime in the Philippines, which critics allege undermines fundamental human rights. He has encouraged extrajudicial killings of those involved in the drug trade, and said he would ""be happy to slaughter"" three million drug addicts in the country. Police say they have killed almost 4,000 people in anti-drug operations since 2016. More than 2,000 others have been killed in connection with drug-related crimes. Mr Trump has previously praised Mr Duterte's war on drugs, reportedly telling him: ""I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem. Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing."" A Philippine government transcript of the 29 April phone call,externalwas later leaked to US media. Mr Trump and other leaders attending the Asean event had already met on Sunday evening at a gala in Manila ahead of the summit. During the evening, Mr Duterte took to the stage tosing a Filipino hit love song, afterwards saying it had been ""on the orders of the commander-in-chief of the United States"". Presidents Trump and Duterte amid the other Asean leaders Demonstrators took to the streets in Manila both on Sunday and Monday, protesting against Mr Trump's visit and carrying banners like ""Trump Go Home"" and ""Ban Trump #1 terrorist"". Riot police used water cannon and sonic alarms to repel the protesters.

"Consumption of coal has grown once again in China after three years of decline Global emissions of CO2 in 2017 are projected to rise for the first time in four years, dashing hopes that a peak might soon be reached. The main cause of the expected growth has been greater use of coal in China as its economy expanded. Researchers are uncertain if the rise in emissions is a one-off or the start of a new period of CO2 build-up. Scientists say that a global peak in CO2 before 2020 is needed to limit dangerous global warming this century.

TheGlobal Carbon Project,externalhas been analysing and reporting on the scale of emissions of CO2 since 2006. Carbon output has grown by about 3% per year in that period, but growth essentially declined or remained flat between 2014 and 2016.Concern at first CO2 rise in four years The latest figures indicate that in 2017, emissions of CO2 from all human activities grew by about 2% globally. There is some uncertainty about the data but the researchers involved have concluded that emissions are on the rise again. ""Global CO2 emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period. This is very disappointing,"" said the lead author of the study, Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia. ""With global CO2 emissions from human activities estimated at 41 billion tonnes for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2 degrees C, let alone 1.5C."" The most important element in causing this rise has been China, which is responsible for around 28% of the global total. Emissions there went up 3.5% in 2017, mainly because of increased coal use, driven in the main by a growing economy. US coal production has increased slightly this year mainly due to export demand Another important factor in China has been lower water levels in rivers which have seen a drop in the amount of electricity made from hydro-power, with utilities turning to coal and gas to make up the shortfall. US emissions have continued to decline but the fall has been less than expected. Higher prices saw a drop in the use of natural gas for electricity - with renewables and hydro-power picking up the slack. Coal use has also grown slightly in the US this year, with consumption up about a half of one percent. India's emissions are projected to grow by about 2%, which is a considerable decrease from around 6% per year over the last decade. However, experts believe that this may be a temporary drop-off caused by a number of factors that have hampered the consumption of oil and cement. Europe also saw a smaller decline than expected, falling by 0.2% compared with 2.2% over the last 10 years. One common theme around the world is continued use of gas and oil, says Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. ""There have been lots of ups and downs in the use of coal but in the background there has been no weakening in the use of oil and gas. And that is quite worrisome."" The report has been launched in Bonn where UN negotiators are trying to move forward with the rules for the Paris climate agreement. Researchers involved with the study say they are not moving fast enough. ""Lots of diplomats are working out the rules but that is all a little bit meaningless unless they go back home to their countries and ratchet up climate action and that is where the gap is,"" said Dr Glen Peters, from theCentre for International Climate Research,externalin Norway. ""These countries have to be pushing on with the policies, but everything keeps getting pushed back."" Demonstrators at UN talks in Bonn demand faster cuts in carbon The report is sure to increase tensions in Bonn between developed and developing nations. There is increasing resentment about the fact that all the focus is on future commitments made under the Paris climate agreement but very little on the years before it becomes active. Poorer countries want the richer ones to increase their carbon-cutting actions over the next three years. ""The climate will not let us wait until 2020 when the Paris agreement comes into force,"" said Nicaragua's chief negotiator, Paul Oquist. ""Climate change is happening now and it's vital that immediate actions to cut emissions become a feature of this summit."" The new research on carbon emissions has been published simultaneously in the journalsNature Climate Change,,externalEarth System Science Data Discussions,externalandEnvironmental Research Letters,external.

"Jupiter and Venus were photographed here above Brighton Pier Jupiter and Venus - the two brightest planets - have appeared together in the morning sky. The planetary conjunction was visible to the naked eye across much of the UK, with the time before dawn being the best to catch the spectacle. Experts said the planets were so close as to appear almost on top of each other. One astronomer said it would probably be ""decades rather than years"" before they appeared as close together. Watch: The dog that orbited the earth The astronaut who was told she would never go to space While the planets have been visible to the unaided eye, viewers with a telescope have also been able to see Jupiter's four Galilean moons. People in the UK have taken to social media to share their photos of the planetary display. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Viewed from London, the planets began appearing shortly before 06:00 GMT with the conjunction occurring just after. Those on high ground with a clear view of the eastern horizon had the best chance of witnessing the planetary display. This image of the planetary display was captured by Alexandra Palace in London The planets were spotted here in the Merseyside skyline The conjunction of the planets looks like a bright star In 2004, the planet Venus could be seen crossing the Sun as a small black dot Mark Thompson, an astronomer and former presenter on the BBC show Stargazing Live, said conjunctions occur when planets line up in such a way that they appear from Earth to be next to each other - despite in this case being hundreds of millions of miles apart. Mr Thompson told the BBC the cloudy atmospheres of the two planets made them appear bright to the naked eye. He said the event was not uncommon - Venus and Jupiter appeared together in 2015 and 2016, also on 13 November - but it was much rarer for them to appear so close to each other. ""There have certainly been cases where they've been close in the sky but they've not been this close in recent years, certainly the last couple of planetary conjunctions. ""This is actually quite a good conjunction because they're so close, and over the next few years they'll pass each other and be close but not this closeâ¦ ""One as close as this, you're probably looking decades rather than years."" The conjunction can also be seen in countries in the mid-northern latitudes, including parts of the US. Those who missed the event will be able to see the two planets again on Tuesday morning, but they will not be as close together. According to Nasa, stargazers will be treated to another planetary pairing later this month, when Saturn will meet Mercury on the western horizon at dusk on 24 and 28 November.

"The traffic lights will be on the link roads between the M6 and the eastbound M62 Traffic lights are to be placed on two busy link roads between the M6 and the eastbound M62 under plans to ease motorway congestion. Testing has begun on the system, near Warrington in Cheshire, and it will be turned on fully in December, according to Highways England. A spokesman said if the Â£7m trial was successful, it could be rolled out on motorway link roads across the country. Previously, traffic lights have only been installed on motorway slip roads. Highways England said electronic information signs and variable mandatory speed limits on the M62 will also be used to ""provide smoother traffic flows"". The aim is to ease traffic at the Croft Interchange, where Junction 21A of the M6 meets Junction 10 of the M62. The Highways England spokesman said it was ""an opportunity to combine existing technology and traffic management systems in a novel way"" to provide ""lower journey times during peak hours and smoother, more reliable journeys"". He added the system would be monitored for a year before any national roll-out took place.

"A lack of devolution at Stormont means the budget will be passed into law using Westminister legislation Northern Ireland's budget for 2017/18 has been published and shows an increase in health spending of 5.4%. The bill has gone through the House of Commons, backed by all parties without a vote. It will go to the House of Lords on Tuesday. NI Secretary James Brokenshire said that public services would begin to run out of money if a budget was not in place by the end of November. Stormont deadlock: what you need to know Sticking points in power-sharing talks He said he regretted having to bring a budget to Westminster but was hopeful an executive could be formed. Northern Ireland has been without a Stormont executive for 10 months. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the passing of budget legislation ""should not be a barrier to to negotiations to continue, but the ongoing lack of agreement has had tangible consequences for people and public services in Northern Ireland"". Faced by DUP calls for the immediate appointment of direct-rule ministers, the secretary of state said: ""That is a step that I do not intend to take while there is an opportunity for an executive to be formed."" He continued: ""This measure I am taking today with the utmost reluctance and only because there is no other option available."" It comes afterthe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in failed to reach a deal in political talks. Overall, the amount of money available for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, meaning no real increase when inflation is considered. Analysis: Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI business correspondent Better late than never, Northern Ireland finally has a budget for the 2017-18 financial year. It means a cliff-edge of running out of cash has been avoided. Civil servants have been controlling the finances since the executive collapsed before a budget was set. Overall, the allocation for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, or about Â£330m, on 2016-17. However, because of inflation, the budget has really flat-lined in real terms. The budget does not include any of the Â£1bn windfall that the DUP extracted for propping up the Conservative government; that is to come separately. InApril, indicative figures suggestedthe education budget would be cut, causing an outcry from teachers and parents. However, the education budget is up by 1.5% compared to last year, the justice budget is down by 0.4% and the agriculture and environment budget is down by 3%. Health economists usually estimate that health service spending needs to rise by an annual rate of 3% - 5% to cope with rising demand. The Department of Finance has cautioned that the budget is not fully comparable to the 2016/17 budget, due to timing differences. The 2016/17 budget was published before the start of the financial year while this budget comes mid-year and includes in-year reallocations. Analysis: Mark Devenport, BBC News NI political editor Is this direct rule or not direct rule? It depends who you talk to. The SDLP says it is direct rule, and blames the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Alliance party says it is a ""slippery slope"" towards direct rule, but both James Brokenshire and Theresa May dismiss that. Mr Brokenshire is fearful of ""full-fat"" direct rule because it would be very hard to get back out of it. He might, therefore, try and get away with this halfway house solution, at least until the end of the year. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds welcomed the budget move as the ""right thing"" to do in the absence of a deal to restore devolution. He said the decision by the secretary of state is ""not full blown direct rule"". The North Belfast MP also said that if a deal is not forthcoming to restore devolution, direct rule ministers of  ""some ilk will have to be appointed"". He said the failure to restore power sharing rests with Sinn FÃ©in and that the DUP and other parties were ready to set up an executive ""in the morning"". He added that the Â£1bn promised by the government for Northern Ireland as part of theTory-DUP confidence and supply arrangement would be ""detailed in the coming days"". NI Secretary James Brokenshire said a budget is needed in the absence of a devolved government However, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader said the reason for the budget was ""DUP opposition to a rights-based society"". Michelle O'Neill said that the UK government had been ""complicit in this, backing the DUP's refusal to honour the commitments previously made and blocking the delivery of equality."" She also said her party had told Prime Minister Theresa May that direct rule was ""not an option"". ""These issues aren't going away. It is now the responsibility of the two governments to look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and for a British-Irish intergovernmental conference to meet as soon as possible. ""We have sought urgent meetings with both the taoiseach [Irish prime minister] and the British prime minister. ""The way forward now is for the two governments to fulfil their responsibility as co-guarantors of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements, to honour outstanding commitments, and to deliver rights enjoyed by everyone else on these islands to people here."" Mr Brokenshire has said he would be willing to withdraw the budget bill if an executive is formed before December. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a ""significant day"" with ""decisions being taken in London which should have been taken in Belfast"". ""This is British direct rule, delivered by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in,"" he added. Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken said: ""We need to have executive ministers in place in January at the absolute latest because we need to get policy decisions made so we can shape the 18-19 budget for everybody in Northern Ireland - if we don't do that we're in real danger."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the budget ""doesn't redirect money to where it's needed now, it simply disperses the money on the basis of decisions that were taken by the last executive and that's now quite considerably out of date"".

The CBI chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, said all those at the meeting reiterated the damage ""no deal"" would do to trade. A German lobby group also warned that no deal would cost their economy dear. The head of the German chambers of commerce, Martin Wansleben, told a newspaper the car industry alone would face annual tariffs of more than â¬2bn if trade between the UK and the EU falls under World Trade Organisation rules. Brexit: All you need to know How are the talks really progressing? Barnier: UK has 'two weeks' to clarify issues Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, said: ""Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress only one month before the decisive December European Council. ""Business aims to avoid a cliff edge and therefore asks for a 'status quo-like' transitional arrangement with the UK staying in the customs union and the single market, as this will best provide citizens and businesses with greater certainty."" The business groups met Mrs May at No 10, as well as Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay. The CBI and the Institute of Directors were represented, along with business organisations from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium.

Earlier, Ms Fairbairn, CBI director-general, told the BBC a CBI survey found that 10% of companies had already activated their contingency plans. The pace of planning by firms was picking up, she added, with about 60% of companies saying they would implement contingency plans by the end of next March.

Police were called after a woman was hit by a car in Lytham, Lancashire, on Sunday, suffering minor injuries. The former England footballer, 44, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving, common assault and criminal damage. He is also suspected of a public order offence and has been released while inquiries continue, police said. Officers responded at 20:45 GMT to a disturbance at a home on Victory Boulevard in Lytham, said Lancashire Police. A man had already left the property in a car. A police spokesman added: ""A short time later, officers found the vehicle which had been involved in a collision with a woman pedestrian on Clifton Drive. She received minor injuries.""

"Primary schoolchildren should be free to dress up in a tiara or superhero cloak without comment from teachers or pupils, the Church of England has said. Inbullying guidance,externalissued to its schools, the Church said pupils should be free to explore ""who they might be"". Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the guidance would help schools spread the Christian message ""without exception or exclusion"". LGBT charity Stonewall said the advice would help to prevent bullying. The advice comes as polling for the Anti-Bullying Alliance showed that two in five children ""hide aspects of themselves"" for fear of being bullied. Of 1,600 eight to 16-year-olds questioned for this week'sAnti-Bullying Week:,external almost two-thirds had witnessed people being bullied for being ""different"" over half feared being seen as different almost a quarter said they would change the way they look to conform The Church, which educates one million pupils in nearly 5,000 schools,first issued guidance about homophobic bullyingthree years ago, but it has now been updated to cover transphobic and biphobic bullying. In his foreword to the advice, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said: ""We must avoid, at all costs, diminishing the dignity of any individual to a stereotype or a problem"". He said sexual orientation should never be the grounds for bullying or prejudice, adding that ""significant progress"" had been made since homophobic bullying guidance was issued in 2014. The report, Valuing All God's Children, said children should be able to play with ""the many cloaks of identity"" without being labelled or bullied - ""sometimes quite literally with the dressing-up box"". Nursery and primary school in particular is a time of ""creative exploration"", it said, where young people should be able to pick a tutu, tiara and heels - or a helmet, tool belt and superhero cloak - ""without expectation or comment"". The Archbishop of Canterbury said no one should be diminished to a ""stereotype or a problem"" The guidance recognised there is a ""breadth of views"" among Christians and people of all beliefs towards same-sex marriage, sexual orientation and gender identity. But it added: ""The aim of this guidance is to prevent pupils in Church of England schools and academies from having their self-worth diminished or their ability to achieve impeded by being bullied because of their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity."" Stonewall, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights group, said the guidance gave ""clear advice"" to teachers on recognising and combating bullying in Church schools. A spokesman said: ""Our research shows that nearly half of lesbian, gay, bi and trans pupils are bullied for being LGBT at school: a situation that desperately needs to change."" Anti-Bullying Alliance national co-ordinator Martha Evans said the guidance struck a chord during anti-bullying week, ""when we are shining a light on needing to celebrate what makes us all different and equal"". ""Schools haveduties under law,externalto ensure they do not discriminate against a pupil or prospective pupil by treating them less favourably because of their gender or sexual orientation.

"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Offering a British-Iranian mother in prison in Iran diplomatic protection is ""one of the options"" being considered in the case, Downing Street has said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and accused of trying to overthrow the regime there - a charge she denies. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has criticised the UK's response and said it could offer diplomatic protection. Number 10 said it was working to find the ""most beneficial"" course of action. In a phone call, Mr Ratcliffe asked Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to consider diplomatic protection for his wife, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national. Taking such a measure would effectively escalate the case from an individual consular matter to a formal legal dispute between Britain and Iran, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. Asked about the possibility, Downing Street said it was an option, adding: ""I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."" The government ""will look"" at Mr Ratcliffe's comments ""very closely"" and decide the ""best course of action to secure her release"", the Number 10 spokesman added. Medical concern for Briton held in Iran Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' 'My wife's been punished without crime' Mr Johnson and fellow cabinet minister Michael Gove have been accused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. The foreign secretary told MPs last week that he believed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching in Iran before she was arrested, while Mr Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran. Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Asked about the government's official position, Downing Street said: ""The government's position on this is clear. She was there on holiday. It wasn't for any other purpose. ""The foreign secretary reiterated that in his conversation with the Iranian foreign minister last week."" The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""from the outset"" and was treating it as ""a priority"". She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Read more from James Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office followingremarks made by Mr Gove. He said Mr Johnson ""did promise to consider whether she'll be eligible for diplomatic protection"" which ""gives a different push"" to what the government can do for his wife. ""I'm reassured that it is the position of the government,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. Asked about his conversation with Mr Ratcliffe, Mr Johnson told the BBC Foreign Office officials were working ""very, very hard"" on the case. ""On Iran - and on consular cases generally - they are all very sensitive and I think the key thing to understand is that we are working very, very hard and intensively and impartially on all those cases,"" he added. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016. The full details of the allegations against her have never been made fully public. But speaking in Westminster on 1 November, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict her own account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and Mr Johnson's remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears that her five-year sentence could be extended. Labour have since called for the foreign secretary's resignation, but Mr Ratcliffe has said he believes it is not in his wife's interests for anyone to resign. The UK government's policy fordual British nationals arrested abroad,external, is that UK authorities ""won't get involved if someone's arrested in a country for which they hold a valid passport, unless there's a special humanitarian reason to do so"". Iran, however, does not recognise dual nationality, and so does not allow consular assistance from the foreign office or the British embassy. Should Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe be granted diplomatic protection, the UK government could make representations at a political and diplomatic level instead. Mr Ratcliffe says a call for his wife's release from the United Nations last month had not been endorsed by government. In October, JosÃ© Antonio Guevara BermÃºdez, chair-rapporteur of the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Ms Asma Jahangir, special rapporteur on human rights for Iran, called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's immediate release. She had been ""deprived of her liberty"",they said,external. ""The UK didn't endorse that call,"" Mr Ratcliffe said.  ""It hasn't ever acknowledged a violation of her rights, which I find staggering."" But he still hopes his family will be reunited by the end of the year. ""I think the best chance Nazanin has of coming home this side of Christmas is all of the weight of the Foreign Office and the foreign secretary being focused on doing that,"" he said.

"Jun Kimura (left) and Ian McCann (centre) made the underwater discovery shortly before their air was due to run out A team of underwater archaeologists believe they have found a cannonball from a Spanish ship that sank in a storm off Japan in 1609. The San Francisco was travelling from the Philippines to Mexico when it sank. The galleon was believed to be carrying valuable trade goods which could be worth millions today, researchers say. Its location has been a mystery - but the suspected cannonball, thought to be the first artefact ever found from the ship, offers clues about where it sank. Dr Jun Kimura from Tokai University has been leading a team of maritime archaeologists, who have been searching for the San Francisco in waters off Iwawada in Chiba prefecture. Read more about shipwrecks in Asia:The Wreck Detectives The cannonball was discovered by Ian McCann, an Australian researcher at the University of New England, during a deep dive nearly 40m (131 ft) below the surface. ""We were in dark, murky waters,"" Dr Kimura told the BBC. ""Ian just saw an unusual shape on the sandy bed - he recovered it but then we had to go back to the surface as our air had nearly run out."" He said the team, and archaeological experts they had consulted, were ""almost certain"" it was a cannonball from the San Francisco, as it was similar to cannonballs found in other Spanish trading ships in the Philippines. However, they will be carrying out a chemical analysis to confirm this. The object was discovered during an underwater archaeological survey Mr McCann told the BBC: ""A cannonball may not sound like much but it indicates the general vicinity where the vessel went down. ""It is the only Spanish Manila galleon that has not been plundered by treasure hunters,"" he added, and the trading vessels ""carried fabulously valuable cargo... by today's value the cargo may have had a value of around $80m"". Mr McCann made the discovery earlier this month - and the find was revealed in Japanese media late last week. The project, which is funded by the Japanese government, is the first scientific mission to search for the San Francisco shipwreck. Researchers also found a piece of timber underwater, which they believe is related to the shipwreck. They plan to conduct further expeditions in the area in early 2018. The San Francisco shipwreck was of ""historical importance"", because it ""impacted the relationship between Spain, the Philippines, Mexico and Japan,"" Dr Kimura said. The vessel had been transporting goods from the Philippines to Mexico - both were Spanish colonies at the time. Among its passengers was the governor of the Philippines Don Rodrigo de Vivero Velasco. On 30 September 1609, a storm drove the boat into reefs off Chiba province. According to experts, Mr Velasco, who survived the sinking, detailed the incident in a book, writing: ""The ship was getting destroyed in pieces among some cliffs on the head of Japan... all of us survivors were over the riggings and ropes, because the galleon was getting broken piece by piece."" The team worked in conditions with poor visibility Hundreds of people survived the shipwreck, and, thanks to Mr Velasco's good relations with the Japanese, were treated well. Eventually, they successfully sailed back to Mexico, with a number of Japanese representatives, on the first western-style ship ever built in Japan. ""They were the first Japanese ever to cross the pacific,"" Dr Kimura said. ""The Spanish king highly appreciated what Japan had done for the survivors, so diplomatic exchanges between Japan and Spain started."" Reporting by the BBC's Helier Cheung.

"This video can not be played Police have urged the public to surrender unwanted firearms People in England and Wales have two weeks to hand in guns, other weapons and ammunition to police stations without being punished for possession. People who surrender firearms will not automatically be charged, but will be if they are later connected to a crime. Police say many firearms are held in ignorance of their illegality. The parents of 18-year-oldYusuf Sonko, who was shot dead in Liverpoolon 2 June, have called on people to hand in any firearms. Papa and Kajdijah Sonko spoke to BBC Breakfast about finding out that their son had been killed. Mr Sonko said he was ""a bright boy who had finished his last exam to go to university"", and was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"". Kajdijah Sonko pleaded with anyone who owns a gun to give it into police. She added: ""Every single day another family is crying."" This video can not be played Yusuf Sonka's grieving parents urge people to hand over their weapons The National Ballistics Intelligence Service said that families sometimes do not know what to do with firearms left behind by elderly relatives. Assistant Chief Constable Helen McMillan said police were ""realistic"" that they were ""not going to get hardened gang members"" surrendering their arms. But she added: ""This is part of our response to try and make it as difficult as possible for those people to come into possession of any type of weapon at all. ""You don't have to give your name or address, we just want more guns out of harm's way."" Reality Check: Is crime up or down? Illegally-held BB-guns, air weapons, rifles, shotguns or pistols are among the weapons police say should be handed in by the 26 November cut-off. Police think some people come across weapons when clearing the houses of relatives and may not know what to do with them. Ms McMillan said: ""It could be a trophy of war, it could be a starting pistol - please contact us on 101 and arrange to hand it in to your nearest police station."" She added: ""Each firearm we retrieve has the potential to save a life so do the right thing and surrender your weapon."" After the last gun surrender in England and Wales in 2014, more than 6,000 weapons were handed in. Detective Chief Superintendent Jo Chilton, said: ""Surrendering unwanted or illegal firearms avoids the risk of them becoming involved in crime."" Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that crime involving firearms in England and Wales increased by 27% in the year to June 2017.

"A lack of devolution at Stormont means the budget will be passed into law using Westminister legislation Northern Ireland's budget for 2017/18 has been published and shows an increase in health spending of 5.4%. The bill has gone through the House of Commons, backed by all parties without a vote. It will go to the House of Lords on Tuesday. NI Secretary James Brokenshire said that public services would begin to run out of money if a budget was not in place by the end of November. Stormont deadlock: what you need to know Sticking points in power-sharing talks He said he regretted having to bring a budget to Westminster but was hopeful an executive could be formed. Northern Ireland has been without a Stormont executive for 10 months. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the passing of budget legislation ""should not be a barrier to to negotiations to continue, but the ongoing lack of agreement has had tangible consequences for people and public services in Northern Ireland"". Faced by DUP calls for the immediate appointment of direct-rule ministers, the secretary of state said: ""That is a step that I do not intend to take while there is an opportunity for an executive to be formed."" He continued: ""This measure I am taking today with the utmost reluctance and only because there is no other option available."" It comes afterthe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in failed to reach a deal in political talks. Overall, the amount of money available for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, meaning no real increase when inflation is considered. Analysis: Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI business correspondent Better late than never, Northern Ireland finally has a budget for the 2017-18 financial year. It means a cliff-edge of running out of cash has been avoided. Civil servants have been controlling the finances since the executive collapsed before a budget was set. Overall, the allocation for day-to-day spending is up by 3.2%, or about Â£330m, on 2016-17. However, because of inflation, the budget has really flat-lined in real terms. The budget does not include any of the Â£1bn windfall that the DUP extracted for propping up the Conservative government; that is to come separately. InApril, indicative figures suggestedthe education budget would be cut, causing an outcry from teachers and parents. However, the education budget is up by 1.5% compared to last year, the justice budget is down by 0.4% and the agriculture and environment budget is down by 3%. Health economists usually estimate that health service spending needs to rise by an annual rate of 3% - 5% to cope with rising demand. The Department of Finance has cautioned that the budget is not fully comparable to the 2016/17 budget, due to timing differences. The 2016/17 budget was published before the start of the financial year while this budget comes mid-year and includes in-year reallocations. Analysis: Mark Devenport, BBC News NI political editor Is this direct rule or not direct rule? It depends who you talk to. The SDLP says it is direct rule, and blames the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Alliance party says it is a ""slippery slope"" towards direct rule, but both James Brokenshire and Theresa May dismiss that. Mr Brokenshire is fearful of ""full-fat"" direct rule because it would be very hard to get back out of it. He might, therefore, try and get away with this halfway house solution, at least until the end of the year. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds welcomed the budget move as the ""right thing"" to do in the absence of a deal to restore devolution. He said the decision by the secretary of state is ""not full blown direct rule"". The North Belfast MP also said that if a deal is not forthcoming to restore devolution, direct rule ministers of  ""some ilk will have to be appointed"". He said the failure to restore power sharing rests with Sinn FÃ©in and that the DUP and other parties were ready to set up an executive ""in the morning"". He added that the Â£1bn promised by the government for Northern Ireland as part of theTory-DUP confidence and supply arrangement would be ""detailed in the coming days"". NI Secretary James Brokenshire said a budget is needed in the absence of a devolved government However, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader said the reason for the budget was ""DUP opposition to a rights-based society"". Michelle O'Neill said that the UK government had been ""complicit in this, backing the DUP's refusal to honour the commitments previously made and blocking the delivery of equality."" She also said her party had told Prime Minister Theresa May that direct rule was ""not an option"". ""These issues aren't going away. It is now the responsibility of the two governments to look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and for a British-Irish intergovernmental conference to meet as soon as possible. ""We have sought urgent meetings with both the taoiseach [Irish prime minister] and the British prime minister. ""The way forward now is for the two governments to fulfil their responsibility as co-guarantors of the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements, to honour outstanding commitments, and to deliver rights enjoyed by everyone else on these islands to people here."" Mr Brokenshire has said he would be willing to withdraw the budget bill if an executive is formed before December. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was a ""significant day"" with ""decisions being taken in London which should have been taken in Belfast"". ""This is British direct rule, delivered by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in,"" he added. Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken said: ""We need to have executive ministers in place in January at the absolute latest because we need to get policy decisions made so we can shape the 18-19 budget for everybody in Northern Ireland - if we don't do that we're in real danger."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the budget ""doesn't redirect money to where it's needed now, it simply disperses the money on the basis of decisions that were taken by the last executive and that's now quite considerably out of date"".

"This video can not be played The CBI chief says business wants the UK and Europe to speed up Brexit negotiations European and UK business leaders have told Prime Minister Theresa May of their Brexit concerns. At a meeting in Downing Street on Monday, representatives from groups including the CBI and BusinessEurope pressed for a transitional deal that preserves the status quo after Brexit. The CBI chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, said all those at the meeting reiterated the damage ""no deal"" would do to trade. A German lobby group also warned that no deal would cost their economy dear. The head of the German chambers of commerce, Martin Wansleben, told a newspaper the car industry alone would face annual tariffs of more than â¬2bn if trade between the UK and the EU falls under World Trade Organisation rules. Brexit: All you need to know How are the talks really progressing? Barnier: UK has 'two weeks' to clarify issues Emma Marcegaglia, president of BusinessEurope, said: ""Business is extremely concerned with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress only one month before the decisive December European Council. ""Business aims to avoid a cliff edge and therefore asks for a 'status quo-like' transitional arrangement with the UK staying in the customs union and the single market, as this will best provide citizens and businesses with greater certainty."" The business groups met Mrs May at No 10, as well as Business Secretary Greg Clark, Brexit Secretary David Davis and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay. The CBI and the Institute of Directors were represented, along with business organisations from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium. There are concerns thatfuture trade talks could collapseahead of December's EU summit. EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned that the talks will only go ahead if the UK first clarifies its financial obligations to the EU. Mr Davis has said the UK was ""ready and willing"" to engage with Brussels ""as often and as quickly as needed"". Earlier, Ms Fairbairn, CBI director-general, told the BBC a CBI survey found that 10% of companies had already activated their contingency plans. The pace of planning by firms was picking up, she added, with about 60% of companies saying they would implement contingency plans by the end of next March. Bernard Spitz, a director of Medef, France's biggest business lobby group, said agreement on a transition deal was important for both UK companies as well as those ""across the European Union"". ""We know that for us, especially for the French, the relationship with the UK is absolutely key, but if business continuity is important, what is even more important is the integrity of the European market,"" he said. Michel Barnier has warned of the possible collapse of Brexit talks Property developer Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave Means Leave, said if a trade deal appeared unlikely, ""then actually we would be better to give certainty to everybody that actually we're going to do a different type of deal which is to go to WTO [World Trade Organization rules]"". BBC business editor Simon Jack says some UK business leaders in favour of Brexit are concerned that a transition period maintaining the current arrangements will delay and frustrate Britain's attempts to strike new independent deals.

"The number of High Street shops closing down has fallen to its lowest level in seven years, research suggests. The Local Data Company, which studied the top 500 British town centres, said 2,564 outlets closed in the first half of 2017, equivalent to 14 a day. At the same time, there were 2,342 store openings, meaning that a net total of 222 High Street shops disappeared. Charity shops, women's clothes shops and shoe shops were worst hit, it said. However, general fashion stores, banks and cheque cashing shops saw their lowest number of net closures in three years. 'Portas towns' see shop closures The Rotherham High Street struggling to survive Non-food sales in slowest growth on record Some sectors actually recorded growth, with tobacconists, coffee shops and beauty salons increasing in number. Ice-cream parlours are also on the up, thanks to expansion by the Ben & Jerry's and Kaspa's chains. Mike Jervis, a retail specialist at PwC which commissioned the research, said the ""relatively low"" number of closures over the period reflected a ""more stable environment"". However, he warned: ""The environment is, of course, uncertain, with recent data showing a more challenging retail environment. I expect net store closures to be an ongoing feature of the market. ""Retailers will choose specific closure stores very carefully and will aim to capitalise on leases expiring in the ordinary course of their businesses."" The store closures were unevenly spread across the country. Scotland fared worst, with a net loss of 42 shops, while eastern England lost 34. Only two out of 11 British regions showed net gains: Yorkshire and the Humber, which added 12 shops, and the East Midlands, which now has eight more shops.

"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband tells Today he doesn't think Boris Johnson should resign Offering a British-Iranian mother in prison in Iran diplomatic protection is ""one of the options"" being considered in the case, Downing Street has said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016 and accused of trying to overthrow the regime there - a charge she denies. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has criticised the UK's response and said it could offer diplomatic protection. Number 10 said it was working to find the ""most beneficial"" course of action. In a phone call, Mr Ratcliffe asked Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to consider diplomatic protection for his wife, which under international law is a way for a state to take diplomatic action on behalf of a national. Taking such a measure would effectively escalate the case from an individual consular matter to a formal legal dispute between Britain and Iran, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. Asked about the possibility, Downing Street said it was an option, adding: ""I think what we need to look at is what will work best and what can be most beneficial in this case."" The government ""will look"" at Mr Ratcliffe's comments ""very closely"" and decide the ""best course of action to secure her release"", the Number 10 spokesman added. Medical concern for Briton held in Iran Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' 'My wife's been punished without crime' Mr Johnson and fellow cabinet minister Michael Gove have been accused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. The foreign secretary told MPs last week that he believed Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching in Iran before she was arrested, while Mr Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran. Her family have always maintained she was on holiday with her daughter. Asked about the government's official position, Downing Street said: ""The government's position on this is clear. She was there on holiday. It wasn't for any other purpose. ""The foreign secretary reiterated that in his conversation with the Iranian foreign minister last week."" The spokesman said Prime Minister Theresa May had been involved in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""from the outset"" and was treating it as ""a priority"". She had raised it with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on at least two occasions, he added. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When a British citizen is jailed overseas, they normally get basic consular help from the local embassy. This could include anything from contacting family to legal support to medical help. But if the UK were assert its diplomatic protection over a British citizen, that would change things significantly. This would be a signal that the UK is no longer treating the case as a consular matter but a formal, legal dispute between Britain and that country. That's because diplomatic protection is a mechanism under international law that a state can use to help one its nationals whose rights have been breached in another country. The broad legal principle is that British diplomats would no longer be representing the interests of a citizen but the interests of their state. Read more from James Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme earlier, Mr Ratcliffe said he had written to the Foreign Office followingremarks made by Mr Gove. He said Mr Johnson ""did promise to consider whether she'll be eligible for diplomatic protection"" which ""gives a different push"" to what the government can do for his wife. ""I'm reassured that it is the position of the government,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. Asked about his conversation with Mr Ratcliffe, Mr Johnson told the BBC Foreign Office officials were working ""very, very hard"" on the case. ""On Iran - and on consular cases generally - they are all very sensitive and I think the key thing to understand is that we are working very, very hard and intensively and impartially on all those cases,"" he added. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe - who has a three-year-old daughter, who is being cared for by family in Iran - was arrested and jailed in Iran in April 2016. The full details of the allegations against her have never been made fully public. But speaking in Westminster on 1 November, Mr Johnson appeared to contradict her own account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and Mr Johnson's remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears that her five-year sentence could be extended. Labour have since called for the foreign secretary's resignation, but Mr Ratcliffe has said he believes it is not in his wife's interests for anyone to resign. The UK government's policy fordual British nationals arrested abroad,external, is that UK authorities ""won't get involved if someone's arrested in a country for which they hold a valid passport, unless there's a special humanitarian reason to do so"". Iran, however, does not recognise dual nationality, and so does not allow consular assistance from the foreign office or the British embassy. Should Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe be granted diplomatic protection, the UK government could make representations at a political and diplomatic level instead. Mr Ratcliffe says a call for his wife's release from the United Nations last month had not been endorsed by government. In October, JosÃ© Antonio Guevara BermÃºdez, chair-rapporteur of the UN's Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and Ms Asma Jahangir, special rapporteur on human rights for Iran, called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's immediate release. She had been ""deprived of her liberty"",they said,external. ""The UK didn't endorse that call,"" Mr Ratcliffe said.  ""It hasn't ever acknowledged a violation of her rights, which I find staggering."" But he still hopes his family will be reunited by the end of the year. ""I think the best chance Nazanin has of coming home this side of Christmas is all of the weight of the Foreign Office and the foreign secretary being focused on doing that,"" he said.

"Sudden cardiac arrest is associated with sexual activity far more often in men than women, research suggests. But sex is a rare trigger for sudden cardiac arrest. Only 34 out of the 4,557 cardiac arrests examined occurred during or within one hour of sexual intercourse and 32 of those affected were men. Sumeet Chugh, of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, said his study is the first to evaluate sexual activity as a potential trigger of cardiac arrest. The research was presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association. A cardiac arrest happens when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating.  It causes someone to fall unconscious and stop breathing and unless treated with CPR, it is fatal. This differs from a heart attack, where blood flow to the heart is blocked. It is known that sexual activity can trigger heart attacks, but the link with cardiac arrest was previously unknown. Almost 90% of people who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests die Every minute without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or defibrillation reduces someone's survival chances by 10% CPR, especially if performed in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, can double or triple a person's chance of survival During CPR, you should push on the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute. The beat of the Bees Gees' hit Stayin' Alive is a perfect match for this Source: American Heart Association Dr Chugh and his colleagues in California examined hospital records on cases of cardiac arrest in adults between 2002 and 2015 in Portland, Oregon. Sexual activity was associated in fewer than 1% of the cases. The vast majority were male and were more likely to be middle-aged, African-American and have a history of cardiovascular disease. The study also found CPR was performed in only one-third of the cases, despite them being witnessed by a partner. Mum saves daughter's life with CPR after cardiac arrest Lisburn teen saves mum after cardiac arrest 'I had a cardiac arrest at my sister's wedding' Pop star tells pupils how CPR saved his life after cardiac arrest Dr Chugh said: ""These findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to educate the public on the importance of bystander CPR for sudden cardiac arrest, irrespective of the circumstance."" He said it shows the need for people to be educated abouthow to administer CPR.,external Another study,externalpresented at the conference showed children as young as six can learn it. After a heart attack or surgery, the British Heart Foundation suggests patients should typically wait four to six weeks before resuming sexual activity.

"The march was led by Tarana Burke, who started the #MeToo hashtag (centre) Hundreds of people have marched in Hollywood in support of victims of sexual assault and harassment, inspired by the #MeToo social media campaign. The march follows a torrent of assault and harassment allegations against public figures, set off by revelations about the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. The marchers started on Hollywood Boulevard and walked along the ""Walk of Fame"" to CNN's headquarters. They were predominantly women but many men attended. Tara McNamarra, 21, of Los Angeles, told Reuters news agency that the march felt cleansing after years of not being taken seriously about abuse. ""I've been sexually assaulted multiple times throughout my life,"" she said. ""It's affected me in every aspect of my life."" Marchers hold placards on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Sunday The #MeToo hashtag was first used by social activist Tarana Burke and popularised by actress Alyssa Milano in the wake of the Weinstein allegations. Ms Burke led Sunday's march. ""For every Harvey Weinstein, there's a hundred more men in the neighborhood who are doing the exact same thing,"" she wrote on Facebook ahead of the event. ""What we're seeing, at least for now, is a unity of survivors, a community of survivors that have grown out of this #MeToo viral moment, that I'm just hoping and praying that we can sustain."" How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories How the scandal unfolded Louis CK admits sexual misconduct allegations The actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Louis CK are among the high-profile figures accused of sexual harassment over the past few weeks. Louis CK published an apologyon Friday, admitting after years of denials that the allegations were true. ""The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly,"" he wrote. The New York Times reported in October that Weinstein, 65, had settled out of court with eight women who had accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact. Weinstein has also been accused of rape, but said through a spokesperson that he ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex.

Mr Thompson told the BBC the cloudy atmospheres of the two planets made them appear bright to the naked eye. He said the event was not uncommon - Venus and Jupiter appeared together in 2015 and 2016, also on 13 November - but it was much rarer for them to appear so close to each other. ""There have certainly been cases where they've been close in the sky but they've not been this close in recent years, certainly the last couple of planetary conjunctions. ""This is actually quite a good conjunction because they're so close, and over the next few years they'll pass each other and be close but not this closeâ¦ ""One as close as this, you're probably looking decades rather than years."" The conjunction can also be seen in countries in the mid-northern latitudes, including parts of the US. Those who missed the event will be able to see the two planets again on Tuesday morning, but they will not be as close together.

"Anita had just turned eight, the minimum age for racing An eight-year-old girl has died after crashing her junior drag racing car on a track in Western Australia. Anita Board was on a solo ""test run"" when her vehicle hit a concrete barrier at the Perth Motorplex, police said. Paramedics treated her at the scene on Saturday before taking her to hospital, where she died a day later. The girl had been attempting to gain her licence for junior dragster racing, the Australia National Drag Racing Association (Andra) said. She had just turned eight - the minimum age required to race under official rules - and was driving a 210cc dragster, local media reported. As a result of the accident, Western Australia has now suspended junior racing at the Perth Motorplex, the state's only drag racing arena. A statement from Sport and Recreation Minister Mick Murray said: ""The suspension of this category of motorsport activity allows for a full investigation to be carried out into the nature of the accident. ""The State Government will wait until the details of the accident are clear following the investigation before taking any further action"". Drag racers across Australia have posted tributes on social media Mr Murray told reporters that he was unaware that children as young as Anita Board could take part in drag racing. ""I was very surprised... but in saying that, from my understanding, it was well controlled but an unfortunate accident,"" he said. The girl's father, Ian Board, posted a message online saying ""my heart [is] in a million pieces"". ""We will need ... the love and support in the days weeks months ahead,"" he wrote in local community forum. Members of the drag racing community have posted tributes online, including under the hashtag #HelmetsOutForAnita. Andra said in a statement: ""Anita was undergoing a licensing pass at the Perth Motorplex, as part of the process for her to receive her racing licence, when this tragic accident happened. ""Junior racers must adhere to stringent safety rules and regulations regarding safety equipment, and their dragsters must meet specific safety requirements. ANDRA regulations for junior competition are benchmarked against similar organisations internationally."" Mike Sprlyan, of Junior Dragster Australia, told news outletPerth Now,externalthat beginners aged between eight and 17 reached top speeds of about 40-50km/h (25-30mph).

"The number of High Street shops closing down has fallen to its lowest level in seven years, research suggests. The Local Data Company, which studied the top 500 British town centres, said 2,564 outlets closed in the first half of 2017, equivalent to 14 a day. At the same time, there were 2,342 store openings, meaning that a net total of 222 High Street shops disappeared. Charity shops, women's clothes shops and shoe shops were worst hit, it said. However, general fashion stores, banks and cheque cashing shops saw their lowest number of net closures in three years. 'Portas towns' see shop closures The Rotherham High Street struggling to survive Non-food sales in slowest growth on record Some sectors actually recorded growth, with tobacconists, coffee shops and beauty salons increasing in number. Ice-cream parlours are also on the up, thanks to expansion by the Ben & Jerry's and Kaspa's chains. Mike Jervis, a retail specialist at PwC which commissioned the research, said the ""relatively low"" number of closures over the period reflected a ""more stable environment"". However, he warned: ""The environment is, of course, uncertain, with recent data showing a more challenging retail environment. I expect net store closures to be an ongoing feature of the market. ""Retailers will choose specific closure stores very carefully and will aim to capitalise on leases expiring in the ordinary course of their businesses."" The store closures were unevenly spread across the country. Scotland fared worst, with a net loss of 42 shops, while eastern England lost 34. Only two out of 11 British regions showed net gains: Yorkshire and the Humber, which added 12 shops, and the East Midlands, which now has eight more shops.

"Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini. The revolution put an end to the rule of the Shah, who had alienated powerful religious, political and popular forces with a programme of modernisation and Westernisation, coupled with heavy repression of dissent. Iran was one of the greatest empires of the ancient world, and has long maintained a distinct cultural identity by retaining its own language and adhering to the Shia interpretation of Islam. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Supreme Leader: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei The Supreme Leader - the highest power in the land - appoints the heads of the judiciary, military and media. He also confirms the election of the president. Ali Khamenei was appointed for life in June 1989, succeeding Ayatollah Khomeini. He previously served two consecutive terms as president in the 1980s. President: Masoud Pezeshkian Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian was elected as Iran president in July 2024, beating his hardline conservative rival Saeed Jalili. He won 53.3% of the more than 30 million votes while Mr Jalili polled at 44.3% in the second round run-off. The run-off came after no candidate secured a majority in the first round of the election, which saw a historically low voter turnout of 40%. The election was called after Iran's previous president Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in May, in which seven others also died. Dr Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and member of the Iranian parliament, has been critical of Iran's notorious morality police and caused a stir after promising ""unity and cohesion"", as well as an end to Iran's ""isolation"" from the world. He has also called for ""constructive negotiations"" with Western powers over a renewal of the faltering 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for an easing of Western sanctions. The president is the top elected official and second in rank to the supreme leader. He is responsible for the day-to-day running of the government and has significant influence over domestic policy and foreign affairs. However, his powers are relatively limited - especially in security matters. The president's interior ministry runs the national police force. However, its commander was appointed by the supreme leader and is answerable directly to him. The same is true of the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij. The president's powers can also be checked by parliament, which introduces new laws. In turn, the Guardian Council - which contains close allies of the supreme leader - has the job of approving new laws and can veto them.

"Sudden cardiac arrest is associated with sexual activity far more often in men than women, research suggests. But sex is a rare trigger for sudden cardiac arrest. Only 34 out of the 4,557 cardiac arrests examined occurred during or within one hour of sexual intercourse and 32 of those affected were men. Sumeet Chugh, of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, said his study is the first to evaluate sexual activity as a potential trigger of cardiac arrest. The research was presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association. A cardiac arrest happens when the heart malfunctions and suddenly stops beating.  It causes someone to fall unconscious and stop breathing and unless treated with CPR, it is fatal. This differs from a heart attack, where blood flow to the heart is blocked. It is known that sexual activity can trigger heart attacks, but the link with cardiac arrest was previously unknown. Almost 90% of people who suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrests die Every minute without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or defibrillation reduces someone's survival chances by 10% CPR, especially if performed in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, can double or triple a person's chance of survival During CPR, you should push on the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.

"Iraq, home to some of the earliest known civilisations, has been a battleground for competing forces since the US-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The mainly Shia-led governments that have held power since have struggled to maintain order, and the country has enjoyed only brief periods of respite from high levels of sectarian violence. Instability and sabotage have hindered efforts to rebuild an economy shattered by decades of conflict and sanctions, even though Iraq has the world's second-largest reserves of crude oil.

He can serve a maximum of two four-year terms in the largely ceremonial post. He is opposed to the normalization of diplomatic relations with Turkey as long as there continue to be border violations. Under an informal agreement between political parties, the presidency is reserved for Kurds, the premiership for Shia Arabs, and the post of speaker of parliament for Sunni Arabs. Prime minister: Mohammed Shia al-Sudani Mohammed Shia al-Sudani  became prime minister in October 2022 after more than a year of political paralysis, though critics say he is struggling to deliver on his promises. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal in 2023, he  defended the presence of United States troops in his country, saying they were needed to hep Iraq's security forces defeat ISIS. This contradicts the stance of several Iran-aligned groups that in part make up the Shia-dominated Coordination Framework, the political bloc that nominated him as prime minister. There are hundreds of publications and scores of radio and TV stations. But political and security crises have resulted in an increasingly fractured media scene.

"Anita had just turned eight, the minimum age for racing An eight-year-old girl has died after crashing her junior drag racing car on a track in Western Australia. Anita Board was on a solo ""test run"" when her vehicle hit a concrete barrier at the Perth Motorplex, police said. Paramedics treated her at the scene on Saturday before taking her to hospital, where she died a day later. The girl had been attempting to gain her licence for junior dragster racing, the Australia National Drag Racing Association (Andra) said. She had just turned eight - the minimum age required to race under official rules - and was driving a 210cc dragster, local media reported. As a result of the accident, Western Australia has now suspended junior racing at the Perth Motorplex, the state's only drag racing arena. A statement from Sport and Recreation Minister Mick Murray said: ""The suspension of this category of motorsport activity allows for a full investigation to be carried out into the nature of the accident. ""The State Government will wait until the details of the accident are clear following the investigation before taking any further action"". Drag racers across Australia have posted tributes on social media Mr Murray told reporters that he was unaware that children as young as Anita Board could take part in drag racing. ""I was very surprised... but in saying that, from my understanding, it was well controlled but an unfortunate accident,"" he said. The girl's father, Ian Board, posted a message online saying ""my heart [is] in a million pieces"". ""We will need ... the love and support in the days weeks months ahead,"" he wrote in local community forum. Members of the drag racing community have posted tributes online, including under the hashtag #HelmetsOutForAnita. Andra said in a statement: ""Anita was undergoing a licensing pass at the Perth Motorplex, as part of the process for her to receive her racing licence, when this tragic accident happened. ""Junior racers must adhere to stringent safety rules and regulations regarding safety equipment, and their dragsters must meet specific safety requirements. ANDRA regulations for junior competition are benchmarked against similar organisations internationally."" Mike Sprlyan, of Junior Dragster Australia, told news outletPerth Now,externalthat beginners aged between eight and 17 reached top speeds of about 40-50km/h (25-30mph).

"Most of the deaths were reported in Iran's Kermanshah province A 7.3-magnitude earthquake has shaken the northern border region between Iran and Iraq, killing at least 396 people and injuring thousands more. More than 7,000 people are also said to have been injured in the quake, the world's deadliest this year. Most of those who died were in Iran's western Kermanshah province, where a search for survivors has started. Nine more people died in Iraq, where residents fled from their homes into the streets in the capital, Baghdad. ""I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,"" a Baghdad resident, Majida Ameer, told Reuters news agency. ""I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: 'Earthquake!'"" Latest images of aftermath The world's deadliest earthquakes In the latest updates from Iran: State news agency Irna quoted an emergency official as saying 6,603 people were injured in Iran alone Most of the victims were in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, about 15km (10 miles) from the border, emergency services chief Pir Hossein Koolivand said The town's main hospital was severely damaged, leaving it struggling to treat hundreds of wounded, state TV reported A woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble in the town, Iranian media said One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter after the quake. Many homes in the predominantly Kurdish mountainous area are made of mud bricks and are vulnerable in quakes as large as Sunday's. This video can not be played A Kurdish TV channel was live on air during the earthquake In Sarpol-e Zahab, a city of about 85,000 people, the sides of a number of tall buildings collapsed, forcing many people to spend the night outdoors in freezing conditions. Rescue teams were being hampered by landslides, emergency workers said. The quake hit at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km south-west of Halabja, near the north-eastern border with Iran,the US Geological Survey (USGS) said,external. About 1.8 million people live within 100km of the epicentre, the UN estimates. On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan in the Kurdistan Region. ""The situation there is very critical,"" Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters news agency. Is it possible to predict a quake? Yaseen Abbas of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society told the BBC that 425 people had been wounded in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, where Turkey has already delivered aid. The BBC's Rami Ruhayem, in the regional capital Irbil, said shaking there had lasted for more than a minute. ""For a few seconds at first it was barely detectable, I wasn't sure whether it was a minor tremor or just my imagination,"" he said. ""But soon enough it was unmistakable as the building started swaying from side to side."" This huge rock fell from a mountain in Darbandikhan, Iraq The earthquake struck at a relatively shallow depth of 23.2 km, and tremors were felt in Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake destroyed the historic city of Bam in south-east Iran, killing 26,000 people. Sunday's quake is the deadliest to hit Iran since 2012. But it is only the sixth earthquake of magnitude-7.0 or more in 2017 -there were 16 last year and 19 the year before,external. Analysis by Jonathan Amos, BBC Science Correspondent Iran is one of those regions of the world that is all too familiar with quakes, and has experienced some very big tremors in the past. In general terms, the big driver here is the clash between the Arabia and Eurasia tectonic plates. The former is pushing north by a couple of centimetres a year. In the south-east of the country, the Arabia plate is actually pushing under the Eurasia plate, but in the north-west these great slabs rub directly against each other. The Zagros mountains are a result of all this compression. Early reports indicate the quake occurred on a thrust fault. This means the crust on one side of the break in the rocks is moved vertically up and over the other side - which fits exactly with this general picture. Geological agencies now produce immediate bulletins on the likely expected casualties. This modelling work is based on factors such as the size of the quake, population density and what is known about local construction methods. It's inexact work, but the first bulletins suggested this event could produce many hundreds of deaths and perhaps thousands of injured individuals. Are you in the area?

"Michel Barnier says ""everyone needs to plan"" for the possible collapse of Brexit negotiations The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he is planning for the possible collapse of Brexit negotiations with the UK. Mr Barnier was talking to French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche,externaldays after giving the UK a two-week deadline to clarify key issues. Failing to reach an agreement was not his preferred option, he stressed. The UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis has said it is time for both sides ""to work to find solutions"". On Friday, Mr Davis insisted good progress was being made across the board, and that the negotiations had narrowed to a ""few outstanding, albeit important, issues"". How are the talks really progressing? All you need to know about Brexit Barnier: The EU's point man on Brexit negotiations Discussing the likelihood of the talks collapsing, Mr Barnier said: ""It's not my option, but it's a possibility. Everyone needs to plan for it, member states and businesses alike. We too are preparing for it technically. ""A failure of the negotiations would have consequences on multiple domains."" Mr Barnier has asked the UK to clarify its stance on its financial obligations to the EUif future trade talks are to go ahead in December. But Mr Davis has made conflicting remarks, suggesting the UK would not have to give a figure for a financial settlement before it could move on to talks about a future trading relationship. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, he said: ""In every negotiation, each side tries to control the timetable. The real deadline on this is, of course, December."" Mr Davis was referring to the next EU summit which will take place in Brussels in December. This video can not be played David Davis says there cannot be a new border within the UK He said British taxpayers ""would not want me to just come along and just give away billions of pounds"". He added: ""We've been very, very careful, and it's taking time and we will take our time to get to the right answer."" His comments followed a sixth round of talks between Mr Davis and Mr Barnier in Brussels.

"Four in ten Ford cars sold in the UK rely on financing supplied by Ford's financing arm. Ford Credit Europe is essentially a bank offering loans to car buyers, and like other banks relies on its ability to operate throughout Europe on the UK's membership of the EU and the so-called ""passport"" to operate throughout the bloc. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said the UK is aiming for a ""bespoke"" deal for banks and the finance sector in the EU. If that did happen Ford would be able to keep its current structure offering finance across Europe from its base in the UK. Ford Credit Europe recently opened a new headquarters in Manchester, serving eleven markets across Europe. Buried in written submissions to the Business Energy and Industrial Skills Select committee - released today - is the following from Ford: ""A loss of access to the single market would also affect our UK-headquartered captive finance arm, Ford Credit Europe. ""This currently operates a branch network across the single market on the basis of an EU Capital Requirements Directive passport for the provision of banking services. ""Outside the EU and the EEA, FCE as a UK-regulated bank will lose access to the passporting regime as currently designed. ""FCE's sole purpose is to finance the sale of Ford motor vehicles and Ford cannot afford any kind of disruption to FCE's continuity of financing."" The car industry has already been very clear that it would be super sensitive to any introduction of tariffs on cars or components as it relies on the frictionless, just-in-time delivery of components from around the EU. In fact, cars produced in the UK are 25% to 42% ""made"" of UK components (it differs from manufacturer to manufacturer). Once outside the EU, the UK would fail current ""rules of origin"" tests required to strike new trade deals with third parties - even those with whom we currently have deals by virtue of our membership of the EU. In its own submissions, Honda makes it clear that any introduction the tariffs applicable in a no-deal scenario would render vehicle production in the UK ""uncompetitive"" thanks to additional costs (4.5% on components, 10% on finished vehicles) that Honda says it cannot afford to absorb. Car manufacturing executives have already been in to see the Chancellor and the Prime Minister in the last two weeks to press the urgency of their case. They will face MPs on the BEIS Select Committee on Tuesday, and on this written evidence, will have plenty to say about the clear and present danger to UK car manufacturing if a preferential trade deal with the EU is not agreed.

"Current Brexit negotiations resemble ""a prime-time soap opera"", the president of the CBI will say on Monday. Paul Drechsler will tell the lobby group's annual conference it is time for government and business to unite behind ""a clear strategy"". This new approach is needed to protect the UK's economy, he will say. Research conducted by the CBI suggests 60% of firms will trigger contingency plans by the end of March 2018, if no transition deal is agreed by then. ""We need a single, clear strategy, a plan for what we want, and what kind of relationship we seek with the EU,"" Mr Drechsler is set to say. ""At the moment, I'm reminded of a prime-time soap opera, with a different episode each week. First Lancaster House, then Article 50, the European Council, two dinners with Juncker - and no doubt many exciting instalments to follow,"" he will say. ""Each one becomes the Big Story, until the next one rolls around."" Mark Carney: 'UK growth slower without Brexit deal' The UK economy will grow more slowly in the short term if no deal for a future trade agreement with the EU is reached, the Bank of England governor has said. In an ITV interview he was asked if the economy would be adversely affected if there was no Brexit deal. ""The short answer is yes, in the short term... In the short term, without question, if we have materially less access (to the EU) than we have now, this economy is going to need to re-orient and during that period of time it will weigh on growth,"" he said. A third of firms will have begun to implement contingency plans by the end of January, if there is no further certainty before then. Business representatives have repeatedly called for faster progress and more clarity over what will happen in March 2019 when the UK is due to formally leave the European Union. The government has proposed a transition or ""implementation"" period to allow businesses to adjust to new trading conditions, but the terms and length of the adjustment period have yet to be decided. Last month five business groups, including the CBI, wrote to the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, to warn that the UK risks losing jobs and investment unless a transition deal is agreed by the end of the year. However, formal discussions on transition arrangements and future trade relations cannot begin before the UK and the EU reach an agreement over a financial settlement. A survey of CBI members suggests that 13% of companies have not yet discussed Brexit at board level; those firms ""need to roll up their sleeves"" according to the CBI. Brexit studies details 'will be published' Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU The CBI said smaller businesses are ""struggling"" and are less prepared than larger firms. One in ten firms have already begun to move staff or slow recruitment as they await the outcome of Brexit negotiations, the CBI said. The lobby group warned that the ""clock is ticking"", with Brexit 508 days away. Mr Drechsler will also emphasise the need for government and business to focus on improving productivity in the UK, which lags significantly behind US, France and Germany. He will call for the apprenticeship levy, introduced earlier this year to encourage large businesses to take on more apprentices, to be made more flexible, and for more investment in schools, including protection for ""per pupil"" funding.

"Current Brexit negotiations resemble ""a prime-time soap opera"", the president of the CBI will say on Monday. Paul Drechsler will tell the lobby group's annual conference it is time for government and business to unite behind ""a clear strategy"". This new approach is needed to protect the UK's economy, he will say. Research conducted by the CBI suggests 60% of firms will trigger contingency plans by the end of March 2018, if no transition deal is agreed by then. ""We need a single, clear strategy, a plan for what we want, and what kind of relationship we seek with the EU,"" Mr Drechsler is set to say. ""At the moment, I'm reminded of a prime-time soap opera, with a different episode each week. First Lancaster House, then Article 50, the European Council, two dinners with Juncker - and no doubt many exciting instalments to follow,"" he will say. ""Each one becomes the Big Story, until the next one rolls around."" Mark Carney: 'UK growth slower without Brexit deal' The UK economy will grow more slowly in the short term if no deal for a future trade agreement with the EU is reached, the Bank of England governor has said. In an ITV interview he was asked if the economy would be adversely affected if there was no Brexit deal. ""The short answer is yes, in the short term... In the short term, without question, if we have materially less access (to the EU) than we have now, this economy is going to need to re-orient and during that period of time it will weigh on growth,"" he said. A third of firms will have begun to implement contingency plans by the end of January, if there is no further certainty before then. Business representatives have repeatedly called for faster progress and more clarity over what will happen in March 2019 when the UK is due to formally leave the European Union. The government has proposed a transition or ""implementation"" period to allow businesses to adjust to new trading conditions, but the terms and length of the adjustment period have yet to be decided. Last month five business groups, including the CBI, wrote to the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, to warn that the UK risks losing jobs and investment unless a transition deal is agreed by the end of the year. However, formal discussions on transition arrangements and future trade relations cannot begin before the UK and the EU reach an agreement over a financial settlement. A survey of CBI members suggests that 13% of companies have not yet discussed Brexit at board level; those firms ""need to roll up their sleeves"" according to the CBI. Brexit studies details 'will be published' Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time Countdown to Brexit: How to divide food sold to the EU The CBI said smaller businesses are ""struggling"" and are less prepared than larger firms. One in ten firms have already begun to move staff or slow recruitment as they await the outcome of Brexit negotiations, the CBI said. The lobby group warned that the ""clock is ticking"", with Brexit 508 days away. Mr Drechsler will also emphasise the need for government and business to focus on improving productivity in the UK, which lags significantly behind US, France and Germany. He will call for the apprenticeship levy, introduced earlier this year to encourage large businesses to take on more apprentices, to be made more flexible, and for more investment in schools, including protection for ""per pupil"" funding.

"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband said ""she was just a mum on holiday"" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman being held in Iran, has seen a specialist after finding lumps in her breasts, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe also expressed concern that his wife appeared to be ""on the verge of a nervous breakdown"". She was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016, accused of trying to overthrow the regime, which she denies. Cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have beenaccused of bungling the UK's handling of the case. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family have issued a statement about her condition, saying she had been ""complaining of sharp stabbing pains in her breasts"" for more than a year. They said she had been given a mammogram by the prison's gynaecologist, which gave an inconclusive result. After insisting on seeing an outside specialist, the family said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was then taken to hospital for an ultrasound on Saturday. They said although the doctor thought the lumps were likely to be benign, he did note her family having a history of breast cancer. She was given anti-inflammatory medication and vitamin pills and was to be seen by the specialist again next week to see whether there was any improvement or whether she might need surgery, the family said. Boris Johnson sorry if remarks 'caused anxiety' Mother caught in Iran power struggle 'My wife's been punished without crime' The full details of the allegations against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe have never been made fully public. She maintains the purpose of her trip to Iran was to visit family and for her daughter to meet her grandparents but speaking in Westminster on 1 November, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared to contradict her account when he wrongly said she had been training journalists there. Four days later, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was recalled to court in Iran and his remark cited as evidence against her, prompting fears her five-year sentence could be extended. However, her family say there have been no developments on new charges against her since her court appearance. Her lawyer also says he has not been contacted by the Iranian judiciary. In the statement her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, describes his earlier phone conversation with Mr Johnson and says the minister is trying to find time to meet him ""in the next few days"". This video can not be played Michael Gove says Richard Ratcliffe was the person who would know what his wife was doing in Iran It came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he did not know what Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been doing in Iran when she was arrested. He later said he would ""take her husband's assurance"" that she was on holiday. Amid calls for his resignation over the matter, the foreign secretary earlier this week clarified that the UK government had ""no doubt"" that a holiday was the sole purpose of her visit to Iran. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had been angered by Mr Johnson's initial remarks and Iranian media coverage of her case. But he restated his belief that it was not in Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's interests for anyone to resign.
