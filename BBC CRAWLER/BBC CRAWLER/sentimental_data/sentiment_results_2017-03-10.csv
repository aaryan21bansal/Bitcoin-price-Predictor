"Watson and Konta had never played each other on the WTA Tour before British number one Johanna Konta beat her compatriot Heather Watson 6-4 6-4 to reach the third round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. Konta, ranked 11th to Watson's 108th, struggled for rhythm in the first set but dominated the second to lead 5-1. Watson served nine double faults before fighting back but Konta came through. In the men's event,Kyle Edmundbeat Portugal's Gastao Elias 6-1 6-3 to set up a second-round meeting with world number two Novak Djokovic. British number threeDan Evansregistered a 6-1 6-1 win over Germany's Dustin Brown in just 53 minutes. He will face Kei Nishikori, ranked fifth in the world, in the second round on Sunday while Konta goes on to face Caroline Garcia in round three.. Murray has work to do in 2017 ""It was definitely a brilliant experience for both of us as Fed Cup team-mates and I am very happy to have come through it,"" said Konta, who was playing her first match in a month after a foot injury. It was the first meeting on the WTA Tour between Britain's two leading women. Their only previous contest was at a second-tier tournament in Barnstaple in 2013 when Watson retired after losing the first four games. Watson broke serve first but then gifted the advantage back as she made three double faults in the third game. With both players making errors, the pair traded serves again before Konta, who received a bye in the first round, struck the decisive blow by winning the ninth game. She went on to hold her serve to love to take the first set. Konta won eight points without reply at the start of the second set and looked on course for a quick victory. Watson, who threw her racquet in frustration after making three more double faults in the sixth game, found herself 5-1 down before she rallied. Konta served two double faults in the seventh game and won only two points as Watson, 24, won three consecutive games. But the 11th seed composed herself to seal her place in the next round after 94 minutes.

"This video can not be played 'Farrell ran into my dog' - Jones jokes with journalists Six Nations Championship: England v Scotland Venue:Twickenham StadiumDate:Saturday, 11 MarchKick-off:16:00 GMT Coverage:Live on BBC Radio 5 live & BBC Radio Scotland, plus live text commentary via the BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app Owen Farrell remains a doubt for England's Six Nations encounter with Scotland after missing training at Twickenham on Friday. The centre, 25, did not take part after sustaining a leg knock on Thursday. ""He's pretty resilient. He will do the right thing by the team and by his body,"" assistant coach Paul Gustard told BBC 5 live. England have until an hour before kick-off to finalise their side for Saturday's Calcutta Cup game. Do slow starters England have a problem? Watson the sole change in Scotland XV Who makes Jeremy Guscott's Six Nations wrecking crew? Listen: Dawson v English - Six Nations mind games? Podcast: Can Scotland win at Twickenham? If Farrell does not make it, Gustard says Ben Te'o will start at inside centre with Jonny May coming on to the bench. ""It will be a loss, of course, but we are very happy with the strengths Ben can bring,"" Gustard added. ""We are very happy with the 23 we will have on the pitch. ""We have flexibility, Jack Nowell is there who can come into the centre. Elliot Daly can come in to 13. So we will be very happy."" Victory for England over Scotland would give the defending Six Nations champions a record-equalling 18th consecutive win and put them one win away from a second straight Grand Slam. If England beat Scotland on Saturday they will retain the title Victory for Scotland could send them top of the table with a game to play If France beat Italy and England lose, mathematically five teams would still be in with a shout There is one final round of games after Saturday's matches However, regardless of their winning run, head coach Jones was in prickly mood in Thursday's news conference. ""I can't speak for how Eddie is,"" Gustard said on Friday. ""The staff and players are excited. We are just confident. That's not to sound bullish.

"The Right Reverend Philip North exposed a wound in the Church of England when he announced the withdrawal of his nomination to become Bishop of Sheffield, referring to ""the highly individualised nature of the attacks upon him"". More than 20 years after the first female ordinations, senior figures in the Church now face another struggle to reconcile those who believe women cannot be priests and those who think traditionalists are unacceptably sexist. The Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu, has urged Anglicans to ""disagree Christianly"". Another bishop blamed the row on an ""intolerant"" faction in the Church, and warned ""we're all in trouble"" if there was no future in the Church for traditionalist Catholics such as Mr North. The dispute that led to Philip North turning down the Sheffield job began in an Oxford cafe one morning in early February, when the chaplain of Trinity College, the Reverend Emma Percy, was given a copy of a Christian magazine with a proud history but a small circulation. The general synod is the deliberative and legislative body of the Church of England New Directions is written and read by traditionalist Anglo-Catholic members of the Church of England: the sort of Anglicans who are referred to colloquially as ""high church"". An article explained how some Church of England priests were starting to be issued with identity cards, to show they were members of a traditionalist Anglican institution named The Society Under the Patronage of St Wilfrid and St Hilda. Members of The Society, to use its shorter name, do not accept the ministry of women priests - or male priests ordained by female bishops. Soon afterwards, one of the most influential voices on the liberal wing of the Church of England, the Very Reverend Prof Martyn Percy - who happens to be Emma Percy's husband -quoted the article in an attack on Mr North's views,external. The Society, of which Mr North is a leading member, was guilty of ""rather fogeyish sacralised sexism"", said Prof Percy. He said: ""Bishop North needs to be able to give his unequivocal support and affirmation to his male and female clergy alike. It can't be a partial and conditional affirmation, based on gender."" Prof Percy followed a Sheffield vicar, the Reverend Sue Hammersley, in urging Mr North not to accept his nomination. She told BBC Look North: ""I think the very fact that he won't ordain women himself has the potential to give out a really negative message - that somehow the Church of England is a discriminatory organisation."" The Labour MP for Sheffield Heeley, Louise Haigh,also wrote an open letter to Mr North,externalin which she said attitudes to women in the Church were a ""major priority for our next bishop"". Bishop Philip North has rejected his nomination She wrote: ""Your traditionalist views pose many questions about how your leadership in Sheffield will work practically in relation to existing women clergy, men who have been ordained by women, women who are in the process of becoming clergy and congregations who come from a completely different tradition within the Church."" Three days later, an evening statementpublished on the prime minister's website,externalconfirmed that Mr North, who is the Bishop of Burnley, would not be promoted to become Bishop of Sheffield. All of this was supposed to have been avoided in 2014 when the Church's governing general synod reached the end of a long process of deciding that women could be bishops. It agreed ""five guiding principles"", allowing traditionalists who opposed women priests to remain in ""the highest possible degree of communion"" and to ""mutually flourish"". After Mr North's U-turn, which he said had followed ""highly individualised attacks"" on him, the Archbishop of York said there had been little sign of that commitment to mutual flourishing. ""What has happened to Bishop Philip clearly does not reflect the settlement under which, two and a half years ago, the Church of England joyfully and decisively opened up all orders of ministry to men and women,"" he said. The Most Reverend John Sentamu: ""Disagree Christianly"" Archbishop Sentamu was not alone in criticising the opponents of Philip North. The Bishop of Willesden, Pete Broadbent, tweeted: ""This is what the Church of England will be like if the intolerant exclusive 'inclusives' winâ¦ if there is no future for the Catholics, we're all in deep trouble."" Serenhedd James, a historian and columnist for the Church Times, said: ""For anyone, anywhere, to be subject of a public bullying campaign of such a personal nature is unacceptable. For it to happen within the Church, and be orchestrated by leading members of the clergy, is wicked. ""And for it to result in one of the most gentle, kind, talented, compassionate, committed, and honourable priests in the C of E being driven out of a post in which his God-given gifts are needed now more than ever is, frankly, diabolical."" At the other end of the Anglican spectrum, the conservative evangelical Bishop of Maidstone, Rod Thomas, said he was ""deeply saddened"" and described the move as ""a body blow to the concept of 'mutual flourishing' which lay at the heart of the agreement to introduce women bishops in the Church of England."" Long, well-intended discussions about principles of conduct appear to have evaporated in the heat of a controversial nomination. Despite a high-profile campaign in favour of Mr North by high-ranking male and female clergy, there is little talk of good disagreement or mutual flourishing. While there seems to be embarrassment rather than triumphalism among opponents of Bishop Philip North's appointment, the campaign group  Sheffield Action on Ministry Equality said many would now enter a period of mourning. ""We also sense an invitation from God for all of us in the Church of England to take responsibility for our part in a process that has caused such pain for so many people,"" saida statement on the group's website,external. ""We pray for Bishop Philip that he may fully recover from an ordeal we believe he should never have had to face."" The Archbishops of York and Canterbury now have to find a way to reunite a Church that is divided over women's ordination as well as sexuality.

"This video can not be played The 19 year old who runs away from ambulances Among the pack of runners one moment, collapsed on the ground and frothing at the mouth the next. For a short time she is lost to the convulsion and then she scrambles to her feet and sprints away. Katie Cooke will not let epilepsy get in the way of a race. The 19-year-old student from Cherrywood, South Dublin, has what her specialist doctor calls the ""Arsenal of epilepsy"" and contends with up to 15 convulsions a day which render her unconscious. ""Your whole body is shaking, you can feel your muscles jumping, it feels like everything has been sucked out of you, you can't breathe,"" she says. ""Every single day you lose control."" Despite having to cope with multiple seizures when she runs, Cooke has won prestigious events including her age group in the Dublin City Marathon and she runs 5km in under 17 minutes. She can often be seen pounding the streets with her running partner, Dr Colin Doherty, who also happens to be her consultant neurologist. But she wasn't always so athletic. Diagnosed at the age of nine with frontal lobe epilepsy, she managed her condition with medication until it deteriorated when puberty hit and her hormones started ""kicking up"". ""I wasn't able to get out of bed. I wasn't able to do anything for myself and couldn't really speak. My Mum was dressing me and showering me,"" she says. Cooke was admitted to Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin where she remained for 10 months. Despite being involved in numerous medical trials she regressed, lost control of her back and hips, and by the time she was discharged she wasn't able to walk. ""I couldn't hold myself up and was in a wheelchair for about seven months but being a very stubborn person I wanted to prove to people what I could do. ""After a lot of physio I started jogging every day and I started to absolutely love the freedom."" Cooke now runs every day and says a missed session sees the tiredness and dizziness of her earlier condition return. But running only alleviates her symptoms, it hasn't been a cure. The raised heart rate brought on by running triggers more seizures than if she didn't run, but Cooke says it improves her general well-being which is a negative worth accepting. Her neurologist, Dr Doherty, has also weighed up the pros and cons from a medical perspective. ""There are particular challenges with having epilepsy and long-distance running, but if you're walking you have those challenges too and I think the general benefits outweigh these risks,"" he says. ""If you took the average long-distance runner and measured all their health parameters against somebody who doesn't run you would find, no matter what disease or disorder they carried with them, they're better off."" If you have a health condition and are thinking about starting to exercise it is always important to consult your doctor first. The brain consists of about three billion cells and all of these cells are active, but they don't fire together - the brain is a de-synchronised machine. The signature of epilepsy is that the cells fire together in a synchronised way. If a million cells fire together that causes a change in behaviour but when all three billion cells fire together you've got a convulsion or a fit. There are about 40 distinct types of epilepsy. In some cases people will just stare blankly, others will wander around in a confused state and there are those who fall to the ground with convulsions. Competitive running was initially a non-starter for Cooke. As soon as she had a convulsion during a race paramedics would withdraw her from the event, but a chance comment at one of her consultations led Doherty to offer himself up as her running partner and he has kept her on track ever since. He says: ""I'm a specialist in epilepsy but my sole role when running with Katie is to stop people from taking her off in an ambulance. I just stand there and say 'Katie's fine, I'm her doctor, she's going to recover'."" Despite Cooke having so many seizures, the nature of her epilepsy means her body doesn't require any recovery time and she is able to immediately get up and run again. Doherty suspects it is her fitness levels which help with that recovery. Listen to theBBC Ouch talk-showto find out more about Katie Cooke, Dr Colin Doherty and their running partnership. ""Katie is a very serious runner, she trains properly. I'm very confident that this is a really positive experience for her,"" he says. As well as sport and college, Cooke also has to navigate a social life and a relationship with boyfriend Jack, a role most daunting at night when Cooke's seizure's make her scream, thrash around and cause the bed to shake and shudder. Cooke says: ""He's one of the most chilled people I know and he sleeps through my seizures which is a bit weird. He wakes up for the odd one because some are quite violent, and I've slapped him in the face before, but he just falls asleep again."" In terms of intimacy Cooke says sex doesn't trigger seizures, although a fit can occur at such times, and women often report an increase in convulsions around the time of ovulation and their period. Her night-time seizures can also be accompanied by hallucinations of a shadowy man who she says ""comes for me"" and it is these which leave her most exhausted. ""I don't sleep at all,"" she says. Her education suffered and she missed the majority of secondary school. Despite that, she managed to cram three years worth of curriculum for the Irish Leaving Certificate into one year and secured a place at college to study sports management. Doherty calls her a ""remarkable young woman"" for all she has achieved while handling so many severe convulsions on a daily basis. While for most people, watching Katie drop to the floor mid-run would be alarming Doherty believes being so public about it will help others with the condition. ""We need to facilitate people to live as normal life as possible and they need to be encouraged to do everything,"" he says. ""The biggest barrier is not the safety issue but the perceptions of other people."" For more Disability News, follow onTwitter,externalandFacebook,external, and subscribe to theweekly podcast.

"Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, said on Friday that BT had agreed to ""legally separate"" Openreach - the division that owns and operates the UK's broadband network. But what will this mean for consumers - particularly those who are suffering from slow broadband - or none at all? Rival telecoms companies have long argued that Openreach - the firm providing most of the UK's broadband infrastructure - should not be part of the same group as BT, which has a third of the country's broadband market. The likes of Sky and TalkTalk say this structure has been bad for competition and consumers. Ofcom agreed - as did the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. To avoid a protracted legal battle, BT has now fallen into line. The jury is still out. BT will still control Openreach's budget, even though the newly separated company will have its own boss and decide how to spend its cash. Really fast broadband requires running fibre optic cable into every home, which is very expensive. As a result, most UK broadband connections still rely on the elderly copper wires used for telephone calls. Andrew Ferguson, of the news website ThinkBroadband, said it is unclear whether separating BT and Openreach will deliver this faster option. Most observers agree that the split alone will not solve the UK's broadband problems. Slow and non-existent broadband is still an issue in some rural areas and Openreach has been criticised for its failure to address the issue. However, very few other operators appear willing to fix the problem, which is expensive and technically challenging. You have a broadband fault but it is taking weeks to fix. Sound familiar? Critics say Openreach just failed to provide adequate levels of customer service because complaints come through a customer's internet service provider, giving it no incentive to undertake repairs more quickly. Gavin Patterson, BT chief executive, admitted on Friday that Openreach's service has ""not been where it needed to be"" and said the separation would improve the situation. It remains to be seen how long that will take to deliver - and to remove the BT logo from thousands of BT white vans.

"It's been 20 years since Buffy The Vampire Slayer first hit our TV screens. It has fans all over the world, and made a star of its lead actress Sarah Michelle Gellar. A TV series based on a not-great movie about a Californian teenager who attends high school by day and fights vampires by night, seems an unlikely candidate to be a serious contender to become a TV classic and hugely influential piece of popular culture. But Buffy managed it and after close to 150 episodes - with its final outing airing in 2003 - its influence is still felt today as a truly ground breaking piece of work. Here are some of the things that Buffy has given the world of entertainment. Sarah Michelle Gellar became a household name after starring in the cult show In TV and film it's all too common for female characters to be the love interest or the support to a male lead. Buffy successfully put a woman at the centre of the series, and led the way for characters like The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen, The Force Awakens' Rey, Homeland's Carrie Mathison, and so many more. This was a trademark feature of Buffy - one example, after a gruesome multiple murder at a college fraternity house, a demon approvingly comments: ""It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue."" Series ranging from Gilmore Girls to Family Guy gleefully use dialogue in a similar, although less gruesome, way. Joss Whedon (far right) with the cast of The Avengers in 2010 Buffy's show runner is now one of the biggest names in Hollywood. Two of the films in the Top 10 highest grossing of all time were directed by him - Marvel's The Avengers and its sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron. Both took over $1.5bn (Â£1.23bn) and he also had a role overseeing other successful Marvel films. And it all started with the experience he got writing and directing Buffy. When writer/producer Russell T Davies re-launched Doctor Who in 2005, he changed its format to one that was similar in many ways to Buffy. The episodes in each series lead up to a climax where the main threat has been bubbling under the surface for several episodes. Once More, With Feeling saw the Buffy cast spontaneously burst into song Without Buffy's brilliant musical episode Once More, With Feeling would Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's movie ever have been green-lit? Actually, yes, it would have been. But if you enjoyed the singing dancing love letter to LA which didn't win best film at this year's Oscars, you could do worse than to check out Buffy's musical extravaganza. It's exactly like La La Land, but with added demons. It also set a trend for other TV shows to unexpectedly feature a musical episode halfway through a series, including medical comedy Scrubs and medical drama Grey's Anatomy - and an upcoming Supergirl/The Flash crossover.

"As anyone who has ever eaten a really hot chilli will testify, they can cause a lot of pain. Chillies come in many shapes, colours, sizes and strengths, but one thing they have in common is the burning sensation they cause in your mouth, eyes and any other part of your body into which their juices come into contact. Although most people think that the hottest part of a chilli is its seeds, in fact it is the white spongy layer you find inside, called the placenta. Bite into this and you will really feel the burn. That burning sensation is mainly caused by a chemical called capsaicin, which is found in tiny glands in the chilli's placenta. When you eat a chilli, the capsaicin is released into your saliva and then binds on to TRPV1 receptors in your mouth and tongue. The receptors are actually there to detect the sensation of scalding heat. Capsaicin makes your mouth feel as if it is on fire because the capsaicin molecule happens to fit the receptors perfectly. When this happens it triggers these receptors, which send a signal to your brain, fooling it into thinking that your mouth is literally burning. Is the chilli pepper friend or foe? Can you hurt yourself eating chilli peppers? The reason why wild chilli plants first started to produce capsaicin was to try and protect themselves from being eaten by mammals like you. From an evolutionary perspective the plant would much rather have its seeds dispersed far and wide by birds. Oddly enough birds, unlike mammals, don't have TRPV1 receptors, so they do not experience any burn. So producing capsaicin turned out to be the ideal way to deter mammals from eating the plant while encouraging birds to do so. But then along came an ape with a giant frontal cortex who somehow learnt to love the burn. Humans have learned to love the burn of chillies Humans are not only not deterred by capsaicin, most of us positively love it. So what's going on? The ferocity of a chilli pepper is measured in something called Scoville heat units (SHU). A relatively mild chilli, like the Dutch Long chilli, is only 500, but by the time you move on to the Naga chilli, which is one of the hottest in the world, you are biting into something with a Scoville score of more than 1.3m units. The current world record holder for hotness, however, is theCarolina Reaper,first bred in Rock Hill, South Carolina. According to tests carried out by the University of Winthrop in South Carolina it scores an impressive 1.57m SHUs So, what happens when you bite into a really hot chill? As part of the new BBC2 seriesThe Secrets of Your Food,botanist James Wong and I entered a chilli eating competition. Within minutes of eating my first chilli, my eyes began to water and my pulse shot up. My body had responded to an initial burst of severe pain by releasing adrenaline. This not only made my heart beat faster, but it also made my pupils dilate. Every round the chillies got hotter and both of us soon dropped out. Had we been able to tolerate biting into some really hot chillies, it's possible we would have experienced a ""chilli endorphin high"". Chilli seeds are dispersed by birds that eat them Endorphins are natural opiates, painkillers which are sometimes released in response to the chilli's sting. Like opiates they are said to induce a pervasive sense of happiness. It is a form of thrill-seeking - feeding our brains' desire for stimulation. Although it is not something I have personally ever experienced, I have certainly heard it described by hard core chilli eaters.. But beyond the pain and the perverse pleasures, are there any health benefits to eating chillies? Perhaps. Ina recent study,externaldone by researchers from the University of Vermont they looked at data from more than 16,000 Americans who had filled in food questionnaires over an average of 18.9 years. During that time nearly 5,000 of them had died. What they found was that those who ate a lot of red hot chillies were 13% less likely to die during that period than those who did not. This supports the finding of another recent study, carried out in China, that came to similar conclusions. So why might eating chillies be good for you? The researchers speculate that it could be that capsaicin is helping increase blood flow, or even altering the mix of your gut bacteria in a helpful direction. Whatever the reason, it adds to my pleasure as I sprinkle chilli on my omelette in the morning. The Secrets of Your Food continues on BBC2 at 2100GMT on Friday 10th March .

"You probably won't get to the end of this article. Everyone knows our attention spans are getting shorter. It's just obvious. Or is it? In the always-connected world of social media, smartphones andhyperlinks,externalin the middle of everything you read, it can feel that much harder to stay focused. And there are statistics too. They say that the average attention span is down from 12 seconds in the year 2000 to eight seconds now. That is less than the nine-second attention span of your average goldfish. You might have seen those stats inTime magazine,external, theTelegraph,external, theGuardian,external,USA Today,external, theNew York Times,externalor theNational Post,external. Maybe you heard a Harvard academic citing them onUS radio,external. Or perhaps you read the management bookBrief,external. But if you pay a bit more attention to where the statistics come from, the picture is much less clear. More or Lessis on the BBC World Service on Fridays. You canlisten online, subscribe to theprogramme podcastand follow the teamon Twitter,external All those references lead back to a 2015 report by the Consumer Insights team of Microsoft Canada, who surveyed 2,000 Canadians and also studied the brain activity of 112 people as they carried out various tasks. However, the figure that everyone picked up on - about our shrinking attention spans - did not actually come from Microsoft's research. It appears in the report, but with a citation for another source called Statistic Brain. A quick Google and it is easy to find where they got it from. The Statistic Brain website looks pretty trustworthy too. It even says they ""love numbers, their purity, and what they represent"" - just the kind of people with whom we, at More or Less, can get along. As if to prove it, the number-lovers at Statistic Brain source all their figures. But the sources are infuriatingly vague. And when I contact the listed sources - the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, and the Associated Press - neither can find any record of research that backs up the stats. My attempts to contact Statistic Brain came to nothing too. I have spoken to various people who dedicate their working lives to studying human attention and they have no idea where the numbers come from either. In fact, they think the idea that attention spans are getting shorter is plain wrong. ""I don't think that's true at all,"" says Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychology lecturer at the Open University. ""Simply because I don't think that that's something that psychologists or people interested in attention would try and measure and quantify in that way."" Dr Briggs has done extensive research on how dual tasking affects attention spans - such as when drivers use their phones She studies attention in drivers and witnesses to crime and says the idea of an ""average attention span"" is pretty meaningless. ""It's very much task-dependent. How much attention we apply to a task will vary depending on what the task demand is."" There are some studies out there that look at specific tasks, like listening to a lecture. But the idea that there's a typical length of time for which people can pay attention to even that one task has also been debunked. ""How we apply our attention to different tasks depends very much about what the individual brings to that situation,"" explains Dr Briggs. ""We've got a wealth of information in our heads about what normally happens in given situations, what we can expect. And those expectations and our experience directly mould what we see and how we process information in any given time."" Some also suggest that evidence of ever-shorter shot lengths in films shows attention spans are dwindling. But the academic behind that research says all it shows is that film-makers have got better at trying to grab our attention. There's something else fishy about those attention span statistics too. It turns out that there is no evidence that goldfish - or fish in general - have particularly short attention spans or memories, despite what popular culture suggests. Have smartphone users and goldfish had their attention spans unfairly maligned? I spoke to Prof Felicity Huntingford, who has spent almost half a century studying fish behaviour and just delivered a series of public lectures under the title, How Smart Are Fish? ""Goldfish can perform all the kinds of learning that have been described for mammals and birds,"" she says. ""And they've become a model system for studying the process of learning and the process of memory formation, exactly because they have a memory and because they learn."" She says there have been literally hundreds of scientific papers over the decades on goldfish learning and memory. I found a reference to a study on fish memory as early as 1908. ""That a species that's used by neuro-psychologists and scientists as a model for studying memory formation should be the very species that has this reputation - I think that's an interesting irony,"" she says. So goldfish don't have short attention spans or memories. There is no evidence human attentions spans are shrinking.

"North Korea has ramped up its missile testing in recent months ""Rogue nation"". The ""greatest immediate threat"". North Korea has been called many things, few of them complimentary. The government has been accused of brutally oppressing citizens while ruthlessly pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. In the past year it held its fifth nuclear test, launched several missiles and - most believe - assassinated its leader's half-brother using a chemical weapon. Most recently, it has conducted its first test of what it claims is an inter-continental ballistic missile, a move that - if verified - increases the threat it can pose to its enemies and ratchets up international tensions. But why is North Korea such a problem - and why can no solution be found? The US and the Soviets divided Korea into two at the end of World War Two. Reunification talks failed and by 1948 there were two separate governments. The 1950-53 Korean War entrenched the split. North Korea's first leader was Kim Il-sung, a communist who presided over a one-party state, and the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. It remains one of the world's poorest nations. Its economy is centrally controlled, its citizens have no access to external media and, apart from a privileged few, no freedom to leave. Most worryingly, it has conductedfive nuclearand multiplemissile teststhat demonstrate progress towards its ultimate goal of building a nuclear missile. Is Kim Jong-un (centre) waiting until he can negotiate from a position of greater strength? There have been several rounds. The most recent, involving China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the US, initially looked promising. Pyongyang agreed to give up its nuclear work in return for aid and political concessions. It went as far asblowing up the cooling tower,externalat its plutonium production facility at Yongbyon. But then things faltered. The US said North Korea was failing to disclose the full extent of its nuclear work. Pyongyang denied this, but then conducted a nuclear test. So, since 2009, there have been no meaningful discussions. John Nilsson-Wright, senior fellow for north-east Asia at think-tank Chatham House, says that North Korea, judging from its recent provocations, is not interested in negotiating at the moment. ""This is because Kim is determined to push forward on military modernisation, so rationally it is in his interests to delay."" The UN and several nations already have sanctions in place against North Korea, targeting its weapons programme and financial ability to function abroad. Meanwhile food aid to North Korea - which relies on donations to feed its people - has fallen in recent years as tensions have risen. But these measures do not seem to be slowing down North Korea's ability to move forward on the military front. China is widely seen as the nation most able to impose economic pain on North Korea. Experts say targeting the intermediaries that keep North Korea moving - like Chinese banks - would make a real impact, as would targeting the oil that Pyongyang imports from China. This is some movement on this. AReuters report in late June,external, citing unidentified sources, said China's state oil giant had suspended sales to Pyongyang, though it suggested the decision was commercial. The US, meanwhile, hasimposed sanctions on a Chinese bankaccused of laundering North Korean money. But the key problem is that China does not want to take actions that would destabilise the government in North Korea and potentially unleash chaos on its border. So, John Nilsson-Wright says, China has been trying to play the role of honest broker, lobbying the US to talk to Pyongyang. But the US, Japan and South Korea have made it very clear that the North must show a real willingness to compromise before talks become an option. North Korean coal exports have been targeted - but the government shows no signs of collapse Not a good one. It is generally thought that military action against North Korea would lead to very high military and civilian casualties. Finding and eliminating North Korea's nuclear stockpile would be hard - experts suspect assets are buried deep underground. Moreover the North is heavily armed, with an arsenal of missiles putting Seoul (and beyond) in range, chemical and biological weapons, and about one million troops. ""The risk is that it provokes a counterattack that is massively costly to South Korea,"" says Dr Nilsson-Wright. In the past South Korea has talked overtly about a ""decapitation"" strategy - a targeted attack to remove Kim Jong-un and his leadership. This could be a tactic to deter North Korea from further provocations or to force it back to the negotiating table, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. The strong view in Seoul, he says, is that the only way to get the North back to the negotiating table is to make the government feel so insecure that it feels it has no choice. There are also big questions around who might fill the vacuum if a ""decapitation"" went ahead. The elite have a vested interest in the survival of the Kim government and there is no political opposition. Both Koreas have firepower and troops ready for any conflict For a while some thought that the way to bring North Korea into the international community was to help it open up gradually, through small economic reforms, using the model of China's transformation after the death of Mao Zedong There were signs Kim Jong-il - the leader's late father - may have been interested in this approach, as he made several trips to Chinese industrial zones. The key supporter of this, however, was thought to be Chang Song-thaek, the leader's uncle. But Kim Jong-un hadhim executed in December 2013, calling him a traitor who planned to overthrow the state. Kim Jong-un has not yet visited China - in fact, he has not visited any foreign country since becoming leader in 2011. And while he has talked of economic growth, the military programme appears to be his priority. This is very unlikely. One-party rule is absolute in North Korea. Citizens are encouraged to worship the Kim dynasty, which is portrayed as the only institution keeping them safe from external aggression. There are no independent media. All TV, radio and newspapers are state-controlled and North Korea has created its own internet so citizens have no electronic access to the outside world. There is a limited flow of information across the Chinese border, including DVDs which are smuggled in. But in general North Korea exercises very tight control over its citizens. The government has informants everywhere looking for signs of dissent andpenalties are severe.Offenders (and sometimes their whole families) can be sent to labour camps where many die. The state controls what North Koreans can and cannot watch, hear and read There needs to be a mixture of pressure and dialogue, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. Pressure, he suggests, could involve some combination of enhanced sanctions, the relisting of North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (it was removed from the list in 2008), and close work with China to inflict real pain. Possible incentives could include formal diplomatic recognition by the US or a peace treaty (the two Koreas remain technically at war). Key to this approach would be co-ordination between the US, China, South Korea and Japan. But there are problems. After initial apparent warmth, ties between the Trump administration and Beijing seem to be cooling. In June US President Donald Trump tweeted that China's approach to North Korea had ""not worked out"". Ties between Japan, South Korea and China remain fractious over historical issues. Beijing is also fiercely opposed to thedeployment by the US of a Thaad missile defence systemin South Korea. In Seoul, new liberal President Moon Jae-in must walk a fine line balancing the interests of his electorate, biggest military ally and powerful neighbour. So there are divisions to exploit. ""That is why North Korea is pushing it now - it knows it has a window on which to capitalise,"" Dr Nilsson-Wright argues.

"This video can not be played A leader who acts more like a mentor than a dictator is more effective, research suggests. When you're at work, do you behave in the same way as you do when you're at home? Or do you have a work persona - a duller, more subdued version of your real self? Of course there are certain behaviours, such as swearing, or nudity, for example, that aren't acceptable in any workplace, but having a toned down version of yourself could be no good for you or your company. ""Zombies"", is how Elisa Steele, chief executive of tech firm Jive Software refers to such people. She says that companies that don't try to encourage staff to express themselves at work, and instead try to force them to fit into some kind of corporate clone - doing what they're told to do without questioning - will lose out. Staff literally won't want to stay, and as a result turnover will be high, says Ms Steele. At Jive, the firm uses its own software, which aims to improve the way employees communicate and collaborate on projects internally, to help new staff settle in and feel more at home quickly. ""They feel the culture because they have complete access to the whole company the first day they start,"" says Ms Steele. ""What are people doing? How is corporate communicating? What's the CEO up to today? What projects are prioritised?"" After their first week, the new joiners are required to write a blog on how they've found it so far, an article that all staff can then read. Jive chief executive Elisa Steele says bosses that work closely with their staff create more productive workforces ""Time and time again we hear... 'I know so much more about this company in a week - and our customers - than I knew at my other company, you know, in three months',"" she says. As far as Ms Steele is concerned, enabling staff to have close access to herself and what she's doing day to day means they've got a good understanding of what the firm itself is aiming to do, and she says this information helps them feel more connected. ""Those two connections make the work really matter, and then people are engaged, and then drive a more efficient and more productive workforce,"" she says. Ms Steele's approach is not that unusual for a tech start-up, which tend to shy away from a defined hierarchy. Arguably, it's also a leadership style that works well in smaller firms, but would be harder for a large company to emulate. Yet increasingly research suggests that a leader who is closer to their staff, acting more like a mentor than a dictator, is the best way to get results. ""For a long time, the accepted wisdom has been that the CEO controlled everything in the company. The organisation served them, not the other way around,"" says chief executive coach and author Steve Tappin. ""Today, that's all changed. Good bosses are learning to support those around them."" It marks a start contrast to the stereotypical image of a distant and dictatorial chief executive. Overworked, exhausted staff without a good work life balance won't create a successful business in the end, says Dr Jim Doty Dr Jim Doty, the founder and director of The Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at Stanford University School of Medicine, says the shift reflects a growing amount of research suggesting that an authoritarian boss creates an anxious and stressed workforce. He suggests that leading in a more collaborative, inclusive way instead could pose a solution to the puzzling productivity crisis, which has seen output per hour decrease considerably in most developed countries from the US to the UK in recent years. ""When you are not in a place of threat or fear, your productivity actually increases,"" he says. While studies are limited, those that have been carried out, show that firms with a more nurturing environment lead to a stronger performance, and for listed firms, a higher stock market price. ""What we know now through science is that when leaders create an organisation that gives the individual a sense of meaning and purpose, this in and of itself is one of the greatest drivers of results,"" says Dr Doty. Ultimately, he says, company leaders need to get across to staff that they're not just a cog in a machine, but that ""there's an interest in who you are, instead of ''we can replace you at any time if you don't do exactly what we say'"". The problem is that company boards often fail to recognise this, and hire domineering personalities because they believe this is what will drive a strong performance, says Dr Doty. ""When an organisation actually understands  that exhausted employees are not actually that productive, when they understand that people need breaks, when they're looking at the whole picture in terms of a work life balance, that's what I believe results in the greatest success."" Klarna chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski says it can take a while for staff to adapt to a less dictatorial boss Sebastian Siemiatkowski, co founder and chief executive of Swedish start-up Klarna, which provides payment systems for online shopping, says ideally a boss should take a back seat, pushing staff to solve problems themselves. He admits that this approach can frustrate, with staff annoyed at the lack of guidance, but he says that over time it will enable people to develop and demonstrate their own particular skills. ""If you're very comfortable in the team, and you really trust each other, you can allow each other to take leadership positions for different topics,"" says Mr Siemiatkowski. ""But it's very hard to reach that. I  know... "" Yet while such an approach may be tough and require those at the top to swallow their ego, it can pay off. Ms Steele gives the example of one of its customers: a chief information officer (CIO) of a large firm. The company had hired a lot of so called millennials - those born between 1980 and 1999. The CIO spent two years frustrated that they weren't listening to him on how to protect the firm's data, and refused to acknowledge his experience and expertise in this area. Eventually he gave in, agreeing to listen to why the new staff didn't want to use the software system and why they were unhappy. ""And when he did that it opened an entirely new world of how the company could perform, and they're incredibly successful,"" says Ms Steele.

"Geri Horner: ""The '90s were like the '60s, very free and full of colour"" It's 20 years since Geri Horner (then Halliwell) strode onto the Brits stage in her Union Jack dress in one of the defining images of the 1990s. To mark the anniversary, the singer is hosting a BBC Two documentary on the decade, looking at her own journey from Turkish game show host to globe-straddling, Nelson Mandela-cuddling pop phenomenon. It's called Geri's 1990s: My Drive to Freedom - referring to the 1967 open-topped sports car she bought with her first ""fat pay cheque"" from Virgin Records. Ahead of the broadcast this Saturday, the star sat down with BBC News to reflect on the decade that changed her life. Along the way, she reveals the creative tensions that split up the Spice Girls, her time as a Turkish TV show hostess, and why she named her newborn son after George Michael. This video can not be played Geri Horner recalls her first Spice Girls pay cheque What struck you most about the 1990s while making the documentary? It was a really good reminder of how much influence that decade had on my life. It was brilliant in every way - musically, culturally, politically. There was so much colour and creativity. Britain felt like the centre of the universe at that moment. You turned 18 in 1990, and almost immediately had surgery to remove a lump in your breast... Yes, I had a little scare. [The lump turned out not to be cancerous,external] That's not something most teenagers have to confront. How did it change your life? Did it make you more ambitious? I think it was something else that put the petrol in my tank. I was always ambitious, but my dad died when I was quite young. He'd always been very encouraging of my career, and when he died not only did I experience the loss of a parent, but also my own mortality. You suddenly think: ""Oh God, life's here and you've just got to go for it"". That, for me, was a defining moment. The Spice Girls stole the show at the 1997 Brit Awards For the next couple of years, you tried your hand at modelling and TV presenting. Were you just looking for the best way to get a break? Two things happened: I went back to college to study English Literature - but to subsidise that, I had to take lots of little jobs. One of them, I was agame show hostess in Turkey,external. The show was a bit like The Price is Right, and I would go to Turkey and do that. I had all these random jobs, but what they ultimately were for, was to fund me going into the studio. I remember the guy said it would cost Â£300 to get my demo tape together. I'd written one song myself and the other was a cover of the songA Lover's Holiday,external. What was your song called? It was called Live to Love. It was pretty crap. You auditioned for the Spice Girls after answering a newspaper advert. How many times had you been through that process? Oh, I'd tried loads and loads of different things. All sorts of random stuff. And there were some dodgy things, believe me. The band got huge very quickly. It's amazing to think that the period between Wannabe and you leaving wasn't even two years. What's your memory of that period? When you're in the middle of it, you just sort of get on with it. I liked being part of a group. The camaraderie. It was a lot of fun. It got quite hysterical - the paparazzi, the screaming fans, the constant tabloid stories. Was fame what you had dreamt it would be? What you think about something and what it turns out to be is never going to be quite the same. Some bits are better, some bits are not. But it was a very happy, fun, full-on experience. This video can not be played Geri says Girl Power was 'more palatable' than feminism In the documentary, you talk about Girl Power being a less threatening way to discuss feminism. Twenty years ago, if you said the word feminism, you thought of those bra-burning, marching protestors. It was quite tough and harsh. For me, Girl Power was a much more punchy way of saying it. But actually, Girl Power embodies much more than a gender. It's about everybody. Everybody deserves the same treatment, whatever race you are, gender you are, age you are. Everybody deserves a voice. It was just saying that in a very digestible way. There was a clip that went viral last year, where you and the rest of the band have ablazing row,externalwith a director who wanted you to show more cleavage. Oh, I saw that, when I told the bloke to zip it! Do you know what? I didn't actually take that very personally. Sometimes people just need reminding that we have to be respectful. He's just being a bit silly. He needs reminding what's what. I was interested to hear you talk about songwriting earlier, because it's rarely discussed that that Spice Girls have writing credits on all of their singles. Do you think that's been overlooked? I feel incredibly proud to have been part of the writing. I've always loved lyric-writing, and melodies - so if it gets recognised, fantastic. What's the song you're proudest of? I'm proud of my solo album - the first one I did - because it was so honest. If you listen toLift Me Up,external, I was really inspired by the Carpenters. On the bridge, where I sing ""it's going to be alright"", I was trying to the way Karen's voice would go really low and then soar up again. But then I also loveWannabe,external. It's a very confident song. The Spice Girls hits included Stop, Wannabe, Say You'll Be There and Spice Up Your Life You had to fight for Wannabe to be your first single, didn't you? Really fight for it. Why was that? Nobody wanted it. The record company didn't want it. Management didn't want it. And I can understand the hesitation. It was not the coolest. But the best song to me is when you instinctively like it - not because it's cool, not because it's what the latest fad is. You just connect to it. The advantage of Wannabe being uncool was that, when Say You'll Be There came out people suddenly sat up and said, ""wait a minute, there's more to this band than we assumed"". And we always knew it could only ever be that way round. I had faith in it and Emma had faith in it. Looking back, would you stand by your decision to quit the band? Ermâ¦ Would I have left? It depends. They wanted to make an R&B album. Am I a big R&B fan? Not really. I'm a pop writer. I felt comfortable in that genre and it felt completely alien to me to sing in that R&B style. My departure almost set them free a bit, and allowed them to make that album [Forever, recorded with Rodney Jerkins]. So I don't regret it. Part of life is change. The singer struck up a friendship with her idol, George Michael You became friends with George Michael around that time. What are you memories of him? I always had sort of a crush on him, so when I met him I just thought, ""wow!"". Most of all, I admired him as an artist, for his music but also, I just think he was a really kind, good person. I filmed the documentary before he died - but I talk about him, and now that [section] has become really sad and poignant. He was just such a generous, kind, loving being. Your new son is called Montague George Hector Horner. Is that partly in his honour? Yeah, it was my mother's idea. Because she was very fond of George and he really loved my mum. He went to her wedding! I had a month [of pregnancy] to go after George died and when Monty was born, mum said, ""why don't you give him George's name?"". And I thought, ""oh that's really sweet."" After you left The Spice Girls, you worked for several years as a UN spokesperson. I get the feeling that changed you as a person. I tell you what - it puts it all in perspective. You realise how lucky we are to live in a country like this. We have an NHS - I know we complain about it, but we have one. We have a support system for the unemployed. There is a structure here that supports. And there is a freedom that some countries do not have. The star lobbied to play a Bond girl in the late 1990s Another thing you did after the Spice Girls was you attended drama school. Yeah! You've really done your research! And then you auditioned for Bond? Actually, they just called me in for a chat. They didn't give me the part. I don't think I was up their street. But you did end up with a cameo in Sex and the City. Oh my God, that was amazing. That was amazing! I had to properly audition for it. They were very strict, because it was all about comedy timing and very tightly scripted. But I think I got more kudos from doing that than anything else. My girlfriends were so excited I was in that. The Spice Girls sold more than 85 million records and performed for royalty You're working on a solo album right now. How is that going? I wrote the majority of the album when I was pregnant and it's really coming together now. Having children has inspired some great records - Madonna's Ray of Light, Neneh Cherry's Raw Like Sushiâ¦ Do you know what? I felt this surge of creativity when I was pregnant. And you're much more emotional - my feelings were really on tap. But this album - it's just so different. I feel like I've jumped over to the other side. When you're a certain genre, like the pop genre, it's like being 12 and to get to the other side, to grow up and be comfortable, has taken me a while. But I feel like I've finally done it. When do we get to hear it? I'm really, really hopeful that it's this side of the summer. That would be really nice. I'd be really happy to share it.

"This video can not be played The 19 year old who runs away from ambulances Among the pack of runners one moment, collapsed on the ground and frothing at the mouth the next. For a short time she is lost to the convulsion and then she scrambles to her feet and sprints away. Katie Cooke will not let epilepsy get in the way of a race. The 19-year-old student from Cherrywood, South Dublin, has what her specialist doctor calls the ""Arsenal of epilepsy"" and contends with up to 15 convulsions a day which render her unconscious. ""Your whole body is shaking, you can feel your muscles jumping, it feels like everything has been sucked out of you, you can't breathe,"" she says. ""Every single day you lose control."" Despite having to cope with multiple seizures when she runs, Cooke has won prestigious events including her age group in the Dublin City Marathon and she runs 5km in under 17 minutes. She can often be seen pounding the streets with her running partner, Dr Colin Doherty, who also happens to be her consultant neurologist. But she wasn't always so athletic. Diagnosed at the age of nine with frontal lobe epilepsy, she managed her condition with medication until it deteriorated when puberty hit and her hormones started ""kicking up"". ""I wasn't able to get out of bed. I wasn't able to do anything for myself and couldn't really speak. My Mum was dressing me and showering me,"" she says. Cooke was admitted to Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin where she remained for 10 months. Despite being involved in numerous medical trials she regressed, lost control of her back and hips, and by the time she was discharged she wasn't able to walk. ""I couldn't hold myself up and was in a wheelchair for about seven months but being a very stubborn person I wanted to prove to people what I could do. ""After a lot of physio I started jogging every day and I started to absolutely love the freedom."" Cooke now runs every day and says a missed session sees the tiredness and dizziness of her earlier condition return. But running only alleviates her symptoms, it hasn't been a cure. The raised heart rate brought on by running triggers more seizures than if she didn't run, but Cooke says it improves her general well-being which is a negative worth accepting. Her neurologist, Dr Doherty, has also weighed up the pros and cons from a medical perspective. ""There are particular challenges with having epilepsy and long-distance running, but if you're walking you have those challenges too and I think the general benefits outweigh these risks,"" he says. ""If you took the average long-distance runner and measured all their health parameters against somebody who doesn't run you would find, no matter what disease or disorder they carried with them, they're better off."" If you have a health condition and are thinking about starting to exercise it is always important to consult your doctor first. The brain consists of about three billion cells and all of these cells are active, but they don't fire together - the brain is a de-synchronised machine. The signature of epilepsy is that the cells fire together in a synchronised way. If a million cells fire together that causes a change in behaviour but when all three billion cells fire together you've got a convulsion or a fit. There are about 40 distinct types of epilepsy. In some cases people will just stare blankly, others will wander around in a confused state and there are those who fall to the ground with convulsions. Competitive running was initially a non-starter for Cooke. As soon as she had a convulsion during a race paramedics would withdraw her from the event, but a chance comment at one of her consultations led Doherty to offer himself up as her running partner and he has kept her on track ever since. He says: ""I'm a specialist in epilepsy but my sole role when running with Katie is to stop people from taking her off in an ambulance. I just stand there and say 'Katie's fine, I'm her doctor, she's going to recover'."" Despite Cooke having so many seizures, the nature of her epilepsy means her body doesn't require any recovery time and she is able to immediately get up and run again. Doherty suspects it is her fitness levels which help with that recovery. Listen to theBBC Ouch talk-showto find out more about Katie Cooke, Dr Colin Doherty and their running partnership. ""Katie is a very serious runner, she trains properly. I'm very confident that this is a really positive experience for her,"" he says. As well as sport and college, Cooke also has to navigate a social life and a relationship with boyfriend Jack, a role most daunting at night when Cooke's seizure's make her scream, thrash around and cause the bed to shake and shudder. Cooke says: ""He's one of the most chilled people I know and he sleeps through my seizures which is a bit weird. He wakes up for the odd one because some are quite violent, and I've slapped him in the face before, but he just falls asleep again."" In terms of intimacy Cooke says sex doesn't trigger seizures, although a fit can occur at such times, and women often report an increase in convulsions around the time of ovulation and their period. Her night-time seizures can also be accompanied by hallucinations of a shadowy man who she says ""comes for me"" and it is these which leave her most exhausted. ""I don't sleep at all,"" she says. Her education suffered and she missed the majority of secondary school. Despite that, she managed to cram three years worth of curriculum for the Irish Leaving Certificate into one year and secured a place at college to study sports management. Doherty calls her a ""remarkable young woman"" for all she has achieved while handling so many severe convulsions on a daily basis. While for most people, watching Katie drop to the floor mid-run would be alarming Doherty believes being so public about it will help others with the condition. ""We need to facilitate people to live as normal life as possible and they need to be encouraged to do everything,"" he says.

"This video can not be played The 19 year old who runs away from ambulances Among the pack of runners one moment, collapsed on the ground and frothing at the mouth the next. For a short time she is lost to the convulsion and then she scrambles to her feet and sprints away. Katie Cooke will not let epilepsy get in the way of a race. The 19-year-old student from Cherrywood, South Dublin, has what her specialist doctor calls the ""Arsenal of epilepsy"" and contends with up to 15 convulsions a day which render her unconscious. ""Your whole body is shaking, you can feel your muscles jumping, it feels like everything has been sucked out of you, you can't breathe,"" she says. ""Every single day you lose control."" Despite having to cope with multiple seizures when she runs, Cooke has won prestigious events including her age group in the Dublin City Marathon and she runs 5km in under 17 minutes. She can often be seen pounding the streets with her running partner, Dr Colin Doherty, who also happens to be her consultant neurologist. But she wasn't always so athletic. Diagnosed at the age of nine with frontal lobe epilepsy, she managed her condition with medication until it deteriorated when puberty hit and her hormones started ""kicking up"". ""I wasn't able to get out of bed. I wasn't able to do anything for myself and couldn't really speak. My Mum was dressing me and showering me,"" she says. Cooke was admitted to Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin where she remained for 10 months. Despite being involved in numerous medical trials she regressed, lost control of her back and hips, and by the time she was discharged she wasn't able to walk. ""I couldn't hold myself up and was in a wheelchair for about seven months but being a very stubborn person I wanted to prove to people what I could do. ""After a lot of physio I started jogging every day and I started to absolutely love the freedom."" Cooke now runs every day and says a missed session sees the tiredness and dizziness of her earlier condition return. But running only alleviates her symptoms, it hasn't been a cure. The raised heart rate brought on by running triggers more seizures than if she didn't run, but Cooke says it improves her general well-being which is a negative worth accepting.

"Geri Horner: ""The '90s were like the '60s, very free and full of colour"" It's 20 years since Geri Horner (then Halliwell) strode onto the Brits stage in her Union Jack dress in one of the defining images of the 1990s. To mark the anniversary, the singer is hosting a BBC Two documentary on the decade, looking at her own journey from Turkish game show host to globe-straddling, Nelson Mandela-cuddling pop phenomenon. It's called Geri's 1990s: My Drive to Freedom - referring to the 1967 open-topped sports car she bought with her first ""fat pay cheque"" from Virgin Records. Ahead of the broadcast this Saturday, the star sat down with BBC News to reflect on the decade that changed her life. Along the way, she reveals the creative tensions that split up the Spice Girls, her time as a Turkish TV show hostess, and why she named her newborn son after George Michael. This video can not be played Geri Horner recalls her first Spice Girls pay cheque What struck you most about the 1990s while making the documentary? It was a really good reminder of how much influence that decade had on my life. It was brilliant in every way - musically, culturally, politically. There was so much colour and creativity. Britain felt like the centre of the universe at that moment. You turned 18 in 1990, and almost immediately had surgery to remove a lump in your breast... Yes, I had a little scare. [The lump turned out not to be cancerous,external] That's not something most teenagers have to confront. How did it change your life? Did it make you more ambitious? I think it was something else that put the petrol in my tank. I was always ambitious, but my dad died when I was quite young. He'd always been very encouraging of my career, and when he died not only did I experience the loss of a parent, but also my own mortality. You suddenly think: ""Oh God, life's here and you've just got to go for it"". That, for me, was a defining moment. The Spice Girls stole the show at the 1997 Brit Awards For the next couple of years, you tried your hand at modelling and TV presenting. Were you just looking for the best way to get a break? Two things happened: I went back to college to study English Literature - but to subsidise that, I had to take lots of little jobs. One of them, I was agame show hostess in Turkey,external. The show was a bit like The Price is Right, and I would go to Turkey and do that. I had all these random jobs, but what they ultimately were for, was to fund me going into the studio. I remember the guy said it would cost Â£300 to get my demo tape together. I'd written one song myself and the other was a cover of the songA Lover's Holiday,external. What was your song called? It was called Live to Love. It was pretty crap. You auditioned for the Spice Girls after answering a newspaper advert. How many times had you been through that process? Oh, I'd tried loads and loads of different things. All sorts of random stuff. And there were some dodgy things, believe me. The band got huge very quickly. It's amazing to think that the period between Wannabe and you leaving wasn't even two years. What's your memory of that period? When you're in the middle of it, you just sort of get on with it. I liked being part of a group. The camaraderie. It was a lot of fun. It got quite hysterical - the paparazzi, the screaming fans, the constant tabloid stories. Was fame what you had dreamt it would be? What you think about something and what it turns out to be is never going to be quite the same. Some bits are better, some bits are not. But it was a very happy, fun, full-on experience. This video can not be played Geri says Girl Power was 'more palatable' than feminism In the documentary, you talk about Girl Power being a less threatening way to discuss feminism. Twenty years ago, if you said the word feminism, you thought of those bra-burning, marching protestors. It was quite tough and harsh. For me, Girl Power was a much more punchy way of saying it. But actually, Girl Power embodies much more than a gender. It's about everybody. Everybody deserves the same treatment, whatever race you are, gender you are, age you are. Everybody deserves a voice. It was just saying that in a very digestible way. There was a clip that went viral last year, where you and the rest of the band have ablazing row,externalwith a director who wanted you to show more cleavage. Oh, I saw that, when I told the bloke to zip it! Do you know what? I didn't actually take that very personally. Sometimes people just need reminding that we have to be respectful. He's just being a bit silly. He needs reminding what's what. I was interested to hear you talk about songwriting earlier, because it's rarely discussed that that Spice Girls have writing credits on all of their singles. Do you think that's been overlooked? I feel incredibly proud to have been part of the writing. I've always loved lyric-writing, and melodies - so if it gets recognised, fantastic. What's the song you're proudest of? I'm proud of my solo album - the first one I did - because it was so honest. If you listen toLift Me Up,external, I was really inspired by the Carpenters. On the bridge, where I sing ""it's going to be alright"", I was trying to the way Karen's voice would go really low and then soar up again. But then I also loveWannabe,external. It's a very confident song. The Spice Girls hits included Stop, Wannabe, Say You'll Be There and Spice Up Your Life You had to fight for Wannabe to be your first single, didn't you? Really fight for it. Why was that? Nobody wanted it. The record company didn't want it. Management didn't want it. And I can understand the hesitation. It was not the coolest. But the best song to me is when you instinctively like it - not because it's cool, not because it's what the latest fad is. You just connect to it. The advantage of Wannabe being uncool was that, when Say You'll Be There came out people suddenly sat up and said, ""wait a minute, there's more to this band than we assumed"". And we always knew it could only ever be that way round. I had faith in it and Emma had faith in it. Looking back, would you stand by your decision to quit the band? Ermâ¦ Would I have left? It depends. They wanted to make an R&B album. Am I a big R&B fan? Not really. I'm a pop writer. I felt comfortable in that genre and it felt completely alien to me to sing in that R&B style. My departure almost set them free a bit, and allowed them to make that album [Forever, recorded with Rodney Jerkins]. So I don't regret it. Part of life is change. The singer struck up a friendship with her idol, George Michael You became friends with George Michael around that time. What are you memories of him? I always had sort of a crush on him, so when I met him I just thought, ""wow!"". Most of all, I admired him as an artist, for his music but also, I just think he was a really kind, good person. I filmed the documentary before he died - but I talk about him, and now that [section] has become really sad and poignant. He was just such a generous, kind, loving being. Your new son is called Montague George Hector Horner. Is that partly in his honour? Yeah, it was my mother's idea. Because she was very fond of George and he really loved my mum. He went to her wedding! I had a month [of pregnancy] to go after George died and when Monty was born, mum said, ""why don't you give him George's name?"". And I thought, ""oh that's really sweet."" After you left The Spice Girls, you worked for several years as a UN spokesperson. I get the feeling that changed you as a person. I tell you what - it puts it all in perspective. You realise how lucky we are to live in a country like this. We have an NHS - I know we complain about it, but we have one. We have a support system for the unemployed. There is a structure here that supports. And there is a freedom that some countries do not have. The star lobbied to play a Bond girl in the late 1990s Another thing you did after the Spice Girls was you attended drama school. Yeah! You've really done your research! And then you auditioned for Bond? Actually, they just called me in for a chat. They didn't give me the part. I don't think I was up their street. But you did end up with a cameo in Sex and the City. Oh my God, that was amazing. That was amazing! I had to properly audition for it. They were very strict, because it was all about comedy timing and very tightly scripted. But I think I got more kudos from doing that than anything else. My girlfriends were so excited I was in that. The Spice Girls sold more than 85 million records and performed for royalty You're working on a solo album right now. How is that going? I wrote the majority of the album when I was pregnant and it's really coming together now. Having children has inspired some great records - Madonna's Ray of Light, Neneh Cherry's Raw Like Sushiâ¦ Do you know what? I felt this surge of creativity when I was pregnant. And you're much more emotional - my feelings were really on tap. But this album - it's just so different. I feel like I've jumped over to the other side. When you're a certain genre, like the pop genre, it's like being 12 and to get to the other side, to grow up and be comfortable, has taken me a while. But I feel like I've finally done it. When do we get to hear it? I'm really, really hopeful that it's this side of the summer. That would be really nice. I'd be really happy to share it.

"North Korea has ramped up its missile testing in recent months ""Rogue nation"". The ""greatest immediate threat"". North Korea has been called many things, few of them complimentary. The government has been accused of brutally oppressing citizens while ruthlessly pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. In the past year it held its fifth nuclear test, launched several missiles and - most believe - assassinated its leader's half-brother using a chemical weapon. Most recently, it has conducted its first test of what it claims is an inter-continental ballistic missile, a move that - if verified - increases the threat it can pose to its enemies and ratchets up international tensions. But why is North Korea such a problem - and why can no solution be found? The US and the Soviets divided Korea into two at the end of World War Two. Reunification talks failed and by 1948 there were two separate governments. The 1950-53 Korean War entrenched the split. North Korea's first leader was Kim Il-sung, a communist who presided over a one-party state, and the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. It remains one of the world's poorest nations. Its economy is centrally controlled, its citizens have no access to external media and, apart from a privileged few, no freedom to leave. Most worryingly, it has conductedfive nuclearand multiplemissile teststhat demonstrate progress towards its ultimate goal of building a nuclear missile. Is Kim Jong-un (centre) waiting until he can negotiate from a position of greater strength? There have been several rounds. The most recent, involving China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the US, initially looked promising. Pyongyang agreed to give up its nuclear work in return for aid and political concessions. It went as far asblowing up the cooling tower,externalat its plutonium production facility at Yongbyon. But then things faltered. The US said North Korea was failing to disclose the full extent of its nuclear work. Pyongyang denied this, but then conducted a nuclear test. So, since 2009, there have been no meaningful discussions. John Nilsson-Wright, senior fellow for north-east Asia at think-tank Chatham House, says that North Korea, judging from its recent provocations, is not interested in negotiating at the moment. ""This is because Kim is determined to push forward on military modernisation, so rationally it is in his interests to delay."" The UN and several nations already have sanctions in place against North Korea, targeting its weapons programme and financial ability to function abroad. Meanwhile food aid to North Korea - which relies on donations to feed its people - has fallen in recent years as tensions have risen. But these measures do not seem to be slowing down North Korea's ability to move forward on the military front. China is widely seen as the nation most able to impose economic pain on North Korea. Experts say targeting the intermediaries that keep North Korea moving - like Chinese banks - would make a real impact, as would targeting the oil that Pyongyang imports from China. This is some movement on this. AReuters report in late June,external, citing unidentified sources, said China's state oil giant had suspended sales to Pyongyang, though it suggested the decision was commercial. The US, meanwhile, hasimposed sanctions on a Chinese bankaccused of laundering North Korean money. But the key problem is that China does not want to take actions that would destabilise the government in North Korea and potentially unleash chaos on its border. So, John Nilsson-Wright says, China has been trying to play the role of honest broker, lobbying the US to talk to Pyongyang. But the US, Japan and South Korea have made it very clear that the North must show a real willingness to compromise before talks become an option. North Korean coal exports have been targeted - but the government shows no signs of collapse Not a good one. It is generally thought that military action against North Korea would lead to very high military and civilian casualties. Finding and eliminating North Korea's nuclear stockpile would be hard - experts suspect assets are buried deep underground. Moreover the North is heavily armed, with an arsenal of missiles putting Seoul (and beyond) in range, chemical and biological weapons, and about one million troops. ""The risk is that it provokes a counterattack that is massively costly to South Korea,"" says Dr Nilsson-Wright. In the past South Korea has talked overtly about a ""decapitation"" strategy - a targeted attack to remove Kim Jong-un and his leadership. This could be a tactic to deter North Korea from further provocations or to force it back to the negotiating table, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. The strong view in Seoul, he says, is that the only way to get the North back to the negotiating table is to make the government feel so insecure that it feels it has no choice. There are also big questions around who might fill the vacuum if a ""decapitation"" went ahead. The elite have a vested interest in the survival of the Kim government and there is no political opposition. Both Koreas have firepower and troops ready for any conflict For a while some thought that the way to bring North Korea into the international community was to help it open up gradually, through small economic reforms, using the model of China's transformation after the death of Mao Zedong There were signs Kim Jong-il - the leader's late father - may have been interested in this approach, as he made several trips to Chinese industrial zones. The key supporter of this, however, was thought to be Chang Song-thaek, the leader's uncle. But Kim Jong-un hadhim executed in December 2013, calling him a traitor who planned to overthrow the state. Kim Jong-un has not yet visited China - in fact, he has not visited any foreign country since becoming leader in 2011. And while he has talked of economic growth, the military programme appears to be his priority. This is very unlikely. One-party rule is absolute in North Korea. Citizens are encouraged to worship the Kim dynasty, which is portrayed as the only institution keeping them safe from external aggression. There are no independent media. All TV, radio and newspapers are state-controlled and North Korea has created its own internet so citizens have no electronic access to the outside world. There is a limited flow of information across the Chinese border, including DVDs which are smuggled in. But in general North Korea exercises very tight control over its citizens. The government has informants everywhere looking for signs of dissent andpenalties are severe.Offenders (and sometimes their whole families) can be sent to labour camps where many die. The state controls what North Koreans can and cannot watch, hear and read There needs to be a mixture of pressure and dialogue, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. Pressure, he suggests, could involve some combination of enhanced sanctions, the relisting of North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (it was removed from the list in 2008), and close work with China to inflict real pain. Possible incentives could include formal diplomatic recognition by the US or a peace treaty (the two Koreas remain technically at war). Key to this approach would be co-ordination between the US, China, South Korea and Japan. But there are problems. After initial apparent warmth, ties between the Trump administration and Beijing seem to be cooling. In June US President Donald Trump tweeted that China's approach to North Korea had ""not worked out"". Ties between Japan, South Korea and China remain fractious over historical issues. Beijing is also fiercely opposed to thedeployment by the US of a Thaad missile defence systemin South Korea. In Seoul, new liberal President Moon Jae-in must walk a fine line balancing the interests of his electorate, biggest military ally and powerful neighbour. So there are divisions to exploit. ""That is why North Korea is pushing it now - it knows it has a window on which to capitalise,"" Dr Nilsson-Wright argues.

"This video can not be played Barbara Buttrick went from typist to boxer in 1950s Britain When Barbara Buttrick started boxing in the late 1940s, women in the sport were regarded on a par with gamblers and prostitutes. However, the 4ft 11in Mighty Atom's career took her from the fairgrounds of Yorkshire to the boxing rings of the United States and - ultimately - the world title. It was a chance encounter with a scrap piece of newspaper that led to Buttrick abandoning her job as a typist. ""I was trying to get a soccer team together and there weren't very many girls that would play soccer in those days, I'm talking about the 1940s,"" the 87-year-old grandmother said. ""One day I read an article about a woman that travelled with boxing booths and I cut the article out and said I'm going to try it."" That article, about prize fighter Polly Burns, was printed on newspaper she had been given by her mother to clean her boots with. Barbara Buttrick started boxing in fairground booths around England in the late 1940s Her parents in Cottingham, East Yorkshire, reluctantly gave her permission for her to take up boxing and she began getting work at fairgrounds, where she would challenge women to fight her in brightly-coloured sideshow booths. Now confined to history, these had been popular attractions for more than 200 years and had launched many successful boxing careers. After some time developing her skills, she headed to London in search of a trainer and female sparring partners. It was there, at Mickey Woods' gym, that she found a trainer in Leonard Smith, whom she later married. At the time, she was something of a minor celebrity, telling a TV interviewer: ""Girls aren't the delicate flowers they used to be. Anyhow, my boyfriend doesn't mind."" Buttrick said in a 1950s interview: 'Girls aren't the delicate flowers they used to be' However, opportunities for a female boxer were limited in 1950s England where it was regarded as an exclusively male sport. ""It was even hard to get in the gyms, you couldn't work out in the gym, they were really against anything like that,"" Buttrick said. ""It was girls don't do this and girls don't do that. I was just interested in it and I figured I should be able to do what I wanted to do, the same as any boy."" It was ""on a par with getting drunk and with gambling and with prostitution"", said Kath Woodward - a sociology professor who researches gender and diversity in sport. ""Boxing goes with being big, with being strong, with being brave - all these things which make up our ideal of masculinity,"" she added. ""But femininity is not made up in those ways, so for Barbara to have boxed was seen as threatening, because boxing is associated with all the things that go with being a real man."" Attitudes were more enlightened in the United States, though, and Buttrick and Smith decided to move there in search of promoters willing to put on her fights. ""The Americans were more open-minded about it, you couldn't do anything but box on the booths in England,"" Buttrick said. She travelled around the US and - when they got to Miami - she began training at the legendary 5th Street Gym, where she met boxing greats Muhammad Ali and his trainer Angelo Dundee. ""He was Cassius Clay back then and he was just starting out,"" she said.  ""He was just a young lad."" Antonio Tarver, a former world champion light heavyweight who trained at the 5th Street Gym and featured in the 2006 Sylvester Stallone film Rocky Balboa, said it would have been an intimidating place. ""When I come here it's like hallowed grounds, I feel something special about the 5th Street Gym,"" he said. ""For Barbara, it had to be hard but she found her way, she made her path. A world champion, I can only imagine the things that she has seen, witnessing and watching the greatness. Her story needs to be told."" Buttrick fought more than 1,000 exhibition matches in the States, winning 30 professional fights, drawing one and losing just one before retiring in 1960. It was in 1957 that she fought Phyllis Kugler, and won the Women's World Boxing Champion title. ""There was one fight that I lost, with Joann Hagen,"" Buttrick said. ""But she was so much taller than me."" Buttrick won the world title in 1957 After her boxing career, she stayed in the sport - founding and becoming president of the Women's International Boxing Federation in the mid-1990s. She was recently the first woman to be inducted into the Florida Boxing Hall of Fame. Now she is returning to her roots as part of Hull's 2017 UK City of Culture celebrations. A play inspired by her story is being performed there, focussing on a group of Hull women who put on an unlicensed fight night, aptly calledMighty Atoms,external. Buttrick will also appear at Hull City Hall for a talk on Saturday, as part of a series of events calledWow Hull (Women of the World).,external Her legacy in the sport is likely to be felt for many decades though. When women's boxing was finally included in the Olympics at London 2012, Buttrick was there to see Nicola Adams win the flyweight gold for Great Britain. ""It's because of women like her that's made it possible for me to box today,"" said Adams. ""It was quite tough for me, women's boxing wasn't really accepted so I can't even imagine how hard it must have been for her to keep pushing, keep training and try to be taken seriously. ""I've got to say a big thank you to Barbara for paving the way."" You can see more onBBC Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on BBC iPlayer. The women boxers breaking stereotypes.
