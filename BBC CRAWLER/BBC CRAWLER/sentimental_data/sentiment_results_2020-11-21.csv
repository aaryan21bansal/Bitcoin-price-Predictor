"Saturday afternoon in Glasgow's Buchanan Street is rarely this quiet More than two million people are spending their first day living under Scotland's toughest Covid restrictions. Level four rules for 11 council areas came into force at 18:00 on Friday, when travel curbs in level three and four areas also became law. Non-essential shops, hospitality, hairdressers and gyms will remain closed until 11 December. Less than five weeks before Christmas, main shopping streets were unusually quiet. The Scottish government has said the restrictions are necessary to drive down stubbornly high rates of the virus. Saturday's daily coronavirus figures showed 887 positive cases and 37 newly-reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Across Scotland, 100 patients were in intensive care, a rise of 12 since Friday. Of the new cases, 234 were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, 246 in Lanarkshire, and 140 in Lothian. Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that while infection rates have stabilised in recent weeks, they remained at a stubbornly high level in some areas. She said the new restrictions would help infection rates come down further before the Christmas period, paving the way for a possible easing. Buchanan Street in Glasgow on Friday afternoon (top) and on Saturday morning ""The fact is the fewer people who are in the population who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period,"" she said. ""It's very important for me to be clear that the risks would not be zero - which is why we must be very careful about any relaxation over Christmas and people will have to think carefully themselves, even with any relaxation, about what they want to do or not."" National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said the actions people in level four areas take now will dictate which restrictions are in place in the new year. He said: ""When you think about Christmas you should also think of the consequences that will have for January. If the virus spreads between households on Christmas day and Boxing day or whenever, of course, that will have a run-in effect to January. ""People will catch the virus at Christmas and then some of them will be hospitalised and be in intensive care in January. That's what we need to avoid. The principal way to avoid that is to get prevalence down and have a safe Christmas."" On Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said the chief medical officers of the UK nations had been tasked with developing a ""concrete"" proposal for household mixing at Christmas, details of which could be revealed next week. Ms Sturgeon also said the new travel restrictions were ""vital"" to ensure there is no need for a national lockdown. Staff outnumbered passengers at Queen Street Station as travel restrictions took effect In South Lanarkshire, closed shops kept people away from Hamilton town centre People in level three and four areas must not travel outside their council area, except foressential purposes,externalsuch as work and healthcare, and people living elsewhere must not travel into these areas except for essential purposes. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? What can I do and where can I go under the new rules? She urged Scots to abide by the new regulations, which could see a Â£60 fine levied against those who violate the rules unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as caring responsibilities or a hospital appointment. The stricter rules apply to 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. The centre of Stirling was also unusually quiet A month away from Christmas, Argyle Street in Glasgow would not normally look this empty On Saturday, a new walk-in testing centre was opened in Glasgow. The UK government-funded centre will be operated by facilities company Mitie in the St Francis Community Centre in the Gorbals. It is the third to open in the city, and one of 14 operating across Scotland out of 22 promised by Westminster. As bars and restaurants closed their doors once again under virus measures, opposition parties called for more support for the industry to help save jobs. Nicola Sturgeon has promised a Â£30m fund for businesses in level four areas. But Labour jobs spokesman Alex Rowley said the proposals fell short of what was required and he urged the first minister to bring forward proposals for more extensive support next week.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he does not oppose devolution Boris Johnson has insisted he does not oppose devolution, after reportedlysaying it had been a ""disaster"" in Scotland. Addressing Scottish Conservatives, the prime minister said he only ""criticised the performance of devolution"" under the Scottish National Party. ""I don't want to oppose devolution as a concept in itself,"" he said. The SNP said these were ""weasel words"" to deflect from his earlier ""blunder"". In a speech by video link to the party's conference, Mr Johnson said reports he had told Tory MPs devolution was a ""disaster"" and ""Tony Blair's biggest mistake"" had not reflected his words ""entirely accurately"". ""The way SNP have handled devolution in Scotland has been a disaster,"" he said, criticising the party's performance on education along with people's satisfaction with public services and describing it as an ""abysmal record"". Johnson 'called Scottish devolution a disaster' The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Devolution not a disaster, says Senedd Tory leader He cited his experience as mayor of London as an example of his support for devolution, saying it could help deliver green transport policies or in tackling crime. ""Devolution should be used not by politicians as a wall to sequester, to break away, an area of the UK from the rest,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It should be used as a step to pass power to local communities and businesses to make their lives better. It's that kind of localism which I believe in and want to take further."" Boris Johnson is said to have told a group of Tory MPs on Monday that devolution had been a disaster in Scotland. No 10 didn't deny those were his words. They went down badly with Mr Johnson's colleagues in Scotland - to put it lightly. Mr Johnson is now trying to repair some of the damage by saying he has no problem with devolution, just the SNP. The problem for Mr Johnson is that the SNP and Labour have already made his comments on devolution a key message ahead of the Holyrood elections in May. Those elections could be crucial in deciding whether there is going to be another independence referendum. He said the coronavirus crisis showed how important it was for the nations of the UK to work together, adding that there was no time for ""division and distraction"" and the ""focus on separation has got to stop"". Thanking First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for her co-operation, he said Scotland had benefited from being part of ""one of the world's leading scientific superpowers"" during the pandemic, with vaccine stocks, testing and other technologies. The jobs of more than 900,000 Scottish workers were protected by the furlough scheme and 80,000 businesses were given government grants or loans, the prime minister said. ""Covid-19 doesn't care about constitutional arrangements,"" Mr Johnson added. ""We all need to work together to protect health and jobs of the people of Scotland."" Devolution is the name for the way powers once held by the government in Westminster have been passed to elected bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved powers include health, housing, fire services, some areas of transport and education. However, Scotland has always had its own education system and a separate legal system. The UK government, based in London, has kept many powers, such as defence, foreign policy and most forms of tax. Public votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and in both parts of Ireland in 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement. It led to the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some parts of England have directly-elected mayors, who also have devolved powers. The mayor of London, for example, is responsible for transport and policing in the capital. An SNP spokesman said the prime minister was just offering ""more weasel words of deflection from his blunder in revealing he thinks devolution has been a disaster"". Elections for the Scottish Parliament take place in May. The SNP is currently the largest party with 61 MSPs and the Conservative Party is the second largest with 31 - eight seats ahead of Labour. Ms Sturgeon's SNP says a second referendum on independence - following Scotland's vote against it in 2014 - should be held if her party wins. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out.

"Boris Johnson is facing questions about whether he tried to tone down an independent report which said Home Secretary Priti Patel broke the ministerial code by bullying staff. Number 10 has insisted Sir Alex Allan's conclusions were ""entirely his own"". But a Whitehall source told the BBC that Sir Alex had resisted pressure to make the findings more ""palatable"". And Sir David Normington, a former Home Office chief, said Ms Patel's behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"". He said the report had found she was a bully, adding: ""You shouldn't have bullies in government"". Ms Patel apologised on Friday, saying:  ""Any upset I have caused was completely unintentional."" Bullying inquiry head quits as PM backs Patel Inquiry 'found Patel broke behaviour rules' In full: Summary of Patel bullying report Sir Alex resigned as independent advisor on ministerial standards after Mr Johnson threw his support behind the home secretary, effectively disregarding Sir Alex's findings. His report found Ms Patel's conduct had fallen below the standards expected of government ministers and cited examples of the home secretary ""shouting and swearing"" at civil servants. But Mr Johnson - who has the final say - kept Ms Patel in her job, saying he ""does not believe that Priti Patel is a bully"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir David Normington - former permanent secretary at the Home Office, said there had been ""no acknowledgement"" by either Ms Patel or the prime minister that ""she was found to have bullied staff, possibly in three departments - not just in the home office"". ""The prime minister has simply put aside the findings of a report... that she is a bully. You shouldn't have bullies in government."" ""The system depends on the prime minister standing up for standards in public life and taking action when a minister breaches those standards,"" he added. This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims He welcomed Ms Patel's apology but said it ""wasn't an apology for bullying"". ""I don't think she recognises, even now, that she bullied."" Ms Patel's friend and colleague, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, defended the home secretary, insisting her behaviour ""wasn't bullying"". She told Radio 4 Ms Patel was ""very direct... and incredibly passionate"". Another Tory colleague, Iain Duncan Smith, told Matt Frei on LBC radio it was right that Ms Patel had apologised but neither she nor the civil service had come out of the report well. He said Sir Alan had identified failings in the Home Office, including that it was ""not as flexible as it could have been"" and that Ms Patel has ""not always felt supported"" by the department. ""It's not just one way,"" he said. ""Senior civil servants did not do their job."" Meanwhile Ken Clarke - a former home secretary - said he was ""troubled"" by the departure of Sir Alex Allan, whom he described as ""very impressive"". Lord Clarke told Times Radio there was a widely-held assumption ""that if an investigation was taken this far, and if anyone was found to have broken the ministerial code"", they would step down. ""It's a very awkward situation and I'm troubled by it,"" he said. The PM asked Sir Alex to investigate allegations against Ms Patel in March, following the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the most senior Home Office official. Standards chief Sir Alex was asked to examine whether the home secretary had breached the  code governing ministers' behaviour. Sir Philip - who is suing the government for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt Ms Patel had ""created fear"" in the department. He says she was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about ""the need to treat staff with respect"". Sir Philip has told the BBC he was never asked to contribute to Sir Alex's investigation. Ms Patel has always strongly denied allegations of bullying. The ministerial code,externalis a government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues. It says ""harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour"" will not be tolerated. It says ministers are ""personally responsible"" for how they act - and that they can stay in office ""for so long as they retain the confidence of the prime minister"". The code is not legally binding and the PM retains the ultimate authority in matters relating to the code - but, typically, if a minister breaches the code, they are expected to resign. Sir Alex examined Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for International Development. He is understood to have concluded his draft report several months ago, but Downing Street delayed giving a verdict until this week. Ina summary of the findings, issued by government, Sir Alex concluded the home secretary had  breached the ministerial code ""even if unintentionally"", with behaviour ""that can be described as bullying"" towards civil servants. He also said Ms Patel's behaviour needed to be viewed in context, citing the pressure of the role of home secretary and the lack of support felt by the minister from the top of the department. In addition, the report said there was no evidence the home secretary was aware of the impact of her behaviour. On Friday, the PM rejected Sir Alex's findings, saying he did not think Ms Patel was a bully and that he had ""full confidence"" in her. Mr Johnson pointed to ""mitigating circumstances"" in the report and Ms Patel's ""full and frank apology"". Sir Alex announced his resignation as the prime minister released his statement. A source told the BBC that there were discussions between Sir Alex and Mr Johnson during the summer about challenges the report presented. A separate Whitehall source said Sir Alex resisted calls to downplay his findings. In response to claims pressure had been placed on Sir Alex, Downing Street said: ""As you would expect, the prime minister spoke to Sir Alex Allan to further his understanding of the report. Sir Alex's conclusions are entirely his own."" Labour described the allegations as ""serious"" and called for an independent investigation. Holly Lynch, shadow home office minister, said: ""The fact the prime minister's own adviser on standards has resigned over this issue shows how desperate the situation has become.""

"This video can not be played Flames rose from the building's large windows Hundreds of anti-government protesters in Guatemala have vandalised and set fire to parts of the Congress building, before being dispersed by riot police. The building in Guatemala City was empty at the time of Saturday's attack, which lasted for about 10 minutes. The fire services put the fire out, but several people were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. The protesters are opposed to a budget approved by Congress of the Central American country on Wednesday night. An office inside the building went up in flames - but the overall extent of the damage is not known A number of protesters were detained by police The opposition says the budget prioritises big infrastructure projects to be handled by companies with government connections and overlooks the social and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are also angered by what they describe as major cuts to education and health spending. How virus is threatening Central America's lifeline Storm Eta kills at least 50 in Guatemala Conservative elected Guatemalan president Guatemala country profile Another key complaints is that the budget was passed by parliament while the rest of the country was distracted by the after-effects of two damaging storms, Eta and Iota.

"Princess Diana and Prince Harry at Hyde Park The Duke of Sussex is ""aware of everything that is happening"" in the investigation into how the BBC secured an interview with his mother in 1995. ""You do not need a public statement to imagine how he is feeling privately,"" a source close to Prince Harry said. The BBChas promised to ""get to the truth""about the events surrounding the Panorama interview with Princess Diana. But her brother, Earl Spencer, has said he is not ""satisfied"" with the parameters set around the inquiry. The source close to Prince Harry was responding to suggestions the prince had failed to speak up over the controversy surrounding the Panorama interview. In the past few days some newspapers have carried criticism of Prince Harry for not ""standing by"" his brother, the Duke of Cambridge. It comes after Prince William said the investigation was ""a step in the right direction"" ina statement released by Kensington Palaceon Thursday. Prince Harry (right) alongside his mother and brother, Princess Diana and Prince William, in 1995 ""Harry is getting regular updates and is aware of everything that is happening,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do not need a public statement to imagine how he is feeling privately, people know how much his mother means to him. ""He has bravely spoken out in the past about loss and grief, and the immense impact it has had on him. ""Sadly, some people are not just seeing this as a drive for truth, but also trying to use this as an opportunity to try to drive a wedge between the brothers."" An investigation was launched following claims by Diana's brother that the BBC's Martin Bashir used forged bank statements to convince her to do the interview. On Wednesday, the BBC announced that Lord Dyson, one of the country's most senior retired judges and a former Supreme Court judge, had been appointed to lead the inquiry. Martin Bashir left the BBC in 2004 but rejoined in 2016 The investigation will examine the following: 1. What steps did the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir take with a view to obtaining the Panorama interview in 1995? This will include looking at the mocked up bank statements, alleged payments to members of the royal household, and other issues raised by Earl Spencer. 2. Were those steps appropriate, particularly in regard to the BBC's editorial standards at the time? 3. To what extent did the actions of the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir influence Diana's decision to give an interview? 4. What knowledge did the BBC have in 1995 and 1996 of the relevant evidence, such as the forged bank statements? 5. How effectively did the BBC investigate the circumstances leading to the interview? The BBC's director general, Tim Davie, said: ""The BBC is determined to get to the truth about these events and that is why we have commissioned an independent investigation."" However Diana's brother said he was ""not at all satisfied with the parameters"" set around the inquiry into the BBC Panorama interview. Writing on Twitter,external, he added: ""Lord Dyson must be free to examine every aspect of this matter, from 1995 to today, as he sees fit."" A BBC spokeswoman said the investigation would be ""fully independent""  with ""a suitably wide remit"". It was ""incorrect"" to suggest it would not cover the BBC's investigations at the time as this was ""explicitly part of the remit"", she said. The spokeswoman added: ""Clearly, if anyone submits new evidence - or the investigation needs to go to particular places - then Lord Dyson will be able to consider that appropriately."" Almost 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama programme 25 years ago. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time, Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. She died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in Paris.

"The discovery was made in a villa on the outskirts of the ancient Roman city Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of two men who died in the volcanic eruption that destroyed the ancient Roman city of Pompeii nearly 2,000 years ago. One was probably a man of high status, and the other his slave, officials at the Pompeii archaeological park said. They ""were perhaps seeking refuge"" from the eruption ""when they were swept away"", director Massimo Osanna added. Pompeii was engulfed by a volcanic eruption from Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The eruption buried Pompeii in ash, freezing the city and its residents in time, and making it a rich source for archaeologists. The latest discovery was made this month during an excavation of a large villa on the outskirts of the ancient city. 'Sorcerer's treasure trove' found in Pompeii Horse found in harness at Pompeii Vesuvius eruption 'turned man's brain to glass' Officials said the wealthy man was aged between 30 and 40. Traces of a warm woollen cloak were found beneath his neck. The other man was aged between 18 and 23. Officials at the archaeological site said crushed vertebrae indicated that he was a slave who did manual labour. Casts were created using impressions the victims' bodies had made in the hardened ash. ""It is a death by thermal shock, as also demonstrated by their clenched feet and hands,"" Mr Osanna told reporters. He described the discovery as ""an incredible and extraordinary testimony"" of the morning when the eruption took place. Excavation work is continuing at the archaeological site, located near Naples, but it remains closed to tourists because of coronavirus measures.

"The chancellor will announce a Â£500m package to support mental health services in England after increased demand for support during the pandemic. The Treasury said the majority of the funding will be spent on specialist services for young people, including in schools, and support for NHS workers. Mr Sunak is also expected to vow for rapid progress to tackle the backlog of adult mental health referrals. He will pledge the new funding in Wednesday's Spending Review. In the same speech, the chancellor will unveil his long-term plan for infrastructure investment. While the funding only applies to England, the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive equivalent funding via the Barnett formula, which will allow them to provide similar support. Sunak to reform anti-Northern spending bias The government estimates that mental ill health costs the economy up to Â£35bn per year, and hopes the package will address the extra demand for services amid the pandemic. Mr Sunak said the pandemic has had ""a major impact on mental health because of increased isolation and uncertainty"". He added: ""It is vital we do everything we can to support our mental health services and ensure help is there for people. ""This funding will make sure those who need help get the right support as quickly as possible so they don't have to suffer in silence."" A Spending Review is a chance to take a long-term view of the government's spending plans. It sets out how much money will be allocated to different government departments and how taxpayers' money will be spent. This year the governmentdecided to abandon its long-term Comprehensive Spending Reviewamid the economic uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic and instead next week's review will cover just one financial year. It is expected to focus on supporting jobs and public services through the Covid crisis as well as investing in infrastructure to deliver on the government's pledge to ""level up"" the country. The package will also be spent on extra support for people with severe mental illness, and faster access to psychological support for conditions such as depression and anxiety, the Treasury said. Local areas will benefit from Â£1.2m for a new service to allow them to access real-time suicide data to better target prevention efforts, it added. And the Spending Review will recommit to the government's pledge to eradicate outdated mental health dormitories, as well as increased investment in the mental health workforce. On Saturday, the government confirmed it would make a major reform to the way it assesses the value for money of big spending projects. It plansto remove a longstanding biasthat has affected funding for northern England and other regions. The changes to what is known as the Treasury's ""Green Book"" will be unveiled at the Spending Review as part of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda.

"The UK and Canada have agreed a deal to continue trading under the same terms as the current EU agreement after the Brexit transition period ends. The government said it paved the way for negotiations to begin next year on a new comprehensive deal with Canada. The PM and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau made the ""agreement in principle"" in a video call, the Department for International Trade said. The agreement does not give any new benefits to businesses. But it rolls over the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement reached by the EU and Canada after seven years of negotiations. How many trade deals has the UK done so far? Boris Johnson said the extension was ""a fantastic agreement for Britain"", adding: ""Our negotiators have been working flat out to secure trade deals for the UK and from as early next year we have agreed to start work on a new, bespoke trade deal with Canada that will go even further in meeting the needs of our economy."" Welcoming the continuity deal, Mr Trudeau suggested a new comprehensive trade agreement with the UK would take several years to negotiate. Speaking during the video call, which also included International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and her counterpart Mary Ng, Mr Trudeau said: ""Now we get to continue to work on a bespoke agreement, a comprehensive agreement over the coming years that will really maximise our trade opportunities and boost things for everyone."" Labour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry welcomed the ""necessary"" deal. ""It is now vital that Boris Johnson and Liz Truss show the same urgency in securing the other 14 outstanding continuity agreements with countries like Mexico, Ghana and Singapore, where a total of Â£60bn of UK trade is still at risk and time is beginning to run out,"" she added. Before it is formally signed, the UK-Canada Trade Continuity Agreement will be subject to final legal checks. The UK has now left the EU, but its trading relationship remains the same until the end of the year. That's because it's in an 11-month transition - designed to give both sides some time to negotiate a new trade deal. No new trade deals can start until the transition period ends on 31 December.

"People in flats with and without cladding have been left unable to move without the safety checks Safety checks that left thousands of people unable to sell their flats after the Grenfell disaster are being eased. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said homes without cladding would no longer need an EWS1 external wall safety certificate - which involves a survey. Thousands of people have been refused mortgages on flats because owners have been unable to get the surveys done. But mortgage lenders said they ""did not consent"" to the announcement of the changes. They also questioned how many homeowners would benefit. The checks were introduced after 72 people died at Grenfell Tower when a fire spread along outside walls. To begin with, only those who owned flats in tall buildings with dangerous flammable cladding were affected. But in January the government extended its advice to smaller properties and mortgage lenders began demanding fire surveys from a much wider range group of sellers. Cladding red tape 'stops people selling homes' Imprisoned by cladding: The flat owners who cannot sell With fewer than 300 qualified surveyors for hundreds of thousands of properties, many owners have been unable to access them, leaving them stuck, unable to sell or remortgage. Earlier, Mr Jenrick announced he had ""secured agreement"" that the survey would not be needed for homes without cladding. ""Through no fault of their own, some flat owners have been unable to sell or remortgage their homes, and this cannot be allowed to continue,"" he said. The housing secretary said the decision to ease checks for blocks without cladding would help almost 450,000 homeowners who ""may have felt stuck in limbo"". The building safety ministerLord Greenhalgh tweeted,externalthat the chairman of the lenders association UK Finance, and the chief executive of the Building Societies Association, had confirmed ""EWS1 forms are not and have never been required"" for buildings without cladding. Despite that some people without cladding, have previously been asked to obtain an EWS form and both bodies said in a statement they ""did not consent"" to being included in the announcement. A finance industry source with knowledge of the negotiations told the BBC the proposal did not mean properties with issues other than cladding would automatically be exempt from a fire survey. The source said buildings with wooden balconies, and other safety issues, should have been included among those which still required the external fire safety checks. It would still depend on the decision of a ""suitably qualified, independent and properly insured surveyor"", the source said. They did not recognise the figure of 450,000 homeowners stuck in limbo. Only a ""small subset"" of buildings would benefit from the announcement, the UK Cladding Action Group said. Estimates by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government suggested that more than 800,000 homes would still require the EWS1. Some blocks which appeared to be built from solid brick were in fact ""clad with unknown materials behind the brick"", UK Finance and the Building Societies Association warned. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said it had agreed the announcement that buildings without cladding did not need the EWS1 assessments, but it added that it would still need to review the government advice before deciding what guidance to issue to surveyors. Sean Tompkins, RICS chief executive, said there had been an ""acute market shortage of fire engineers"" to carry out the checks. ""We are aware of the severe impact this has had on some homeowners and we agree that buildings without cladding should not be subject to the process,"" he said. Mr Jenrick also said the government was paying to train 2,000 more assessors within six months to speed up checks on blocks which did have cladding. But some cladding experts questioned whether the Â£700,000 in government funding would be enough. ""Do they think they can just give these people a two-day training course for Â£350?"" said Adrian Buckmaster, director of Tetraclad. ""You can't train experience in the built environment.""

"Saturday's rally followed previous protests since the start of the second lockdown Thirteen people have been arrested after an anti-lockdown protest in Liverpool on Saturday. Police originally held 15 peoplebut said some had been ""de-arrested and issued with fixed penalty notices"". Hundreds of people have gathered for weekend rallies since the second national lockdown began on 5 November. At Saturday's protest, a 36-year-old man, from Kirkby, was held on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker after an officer was pushed in the chest. The remaining 12 people were arrested for breaching coronavirus rules and public order. Police also implemented a dispersal zone in the city centre on Saturday, with officers having the power to ask people suspected of anti-social behaviour to leave the area and not return for up to 48 hours. They issued 25 fixed penalty notices and 10 dispersal notices. England's first city-wide mass testing programme started in Liverpool earlier this month About 33 people are reported to have died with the virus in the past week There were 1,155 reported cases in the week to 16 November, compared with 1,429 cases in the previous week Among the city's population of about 500,000, the rate has dropped to 232 per 100,000 from 287 Overall, there were 145,031 cases in England in the week to 16 November, or 258 per 100,000 More than 140,000 people in Liverpool have taken part in the country's first city-wide mass testing pilot,which started on 6 November.

"On Saturday night, Californians will be under stay-at-home orders after 22:00 California has begun a night-time curfew, in an attempt to curb a surge in coronavirus cases. The western state's latest figures are now worse than the previous peak in August, the Los Angeles Times reports. Across the US, the daily death toll linked to Covid-19 has passed 2,000 for the first time since May. The country has now more than 12 million confirmed infections, with more than 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This is by far the highest death toll in the world. About 187,000 new infections were recorded nationwide in the latest figures - released on Friday for the previous day - which is an all-time high. Several states have imposed new mask mandates and restrictions to try to combat the rise, and in Texas the National Guard is being deployed to the city of El Paso to help with morgue operations there. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Last year, an estimated 26 million people  passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday. On Friday, it was revealed thatPresident Donald Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, had tested positive for coronavirus. ""Apparently I got the 'rona,"" he said in a video on social media, adding that he was asymptomatic so far and quarantining. California reported a total of one million cases last week, making it the second state to do so after Texas. The new daily curfew, from 22:00 local time on Saturday (06:00 GMT Sunday) until 05:00, will carry on until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, according to authorities. Restaurants will be able to offer takeout and delivery outside these hours. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? The stay-at-home order affects 41 out of California's 58 counties, covering more than 94% of the state's population. Some 40m people live in California, the most populous state in the US. Some counties have also warned that a more severe lockdown could follow. The latest measures are not as strict as restrictions imposed between March and May, when all nonessential business and travel was prohibited. Other places, including New York City, are also operating a night-time curfew. Bars, restaurants and gyms are allowed to open until 22:00, but schools have been closed. The Californian curfew was announced by Governor Gavin Newsom. ""The virus is spreading at a pace we haven't seen since the start of this pandemic, and the next several days and weeks will be critical to stop the surge,"" he wrote in a statement. Hospital admissions are up 61% statewide in the last two weeks, according to the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ""The data looks really bad right now,"" said Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Friday. The CDC has recommended that Americans ""consider"" avoiding Thanksgiving travel and gatherings. ""It's not a requirement. It's a recommendation,"" said Dr Henry Walke, the CDC's Covid-19 incident manager, on Thursday. The following day, President Donald Trump re-tweeted the words of Republican Congressman Jim Jordan: ""Don't lockdown the country. Don't impose curfews. Don't close schools. Let Americans decide for themselves. And celebrate Thanksgiving."" The president and President-elect Joe Biden have both said they are against imposing a national lockdown, and favour letting states come up with their own rules. Californian authorities permit up to three households meeting outdoors On Thursday, the White House coronavirus task force had its first public briefing in months. Members, including Vice-President Mike Pence, noted the rise in coronavirus cases. The task force said indoor gatherings should be limited over the next couple of weeks. However on Saturday, US media noted that Mr Pence's wife, Karen, had sent out an invitation for a ""Christmas craft"" get-together at their home on 9 December for Congressional Club members. The White House has also so far declined to engage with Joe Biden and his incoming administration on policy, as Mr Trump refuses to concede the presidential contest.

"A tougher three-tiered system of local restrictions will come into force in England when the lockdown ends on 2 December, Downing Street has said. Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plan - including details of how families can see different households at Christmas - to MPs on Monday. More areas are set to be placed into the higher tiers to keep the virus under control, No 10 said. And some tiers will be strengthened to safeguard lockdown progress. Some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system, which was in place in England untilthe current lockdown began. But the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous restrictions were not strong enough. The government will identify the tiers that each area will be placed into on Thursday. What are the current rules where you live? England tiers may need strengthening - adviser Ministers want 'greater consistency' in tier system Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marr the 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants was one of the things it was looking to ""refine"". It is understood rules will be relaxed to give people an extra hour to finish their food and drinks after last orders at 10pm. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said this would help businesses - but would be ""meaningless"" unless people were allowed to socialise with friends and family, particularly over the crucial Christmas period. Pre-lockdown, there were three tiers of restrictions -medium, high, and very high: Medium / Tier 1:Rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm High / Tier 2:No household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm Very high / Tier 3:No household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed Newspaper reports suggest rules could be temporarily relaxed UK-wide over Christmas. Several families could be allowed to join in one ""bubble"" and mix between 22 and 28 December, according tothe Daily Telegraph,external. Ministers have made clear the festive season will be different to normal - with some restrictions expected to remain in place. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said conversations about Christmas between the different nations of the UK were ongoing. Sources believe a deal is probable later next week - but it is unlikely to be signed off before the prime minister's announcement on Monday. The four nations have different Covid rules but ministers are hoping to agree a joint approach for the festive period. Government ministers and advisers have been hinting about new tougher tiers over the past week. Before lockdown there was some evidence that tiers two and three were having an impact, but not tier one. Crucially, both the top two tiers involved banning mixing inside homes, so one option being discussed behind the scenes is introducing a ban across all the tiers until winter is over. The exception will, of course, be Christmas. That is a move that divides opinion. But the government sees it as a necessity, believing significant numbers of people will ignore any attempt to ban gatherings over the festive period. It is also a recognition the public needs a break from the long hard slog of the pandemic. Infection rates will of course rise, but that will be offset to some extent by a wider boost to wellbeing. Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool, said he hoped it would be possible to relax rules over Christmas if the new tiered system worked but warned ""there will be a price"", including tighter restrictions in the future. However, Prof Semple, who is a member of Sage, told Sky News's Sophy Ridge there was ""a lot to be optimistic about"". He said he expected mass vaccination of the general population to happen towards next summer, which would give ""broad immunity"" and allow a ""return back to normal"". MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system in the days before it comes into force. Many Conservative MPs are opposed to stricter measures, with 70 signing a letter coordinated by the recently-formed Covid Recovery Group (CRG), saying they cannot support a tiered approach unless they see evidence measures ""will save more lives than they cost"". Earlier this month, 32 Conservativesrebelled by voting against the current lockdownand 17 more, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, abstained. In a letter to the prime minister on Saturday, the CRG, led by former chief whip Mark Harper and ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker, warned against inflicting ""huge health and economic costs"". The letter said: ""We cannot live under such a series of damaging lockdowns and apparently arbitrary restrictions, and expect our constituents to be grateful for being let out to enjoy the festive season, only to have strict restrictions imposed on them afterwards that cause them health problems and destroy their livelihood."" Asked whether he would publish a cost-benefit analysis of any future measures, as called for by the CRG, the chancellor told Sky News it was ""very hard to be precise"" on the economic impacts of individual restrictions. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? Labour has so far supported the need for restrictions to slow the spread of Covid-19, making a Commons defeat on the plan unlikely. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told the BBC her party wanted clarity from the government over how tiers would be decided and the support available for businesses. On Saturday, the UK recorded another 19,875 new coronavirus cases and 341 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths was down from 511 on Friday, and 462 on Saturday 14 November.

"Americans should start being vaccinated against coronavirus in the coming days, providing some light at the end of the tunnel for the country with the highest death toll in the world. But the good news about vaccines comes as the US is experiencing its toughest period of the pandemic so far. The number of daily reported deaths is at a record high while both the number of infections and admissions to hospital continue to rise. Robert Redfield, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned that the next few months will be ""the most difficult in the public health history of this nation"". So why is the outlook so bleak and what will next year bring? The number of daily reported deaths began to increase substantially in November and it has now passed 3,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The highest number of deaths in one day during the spring outbreak, which was limited to states in the Northeast, was just below 2,800. If you ignore the recent slight drop in the seven-day average, which was caused by the limited reporting of data around the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November, the trend does not look good. Earlier this week, Dr Redfieldtold,externalthe Council on Foreign Relations think-tank that he expected the daily death toll to be higher than the 3,000 killed in the 9/11 attacks ""probably for the next 60 to 90 days"". At the moment, the US death toll stands at nearly 300,000 - the highest figure in the world and about a fifth of the global total of confirmed coronavirus deaths. How does the US compare to the rest of the world? One of the reasons the death toll is expected to rise at such a fast rate is because the number of infections is also still on the way up. With more than 15 million confirmed cases, the US has the highest number of infections in the world and the spread shows no sign of slowing down. The chart below shows that the current wave is still growing at a faster rate than the previous two - although some of that is down to increased levels of testing. During the spring wave, testing was mostly limited to confirming cases in people who were already in hospital, meaning the true scale of that outbreak wasn't fully captured. The latest data compiled by theCOVID Tracking Project,externalshows the number of cases was up by nearly 30% week on week, while testing was up by just 10%. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, has said we'll have to wait until mid-December to gauge what effect Thanksgiving gatherings have had on the numbers. But hewarned,externalthat Christmas will inevitably bring another increase in travelling and social contacts, which will lead to ""a very challenging period"". Because of the change in the level of testing, a better way to compare waves is to look at the number of people being admitted to hospital because of Covid-19. This data shows that roughly the same number of people across the US were in hospital during the first and second waves of the outbreak. But the current wave has seen far more Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital - more than 100,000 at the moment. The number of patients with coronavirus who are in intensive care units and on ventilators is also rising, which is another worrying sign - although treatments have improved since the spring outbreak. In arecent study,externalin New York, researchers found that the probability of death among coronavirus patients was down 18 percentage points from the spring, in part due to new treatments and better knowledge of the virus among medical staff. But these improvements are dependent on the quality of care being received, which is put at risk when hospitals reach capacity and staffing levels are put under pressure. Recent analysis of hospital admissions databy the New York Times,externalfound that one in 10 Americans lived in an area where intensive care units were either full or fewer than 5% of beds were available. One travel nurse's journey to US Covid hotspots The current wave of infections is the third one to hit the US this year but the one major difference is that it's affecting every region at the same time. The spring wave was predominantly in the Northeast, while the summer one hit the South and West hardest. This time around, it was the Midwest where infections rose fastest - but every region has seen a spike in cases. The Covid Exit Strategygroup,external, which is run by public health experts, ranks the progress each state is making in tackling the outbreak. At the moment, every state but Hawaii is categorised as having an ""uncontrolled spread"". The only region where the numbers are looking somewhat positive is the Midwest, although we'll have to wait another week or so to see whether cases continue to fall once the post-Thanksgiving data stabilises. The mask-wearing US city that bucked the trend Several states have brought in increased measures in recent days in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus, including California and New York. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf banned dining inside restaurants and introduced limits on social gatherings indoors,saying,external: ""We need to slow the spread right now in order to save lives. If we don't, we're going to be in big trouble."" Mr Wolf is himself isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. Dr Fauci has called on Americans to ""hang on"" until the vaccines arrive, saying key public health measures like social distancing and the wearing of face masks are crucial over the next few months. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make tackling the pandemic a top priority when he enters the White House on 20 January. He has set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people - nearly a third of the US population - within the first 100 days of his administration. Dr Fauci, who has accepted a role as Mr Biden's chief medical adviser,said,externallast week that if 75% of Americans can be vaccinated by next summer, the country may be able to return to ""some degree of normality"". However, arecent survey,externalby the Pew Research Center suggests that may be a challenge, with only 60% of people saying they would probably or definitely get the vaccine.

"Inmates have been working at the local morgue The US had just over nine million Covid-19 cases when November began - now, just weeks later, the country is topping 11 million. And one west Texas county has emerged as the latest American epicentre. Right on the border with Mexico, El Paso in Texas is known for its desert landscape, military complexes and plentiful sunshine. Now, it's making a name as one of the worst hit regions in the nation. Covid-19 patients account for more than half of all hospital admissions in the county of El Paso, and the case count continues to trend upwards. Here are five symptoms of the unfolding crisis. With cases going up by more than a thousand every day in El Paso, some 76,000 people have now been infected. That's about the same number of confirmed cases as in the whole of Greece or Libya. Data shows 1,120 El Paso residents are currently in hospital with the virus, and this number is expected to rise. That means that of all the Covid patients in hospital across the state of Texas, one in six is in El Paso,according to the latest figures,external. A total of 782 people are known to have died. Does the US have the worst coronavirus death rate? New curbs as US Covid-19 cases surpass 11 million Both hospitals and staff are struggling to cope. An El Paso University Medical Center spokesman said the hospital recognised the ""physical and emotional"" toll the pandemic was taking on healthcare workers. As officials race to keep up with the rapidly increasing number of sick people, El Paso city's convention centre was recently converted into a makeshift hospital to provide extra beds. Some facilities are so overrun that patients are being airlifted to other cities in the state. On Monday, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said the county had opened 500 extra hospital beds so far, but at the rate the virus was spreading, those beds would be full by next week. As hospitals grapple with too many patients, El Paso's morgue has been unable to keep up with the county's rising death toll. As a result, officials are turning to refrigerated trailers. Ten of these mobile morgues have been requested in recent weeks. The mobile facilities are set up outside the county's medical examiner's office, which has been handling more than 150 bodies in the last week. Earlier this month, the US defence department deployed medical teams to assist local health workers. Even the county's funeral homes are feeling the strain. One manager, Jorge Ortiz,told KERA News,externalhe has had to convert the home's chapel into a makeshift cooler. Mr Ortiz said the peak back in the summer is ""nothing compared to what we're living right now"". Is this Covid wave in US the worst yet? The city continues to face a shortage of staff, and officials have faced criticism for turning to local prisons for help. Inmates have been pictured handling the bodies of Covid victims at the medical examiner's office, helping load them into the mobile morgues. A sheriff's office spokesman said the inmates - who are minor offenders in minimum security prisons - are being compensated $2 (Â£1.5) an hour. The work is voluntary and they are being provided with protective gear, but the move has still shocked many. County Judge Samaniego called using inmates a last resort. ""If there's no personnel, no one to help out, and there's volunteers, even if they are inmates, then that's what we're left with,"" he said, according toKFOX14 News,external. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? The judge added that officials were waiting for Texas National Guardsmen to help with the efforts - but the military hasn't confirmed that they could handle the demand. In the last six months, one El Paso woman has lost six of her family members to the virus as the outbreak worsens. Bonnie Soria Najera toldGood Morning America,externalthat her uncle was the last to pass away on Sunday. She has also had to bury her parents, two aunts and a cousin. ""They were all being very careful,"" she said. ""They did things that they had to do: grocery stores, went to doctor's appointments."" These three symptoms cover 85% of coronavirus cases Ms Najera's mother first tested positive in May. Within three days, her mother was on a ventilator, she said. Her father soon fell ill with the virus too, but ended up at a different hospital. A week after her mother was admitted, she passed away. An hour later, Ms Najera learned her father was on a ventilator. He would pass away three weeks later. Ms Najera too, came down with Covid-19, but eventually recovered. As she began feeling better, she learned her cousin and her aunt had both died after contracting the virus. And last week, another aunt also passed away in hospital from Covid-19. Now, Ms Najera is calling for Texans to practise social distancing properly, like her family tried to. ""You don't want to be in our shoes,"" she said. Despite the worries of many El Pasoans, there's no lockdown in sight for the west Texas county. On Friday, a state appeals court overturned a stay-at-home order after local restaurant owners and the state attorney general sued Judge Samaniego for shutting down the city. A panel of judges ruled 2-1 that the order to close nonessential businesses until December went against the Texas governor's 7 October reopening guidance. Some businesses resumed operations almost immediately, local media reported. Attorney General Ken Paxton called Judge Samaniego a ""tyrant"" over the mandate. The county judge responded that it was ""unfortunate"" that the attorney general sought ""to gloat instead of coming to El Paso to walk along side me by the mobile morgues"". Judge Samaniego added he was disappointed by the decision, but noted that El Pasoans must still adhere to certain restrictions on masks, businesses and gatherings.

"On Saturday night, Californians will be under stay-at-home orders after 22:00 California has begun a night-time curfew, in an attempt to curb a surge in coronavirus cases. The western state's latest figures are now worse than the previous peak in August, the Los Angeles Times reports. Across the US, the daily death toll linked to Covid-19 has passed 2,000 for the first time since May. The country has now more than 12 million confirmed infections, with more than 255,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. This is by far the highest death toll in the world. About 187,000 new infections were recorded nationwide in the latest figures - released on Friday for the previous day - which is an all-time high. Several states have imposed new mask mandates and restrictions to try to combat the rise, and in Texas the National Guard is being deployed to the city of El Paso to help with morgue operations there. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also urged Americans to avoid travelling for the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November to prevent increased transmissions. Thanksgiving typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. Last year, an estimated 26 million people  passed through the country's airports in the week surrounding the holiday. On Friday, it was revealed thatPresident Donald Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, had tested positive for coronavirus. ""Apparently I got the 'rona,"" he said in a video on social media, adding that he was asymptomatic so far and quarantining. California reported a total of one million cases last week, making it the second state to do so after Texas. The new daily curfew, from 22:00 local time on Saturday (06:00 GMT Sunday) until 05:00, will carry on until 21 December, with a possible extension if needed, according to authorities. Restaurants will be able to offer takeout and delivery outside these hours. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? The stay-at-home order affects 41 out of California's 58 counties, covering more than 94% of the state's population. Some 40m people live in California, the most populous state in the US. Some counties have also warned that a more severe lockdown could follow. The latest measures are not as strict as restrictions imposed between March and May, when all nonessential business and travel was prohibited. Other places, including New York City, are also operating a night-time curfew. Bars, restaurants and gyms are allowed to open until 22:00, but schools have been closed. The Californian curfew was announced by Governor Gavin Newsom. ""The virus is spreading at a pace we haven't seen since the start of this pandemic, and the next several days and weeks will be critical to stop the surge,"" he wrote in a statement. Hospital admissions are up 61% statewide in the last two weeks, according to the Los Angeles Times newspaper. ""The data looks really bad right now,"" said Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Friday. The CDC has recommended that Americans ""consider"" avoiding Thanksgiving travel and gatherings. ""It's not a requirement. It's a recommendation,"" said Dr Henry Walke, the CDC's Covid-19 incident manager, on Thursday. The following day, President Donald Trump re-tweeted the words of Republican Congressman Jim Jordan: ""Don't lockdown the country. Don't impose curfews. Don't close schools. Let Americans decide for themselves. And celebrate Thanksgiving."" The president and President-elect Joe Biden have both said they are against imposing a national lockdown, and favour letting states come up with their own rules. Californian authorities permit up to three households meeting outdoors On Thursday, the White House coronavirus task force had its first public briefing in months. Members, including Vice-President Mike Pence, noted the rise in coronavirus cases. The task force said indoor gatherings should be limited over the next couple of weeks. However on Saturday, US media noted that Mr Pence's wife, Karen, had sent out an invitation for a ""Christmas craft"" get-together at their home on 9 December for Congressional Club members. The White House has also so far declined to engage with Joe Biden and his incoming administration on policy, as Mr Trump refuses to concede the presidential contest.

"This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win A judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign that sought to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in the battleground state. Judge Matthew Brann said the suit, which rested on allegations of irregularities, was ""without merit"". The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to next week certify Joe Biden's win - he leads by more than 80,000 votes. It is the latest blow to Donald Trump, who is trying to overturn his loss in the 3 November presidential election. He has refused to concede and made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The lack of a concession has upended the process that normally follows a US election. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked Mr Biden is projected to defeat President Trump 306 to 232 in the US electoral college, which determines who becomes president - far above the 270 he needs to win. The Trump campaign has lost a slew of lawsuits contesting results from the election, and its latest efforts focus on stopping the swing states that handed Mr Biden his win certifying the results - an essential step for the Democrat to be formally declared victor. In the rulingJudge Brann wrote that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"".,external He said his ""court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations"". ""In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state,"" the judge wrote. The Trump campaign argued that the state had violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law as some Democratic-run counties allowed voters to fix errors on their ballots while Republican-run counties did not. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election But in his ruling Judge Brann dismissed the claim, saying ""like Frankenstein's Monster"" it had been ""haphazardly stitched together"". He said even if it was the basis for a case then the Trump campaign's solution went too far. Few Republicans have called on the president to concede, but following the judge's ruling Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey said Mr Trump had exhausted all legal options in the state and urged him to accept the result. On Sunday afternoon, the Trump legal team confirmed they were appealing against the Pennsylvania decision. Earlier his lawyerRudy Giuliani said in a statement:,external""Today's decision turns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the US Supreme Court."" There is no standard route to the Supreme Court, but challenges would usually have to be upheld in a state court first, before the issue could be escalated. Legitimate federal or constitutional question would also have to be at the heart of the complaint. Also on Saturday the Trump campaign called for another recount inGeorgia, a day after a by-hand recount confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. The campaign said it ""has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards"". In another swing state won by Mr Biden,Michigan,Republican officials wrote to the state's electoral board to request a two-week delay in certifying the results. They called for an audit of the presidential vote in the largest county, home to Detroit, after it was contested by the Trump camp. But the Michigan Department of State said delays and audits were not permitted by law. InWisconsin, election officials accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. If the recount is not concluded by 1 December - the deadline for Wisconsin to certify its votes -  the way is open for the Trump camp to pursue a lawsuit. Mr Biden has a lead of more than 20,000 in the state. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one. They are voting for state electors who will then cast one vote each for president. These electors usually follow the will of the electorate - in Michigan, for instance, they should all vote for Joe Biden because he won the state. This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" The states get a varying number of votes, equivalent to the number of their representatives in the US Congress - the House and the Senate. What is the electoral college? Many world leaders have already congratulated Mr Bidenbased on his projected victory, as is customary in every US election. Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of the few holdouts. ""I want to assure you: there is no subtext here. It is not that we like or dislike someone - we are just waiting for the [US} domestic political stand-off to end,"" he told state television channel Rossiya 1 in an interview. After the 2016 US election, President Putin congratulated Mr Trump the morning after voting day. What is typically a mere formality during normal elections - the bipartisan certification of state vote totals - has become the latest battleground in the president's attempts to maintain power for the next four years. Could Trump actually be successful? It's not impossible, but the chances are very, very slim. First of all, the president would have to overturn the results in multiple states, where Biden's leads range from tens of thousands of votes to more than a hundred thousand. This isn't 2000, when everything came down just to Florida. What's more, many of the states Trump's legal team is targeting - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - have Democratic governors who are not going to sit idly by while all of this takes place. That doesn't mean Biden's supporters aren't worried, however. While the odds of this happening are along the lines of the earth being hit by a giant meteor or someone getting struck by lightning while winning the lottery, having victory snatched away at this point would be such a cataclysmic political event that the remote prospect of such a possibility is enough to give Democrats cold sweats.

The Viking Grace became stranded close to the port of Mariehamn on Saturday. The Coastguard said the ship was towed to the port on Sunday morning, and the passengers would be evacuated shortly. It earlier said the vessel was not leaking and no lives were in danger. The cause of the incident is being investigated. The ship, owned by the Viking Line, had been heading to the Swedish capital, Stockholm, from Turku in Finland.

"Campaigners want a public inquiry to establish ""truth, justice and accountability"" around the 1974 bombings A convoy of more than 100 cars and bikes marked the 46th anniversary of the Birmingham pub bombings. Friends and relatives of the 21 killed and 220 injured in the 1974 atrocity began in Aston and were ending at West Midlands Police's headquarters. Campaigners are calling for a public inquiry to establish ""truth, justice and accountability"". A 65-year-old man arrested over the bombings on Wednesday in Belfastwas released on Fridayafter questioning. The man, reported to be 65-year-old Michael Patrick Reilly, was held under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and has strongly denied any involvement in the bombings. Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 Six men - Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker - were wrongly jailed for life in 1975 for the attack. Last month, Home Secretary Priti Patel gave campaigners fresh hope by considering the case for a public inquiry, saying she ""recognised the desire to see those responsible brought to justice"". ""If we don't have hope, there's no point in us campaigning. We might as well give up,"" said Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine died in the bombings. ""But we will never give up, we will never go away until justice is seen to be done."" The convoy was ending at West Midlands Police headquarters in the city centre Inquests last year found an IRA warning call was ""inadequate"" for the purposes of ensuring that lives were not lost in the explosions. The call, made to the Birmingham Post and Mail at 20:11, gave the bomb locations as the Rotunda building and the nearby Tax Office in New Street but made no mention of pubs, costing the police vital minutes. The first bomb detonated in the Mulberry Bush seven minutes later, and the second exploded in the nearby Tavern in the Town shortly after.

"A picture of Jean Moulin sat on Daniel Cordier's bookshelf at his home on the French Riviera French Resistance figure Daniel Cordier - who has died at the age of 100 - was one of the last remaining heroes decorated by Charles de Gaulle for their role in fighting the Nazi occupation. His death on Friday leaves only one survivor among the 1,038 men and women who received the title ""Compagnons de la LibÃ©ration"" after World War Two. The son of a wealthy merchant in south-western France, Cordier first became involved in politics in the 1930s as a teenage member of the royalist far-right. France honours Resistance heroes How I escaped the Gestapo In June 1940, after German forces crushed the French army and the government of Marshall Philippe PÃ©tain sued for peace, Cordier's activism took a different turn. ""As my mother collapsed into my stepfather's arms, I raced upstairs and flung myself on my bed, and I sobbed. But then (â¦) I suddenly drew myself up, and I said to myself, 'But no, this is ridiculous,""Cordier recalled in a 2018 interview with the BBC. ""[PÃ©tain] is just a stupid old fool! We have to do something."" Daniel Cordier left to join the Free French in 1940 and returned in 1942 Three days later he and a few friends boarded a ship bound for French Algeria, which was seen as shelter for patriots who refused to surrender. But the vessel was diverted to Britain, where Cordier joined de Gaulle's Free French. He joined the movement's intelligence arm and was parachuted into central France in mid-1942. A high point in his life was his meeting with Jean Moulin, the man tasked by de Gaulle to co-ordinate Resistance groups. Cordier had come to deliver a message. The two men hit it off and he became the commander's right-hand man, based in Lyon. ""I admired Jean Moulin from the moment I first saw him,"" Cordier told the BBC.  ""He had an elegance and a kindness, and also a huge capacity for work. In his view, he was the Resistance. I hope in my own small way I was able to serve him as he wanted."" Ten months later Moulin was betrayed to the Gestapo and killed under torture. Cordier moved to Paris, where he continued to rally the resistance before escaping to London in 1944. After the war he became a painter and a successful art-dealer, promoting contemporary masters such as Braque and Dubuffet. He later credited Jean MouIin for initiating him into modern art. The education, he said, had begun as a kind of code. Moulin, he once said, decided to give him loud lectures on painters so as not to arouse suspicion when out and about in the danger zone that was occupied France. Cordier took part in World War II commemoration ceremonies until his late 90s Focused on his passion for art, Cordier did not speak publicly about his wartime past for decades. But he broke his silence in the 1970s, when a fellow Resistance hero portrayed Moulin - a hallowed figure in France - as a shambolic self-promoter and a Soviet agent. Outraged, Cordier decided to clear his former boss's name. Delving into his Resistance past, he sifted through Resistance archives and interviewed survivors. ""I knew it was not true. But to prove it, I had to go back to the records,"" he told the BBC in 2018. The work culminated in the publication of influential biographies of Moulin in the 1980s and 1990s. Controversy among historians continued over the nature of Moulin's links with the Communists - who after all were a key component of the Resistance Jean Moulin worked to unify. But Cordier's historical work helped refute many of the wilder allegations. His effort to expose the truth did not end there. In a 2009 autobiography Cordier came out as gay, saying it would have been ""utterly unthinkable"" when he was young.

"This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win A judge in Pennsylvania has dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign that sought to invalidate millions of mail-in votes in the battleground state. Judge Matthew Brann said the suit, which rested on allegations of irregularities, was ""without merit"". The move paves the way for Pennsylvania to next week certify Joe Biden's win - he leads by more than 80,000 votes. It is the latest blow to Donald Trump, who is trying to overturn his loss in the 3 November presidential election. He has refused to concede and made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The lack of a concession has upended the process that normally follows a US election. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked Mr Biden is projected to defeat President Trump 306 to 232 in the US electoral college, which determines who becomes president - far above the 270 he needs to win. The Trump campaign has lost a slew of lawsuits contesting results from the election, and its latest efforts focus on stopping the swing states that handed Mr Biden his win certifying the results - an essential step for the Democrat to be formally declared victor. In the rulingJudge Brann wrote that the Trump campaign had tried to ""disenfranchise almost seven million voters"".,external He said his ""court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations"". ""In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state,"" the judge wrote. The Trump campaign argued that the state had violated the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law as some Democratic-run counties allowed voters to fix errors on their ballots while Republican-run counties did not. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election But in his ruling Judge Brann dismissed the claim, saying ""like Frankenstein's Monster"" it had been ""haphazardly stitched together"". He said even if it was the basis for a case then the Trump campaign's solution went too far. Few Republicans have called on the president to concede, but following the judge's ruling Republican Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey said Mr Trump had exhausted all legal options in the state and urged him to accept the result. On Sunday afternoon, the Trump legal team confirmed they were appealing against the Pennsylvania decision. Earlier his lawyerRudy Giuliani said in a statement:,external""Today's decision turns out to help us in our strategy to get expeditiously to the US Supreme Court."" There is no standard route to the Supreme Court, but challenges would usually have to be upheld in a state court first, before the issue could be escalated. Legitimate federal or constitutional question would also have to be at the heart of the complaint. Also on Saturday the Trump campaign called for another recount inGeorgia, a day after a by-hand recount confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. The campaign said it ""has to include signature matching and other vital safeguards"". In another swing state won by Mr Biden,Michigan,Republican officials wrote to the state's electoral board to request a two-week delay in certifying the results. They called for an audit of the presidential vote in the largest county, home to Detroit, after it was contested by the Trump camp. But the Michigan Department of State said delays and audits were not permitted by law. InWisconsin, election officials accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes. They said observers for Mr Trump were in some cases challenging every single ballot to deliberately slow down proceedings. If the recount is not concluded by 1 December - the deadline for Wisconsin to certify its votes -  the way is open for the Trump camp to pursue a lawsuit. Mr Biden has a lead of more than 20,000 in the state. When Americans vote in a presidential election, they are actually voting in a state contest, not a national one. They are voting for state electors who will then cast one vote each for president. These electors usually follow the will of the electorate - in Michigan, for instance, they should all vote for Joe Biden because he won the state. This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" The states get a varying number of votes, equivalent to the number of their representatives in the US Congress - the House and the Senate. What is the electoral college? Many world leaders have already congratulated Mr Bidenbased on his projected victory, as is customary in every US election. Russian President Vladimir Putin is one of the few holdouts. ""I want to assure you: there is no subtext here. It is not that we like or dislike someone - we are just waiting for the [US} domestic political stand-off to end,"" he told state television channel Rossiya 1 in an interview. After the 2016 US election, President Putin congratulated Mr Trump the morning after voting day. What is typically a mere formality during normal elections - the bipartisan certification of state vote totals - has become the latest battleground in the president's attempts to maintain power for the next four years. Could Trump actually be successful? It's not impossible, but the chances are very, very slim. First of all, the president would have to overturn the results in multiple states, where Biden's leads range from tens of thousands of votes to more than a hundred thousand. This isn't 2000, when everything came down just to Florida. What's more, many of the states Trump's legal team is targeting - Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania - have Democratic governors who are not going to sit idly by while all of this takes place. That doesn't mean Biden's supporters aren't worried, however. While the odds of this happening are along the lines of the earth being hit by a giant meteor or someone getting struck by lightning while winning the lottery, having victory snatched away at this point would be such a cataclysmic political event that the remote prospect of such a possibility is enough to give Democrats cold sweats.

"Two fishermen are missing off the Sussex coast. One other has been rescued after their boat sank. A man has been rescued and two others remain missing after a fishing boat sank off the Sussex coast. A search began in the sea off Seaford, near Newhaven, when the coastguard received an alert from the ship's emergency beacon at about 06:00 GMT. A man was found clinging to a buoy and was taken to hospital. Two crew members from the boat, the Joanna C, remain missing. The search for them was suspended at 23:00 and will resume at first light on Sunday. The emergency signal put the 45ft scalloping vessel, registered in Brixham, about three nautical miles off the coast. Two helicopters and two lifeboats were deployed and a coastguard rescue team has been sent to check for sightings from the shore. Other fishing boats in the area have also been helping with the search. Piers Stanbury, HM Coastguard controller, said: ""Thankfully one of the three people on board at the time of sinking has been pulled out of the water and brought to shore by the Newhaven RNLI lifeboat but the intensive air and sea search for the two missing crew continues.

"This video can not be played Richard Boatwright said Google refused to remove fake reviews which are damaging his business A car sales business owner says he is taking legal action against Google over a series of fake and damaging reviews.

"Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner have met England's regional mayors to discuss ""shifting power out of Westminster"". The UK has had devolved governments since the late 1990s, which work alongside the Westminster Parliament. There are different types of devolution across the UK's nations and parts of England. For many years England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were run by the UK government, based in Westminster in London, but there were growing calls to transfer some of this power to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Public votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and on both sides of the Northern Irish/Irish border in 1998 as part ofthe Good Friday Agreement. This led to the creation of three elected institutions: the Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales (now called the Senedd) the Northern Ireland Assembly. A number of mayoral posts have also been introduced in England, with varying powers. Speaking ahead of her meeting with the mayors, Ms Rayner said that ""for too long"" Westminster had ""tightly gripped control"" and ""held back opportunities for towns, cities and villages across the UK"". Sir Keir said the government will let ""those with skin in the game - those that know their communities - make much better decisions"". Mayors will be required to draw up local plans to boost economic growth, which is one of the new government's five ""missions"". Mayors visit Downing Street for devolution talks The UK government in Westminster remains responsible for policies which affect just England, as well as overall policy in a number of areas. These include defence and national security, foreign policy, immigration, citizenship and tax - although Scotland has its own powers to raise and lower income tax. The Scottish Parliament sits at Holyrood in Edinburgh. There are 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Scotland already had its own legal and education system. After devolution, it became responsible for many other areas, including: Agriculture, forestry and fishing Education Environment Health Housing Justice, policing and courts Local government Some transport Taxes including income tax, stamp duty and air passenger duty Some welfare powers Its powers were extended in 2012, after the 2014 referendum on whether Scotland should become independent, and again in 2016 through the Scotland Act. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has formed the Scottish government at Holyrood since 2007, continues to argue for full independence. Timeline of Scottish devolution Since May 2020, the National Assembly of Waleshas been known as the Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament).It meets in Cardiff Bay, and is made up of 60 elected Members of the Senedd (MS). The Senedd's responsibilities include: Agriculture, forestry and fishing Education Environment Health and social care Housing Local government Highways and transport Some control over income tax, stamp duty and landfill tax Welsh language Timeline of Welsh devolution The Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast. There are 90 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Devolution in Northern Ireland is different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories: Transferred powerscontrolled by the Northern Ireland Assembly Reserved powersremain with Westminster, but could be transferred in the future if the Northern Ireland Executive wants them. These include prisons and civil defence Excepted powerscannot be moved to Stormont without special laws being made in Westminster. They include elections and national defence Stormont's main powers include: Agriculture Education Environment and planning Health and social services Local government Justice, policing and prisons Control over air passenger duty Transport Culture, language and sport The power-sharing agreement between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland is also key. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister - one representing each of the two largest parties in power - jointly lead the government in a mandatory coalition. Despite different job titles, they have the same powers. The assembly was dissolved for three years afterrelations broke down between governing parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in- in January 2017. The two parties re-entered devolved government in January 2020 alongside three smaller parties - the Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance. But in February 2022, the DUP again boycotted the executive in protest against post-Brexit trade agreements. Two years later,devolved government was restoredwhen the DUP agreed to returnafter reaching a new trade deal with Westminster. Over the past 20 years, more powers have been given to local and regional mayors in areas like transport and housing. The Mayor of London was the first role of this kind, created alongside the London Assembly, after a referendum in 1998.

"Americans should start being vaccinated against coronavirus in the coming days, providing some light at the end of the tunnel for the country with the highest death toll in the world. But the good news about vaccines comes as the US is experiencing its toughest period of the pandemic so far. The number of daily reported deaths is at a record high while both the number of infections and admissions to hospital continue to rise. Robert Redfield, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned that the next few months will be ""the most difficult in the public health history of this nation"". So why is the outlook so bleak and what will next year bring? The number of daily reported deaths began to increase substantially in November and it has now passed 3,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The highest number of deaths in one day during the spring outbreak, which was limited to states in the Northeast, was just below 2,800. If you ignore the recent slight drop in the seven-day average, which was caused by the limited reporting of data around the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November, the trend does not look good. Earlier this week, Dr Redfieldtold,externalthe Council on Foreign Relations think-tank that he expected the daily death toll to be higher than the 3,000 killed in the 9/11 attacks ""probably for the next 60 to 90 days"". At the moment, the US death toll stands at nearly 300,000 - the highest figure in the world and about a fifth of the global total of confirmed coronavirus deaths. How does the US compare to the rest of the world? One of the reasons the death toll is expected to rise at such a fast rate is because the number of infections is also still on the way up. With more than 15 million confirmed cases, the US has the highest number of infections in the world and the spread shows no sign of slowing down. The chart below shows that the current wave is still growing at a faster rate than the previous two - although some of that is down to increased levels of testing. During the spring wave, testing was mostly limited to confirming cases in people who were already in hospital, meaning the true scale of that outbreak wasn't fully captured. The latest data compiled by theCOVID Tracking Project,externalshows the number of cases was up by nearly 30% week on week, while testing was up by just 10%. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, has said we'll have to wait until mid-December to gauge what effect Thanksgiving gatherings have had on the numbers. But hewarned,externalthat Christmas will inevitably bring another increase in travelling and social contacts, which will lead to ""a very challenging period"". Because of the change in the level of testing, a better way to compare waves is to look at the number of people being admitted to hospital because of Covid-19. This data shows that roughly the same number of people across the US were in hospital during the first and second waves of the outbreak. But the current wave has seen far more Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital - more than 100,000 at the moment. The number of patients with coronavirus who are in intensive care units and on ventilators is also rising, which is another worrying sign - although treatments have improved since the spring outbreak. In arecent study,externalin New York, researchers found that the probability of death among coronavirus patients was down 18 percentage points from the spring, in part due to new treatments and better knowledge of the virus among medical staff. But these improvements are dependent on the quality of care being received, which is put at risk when hospitals reach capacity and staffing levels are put under pressure. Recent analysis of hospital admissions databy the New York Times,externalfound that one in 10 Americans lived in an area where intensive care units were either full or fewer than 5% of beds were available. One travel nurse's journey to US Covid hotspots The current wave of infections is the third one to hit the US this year but the one major difference is that it's affecting every region at the same time. The spring wave was predominantly in the Northeast, while the summer one hit the South and West hardest. This time around, it was the Midwest where infections rose fastest - but every region has seen a spike in cases. The Covid Exit Strategygroup,external, which is run by public health experts, ranks the progress each state is making in tackling the outbreak. At the moment, every state but Hawaii is categorised as having an ""uncontrolled spread"". The only region where the numbers are looking somewhat positive is the Midwest, although we'll have to wait another week or so to see whether cases continue to fall once the post-Thanksgiving data stabilises. The mask-wearing US city that bucked the trend Several states have brought in increased measures in recent days in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus, including California and New York. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf banned dining inside restaurants and introduced limits on social gatherings indoors,saying,external: ""We need to slow the spread right now in order to save lives. If we don't, we're going to be in big trouble."" Mr Wolf is himself isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. Dr Fauci has called on Americans to ""hang on"" until the vaccines arrive, saying key public health measures like social distancing and the wearing of face masks are crucial over the next few months. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make tackling the pandemic a top priority when he enters the White House on 20 January. He has set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people - nearly a third of the US population - within the first 100 days of his administration. Dr Fauci, who has accepted a role as Mr Biden's chief medical adviser,said,externallast week that if 75% of Americans can be vaccinated by next summer, the country may be able to return to ""some degree of normality"". However, arecent survey,externalby the Pew Research Center suggests that may be a challenge, with only 60% of people saying they would probably or definitely get the vaccine.

"Yes campaigners outside the Scottish Parliament building after 2014 referendum saw a majority for No Opinion polls suggest a consistent majority of Scots are now in favour of independence. What is driving this surge in support? When Scotland awoke one grey autumn morning in 2014, it seemed that nothing much had changed. For a start, the weather was typically Scottish - damp, dreary, drizzly - for another, the union with England, which had endured for more than three centuries, remained unbroken. After years of passionate disagreement, the votes had been counted overnight and Scotland had decided against becoming an independent country by 55.3% to 44.7% - a substantial but not overwhelming margin. Six more spins around the sun and the independence campaign continues, in a very different world. The independence campaign continues in a very different world The UK has withdrawn from the European Union despite a majority in Scotland opposing that move. A deadly virus has ravaged the globe, leaving more than a million people dead. Lockdown and other restrictions have left the UK economy reeling, with the UK government borrowing mind-boggling sums to support unemployed workers and save shuttered businesses. The powers - and limits - of the Scottish Parliament, particularly over health and education, have been demonstrated more dramatically than at any point since they were devolved from London to Edinburgh in 1999. The contrasting styles of Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been plain to see. Even the climate can be said to have changed. Research suggests that last year, for the first time, a majority in every age group in Scotland regarded climate change as an immediate and urgent problem. As a result oil, once Scotland's most valuable asset, has gone very much out of fashion. Amid all this turmoil, the public mood, it seems, has shifted too. In the past four months nine opinion polls in a row have indicated that Scottish independence is now backed by a majority of voters, the most sustained period of support for secession in modern history. One recent survey,by Ipsos MORI for STV News,external, suggested that the ""yes"" vote had risen to a record high of 58%, excluding those who answered ""don't know"". Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, says that poll may be an outlier but even so he reckons support for independence is running at an average of 54%. Why are more Scots supporting independence? Sir John has also noted that the gender gap, which saw women more reluctant than men to support independence, seems to have vanished and that increasing numbers of younger voters appear to favour leaving the UK. Sally Williams says independence has nothing to do with nationalism ""We're in a completely different landscape now,"" says Sally Williams, speaking in a field on her farm near Earlston, some 20 miles from the border with England. ""Brexit is a huge factor,"" she adds, explaining why she supports independence, while being jostled by her herd of lowing dairy cows eager for some more feed. In 2014 the central case against independence was that it would jeopardise Scottish prosperity. It was claimed that mortgages, jobs and savings would be endangered and that an independent Scotland did not know what currency it would use. Opponents said it could not possibly raise enough taxes to fund its high levels of public spending and that it would be forced to leave the European Union to boot. It was largely an appeal to pragmatism not emotion, a transactional rather than a cultural case for the UK. It became known, thanks to an ill-advised joke by one of its advisers, as Project Fear. Effective at the time, the message's durability is now in doubt for three reasons. First, the more that campaigners for the union highlight Scotland's dependence on tax receipts from the richer south east of England, the less attractive such a state of affairs may appear. Increasing numbers of voters in England are asking why they should be writing the cheques and many north of the border are wondering why Scotland is poorer than other parts of the UK in the first place. Secondly, it did not resolve widespread Scottish discontent about being ruled, at a UK level, by a Conservative party, which is consistently far less popular north of the border. Thirdly, and perhaps most obviously, it assumed those British waters would remain calm and the voyage serene. Instead the seas have been stormy. On 23 June 2016 a majority of voters across the UK opted to leave the EU. In Scotland, the one million people who wanted to leave the EU were far less than the 1.66 million who wanted to Remain. The leave vote was unaffected by Scotland and Northern Ireland favouring remain, prompting Nicola Sturgeon to declare that there had been a ""material change"" in circumstances which justified asking Scots whether they had now changed their minds about rejecting independence. ""Brexit has put the tin lid on it for Scotland,"" says Ms Williams. ""We were told there wasn't going to be a border in Ireland and now who knows how they're going to fix that?"" she says. ""We were told there was an oven-ready deal [with the EU], that it would be the easiest deal in history, and we're not getting any of that."" Not far from the US president Donald Trump's golf course on the Aberdeenshire coast, Michelle Stephen farms some 600 ewes and 10 rams (or tups, as they're known in Scotland). She opposes Brexit and worries about its impact but she does have concerns about independence which are practical and specific. Michelle Stephen farms some 600 ewes ""We need to know what would happen if we did separate from England,"" she says. ""I think we are better off staying [in the UK] and then we've got a louder voice to make trade agreements with other countries, not just the EU, but other countries as well."" This is the conflicting effect of Brexit on Scotland's current constitutional debate. One argument holds that it strengthens the political case for leaving the UK (Scotland didn't vote for it), the other that it weakens the economic case (why compound the uncertainty?) The SNP's major argument is that decisions about what is best for future governance are fundamentally different depending on whether you are in London or Edinburgh. This is the case for independence it is likely to advance in any future referendum. It wants Scotland to have the ability to implement policies tailored to the specific needs of the Scottish, rather than the UK, economy. Ms Sturgeon has confirmed that her party's manifesto for next May's Scottish Parliament elections will contain a commitment to a second referendum, or indyref2 as it has become known on social media. She is hoping to win a majority of seats and the polls suggest that outcome is likely. But the power to hold a referendum resides with Westminster. The 2014 poll was only arranged when London agreed to temporarily transfer that power to Edinburgh. Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he will not consent to a second votebut there are indications that some members of his governing Conservative party regard that position as unsustainable,external. Something else has changed in the past six years: oil. Since BP discovered the giant Forties field in the North Sea off Aberdeen in 1970, the 'black gold' has fuelled the independence movement. Most of the UK's oil is in the waters off Scotland ""It's Scotland's Oil"" was a rallying slogan for the SNP in the 1970s. For years the party pointed to prosperous Norway, which used the proceeds of its share of North Sea oil to set up a vastly profitable investment fund, as an example of the wealth an independent Scotland could enjoy. The UK government, which controls the tax revenue from the British sector of the North Sea, most of which is in Scottish waters, never set up such a fund. Those arguments have faded as the price of the commodity has collapsed, the industry has contracted, with thousands of job losses in Aberdeen, and the conversation about tackling climate change has made it politically trickier to extol the benefits of fossil fuels. In the run-up to the 2014 referendum, the Scottish government published a prospectus for independence which mentioned the word ""oil"" more than 140 times. It predicted North Sea taxation revenues of between Â£6.8bn and Â£7.9bn in 2016/17, which it suggested would be the first year of independence. The actual revenue in that period was less than nothing, minus Â£24m. In the Angus county town of Forfar, Owen Foster reckons this was a devastating blow to the SNP's credibility. Owen set up a farm shop business with the help of his parents Mr Foster did something unusual for this year. He started a business. A few years ago, as a schoolboy keen to earn some money, he had asked his grandmother to teach him how to make jam. Within a week he had sold 50 jars. And in lockdown he went one step further, opening a farm shop with the help of his parents. The Foster family are no fans of independence. ""Back in 2014 one of the main points that was put to us was the oil industry was going to be one of the big incomes,"" says Mr Foster, He adds: ""There's just not the money there any more to go independent."" Leaving the UK, he says, would lead to a ""massive crash in the economy"". ""We don't have the borrowing power that the UK has because it's got the Bank of England. It's got the pound."" Claire Millar says Aberdeen is divided between rich and poor On a housing estate in North East Scotland, Claire Millar says the talk of prosperity within the UK and riches from the North Sea is almost beside the point. In 2014, as an active member of the Labour Party in Aberdeenshire, Ms Millar campaigned for the union under the umbrella of the official ""No"" campaign, which was styled Better Together, an uneasy alliance of Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat politicians. She says the black gold did not benefit the poorer parts of Scotland's oil capital. Rather, the profits went to wealthy suburbs and multinational companies while the tax revenues flowed to Whitehall. Aberdeen, she says, is ""a tale of two cities,"" with a lot of wealth from oil but also a lot of poverty too. ""Just five years ago I hadn't heard of food banks in Aberdeen and now they're popping up everywhere,"" she adds. ""By staying part of the [UK] we were going to keep our European citizenship. That was the main promise and that's been broken. ""I feel betrayed now because I believed what I was told by the Better Together campaign and the Westminster establishment and what I was telling people on the doorsteps was effectively lies,"" she adds. Her mistake in campaigning for the union in 2014, she says, was to assume that Labour would sweep back to power and ""sort everything out."" Instead she laments, ""we're on the third Tory prime minister."" This democratic deficit has been a refrain of the independence movement for decades but it has been given new life byBoris Johnson, who is deeply unpopular in Scotland.,external By contrastNicola Sturgeon's opinion poll ratings have soared,externalduring the pandemic, even among many voters who oppose her party and its aims. In a leafy suburb in north west Edinburgh, Gail Buckie has just returned from the school run with her two children. In 2014 she ""played it safe"" and voted to remain in the union. ""I didn't want to take the risk,"" she says. But the coronavirus, and especially the First Minister's daily presence in televised briefings and her consistent messaging, has changed Ms Buckie's mind. ""Seeing how Nicola has handled the situation has really made me see that Scotland's a lot stronger than I initially thought it was,"" she says. ""It feels like we've all really been sticking together, which is something I think we're not seeing in the United Kingdom as a whole,"" she adds. Amy Lee Fraioli has had a change of heart since 2014 While there is clearly movement among Scottish voters towards independence there is also some in the other direction. Scotland's populous central belt was hardest hit by the virus. In Lanarkshire, one of the health board areas which remain under tight restrictions, pandemic and politics are colliding. Since voting for independence six years ago, Amy Lee Fraioli, from Blantyre, has had a change of heart. Now she works for the Labour Party and promotes the union she once opposed. ""We're in the middle of a global pandemic,"" says Ms Fraioli. ""And had Scotland voted independence in 2014, we would have been very unstable economically at this point. ""We couldn't have given the economic support that the UK government's given"", she says, pointing in particular to the Job Retention Scheme introduced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak to subsidise wages of furloughed workers. So why, then, is support for independence rising? ""I don't think there's any doubt about the fact that it's because Nicola Sturgeon's a fantastic communicator,"" admits Ms Fraioli. Communication is one thing. Saving lives and protecting jobs is another - and global comparisons suggest that England, Wales and Scotland have all performed poorly. A study of 22 industrialised countries by Imperial College, London, found thatEngland, Wales and Spain had the highest level of excess deaths from all causes in the first wave of the pandemic between February and May,external, around 100 per 100,000 people. After Italy, Scotland had the next highest rate, 86 excess deaths per 100,000 people. ""If you actually look at how well the Scottish government are performing, it's not very good at all,"" says Meghan Gallacher, a Conservative councillor in Motherwell, pointing to hundreds of Covid-19 deaths of older people in care homes and the introduction of restrictions which she says are harming businesses. ""We shouldn't link the pandemic to the future of Scotland's place within the United Kingdom,"" she insists. ""It shouldn't be the focus of any government just now to look at the constitution,"" says Ms Gallacher. Keiran O'Neill is standing for Labour in North Glasgow at the Holyrood elections Keiran O'Neill, who hopes to be elected for the Labour Party in the north of Glasgow in May's Holyrood elections, agrees. Like Ms Fraioli, he has switched from opposing the union to supporting it. Mr O'Neill though wants his party to publicly embrace and promote a restructured, federal UK with more powers for Holyrood and regional parliaments south of the border. ""England would remain a nation, but it would have to be broken up into different regions,"" he says. The constitution discussion is not new. Two days before the2014 referendum, the Daily Record newspaper published a front page headlined ""The Vow"", promising ""extensive new powers"" for Holyrood. It was signed by then Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. Extra powers have indeed been devolved, and used,for example the ability to vary the rate of income tax and the drink-drive limit,external, but the argument about the extent of devolution continues with a fight over theframework for repatriating powers from Brussels and the impact of any future trade deals on the devolved administrations in London, Cardiff and Belfast. The sustainability of the UK government's position on this issue, and on a referendum itself, is in question. At present Mr Johnson continues to insist that there will be no second referendum on independencebut a leaked policy document reportedly advises the Conservative party that continuing on such a course could prove ""counterproductive"",externaland that the Tories should consider a package of additional powers for Edinburgh if there is a pro-independence majority in May's Holyrood elections. The SNP, meanwhile, is divided about how to proceed if the prime minister continues simply to say no to a new vote. Anum Qaisar-Javed wants the power to hold a legal referendum Anum Qaisar-Javed, a former Labour Party member now attempting to be selected to run for a seat in the Scottish Parliament for the SNP in Lanarkshire,insists the approach must be the same as in 2014, securing the agreement of the UK government for a transfer of the power to hold a referendum from Westminster to Holyrood under Section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. ""The mechanism has to be in a legal manner,"" she says. ""We can't have an illegal referendum. We can't just declare independence."" But many grassroots members of the independence movement think another option may be needed. When Mary McCabe started campaigning for independence US troops were still fighting in Vietnam and the Beatles had just released Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. More than 50 years later, she is handing out leaflets in Glasgow city centre as part of a group called Pensioners for Independence. Ms McCabe wants the SNP to signal in its manifesto for May's elections that it would be prepared to organise its own referendum if Downing Street continues to block one, and that the party should try to win international support for its right to do so. ""By all the rules of self-determination, we should have it as soon as we get yet another mandate,"" she says. For Ms McCabe the landscape has changed utterly since she began her political journey in 1967. She points out that the Conservatives, now the main opposition party in the Scottish Parliament, opposed devolution in the referendums of 1979 and 1997. ""People thought the earth would stop turning if we got our own parliament for devolved matters and suddenly they saw it was actually run quite efficiently,"" she says. Back in the sixties, she adds she was often in a minority of one in wanting independence. ""Now it's mainstream,"" she says. Why are more Scots supporting independence?

"Queen's University in Belfast will begin an asymptomatic coronavirus testing programme on campus on Monday as part of a national pilot scheme. This month the government confirmed it wasplanning to carry out mass testing of students for Covid-19. Queen's University said testing would allow students who had remained on campus for the first term to return home for Christmas ""with confidence"". It expects to conduct 6,000 weekly tests by the end of December. It said the testing, which will continue in the second term, would help ensure its campus remained a safe place. ""The tests will be conducted using lateral flow devices that have recently been approved for use as a screening device for Covid-19,"" it said. ""These tests can give rapid results, although participants are required to have two tests no less than three days apart."" Rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests need high levels of the virus in the body in order to work. Some health professionals have raised concerns about the accuracy of rapid tests, warning thatthey may miss as many as half of coronavirus cases,external. About 90,000 people were tested inthe first week of a mass-testing trial in Liverpoolusing the ""lateral flow"" system. Queen's University said it was pleased to ""be one of the first places in the UK to pilot asymptomatic testing at scale"". What is mass testing and how does it work? It emphasised that the pilot scheme was ""for those who are not displaying symptoms"" of the virus. The scheme has been backed by Health Minister Robin Swann who said he welcomed the university's participation. ""[It] will help us to understand how asymptomatic testing can be implemented and extended more widely in the future to other parts of Northern Ireland,"" said the minister. The president and vice-chancellor of the university, Prof Ian Greer, said the university was ""keen to be involved"" in the testing programme after being approached to take part. ""We hope that the programme will help the health authorities to develop the best approach to mass testing whilst... helping us to drive down instances of the virus in our campus community and keeping it safe for our staff and students,"" he said.

"Care home resident John Duffy is a much loved father and grandad When John Duffy's family came to visit him, looking through a window into his care home on Monday, he burst into tears. It was his 71st birthday. When his daughter asked him why he was crying, he replied: ""Because I haven't seen you in so long."" Coronavirus restrictions on care homes meant his family had not been able to visit him over the previous six weeks. But because it was his birthday, an exception was made - and the Duffys were allowed a brief ""window visit"". Like many families, the Duffys' only face-to-face contact is through a care home window Donna Duffy appreciated the home's gesture for her father, who has dementia, and also understands care homes must obey rules to protect vulnerable residents from Covid-19. But eight months into the pandemic, the Belfast woman said she believes current visiting arrangements are damaging the mental and emotional well-being of residents and their families. A protest was staged on the rules around visiting loved ones at care homes at Stormont on Saturday Ms Duffy and other campaigners staged a protest at Stormont on Saturday to highlight the isolation and ""loneliness"" felt by residents and their loved ones. ""Every human needs emotional warmth,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I need to be able to hold my daddy's hand again and tell him that he's ok."" John Duffy has spent several weeks without family visitors Care homes have been badly affected by Covid-19 and stringent visiting guidelines were introduced to protect residents from infection. Out of a total of 483 care homes in Northern Ireland, nearly 30% (143) are currently dealing with confirmed Covid-19 outbreaks. Reducing footfall in care homes is viewed by home managers as ""one of the most effective measures"" in minimising infection, according to the Department of Health's most recent guidance. But the same document acknowledges restricted visiting has ""contributed to an emotional trauma"" caused by separating residents from family members. John Duffy with his wife and daughters Ms Duffy believes residents need face-to-face visits from family. She said the risk could be ""managed"" through regular testing and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). ""No-one wants to put anyone at risk, we're not asking for whole families to be allowed in,"" she said. Instead, she is calling for one person from each family to be awarded the ""same status as key workers"", and be given access to PPE and testing, so residents can maintain physical contact with loved ones. Other relatives who took in Saturday's protest included Martina Ferguson. Before the pandemic began, she visited her 87-year-old mother every evening, ""tucking her into bed"" at her County Armagh care home. Her mother, Ursula Derry, has advanced dementia. The pensioner can no longer speak or walk, but she can still ""smile and giggle and laugh,""  according to her daughter. ""She recognises me - even when I'm wearing a mask."" Martina Ferguson with her mum, Ursula Derry, in the month before lockdown Their daily visits stopped abruptly at the start of lockdown in March and the lack of face-to-face contact over the past eight months has been difficult for both mother and daughter. ""I feel like I'm grieving the loss of someone who is still alive,"" Ms Ferguson said. Like many families across the UK, their visits are now little more than a wave through a care home window. ""I go round to my mummy's bedroom window, I wave and try to talk to her through the glass. ""My mummy is lonely,"" she added, fighting back tears. ""She must feel abandoned."" Ursula Derry, pictured through the window of her care home bedroom earlier this month Ursula Derry is not used to being separated from family for long periods. Born as a twin in the early 1930s, she raised six children and is now a great-grandmother. But the pensioner has ""become withdrawn"" in recent months, according to her daughter, who fears she is suffering emotionally from the separation from her loved ones. Ms Ferguson is calling on homes to ""strike a balance"" on family visits to protect residents' mental and emotional well-being. Ursula Derry and her daughter, Martina Ferguson, at a wedding She also believes risks could be managed with strict infection control measures, pointing to her experience when her mother was taken into hospital for 13 days in July. Wearing PPE, Ms Ferguson was able to be at her mother's bedside on the ward, hold her hand and comfort her for the first time in months. When Mrs Derry was discharged from hospital, she was readmitted to her care home and has had no physical contact with her daughter since the summer. Fearing the pandemic will continue well into next year, Ms Ferguson said homes must find ways to accommodate visits to prevent months of further separation. Ms Duffy's father is also a big part of her family's life and is much missed by his grandchildren. ""My six-year-old niece is asking if Santa Claus will bring grandad home for Christmas,"" she said. ""She says Santa can take any of her toys off her list, as long as he brings her grandad."" John Duffy with his granddaughter, celebrating his 70th birthday in November 2019 But there are no easy answers to the unprecedented challenges faced by health staff, trying to keep the most vulnerable people in our society healthy, happy and safe from infection. Care home residents account for more than 40% of all Northern Ireland's Covid-related deaths. John Duffy's family was at the protest on Saturday In a statement, the Department of Health said the department's minister, Robin Swann, ""fully recognises how difficult and upsetting it is for people in care homes not to see their loved ones"". Acknowledging homes face ""challenges"" in safeguarding residents from Covid-19, the statement added ""every effort should continue to be made to ensure residents maintain important social connections"". Thedepartment issued guidance in September,externalon a risk-assessed approach to visiting which included ""safely managed face-to-face visits as well as virtually-supported connections"". That guidance also encouraged homes to develop a ""care partner arrangement"" with individuals who have a pre-existing relationship with residents. The protest took place at the steps of Stormont This could be a family member or friend who carried out a caring or support role for a resident before visits were restricted. The document said that care partners may quickly pick up on a resident's discomfort, illness or upset because they know the person so well.  It also recognises the absence of that support can cause distress. Ms Ferguson and Ms Duffy support the idea of care partners but complain that some homes are not implementing the guidance. Martina Ferguson taking her mum to a tea party a few years ago Ms Duffy called for the guidance to be replaced by legislation, suggesting that until it has legal force, care homes can ""pick and choose"" their own visiting rules. She also said homes need more support from the department to introduce the changes. Itslatest guidance,external, the department states the care partner concept ""will be applied differently for individual residents"" and each care home will be responsible for agreeing how it is applied. However, the department said it is in talks about providing ""assurances"" on how visiting guidance and the care partner concept are implemented.

"Testing began at 09:00 GMT inside Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre Hundreds of people queued as mass testing began in Merthyr Tydfil, set up to try and curb the spread of Covid. Up to 60,000 people could be tested in total, with those without symptoms urged to take a test. It prompted concerns some could be left hard up if told to self-isolate weeks before Christmas. Shirley Jones, 82 whose partner died just 24 hours earlier while awaiting cancer treatment delayed due to the pandemic, was the first to be tested. She said: ""I could've stayed in this morning and not come because I was grieving, but I knew I had to do the right thing in coming up here for myself for our community. ""And I pray to God that everybody comes up and has a test like I have."" Ms Jones said her partner, Desmond Rogers, 83, who died at the town's Prince Charles Hospital, had bowel cancer which spread to his stomach and throat. ""I couldn't say goodbye to him,"" she told the PA news agency. Shirley Jones said she ""knew I had to do the right thing in coming up here"" Anyone living or working in the county can now get a test, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and queues have formed at the town's testing centre. On Saturday Merthyr council also revealedthe full list of testing sites and their opening times,external. Merthyr council has created a regional helpline for those who test positive or were contacted by tracers and told to self-isolate. The Welsh Government has set up apayment scheme for those on low wages. Council leader Kevin O'Neill confirmed about 60,000 people could be tested. ""We want that response today of people coming along who are not symptomatic,"" he said. ""We can seek out the disease where we don't know where it is, where people haven't got the symptoms,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales. ""This is all about getting something in place that will work for the rest of the country."" People have been queueing around the leisure centre to get tested There's a queue around the block outside the Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre this morning - it's the first mass-Covid testing centre in Wales, opening weeks after the area was given the title of the worst affected place in the whole of the UK. The cases in Merthyr Tydfil have reduced considerably, but people here are keen to get tested even if they have no symptoms. Eileen Nelson, who has lived in Merthyr her whole life, said she would be getting a test because it was ""essential"" and ""everybody should take advantage of it"". At a first glance, it looks like it's going to be a busy first day for the test centre. The rise in cases had been blamed on people visiting friends and relatives living close by At the start of November, the county had the highest rate of coronavirus in the UK. While the case rate has fallen dramatically in recent weeks, it remains among the worst hit areas in Wales. Covid-19: How many cases have there been in Wales? Latest figures published on Saturday showed Merthyr Tydfil had 250.3 cases per 100,000 of the population in a seven-day period, behind Blaenau Gwent (396.5) and Neath Port Talbot (258.9). Now the county has become the first part of Wales to pilot mass testing of asymptomatic people. Anyone working, living or studying in the area has been urged to get tested for the virus, including children over the age of 11. Up to 175 armed forces personnel have been drafted in to help with the testing, with the first site opening at Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre. But there are fears that many will not take the voluntary test because a positive result would mean isolating just weeks before Christmas and potentially losing income. The tightly-packed terraced streets have been blamed for the high rates of Covid in valleys communities Merthyr Valley Homes, which supports people living in 4,100 homes across the county and employs 200 staff, said it was trying to encourage tenants and staff to take up the offer of testing. Director Michelle Reid said: ""We have been rehousing people escaping domestic violence and those who are at risk of being homeless, and we wouldn't let anything get in the way of doing that."" 'Closeness and community' spreading virus Criticism over Wales self-isolation payment delay Ms Reid said the company was looking at how to support vulnerable and elderly residents, to help them access tests, and had been supporting people already struggling with rent and bills during the pandemic. ""I am very optimistic, the way people in Merthyr have come together to support each other has been incredible, we will pull through this,"" she added. People on low incomes who are told to self-isolate and are unable to work from home will be able to claim Â£500. The community hub fears that the implications of people having to self-isolate could be huge for the community At Twyn Community Hub, volunteers are getting ready to help prevent families and those living alone going hungry if forced to self-isolate. During the pandemic the community rallied to help deliver over 270 food boxes a week, and more than 200 hot meals a week were cooked and delivered to households. Project manager Louise Goodman said there were real fears in the community that people on zero-hour contracts or self-employed would go without pay before the Christmas holidays if told to self-isolate and that the county was being used as a ""guinea pig"". There are concerns that more people will need to ask for help if told to isolate She said: ""We are expecting lots of people to contact us for help. It has got to be done, and it will do good, but you must not forget that people's lives are entwined with this. ""No one wants their children to go without, especially after such a horrible year."" Despite concerns for people's mental health and more people feeling isolated and going hungry, Ms Goodman said more people had been volunteering to help during lockdown. ""Everybody is amazing, it just shows what sort of community we are, everyone helps each other and pulls together,"" she said. Military personnel have been drafted to help at test sites including at Liverpool FC's stadium A similarpilot scheme in Liverpool started two weeks ago. By Friday, more than 140,000 people had been tested for coronavirus, with more than 700 testing positive. ""Those people... would have been unaware of the fact that they we're both infected and infectious,"" Liverpool City councillor Paul Brant told Politics Wales. Col Sion Walker, from the Joint Military Command in Wales, said ""lessons learned"" from mass testing in Liverpool had been used to ""try and make our system more effective... and get people through far quicker"". He said testing was expected to take up to four weeks at up to 14 sites. This video can not be played As Merthyr Tydfil prepares to roll out mass testing, there are mixed reactions in the town Merthyr Tydfil Council saideveryone living, working or studying in the county should have two tests,externalover 14 days, or three tests over a three-week period. People can request more if needed. There is no booking system and people can just turn up at a testing centre. Mass testing uses lateral flow testswhich intend to produce a result within 20-30 minutes. If an individual tests positive, they will be asked to immediately self-isolate at home and to take another test. Pupils aged 11-18 who attend schools in Merthyr Tydfil or Merthyr Tydfil College will be able to have a test at their school or college, with parents asked to consent. Some large employers will also carry out testing. Further sites are due to open,externalin the coming weeks while home tests are being considered for the most vulnerable. Some sites are to stay open until 23 December. The case rate in Merthyr rose dramatically at the end of October and has been falling in recent weeks There were 458 cases in Merthyr Tydfil in the week up to 1 November and the case rate rose as high as 759 cases per 100,000. The proportion of positive results was also high - accounting for nearly a third of people tested. Those case rates have since come down and Merthyr Tydfil has been overtaken by Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot.

"Burton had ""something quite extraordinary"", said his widow Sally The story of stage and screen icon Richard Burton is being told through a new exhibition in Cardiff. Becoming Richard Burton follows the journey of Richard Jenkins from his humble beginnings in Port Talbot to a life of international stardom. The free exhibition at the National Museum of Wales features Burton's diaries, papers and personal objects on public display for the first time. The items were loaned by the Richard Burton Archives at Swansea University. Richard Burton script auctioned to raise PPE funds Burton diaries' passion and shame The exhibition on Burton's life reveals the man behind the headlines - as a husband, father, reader, writer and passionate Welshman. Burton and Taylor had a famously tempestuous relationship It also displays the costumes worn by Burton on stage in the Shakespearean performances that launched his career and later as a Hollywood star in Cleopatra, the film that sparked his tempestuous romance with co-star Elizabeth Taylor. The actor's widow Sally Burton donated many of the objects to Swansea University in 2005, creating the Richard Burton Archive. She said there was ""something quite extraordinary"" about her husband from an early age. Family photographs give insight into the actor's personal life ""I think everyone who met him felt it. People were drawn to him. It was a magical quality which he also knew he had but he didn't quite know what it was,"" she said. ""One thing he did know was that he had to pursue it, knocking down barriers as he went. ""Sometimes he would say 'what is it about me?'. ""I believe this exhibition, and here I must thank everyone involved, will enable us to explore some of those intriguing answers."" The exhibition includes costumes worn by Burton in his Shakespearean performances To coincide with the physical exhibition, there will also be a digital exhibition on the museum's website from mid-December. Produced by Focus Group, a design and creative agency based in Cardiff and Edinburgh, the digital exhibition will be updated with key stories and items on a regular basis.

"A possible alternative to a vaccine, for people without functioning immune systems, is entering its final stage of trials. The injection was developed using antibodies - made by the immune system to fight infection - produced by a single Covid patient in the US. It is hoped it could provide at least six months' protection for patients who cannot receive vaccines. Trials involving 1,000 UK participants begin in Manchester on Saturday. A further 4,000 people are involved in the trial globally, which is being organised by pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. Participants will be given either an injection containing two different Covid-19 antibodies, which have been specially engineered to last longer in the body - or a placebo. In recent weeks there have been promising developments in the creation of a Covid-19 vaccine, which works by priming the immune system to fight off the infection. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection Oxford Covid vaccine 'encouraging' in older adults But the UK's Vaccine Taskforce chair, Kate Bingham, estimates hundreds of thousands people might not benefit from a vaccine because they do not have a working immune system. This might be due to an immune deficiency, or because they are taking immune-suppressing drugs, for diseases such as cancer. ""It's crucial that we leave no one behind as we move closer to finding both a vaccine and developing more treatments for Covid-19,"" she said. ""We particularly need to ensure those who cannot be given a vaccine, such as people who are immuno-compromised, have alternatives available that will help protect them."" AstraZeneca, which is developing the antibody injection, hopes it will offer 6-12 months' protection. Study lead Prof Andrew Ustianowski said, while vaccines work ""by inducing a person's immune system to produce antibodies that inhibit or 'neutralise' the virus"", his team are investigating whether similar protection could be given to the immuno-compromised, by injecting antibodies which have been shown to neutralise the virus directly into the muscle. This bypasses the immune system for those people who ""don't respond well to vaccines, or cannot be given them"". However, the therapy is significantly more expensive than vaccination and difficult to produce at scale, so it is unlikely to be used on the wider population. Nine UK trial sites have been identified so far, in Manchester, London, Plymouth, Southampton, West Yorkshire, Enfield, Rochdale and Preston. The first results are expected next spring. The trial will assess whether the therapy is effective and whether it is safe. Additionally, AstraZeneca has suggested another possible use for the jab - to protect care home residents if a case is identified within the home. Vaccines take a bit of time to build immunity in the body, but this injection should work immediately, so could be given as a preventative measure. Its preventative efficacy will be tested in a second, parallel trial, on participants in the US and the UK.

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is demanding another referendum If you can tear yourself away from the counting of votes in the United States, (and I appreciate if you are into politics, that's not easy right now), it is well worth noting what's going on in the warm up to a big political fight on this side of the pond, arguments that we are going to be talking about a lot in the coming months. There is a huge set of elections, straddling many parts of the UK next May, and the most contentious arguments are likely to be in the elections for the Scottish Parliament. In that poll, you guessed it, the central question on the ballot paper is likely to be that of Scottish independence. With a solid trend of polls backing independence in recent months, the SNP is hopeful of another convincing result in the May ballot that will give them a mandate for another referendum on whether Scotland should stay in the UK. Their problem, even if they win convincingly in May, is that the law says it's up to the UK government to decide whether or not there should be another referendum - a vote some Scots are massively eager to have, but which others want like a hole in the head. You can read more about the laws around a referendumhere. Is Scotland moving towards independence? Johnson rejects Sturgeon's indyref2 demand And the SNP themselves said, at the time, that the 2014 referendum was a ""once in a generation opportunity"" for those who want Scotland to be independent. The UK government's problem is that if the SNP does win convincingly in May on a promise of having another referendum, denying that would just amplify the argument that Westminster doesn't listen to what Scots want, and likely increase support for independence. Alister Jack has rejected a referendum for a ""generation"" That's whythe comments from Scottish Secretary Alister Jackthis morning are notable. He said that ""once in a generation"" means there can't be an independence referendum for many, many years. Not surprisingly, the SNP have leapt on his words, even comparing his comments to President Trump's bizarre, sometimes rambling, statements since the US election - so full of claims without evidence about fraud or irregularities in the voting that some of the American TV networks cut him off while he was still talking. One US politician making wild allegations about fraud is obviously not the same as another in the UK hardening their opposition to another kind of poll taking place, which the government has the legal right to permit or not. Yet the UK government does have an acute dilemma, and it knows it. And not everyone in Westminster agrees that the answer to a hypothetical big SNP win in May can be, ""no, not now, and not nearly ever"". To put it mildly, there is a range of opinion in government on how to meet the demands for a referendum in practice. There are concerns among Tories too about Labour's weakness at Holyrood,which you can read about here. At the very least, the UK government intends to be more present, more prominent, in Scotland, to move away from what one government source admits was an attitude of ""devolve and forget"" that has built up over successive UK administrations. But making the argument for the Union more obviously, and more visibly is one thing - there is no guarantee that in the coming months Scottish voters will like what they see.

"This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Donald Trump has had a fresh setback in his bid to overturn his loss in the US election as Michigan lawmakers indicated they would not seek to undo Joe Biden's projected win in the state. Two Republican legislators pledged to follow ""normal process"" in validating the vote after a White House meeting. Earlier on Friday, Georgia dealt the US president another blow by certifying Mr Biden's razor-thin margin of victory. The Democrat is set to take office on 20 January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory in the Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. His lead in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. Mr Trump, who has had few public appearances since the 3 November vote, on Friday again falsely claimed victory. ""I won, by the way,"" he said, while making an announcement on drug pricing. He has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. Can Trump overturn the election result? Five US election fraud claims fact-checked What is the electoral college? His Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. ""While in 2016 President Trump became the duly elected president, many sought to undermine him, discredit him, de-legitimise him and deny his victory. There were no calls for unity, there were no calls for healing,"" she said. ""So while every legal vote is counted let us not forget the inexcusable transition, or lack thereof, that President Trump had to endure in 2016 and for years into his presidency."" However, Mr Trump praised his predecessor during his inauguration. ""Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out an orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition,"" he said outside the US Capitol building in Washington DC in 2016. After a string of court defeats in his efforts to challenge the election results, Mr Trump's team is hoping to convince legislatures controlled by his fellow Republicans in key states to ignore the outcome and declare Mr Trump the victor, according to multiple US media outlets. Mr Trump has also expressed interest in inviting legislators from Pennsylvania, another battleground won by Mr Biden, to the White House, a senior campaign official confirmed to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. But he has no such meetings currently listed on his public schedule for this weekend, and counties in the Rust Belt state, along with Michigan, are due to certify their vote totals on Monday.Â It is seen as highly unlikely that the president's team would be able to flip Michigan and Pennsylvania. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Even if they managed to do so, Mr Trump would still need to overturn the result in one other state in order to leap-frog Mr Biden in the Electoral College. Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield confirmed the long odds of any such strategy after the White House meeting. Donald Trump Jr tests positive for coronavirus A president who loves attention now hunkered down The two Republicans - hailing from a state that Mr Biden is projected to win by 154,000 votes - said they had focused during the discussion on Covid-19 assistance, not Mr Trump's efforts to overturn the election results. The White House said earlier it was ""not an advocacy meeting"" and simply part of the president's routine meetings with state lawmakers across the country, although he has conducted very few engagements since the election. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Afterwards, Mr Shirkey and Mr Chatfield said in a joint press release: ""We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan's electors, just as we have said throughout this election."" Democrats accuse Mr Trump of abusing his office by trying to pressure the legislators to subvert the will of voters and seat their own electors to the Electoral College, which gathers on 14 December. Amid the row the president-elect has sought to plough on with the transition, this week announcing appointments and meeting national security experts. On Friday he met two top Democratic legislators, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, to discuss how to help ""struggling working families and small businesses"" during the worsening coronavirus outbreak. ""They agreed that Congress needed to pass a bipartisan emergency aid package,"" a joint statement said. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump It said that Mr Biden also ""raised his agenda for the first 100 days of his presidency"". In another development Twitter is preparing to hand control of the presidential @POTUS account - currently being used by Mr Trump - to Joe Biden on inauguration day even if Mr Trump has not conceded his loss by then, a spokesman for the company is quoted as saying by Politico. Following a by-hand recount, Mr Biden's narrow victory in Georgia wasofficially certified,externalon Friday by the Republican official who oversaw the audit. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie."" Mr Biden beat Mr Trump by 12,670 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992. Efforts by the Trump team in other key battlegrounds have also largely stalled. In Arizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. In Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. What happens now?

"As a rule of thumb, the bigger the star the more outlandish the dressing room request. It has been reported that Kanye West stipulates Versace towels being on hand at all times, and his missus insists the carpet is ironed. Apparently, Madonna wants a brand new loo seat wherever and whenever she goes, and Van Halen's 53-page ""rider"" is said to list pickled herring, KY Jelly and M&Ms with all the brown ones removed (to check the venue is paying attention to the tiny details). Other alleged diva-ish demands that have found their way into the press are Mariah Carey's desire for an ever-present attendant to whom she can pass her used chewing gum, and Marilyn Manson asking for a bald-headed, toothless hooker. Given all that, you'd think a modest requirement of one measly bottle of Coca-Cola wouldn't be too much to ask: a cheap, cold drink to whet the whistle in a sweltering recording studio. Surely that's a basic fridge-filler made available to any rookie performer starting out, let alone one of the biggest singing stars in America. Not back in the 1920s it wasn't. At least, not if you were black. That's how the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson (1945 - 2005) tells it in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, one of his celebrated ""Pittsburgh Cycle"" of plays, which chronicle the 20th-Century African American experience. Written in 1982 and first performed two years later to glowing reviews, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom explores talent, ambition, religion, family, race and the historic exploitation of black recording artists by white producers. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom had its first onstage reading at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Connecticut in 1982, with (from l-r) Leonard Jackson (Slow Drag) Charles S Dutton (Levee) and Joe Seneca (Cutler) August Wilson said in an interview ""I think my plays offer [white Americans] a different way to look at black Americans"" It is a black producer, Denzel Washington, who is behind its highly anticipated screen adaptation, soon to be released on Netflix. The venerated actor has been entrusted by August Wilson's estate to make films of all 10 plays in the cycle, a long-term project that got off to a very good start with Fences in 2016, in which Viola Davis co-starred and deservedly won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as an undermined matriarch. Denzel Washington took on the role of Troy Maxson and Viola Davis acted as his wife, Rose in the adaptation of August Wilson's play Fences, about the struggles of a working class African American family in the 1950s She could well get the twin-set with a leading actress Oscar for her portrayal of the imperious, glorious Gertrude Malissa Nix Pridgett, known to all as Ma Rainey, the ""Mother of the Blues"". Davis brings a swaggering, menacing belligerence to a regal character with the soul of an artist, the heart of a lover, and the emotional armour of a tank. Ma Rainey is not standing for any nonsense from either the cantankerous studio owner Mel Sturdyvant (Jonny Coyne), or her weaselly manger, Irvin (Jeremy Ramos), who has booked the legendary singer to record an album of her songs. Ma Rainey was one of the first African American professional Blues singers and famous for her flamboyant style Oscar-winning Viola Davis as Ma Rainey with her band (l-r: Chadwick Boseman as Levee, Colman Domingo as Cutler, Michael Potts as Slow Drag and Glynn Turman as Toledo) She is not just the smartest person in the room, she is also the most precious commodity, bestowing upon her a status not accorded to most black men and women in 1927 Chicago. Hers is a position of power where she gets to call the shots, but only for as long as she holds all the cards: ""They don't care nothing about me. All they want is my voice. Well, I done learned that, and they gonna treat me like I want to be treated no matter how much it hurt themâ¦. As soon as they get my voice down on them recording machines, then it's just like if I'd be some whore and they roll all over and put their pants on."" The stifling heat in the studio is getting to everybody. Ma can't sing until she's got her Coca-Cola, her stammering young nephew Sylvester (Dusan Brown) can't get his words out when asked to perform, and her band can't get along with its ebullient trumpeter, Levee (Chadwick Boseman). This was Chadwick Boseman's last movie before his death in August, a desperately sad fact made even more poignant by the sheer effervescence of his performance as the ambitious, mouthy, naÃ¯ve, and gifted horn player, who prefers easy ladies to hard work. Chadwick Boseman is tipped for a posthumous Oscar for his role in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom The rest of the band are old-timers who know the score. They turn up on time, play what they are asked to play, and happily shoot the breeze in between. Their professional expectations don't go beyond being paid to play. Levee was not cut from the same cloth. He considers himself an artist, a musician from a younger, hipper generation, who knows what the future looks like, and it ain't Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. He wants it all: the flashy shoes, the beautiful women, his own band, and the glare of the spotlight. The problem is he lacks discipline and has a temper as hot as the weather outside. As tensions rise along with the room temperature, director George C. Wolfe manages the building atmospheric pressure with a controlled assurance, creating a tinderbox of explosive egos and fracturing relationships. Viola Davis with director George C. Wolfe and Chadwick Boseman enjoying a moment during filming Davis and Boseman are the stars of the show - their characters wouldn't have it any other way - but the overall feel of the movie is of an ensemble piece, with band members Cutler (Colman Domingo), Toledo (Glynn Turman), and bassist Slow Drag (Michael Potts) adding texture and nuance as the ominous cracks widen. The film is largely faithful to the play, with Wilson's words and extraordinary ear for dialogue treated with the respect it deserves. There are moments downstairs in the band-room (Levee trying to open a locked door) and upstairs in the studio (Ma cosying up to her girlfriend), when it feels like you're watching a filmed play rather than a film of a play. But those occasions are few and far between, and the sense of detachment they provoke is swiftly overcome with a knowing look from Ma or a flash of Levee's smile. Ma Rainey with her girlfriend Dussie Mae (Taylour Paige) and nephew Sylvester (Dusan Brown) in the car It was a powerful work in 1984 when performed on stage and it remains a powerful work in 2020 on film. It stays with you. Or, put another way: Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, once seen, never forgotten.

"Health experts say the only solution to the coronavirus pandemic is a global one. There have been more than 55 million cases of the virus confirmed around the world and more than 1.3 million deaths. Many hopes are pinned on a vaccine as a solution. But there are concerns that poorer nations could get left behind. We have spoken to the experts about the main concerns that lie ahead and whether efforts to come up with a fair system will actually work. Early results indicate that at least two vaccines are highly effective, several others have reached late-stage trials, and many more are at some stage of development. None of these vaccines has been approved yet, but that hasn't stopped countries purchasing doses in advance. A key research centre in the US -Duke University in North Carolina,external- is trying to keep tabs on all the deals being done. It estimates that 6.4 billion doses of potential vaccines have already been bought, and another 3.2 billion are either under negotiation or reserved as ""optional expansions of existing deals"". The process of advance purchasing is well established in the pharmaceutical industry, as it can help to incentivise the development of products and fund trials, according to Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science. How soon can we expect a working vaccine? But it also means that whoever can pay the most at the earliest stage of production gets to the front of the queue, she says. And Duke's research found that the ""vast majority"" of vaccine doses that have been bought so far are going to high-income countries. Some middle-income countries with manufacturing capacity have also been able to negotiate large purchase agreements as part of manufacturing deals. While other countries with the infrastructure to host clinical trials - such as Brazil and Mexico - have been able to use that as leverage in procuring future vaccines. India's Serum Institute, for example, has committed to keeping half of all doses it produces for in-country distribution. Meanwhile, Indonesia is partnering with Chinese vaccine developers and Brazil is partnering with the trials run by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? Because we do not yet know which vaccines will work, some countries are hedging their bets by purchasing multiple options. India, the EU, the US, Canada and the UK are among the countries which have reserved the most doses, according to the latest data. The World Health Organization (WHO) told the BBC it was ""understandable that leaders want to protect their own people first - they are accountable to their citizens - but the response to this global pandemic must be collective"". Andrea Taylor, who has been leading the Duke analysis, said the combination of advance purchase agreements and limits on the number of doses that can be manufactured in the next couple of years meant ""we're heading into a scenario where the rich countries will have vaccines and the poorer countries are unlikely to have access"". Experts note that we do not know yet how many vaccines might make it on to the market, or when they will become available. Deals are still being made, and questions remain about details of distribution. According to Chandrakant Lahariya, co-author of the upcoming book Till We Win: India's Fight Against the Covid-19 Pandemic, availability in poorer countries could depend on how many vaccines are developed, how quickly and where they are manufactured. ""There are vaccines developed in India, and with our production capacity I foresee that the price could come down very quickly and availability in low- and middle-income countries will be very high."" Moderna Covid vaccine shows nearly 95% protection UK orders 5m doses of Moderna vaccine How a 'warm vaccine' could help India tackle Covid Rachel Silverman, a policy analyst at the Center for Global Development think-tank in the US, said the most promising vaccines ""are largely covered by advanced purchase agreements, mostly from wealthy countries"". ""However, the big asterisk is that if there are many successful vaccines, there will be enough overall supply so that the wealthy countries would not necessarily exercise all their options."" Ms Silverman said recent announcements about some vaccines reaching more than 90% effectiveness - notably those from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna - were ""exceptional scientific news"". But she added: ""There is very little likelihood that it will make it to low- and middle-income countries by the end of next year, at least in any significant numbers for mass vaccination."" Pfizer says it hopes to produce up to 50 million doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Each person needs two doses. ""Just doing the mathsâ¦ you can see it's not enough to go around [from that alone],"" Ms Silverman said. However, she says nowModerna has also shown similarly promising results,there is more hope, as even more vaccines could follow. The Moderna vaccine also has fewer requirements about cold storage, which has been a concern for poorer countries, particularly in warmer areas, and those with remote areas and limited electricity. Of course inequality in global health is nothing new. The WHO estimates that nearly 20 million infantshave insufficient access to vaccines,externaleach year. Research shows that during the 2009 ""swine flu"" pandemic the supply of vaccines wasdominated by advance purchase agreements with wealthy states.,external ""We talk about the 90/10 divide in global health - 90% of the world's pharmaceutical products serve 10% of the world's population. This is part of that story,"" Ms Wenham said. ""But there's a difference between the fact that the market has loads and loads of erectile dysfunction drugs but no cures for Dengue fever... to us all now being in the same boat and us all facing exactly the same need for the same product, and that product being finite."" A landmark global vaccine plan known as Covax is seeking to ensure an equitable distribution of future coronavirus vaccines. The joint initiative - between the Gavi vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) - aims to procure enough vaccines for participating countries to inoculate at least 20% of their populations. The programme is designed so that richer countries buying vaccines agree to help finance access for poorer nations, too. So far, some 186 economies are involved. Gavi says it has exceeded an initial target of raising more than $2bn (Â£1.5bn) to buy and distribute vaccines among 92 eligible countries which would otherwise be unable to afford them, but needs at least $5bn more in 2021. Covax has already secured advance purchase agreements on hundreds of millions of doses of potential vaccines to be distributed equitably among countries. AstraZeneca, which is developing a vaccine with Oxford University, is part of the initiative. CEO Pascal Soriot says the company's ""objective is to enable every country around the world to get access more or less at the same time"". The company has said it will not profit from its vaccine ""during the pandemic"". Pfizer has not signed up to Covax but told the BBC ""there are discussions ongoing"". The company said it was ""committed to ensuring everyone has the opportunity"" to access the vaccine, and had developed solutions to storage issues as its product need to be kept in ultra-low temperatures. Moderna also hasn't made any deals to supply through Covax, but Gavi says talks are under way. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was a ""bit concerned"" about the lack of deals on major vaccines. She was speaking after leaders of the world's biggest economies - the G20 - pledged to ensure the affordable and fair distribution of coronavirus vaccines, so that poorer countries were not left out. Concerns have also been raised over the fact that several Covax signatories, including the UK and Canada, are directly negotiating their own deals with pharmaceutical companies. ""They're investing generously in Covax but at the same time they're undermining that by taking doses off the market when we know demand will outstrip supply,"" said Duke researcher Ms Taylor. When asked if wealthy countries were undermining the spirit of the initiative, Gavi CEO Seth Berkley said it was a ""complicated question"". ""Every political leader wants to protect their own population, so in a sense that's what you would expect to happen. But in a pandemic of course we're only safe if we're all safe, so in that circumstance they need to be thinking about both of those issues,"" he said. Human rights groups including Amnesty International and charities like Oxfam say more needs to be done to ensure global access to future vaccines. They have urged pharmaceutical companies to share information through the WHO's Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. Pfizer is among the companies developing vaccines ""No single company can supply enough, and unless we tackle the problem with supply, we're going to have rich countries competing with poor countries and rich countries will always win,"" said Oxfam health policy adviser Anna Marriott. ""All of the vaccine manufacturers and the pharmaceutical corporations should pool their science and data, and commit to transferring their technology so that we can scale up production. No-one has come forward for that."" Policy analyst Ms Silverman said: ""One way you can sometimes get rapid scale-up of health technologies for use in low- and middle-income countries is through licensing to generic manufacturers."" But she added: ""This often gets into disputes about intellectual property and pricing and can be quite contentious."" While the scale of infections, deaths and restrictions varies in different countries, the WHO says any vaccine needs to be available in all countries to tackle the virus. ""With such a highly contagious virus, and in a globalised world, no country will be safe from the fallout of the pandemic until all countries are protected.""

"Donald Trump Jr and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle US President Donald Trump's oldest son has tested positive for coronavirus, according to his spokesman. Donald Trump Jr, 42, was diagnosed at the start of this week and has been quarantining at his hunting cabin since the result, the spokesman said. ""He's been completely asymptomatic so far and is following all medically recommended Covid-19 guidelines,"" according to the statement. Don Jr is the second of the president's children to test positive. Barron Trump, 14, was also diagnosed last month, but made a swift recovery. A firebrand speaker, Don Jr played a major role in his father's presidential campaign. There has also been speculation that Don Jr is interested in running for the White House, conjecture he hasn't tried to tamp down. Don Jr's partner, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host, tested positive for the disease in July, and also recovered. He apparently did not contract the infection at the time. A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? Don't travel for Thanksgiving, CDC tells Americans Earlier on Friday, Andrew Giuliani, a special assistant to President Trump, announced he had tested positive for coronavirus. Mr Giuliani, the son of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tweeted that he was experiencing mild symptoms after receiving his positive test on Friday morning. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, confirmed that at least four other White House aides have tested positive for Covid-19 in a new outbreak there. Earlier this month, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was among several aides who tested positive for the infection. This video can not be played How effective is getting a Covid test before you travel for Thanksgiving? The president himself spent three nights in hospital at the beginning of October after being hit by Covid-19. First Lady Melania Trump also had a bout of the infection. Last month, Don Jr was criticised for downplaying the US coronavirus death toll. In an interview with Fox News, he argued that the media was focusing on the caseload, while ignoring the mortality rate. He said: ""I was like, 'Well, why aren't they talking about deaths?' Oh, oh, because the number is almost nothing. Because we've gotten control of this, and we understand how it works."" The virus has infected 11.8 million Americans and killed more than 253,000. On Friday alone, 192,000 people in the US tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

"Gwynedd's Italian-inspired village of Portmeirion is currently closed A unified approach between the UK's four nations is needed for any future lockdowns, a Welsh tourism group says. Rowland Rhys Evans of Mid Wales Tourism Cymru said different regulations made it difficult for the industry. The Wales Tourism Alliance said although Wales' lockdownended on 9 November, up to half of Wales' tourist businesses will remain closed until the English lockdown lifts on 2 December. The Welsh Government said decisions for Wales would be made within Wales. The UK government said its financial support measures were helping tourist businesses. Mr Evans said: ""It definitely needs unification now. If we've got different lockdowns and different rules for Christmas, it's going to be disastrous for everyone. ""It's a shame the two governments, and Scotland and Northern Ireland, aren't working together so that we can get on the same song sheet. ""People tend to forget this virus is the same across the UK and the rules should be the same for everyone, because it's difficult when you have a border that isn't a hard border but you've got different regulations on either side of that line."" Covid: 'Dark days' for tourism in Wales, but 'silver lining' Covid-19: Quarantining tourists 'could lead to uncertainty' Coronavirus: Half of tourism businesses 'not full' The Wales Tourism Alliance estimates that 50% of businesses across all sectors in tourism remained closed in Wales after the firebreak and would continue until at least the end of the lockdown in England, with the reliance on tourists from over the border accounting for 80-90% of footfall in some areas of Wales. Despite the end of Wales' most recent lockdown, the streets of Aberdyfi in Gwynedd are still eerily quiet even for this time of year. Peter and Elizabeth Holt have run Cafe Medina on the High Street for almost 13 years and have worked in hospitality for over three decades in the area and have never seen it so quiet in November. ""It's nice for the locals, [they] absolutely love it, but as businessesâ¦ we need the people,"" said Mr Holt. ""We are reliant on the English coming into Wales, but we are a small coffee shop and have a small following of locals, so we are OK."" The same might not be the case for others on the High Street - on a mid-week afternoon about two-thirds of the businesses were shut. Many of Aberdyfi's businesses were closed on a mid-week afternoon It is the same scene in many other seaside towns along the coast - Tywyn, Barmouth and on the LlÅ·n Peninsula - areas that are reliant on tourists. Nanteos Mansion Hotel, near Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, has 26 rooms, a restaurant, bar and hosts weddings. But one of the hotel's directors Nigel Jones said they had made the decision to only open half the rooms and for only three nights a week until 2 December, when the English lockdown is due to end. ""We based our decision purely on the lockdown in England. It's a major part of our business coming in,"" he said. ""The problem is whether people will feel as keen and secure to go out again as they did after the first lockdown. ""Now they've got Christmas coming up, do they want that threat? It's been hinted at there could be another lockdown in 2021â¦ it's difficult to plan against the unknown."" Some of Wales' best-known tourist attractions and resorts, such as the Celtic Manor outside Newport, Zip World and its adventure tourism in Snowdonia, and the Italian-inspired village of Portmeirion in Gwynedd, have closed for the month. England's current lockdown began on 5 November - four days before Wales' firebreak lockdown ended David Brown, chairman of the Barmouth Publicity Association, said it was not just hospitality, accommodation and attractions hit - but the wider community as well. ""That's the first line, when the tourist don't come, accommodation loses income,"" he said. ""But that income gets spent in two ways in the community. In Barmouth a guesthouse closes down during winter and that money gets spent at the DIY store for renewing. That's not happening this year because the money hasn't been coming in. ""So those builders, plasterers and plumbers are going to find this winter is very lean for them. ""But also one of our tourism agencies found that whatever tourists spend on accommodation they spend in the community. So if you spent Â£700 on a cottage, you will likely spend the same in local shops, restaurants, even in the local post office."" A spokesman from the Welsh Government said First Minister Mark Drakeford had been clear he wanted ""regular and reliable"" meetings with the other governments. He added: ""Decisions about the response to the pandemic in Wales are made in Wales."" The UK government said: ""We have helped the tourism industry through a financial package of measures - of which many Welsh businesses are benefiting from - and continue to support the tourism sector through these very challenging times."" Whether or not the lockdown in England will finish on 2 December will have a knock-on effect on much of Wales' economy, especially those areas reliant on tourists from across Offa's Dyke. What this industry really wants is some assurances so they can get off to a flying start in 2021. Camping when the toilets are in lockdown.

"Saturday afternoon in Glasgow's Buchanan Street is rarely this quiet More than two million people are spending their first day living under Scotland's toughest Covid restrictions. Level four rules for 11 council areas came into force at 18:00 on Friday, when travel curbs in level three and four areas also became law. Non-essential shops, hospitality, hairdressers and gyms will remain closed until 11 December. Less than five weeks before Christmas, main shopping streets were unusually quiet. The Scottish government has said the restrictions are necessary to drive down stubbornly high rates of the virus. Saturday's daily coronavirus figures showed 887 positive cases and 37 newly-reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Across Scotland, 100 patients were in intensive care, a rise of 12 since Friday. Of the new cases, 234 were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, 246 in Lanarkshire, and 140 in Lothian. Nicola Sturgeon said on Friday that while infection rates have stabilised in recent weeks, they remained at a stubbornly high level in some areas. She said the new restrictions would help infection rates come down further before the Christmas period, paving the way for a possible easing. Buchanan Street in Glasgow on Friday afternoon (top) and on Saturday morning ""The fact is the fewer people who are in the population who have Covid by the time we get to Christmas, the lower the risk of people being infected with it during that period,"" she said. ""It's very important for me to be clear that the risks would not be zero - which is why we must be very careful about any relaxation over Christmas and people will have to think carefully themselves, even with any relaxation, about what they want to do or not."" National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said the actions people in level four areas take now will dictate which restrictions are in place in the new year. He said: ""When you think about Christmas you should also think of the consequences that will have for January. If the virus spreads between households on Christmas day and Boxing day or whenever, of course, that will have a run-in effect to January. ""People will catch the virus at Christmas and then some of them will be hospitalised and be in intensive care in January. That's what we need to avoid. The principal way to avoid that is to get prevalence down and have a safe Christmas."" On Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said the chief medical officers of the UK nations had been tasked with developing a ""concrete"" proposal for household mixing at Christmas, details of which could be revealed next week. Ms Sturgeon also said the new travel restrictions were ""vital"" to ensure there is no need for a national lockdown. Staff outnumbered passengers at Queen Street Station as travel restrictions took effect In South Lanarkshire, closed shops kept people away from Hamilton town centre People in level three and four areas must not travel outside their council area, except foressential purposes,externalsuch as work and healthcare, and people living elsewhere must not travel into these areas except for essential purposes. What are Scotland's new travel restrictions? Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? What can I do and where can I go under the new rules? She urged Scots to abide by the new regulations, which could see a Â£60 fine levied against those who violate the rules unless they have a ""reasonable excuse"", such as caring responsibilities or a hospital appointment. The stricter rules apply to 2.3 million people across East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire, North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian. Virus rates in these areas last week ranged from 158 new cases per 100,000 people in West Lothian to 277 in Glasgow - all of which were above the Scotland-wide rate of 140 cases per 100,000. The centre of Stirling was also unusually quiet A month away from Christmas, Argyle Street in Glasgow would not normally look this empty On Saturday, a new walk-in testing centre was opened in Glasgow. The UK government-funded centre will be operated by facilities company Mitie in the St Francis Community Centre in the Gorbals. It is the third to open in the city, and one of 14 operating across Scotland out of 22 promised by Westminster. As bars and restaurants closed their doors once again under virus measures, opposition parties called for more support for the industry to help save jobs. Nicola Sturgeon has promised a Â£30m fund for businesses in level four areas. But Labour jobs spokesman Alex Rowley said the proposals fell short of what was required and he urged the first minister to bring forward proposals for more extensive support next week.

"Hong Kong has seen a spike in new Covid-19 cases The launch of a travel corridor between Hong Kong and Singapore has been postponed for two weeks amid a surge of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. The deal was due to kick in on Sunday, allowing passengers to fly both ways without the need to self-isolate. The decision is a blow to attempts by the two financial hubs to revive their battered travel sectors. Hong Kong reported 43 new infections on Saturday, the highest daily toll in nearly three months. The number includes 13 cases with unknown transmission sources, raising fears the local outbreak could get out of control. When will a coronavirus vaccine be ready? Tracking the global pandemic ""Today's decision is a responsible decision,"" Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau told reporters. ""For any scheme to be successful, it must fulfil the conditions of securing public health and also making sure that both sides [are] comfortable and feel safe about the scheme."" The decision will be revisited in early December, he added. Under the travel bubble arrangement, travellers would be required to take a Covid-19 test before departure and upon arrival. There would be no restrictions on the purpose of travel but passengers would have to take designated flights, and a maximum of 200 people would be allowed to travel each way per day. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Neither Hong Kong nor Singapore has seen the large outbreaks of the virus experienced elsewhere. With small populations and heavy dependence on international air travel, they hope the travel corridor will help their key tourism and aviation sectors amid a global downturn. Shukor Yusof, an analyst with aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said the travel arrangements were fraught with challenges. ""There is no solution until the vaccine is available to all. The more airlines swim against the Covid tide, and try to beat the odds, the worse it will become. Best to endure, stay put, refine the business model and conserve cash,"" he told AFP news agency. Last month,an air travel corridor was introduced between Australia and New Zealandin which New Zealanders are exempt from self-isolation requirements when arriving in the state of New South Wales and the Northern Territory. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 290 airlines, expects traffic this year to be 66% below the level it was in 2019. The IATA estimates that it will be at least 2024 before air traffic reaches pre-pandemic levels. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the pandemic led to a 72% drop in international tourists in the first half of the year. However,there has been a rebound in domestic tourism in some markets, such as China. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Ian Jones had also suffered malaria, dengue fever and coronavirus while out in India A British charity worker in India has been blinded and paralysed by a potentially lethal snakebite. Ian Jones, from the Isle of Wight, was bitten by a cobra in a village near Jodhpur, Rajasthan. His family said he was ""very frightened"" by his condition although they hoped his blindness and leg paralysis were only temporary. Mr Jones has previously suffered from malaria, dengue fever and coronavirus while in India, his son said. The former healthcare worker was running a charity-backed social enterprise aimed at helping craftspeople trade their way out of poverty. Claire Robertson, from Community Action Isle of Wight which runs the enterprise, said: ""Ian was living temporarily in the social enterprise's warehouse in Jodphur so he could be closer to the people he supports. ""He was in an area of the warehouse that he'd made his living quarters when his adopted dog, Rocky, started barking, and when he reached out to soothe him the cobra, alerted by his sudden movement, bit him twice."" Ian Jones was running a charity helping Indian craftspeople Mr Jones's family said he spent nearly two weeks in intensive care but had left the hospital in India due to the high number of Covid patients. Community Action Isle of Wight has raised more than Â£12,000 on a fundraising website to cover Mr Jones's medical costs and transport home. His son Sebastian said his father ""remained resolute in his determination to stay in the country and continue his work to help the people that needed his support"". ""When we heard he had also suffered what is usually a fatal snakebite on top of all that he had been through, we honestly could not believe it,"" he said. Giant king cobra caught in Thai sewer.

"Video showed Russian special forces cutting down a door to free the boy Russian special forces have rescued a seven-year-old boy kidnapped in late September by a suspected paedophile. Footage shows officers cutting through a reinforced metal door to release the boy and arrest the suspect in the village of Makarikha, east of Moscow. The operation was co-ordinated by Interpol, after the agency's officers in the US spotted a dark web user with a possible link to the abduction. The child, who has not been named, appears to be physically unharmed. The suspect is a 26-year-old resident of Makarikha village. Allow YouTube content?

"Testing began at 09:00 GMT inside Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre Hundreds of people queued as mass testing began in Merthyr Tydfil, set up to try and curb the spread of Covid. Up to 60,000 people could be tested in total, with those without symptoms urged to take a test. It prompted concerns some could be left hard up if told to self-isolate weeks before Christmas. Shirley Jones, 82 whose partner died just 24 hours earlier while awaiting cancer treatment delayed due to the pandemic, was the first to be tested. She said: ""I could've stayed in this morning and not come because I was grieving, but I knew I had to do the right thing in coming up here for myself for our community. ""And I pray to God that everybody comes up and has a test like I have."" Ms Jones said her partner, Desmond Rogers, 83, who died at the town's Prince Charles Hospital, had bowel cancer which spread to his stomach and throat. ""I couldn't say goodbye to him,"" she told the PA news agency. Shirley Jones said she ""knew I had to do the right thing in coming up here"" Anyone living or working in the county can now get a test, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and queues have formed at the town's testing centre. On Saturday Merthyr council also revealedthe full list of testing sites and their opening times,external. Merthyr council has created a regional helpline for those who test positive or were contacted by tracers and told to self-isolate. The Welsh Government has set up apayment scheme for those on low wages. Council leader Kevin O'Neill confirmed about 60,000 people could be tested. ""We want that response today of people coming along who are not symptomatic,"" he said. ""We can seek out the disease where we don't know where it is, where people haven't got the symptoms,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales. ""This is all about getting something in place that will work for the rest of the country."" People have been queueing around the leisure centre to get tested There's a queue around the block outside the Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre this morning - it's the first mass-Covid testing centre in Wales, opening weeks after the area was given the title of the worst affected place in the whole of the UK. The cases in Merthyr Tydfil have reduced considerably, but people here are keen to get tested even if they have no symptoms. Eileen Nelson, who has lived in Merthyr her whole life, said she would be getting a test because it was ""essential"" and ""everybody should take advantage of it"". At a first glance, it looks like it's going to be a busy first day for the test centre. The rise in cases had been blamed on people visiting friends and relatives living close by At the start of November, the county had the highest rate of coronavirus in the UK. While the case rate has fallen dramatically in recent weeks, it remains among the worst hit areas in Wales. Covid-19: How many cases have there been in Wales? Latest figures published on Saturday showed Merthyr Tydfil had 250.3 cases per 100,000 of the population in a seven-day period, behind Blaenau Gwent (396.5) and Neath Port Talbot (258.9). Now the county has become the first part of Wales to pilot mass testing of asymptomatic people. Anyone working, living or studying in the area has been urged to get tested for the virus, including children over the age of 11. Up to 175 armed forces personnel have been drafted in to help with the testing, with the first site opening at Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Centre. But there are fears that many will not take the voluntary test because a positive result would mean isolating just weeks before Christmas and potentially losing income. The tightly-packed terraced streets have been blamed for the high rates of Covid in valleys communities Merthyr Valley Homes, which supports people living in 4,100 homes across the county and employs 200 staff, said it was trying to encourage tenants and staff to take up the offer of testing. Director Michelle Reid said: ""We have been rehousing people escaping domestic violence and those who are at risk of being homeless, and we wouldn't let anything get in the way of doing that."" 'Closeness and community' spreading virus Criticism over Wales self-isolation payment delay Ms Reid said the company was looking at how to support vulnerable and elderly residents, to help them access tests, and had been supporting people already struggling with rent and bills during the pandemic. ""I am very optimistic, the way people in Merthyr have come together to support each other has been incredible, we will pull through this,"" she added. People on low incomes who are told to self-isolate and are unable to work from home will be able to claim Â£500. The community hub fears that the implications of people having to self-isolate could be huge for the community At Twyn Community Hub, volunteers are getting ready to help prevent families and those living alone going hungry if forced to self-isolate. During the pandemic the community rallied to help deliver over 270 food boxes a week, and more than 200 hot meals a week were cooked and delivered to households. Project manager Louise Goodman said there were real fears in the community that people on zero-hour contracts or self-employed would go without pay before the Christmas holidays if told to self-isolate and that the county was being used as a ""guinea pig"". There are concerns that more people will need to ask for help if told to isolate She said: ""We are expecting lots of people to contact us for help. It has got to be done, and it will do good, but you must not forget that people's lives are entwined with this. ""No one wants their children to go without, especially after such a horrible year."" Despite concerns for people's mental health and more people feeling isolated and going hungry, Ms Goodman said more people had been volunteering to help during lockdown. ""Everybody is amazing, it just shows what sort of community we are, everyone helps each other and pulls together,"" she said. Military personnel have been drafted to help at test sites including at Liverpool FC's stadium A similarpilot scheme in Liverpool started two weeks ago. By Friday, more than 140,000 people had been tested for coronavirus, with more than 700 testing positive. ""Those people... would have been unaware of the fact that they we're both infected and infectious,"" Liverpool City councillor Paul Brant told Politics Wales. Col Sion Walker, from the Joint Military Command in Wales, said ""lessons learned"" from mass testing in Liverpool had been used to ""try and make our system more effective... and get people through far quicker"". He said testing was expected to take up to four weeks at up to 14 sites. This video can not be played As Merthyr Tydfil prepares to roll out mass testing, there are mixed reactions in the town Merthyr Tydfil Council saideveryone living, working or studying in the county should have two tests,externalover 14 days, or three tests over a three-week period. People can request more if needed. There is no booking system and people can just turn up at a testing centre. Mass testing uses lateral flow testswhich intend to produce a result within 20-30 minutes. If an individual tests positive, they will be asked to immediately self-isolate at home and to take another test. Pupils aged 11-18 who attend schools in Merthyr Tydfil or Merthyr Tydfil College will be able to have a test at their school or college, with parents asked to consent. Some large employers will also carry out testing. Further sites are due to open,externalin the coming weeks while home tests are being considered for the most vulnerable. Some sites are to stay open until 23 December. The case rate in Merthyr rose dramatically at the end of October and has been falling in recent weeks There were 458 cases in Merthyr Tydfil in the week up to 1 November and the case rate rose as high as 759 cases per 100,000. The proportion of positive results was also high - accounting for nearly a third of people tested. Those case rates have since come down and Merthyr Tydfil has been overtaken by Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot.

Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is one of 19 regional leaders demanding a ""northern budget"". Mr Johnson said a ""very, very good case"" was being made for connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Bradford and Leeds in his Tory leadership run. He had said a trans-Pennine transport link would ""turbo-charge the economy"". The NPR project was part of Mr Johnson's wider commitment to deliver a high-speed railway link across the north of England, which would cost about Â£39bn. The leaders from the Transport for the North group are asking him to commit to the funding in full now that he is PM. The group, which also includes mayor of the Sheffield City Region Dan Jarvis, are also demanding Â£7bn for road and rail projects. Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram said: ""We're consistent and focused in our plan for what infrastructure the north needs to unlock its full potential, not just for its own benefit, but for the whole UK. ""A northern budget would be the ultimate demonstration of that commitment. ""The north is clear that we only support NPR proposals that deliver the whole network, from Liverpool to Hull, along with HS2."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the investment ""is exactly what's needed and what Labour in government will deliver"". A government spokesman said: ""As the Prime Minister recently set out, this government is committed to boosting the north by levelling up our regions, through Northern Powerhouse Rail, giving local leaders greater powers and investing Â£3.6bn in towns across England. ""We're already investing over Â£13bn in improving transport in the north - more than any government in history - and will set out our plans to build on this in due course.""

"Brexvid? Covit? Brovid? A simultaneous no-trade deal Brexit and ongoing coronavirus pandemic are now clearly possible and - however the prospect is to be described - both will have noteworthy economic consequences. In many sectors, the economic impacts of these two trade shocks could build on each other. Cabinet ministers had privately hoped in early summer that the coronavirus crisis backdrop would help make post-Brexit trade discussions easier. European ministers had acknowledged that the economic consequences of the pandemic, with a temporary loss of 10-20% of the economy, had put the smaller shock of a new set of border trading arrangements into context. That reading appears optimistic right now. The EU has compromised a little bit over its negotiation red lines, especially on state aid, but that is yet to open up a clear path to a deal. So a no-trade deal at the end of the year is an immediate challenge at a time when the UK, Europe and the global economy is grappling with a pandemic. Recession is unprecedented, says Chancellor Rishi Sunak UK recession: Labour wants 'targeted financial backing' Coronavirus: How could a recession affect me? The Treasury has avoided producing a public assessment of the overall short-term economic effect. But the impact against a backdrop of the pandemic, in particular sectors, has been quietly acknowledged by the government in preparatory papers. In August, the government wrote a letter to the pharmaceuticals industry asking it to ""stockpile to a target level of six weeks' total stock on UK soil"" of certain drugs and devices, as part of plans for the end of the transition period, while ""recognising that global supply chains are under significant pressure, exacerbated by recent events with Covid-19"". Last week the government quietly enacted legislation to fast track special development planning permission for border and customs controls facilities - basically lorry parks - in 29 English council areas with sea ports and airports. How will leaving the EU impact customs infrastructure and border checks? The main reason offered was that there was ""limited space"" at ports serving EU markets, which have for decades in the customs union and single market, required no checks at all. That has been obvious for years, but the government specifically referenced that it was ""aware that the impact of coronavirus may have affected the ability of port operators and businesses to provide the necessary infrastructure by the end of the year"". If the ports most exposed to a change in border trade have understandably been distracted by Covid-19 and not been able to invest to cope with changes, it's going to be a endemic problem across the economy in other sectors. Some, especially smaller business exporters, will not have the working capital to invest in new procedures and staff, after this year. While it is not possible to put precise numbers on it, a raft of new trade taxes applying to a market that accounts for just under half of a country's total trade is always going to be an economic shock. This will disproportionately be felt in sectors and regions most reliant on exports to the EU. Tariffs will obviously hinder any business model built on the UK as an export hub to the rest of Europe. The UK could catch more fish but it may also face higher tariffs on trade Prime Minister Boris Johnson is citing fishing as a clear example of why what he calls an Australian-style arrangement with the EU - without a formal deal - would be ""good"". It is certainly true that the domestic catch of, for example, mackerel, would shoot up. But whatever is caught in UK waters will need a market, and what is in our waters tends to be exported, and would face a 20% tariff into the EU without a deal. New trade deals with the likes of the US could also be good for growth, but signing a proper free trade agreement there is not going to be possible by year-end, say insiders. More generally, the growth and jobs benefits of lighter regulation would take some time to see, so timing matters too. The best way to alleviate the trade shock is to properly plan for it as early as possible. Perhaps that underpins the new ""38-day deadline"" for a deal. Boris Johnson is in favour of an ""Australian-style"" arrangement with the EU The government internally has long believed that dragging out negotiations until November is the last thing that would be wanted, that businesses need to know ""one way or the other"" what to plan for in January. But this is still relatively late in the day, and the pandemic means that some businesses simply do not have the financial firepower to make these changes. Indeed, some technical changes to for example, labelling, are already proving challenging, which leaves a considerable burden of adjustment on to the government. Going for a no-trade deal, will change the shape of the upcoming Budget, and spending review. Yet this comes at a time when some of the economic ammunition to deal with post-Brexit challenges has been used in the pandemic. ""After Covid, we will return"" says a poster in Scotland, but has the government used up its post-Brexit resources on the pandemic? Interest rates are already at rock bottom and the Exchequer has never borrowed so much, with public debt now more that 100% of the size of the economy. Having spent the same on Brexit preparations overall - Â£8bn - as was spent in some individual months of the furlough scheme, there will be significant pressure to help affected industries and regions. The coronavirus crisis was a shock to supply and then an extraordinary shock to demand to control it. The UK is officially in recession, but actually, right now probably growing like never before, rebounding from the lockdown lows. Adding a shock to trade terms too, just as the recovery might be taking hold, is going to be a considerable economic challenge for both the UK and the EU.

"Former prime ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair have warned Boris Johnson that cutting the UK's overseas aid budget would undermine the UK's G7 presidency next year and cost lives. The UK is committed to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid - a global benchmark. But the government is considering reducing the target to 0.5%, which would have saved around Â£4bn this year. Such a decision would be a ""moral, strategic and political mistake"", Mr Cameron has warned. Spending on foreign aid is linked to the UK's national income - its GDP - which has been badly impacted by the pandemic. The government has already announced a Â£2.9bncut from the budget for the rest of 2020 so as to avoid over-shooting the 0.7% target. The 0.7% target, initially proposed by the United Nations in the 1970s, was first adopted in the UK by Mr Blair's Labour government in 2005. However, it was not actually reached until 2013 - under the coalition government, led by Mr Cameron. The proportion of GDP spent on aid was0.24% in 1999,external, but steadily increased from there. Speaking tothe Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Blair said Britain's 0.7% commitment had saved millions of lives in the past 20 years by helping to reduce deaths from deadly diseases such as malaria and HIV in Africa. Millions have also been educated, living standards raised, and life expectancy ""dramatically"" increased, he added. The former Labour leader said: ""This has been a great British soft power achievement. It isn't about charity. It's enlightened self-interest. ""Neither the challenge of climate or Covid can be met without Africa. Nor can those of extremism and uncontrolled immigration."" Overseas aid budgets were protected from cuts under Mr Cameron and Theresa May, but some Conservatives have argued money should be re-directed to domestic priorities. The UK's national debt is over Â£2trillion, and on Friday the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said borrowing hit Â£22.3bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993. The overall debt has now reached 100.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s. Cut to UK's foreign aid budget 'not ruled out' UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn UK borrowing hits highest October level on record The UK assumes the presidency of the G7, taking over from the US, on 1 January. Reducing the UK's contributions to foreign aid could also risk alienating President-elect Joe Biden when he enters the White House in January, Mr Cameron and Mr Blair added. The G7 (or Group of Seven) is made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US. General Lord David Richards, former head of the British Army, backed the former prime ministers, saying it was in the UK's interests to be ""as generous as possible"", adding: ""It's much cheaper than fighting wars.""

"Arlene Foster says ministers had to impose restrictions because the R-number was rising First Minister Arlene Foster has denied the DUP performed a u-turn by agreeing to tighter Covid-19 restrictions one week after voting against measures proposed to the Stormont Executive. She said the evidence ""had changed"" in what was put to ministers at Thursday's executive meeting. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was the ""correct decision"". On Friday, some businesses reopened ahead of a two-week ""circuit-break""which will begin on 27 November,external. The restrictions have beencriticised by many businesses leaders, with the Stormont Executive being described as a ""coalition government run by numbskulls"" by the prominent hotelier Bill Wolsey. But Mrs Foster said the executive ""had to act"" given that the R-number - the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus to - was close to one. Ministers were presented with data last week that saidthe R-number was ""around 0.8 and rising"",external. Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions were necessary but accepted they were ""equivalent of going back to where we were in March and April"". ""I understand the frustrations and need for additional support and mechanisms to get businesses through what is going to be a very tough time. What is a circuit-breaker and can one fight Covid? He said the two week circuit breaker was ""a big ask"" but ""necessary so we can return to as normal a Christmas as possible."" ""Let's put the differences and arguments behind us and work to get Covid, which is our common enemy, under control,"" he said. Health Minister Robin Swann said the latest restrictions are the equivalent of the those in March and April When asked if it was a mistake not to bring these restrictions in earlier, Mr Swann said ""Covid does not follow any direction of travel that we as an a executive can put down in a calendar."" He said he could not rule out early school closures before Christmas. ""We're doing all we can to stay open and it is being kept under continued review,"" he said. Education Minister Peter Weir said there are no plans for the early closure of schools before the Christmas holidays. ""I believe that schools are the best place for our children for education, mental health and wellbeing and physical development,"" Mr Weir said. Speaking on Friday, the DUP leader said it was a difficult time. ""I'm not pretending these are easy decisions. I regret we had to act but that's what we had to do,"" she said. Hair salons are reopening after a five-week forced shutdown but will have to close again from next Friday Last week,the DUP blocked plans to extend existing restrictions. Both the first and deputy first ministers said the priority now was to ensure businesses affected by the new restrictions received financial support. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she understood the anger felt by businesses that would have to close next week but added that it was was the ""correct decision"" given the medical and scientific advice ministers had received. She said she was concerned about what she described as the ""contradictory"" move to reopen cafes and close-contact businesses on Friday while preparing for a lockdown next week. The restrictions coming into force from next Friday include the closure of non-essential retail, close-contact services, restaurants, and churches apart from for weddings and funerals. Ministers have also advised against household gatherings outside of support bubbles, and said people should work from home ""if at all possible"". Hotels and other accommodation providers can operate on a restricted basis, such as for work-related travel and for vulnerable people. On Friday, the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said 12 more people had died after contracting coronavirus and another 369 people had tested positive. The government statistics agency Nisra said it hadrecorded a rise in Covid-19-related deaths for the sixth week in a row. It said 96 deaths were registered in the week up to Friday 13 November, with the overall total standing at 1,201. The Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland said on Friday that it had been notified of eight more deaths related to Covid-19. It brings its death toll to 2,018. Stormont ministers know that last week was very damaging for executive relations. That penny particularly dropped with the DUP. DUP ministers, I think, found themselves in a place where they were very fearful that they were on the wrong side of this argument and would be blamed if something went catastrophically wrong. There was an absolute screeching u-turn, a 180-degree turn. There is no doubt there was a different atmosphere around the table last night - there was consensus. But if they are truly united why could they not have come out, even together, and made this point? Hiding away from questions and scrutiny, as ministers did for hours after the announcement, is not the way to present unity. Justice Minister Naomi Long said the situation facing ministers was ""quite stark"" and there was concern that hospitals would be ""in a pretty bad state"" without tight restrictions being put in place. Speaking to BBC News NI'sGood Morning Ulsteron Friday, the Alliance Party leader she said: ""It was predictable - we knew this last week."" Health Minister Robin Swann had warned that without immediate actionthere could be a need for restrictions in Decemberdue to the pressures the pandemic is placing on the health service. All non-essential retail will close for two weeks After the decision to introduce new measures on Thursday evening, he said: ""Without this further intervention there was a very real risk of our hospitals being overwhelmed in the run up to Christmas. ""All of us now have to work really hard to achieve a happier festive season."" What do NI's new restrictions mean for you? Strong reaction to NI's new lockdown measures What support is there for my business? How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? It is understood DUP Minister Edwin Poots voiced opposition to the restrictions during the executive meeting. Stormont sources said the minister, who has previously spoken out against imposing tighter lockdown measures, said it was illogical to close non-essential retail as it could severely damage the high street. It is believed Mr Poots did not ask for the measures to be put to a vote by the executive and said he would accept whatever measures were agreed by the executive. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said advice to the executive was the same on Thursday as it had been weeks ago. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback, she said the earlier modelling had recommended a six-week lockdown and four-week school closure. ""We should have been taking these decisions long before and not had the shambles of last week, but we have got the right decision now."" She also said she was ""not going to pretend that everything is rosy"" within the executive, but that all ministers now had a responsibility to support the restrictions. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber, said businesses were ""sympathetic"" to the need for steps to ""save lives"". But he warned that there could be ""unfathomable job losses"" without ""a multi-million pound rescue and support package"". Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the sector he represents has been ""left with no trade, no hope and a huge amount of redundancies"". The executive has said it will develop further financial support packages in the coming days. On Thursday, it agreed that businesses which are allowed to reopen between 20-26 November but choose not to will be able to access funding.

"Antibodies bind to viral proteins, marking them for destruction by other immune cells Coronavirus antibodies last at least six months and offer protection against a second infection, a study of healthcare workers suggests. Staff at Oxford University Hospitals were regularly tested both for Covid-19 infections and for antibodies revealing a past infection. The more antibodies people had, the lower their chances of re-infection. A separate study found pre-existing immunity from other coronaviruses also protected against Covid. Infection consultant Dr Katie Jeffery described the Oxford findings as ""encouraging news"" ahead of forthcoming Covid vaccines. They indicated that having the virus once ""provides at least short-term protection"" from getting it again, she said. T-cell response 'lasts six months after Covid infection' Antibodies 'fall rapidly after Covid infection' The Oxford study enrolled more than 12,000 healthcare workers of which 11,000 tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies. Antibodies build up during a viral infection and stop the virus from getting inside the body's cells and attacking the rest of the immune system. Of those without any antibodies at the start of study, 89 developed symptomatic infections that were confirmed with a swab test. Of those that did have coronavirus-specific antibodies, none developed a symptomatic infection during the study period. There were three individuals who developed asymptomatic Covid-19 infections despite having positive antibody tests, compared with 76 in the group without any antibodies. But none of the three became unwell. The results were ""consistent with Sars-CoV-2 re-exposure that did not lead to repeat symptoms"", the study said. The antibodies being studied are those designed to bind to the ""spike"" of the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 infections. This ""spike"" is what many of the vaccines in development target. The staff tested were followed for up to 30 weeks. Earlier in the week, a study conducted by Public Health England looked at T-cells - another element of our immune systems' response to infection. It found in June about a quarter of the key workers studied had high levels of T-cells which recognised the Covid virus in their blood - but only just over half of them appeared to have had Covid-19. The paper concluded this immunity was likely to be there ""because of previous infection with coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2"", for example the common cold virus. And those people with high levels of the relevant T-cells ""appeared to be protected from Covid-19 in the four months after recruitment"", whether they had previously been infected Covid-19 or not. But Dr Rupert Beale at the Francis Crick Institute pointed out that this equated to ""only a very small proportion of adults (less than 10%, maybe much less than 10%)"" who would be protected by pre-existing T cell immunity. An earlier paper suggested just looking at antibodies might underestimate how many people were protected from re-infection by T cells - another part of the immune response.

"This video can not be played Patel ""unreservedly"" apologises over bullying claims Home Secretary Priti Patel was warned on several occasions to treat staff with respect, a former top official who resigned over the row has told the BBC. An inquiry found Ms Patel's behaviour broke the rules - although she was ""unaware"" of her conduct. But ex-official Sir Philip Rutnam has contradicted this, saying Ms Patel was told not to shout and swear at staff a month after becoming home secretary. The home secretary has apologised for any ""upset"" she caused people. But she insisted the inquiry's findings had made clear that ""issues were not pointed out"" to her in the course of the department's ""deeply challenging"" work. The PM has said he does not believe Ms Patel is a bully and regards the matter as closed despite the resignation of his adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Alex Allan,whose report,externalfound Ms Patel's conduct fell below the standards expected of government ministers.

He said he was never asked to contribute to the bullying inquiry despite resigning over the matter. Sir Philip Rutnam says Ms Patel was warned about shouting at staff Furthermore, he maintains that Ms Patel was ""advised"" on a number of occasions about the need to treat staff with respect, despite the report saying she had been ""unaware"" of her conduct. ""As early as August 2019, the month after her appointment, she was advised that she must not shout and swear at staff. ""I advised her on a number of further occasions between September 2019 and February 2020 about the need to treat staff with respect."" Sir Philip said he respected Sir Alex and regretted his resignation but took issue with the ex-adviser's suggestions that the Home Office did not provide sufficient support to Ms Patel when she took on the job. ""Enormous efforts were made from top to bottom in the Home Office to support the new home secretary and respond to her direction and significant achievements have resulted. The advice does not fairly reflect this."" In his report, Sir Alex said there was ""no evidence"" that Ms Patel was aware of the impact of her behaviour, and no feedback was given to her at the time"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Sir Philip's comments were important because they challenged this verdict. Ms Patel has given an ""unreserved apology"" for any upset caused, which she said ""was completely unintentional"", but argued she was not ""supported"" by her department at the time when claims were made. Mr Johnson has said he retains ""full confidence"" in Ms Patel while Tory MPs have rallied behind her. Former minister Simon Clarke told the BBC she had been working ""under the most challenging circumstances to bring about major change in a department that needs it"". But the head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Lord Evans, said there were ""serious questions"" about the process for investigating breaches of the ministerial code which must be ""urgently"" looked into.

"UK households may have to pay more for gas and electricity bills from April, energy regulator Ofgem says. It is considering raising the price cap on household bills by Â£21 per year to help energy companies which have been hit by a rise in unpaid bills. The news was met with dismay from campaigners, who questioned the logic of raising prices when many householders were struggling to pay. The current price cap is set at Â£1,042 per household for gas and electricity. It runs to the end of March and consumers will learn in February what it plans to do. Octopus Energy boss Greg Jackson said the plans let dominant suppliers off the hook. ""Legacy suppliers charge long-standing customers hundreds of pounds more than new customers,"" said Mr Jackson, whose firm is now the UK's sixth biggest supplier. ""If they cared about customers, they could handle Covid debt by reducing this disparity, rather than exacerbating it by lobbying for a hike in the price cap."" ""Ofgem's single biggest success of the last decade has been the price cap - saving billions for customers and finally forcing dinosaur companies to become more efficient. They should resist all attempts to undermine it."" The price cap was introduced in January 2019 and limits energy unit prices for about 11 million customers on more expensive variable tariffs. These are often default tariffs that customers are moved to after a period on a lower fixed rate. ""Just like every other business, there have been challenges from the pandemic,"" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of trade body Energy UK, said. ""It is the independent regulator's job to hear views, look at the evidence, and weigh up how to support energy retailers through their own commercial difficulties in the pandemic, so that they can continue to supply and support all customers."" The Â£21 rise to Â£1,063 is based on a household with typical usage and which pays for both electricity and gas by direct debit. Price comparison website Uswitch says 12-month deals can be had for as little as Â£821.40 by comparison. Cat Hobbs, the director of We Own It, which campaigns to nationalise energy supply, said: ""These proposals from Ofgem are absolutely shocking. The idea that at a time when millions of people are struggling to pay their bills, the solution would be to charge people even more is farcical."" Energy bills to fall for millions of households Energy firm pays Â£500,000 for overcharging customers Is surge pricing a fair way to manage demand?
