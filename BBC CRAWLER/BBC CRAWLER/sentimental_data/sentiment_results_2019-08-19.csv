"Legal school meal nutrition standards may need to be amended, or discarded, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to internal local council planning documents seen by the BBC. The standards are designed to make sure school children are fed healthy food. Many councils say school meal costs will rise and funding for free school meals increase if there is no-deal. The government said the food industry was ""well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply."" ""We have a highly-resilient food supply chain and consumers in the UK have access to a range of sources of food. This will continue to be the case when we leave the EU."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted earlier on Mondaythat no-deal Brexit preparations are on track. Some councils are anticipating they will not meet nutrition standards because of a rise in food prices and restriction of choice anticipated after a no-deal Brexit, particularly on fresh imports from Europe. For example, North Ayrshire Council says it ""might need to amend school nutrition standards"", in its internal Brexit planning document. Local councils are legally obliged to provide high standard food to vulnerable users of public services and to manage the food supply challenges of leaving the EU without a deal. Brexit: How have UK councils prepared? Brexit: Local councils to receive Â£56.5m fund Other councils, such as North Tyneside, report that ""special dietary requirements may be difficult to meet"" and that ""if fresh produce is difficult to come by"" schools should ""increase use of tins and frozen goods"". Many councils say that prices for school meals will rise, and central government funding for free school meals will have to increase. Some also mention the possible use of food banks. Slough has contacted food banks in its area to check contingency plans for food shortages, and some Scottish councils have already increased funding for extra provision from food banks. The government says that school food standards must continue to be adhered to post Brexit, but thatschools have ""significant flexibilities,,externalwhich they can refer to if certain items are in short supply."" Bedford Council's planning document from its internal Brexit planning team says care homes are ""advised to hold four to six weeks supply of non-perishable foodstuffs"". Hastings Council's internal Brexit risk document even goes as far as saying: ""There might be the need for rationing. The severity would depend on what was available and particularly the duration of any shortages."" Insiders suggest this is a reference to the prevention of stockpiling, more than a return to wartime ration books. The documents seen by the BBC date from the end of last year - up until last month - but predate the appointment of Boris Johnson as prime minister. Most take at face value the government's national assessment for March that there will be no impact of a no-deal Brexit on overall food supply, but there could be an impact on price and choice. An October no-deal Brexit would come, however, at a time when the UK is particularly dependent on European imports for its fresh food, and when there is littleto no excess warehousing space, unlike in March. One catering industry veteran, Andy Jones, the chair of the Public Sector 100 Group of caterers, backed the councils: ""Given a no-deal Brexit, they're being very sensible. They're being very cautious, and rightly so, we're going into something that we don't know about, we're going to the unknown. ""If a no-deal Brexit happens, I feel that the supply chain long term will absolutely be under pressure. And that will affect the most vulnerable in society."" Brexit: Food industry seeks no-deal competition waiver Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Mr Jones said concern about rationing was excessive, unless supply disruptions lasted beyond the current four-to-six week worst case assumption. But he confirmed that menus would change and that ""certain nutritional standards will have to be altered or adapted for a short period of time"" for schools and hospitals. He said public services such as new hospitals, had been built without food storage, and that caterers were now effectively ""fighting each other for space"" in warehouses. Bidfood, one of the key suppliers to schools, hospitals, care homes and prisons, said it was now preparing for no-deal again having bought up warehouse space and assessed and identified alternatives for 400 key food imports to store. ""The key areas that we're looking at in terms of making sure we have surety of supply is around those key things that we import, like pasta, tuna, tinned tomatoes, olive oil, chips, french fries, rice. These are not exotic commodities, these are staples of everyday life, and we want to make sure that all of our customers can get those,"" said Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood. He said there was only limited scope to replace imports with domestic production. ""Because of our changing tastes, unless we're going to go back to a menu based on the 1700s, we are going to look at imported products and imported tastes and imported flavours."" However, he said his company would be ""ready"" to take care of key customers and he does not anticipate ""calamitous"" problems. ""There will be challenges around availability, delays at ports and around currency fluctuations,"" he said. He added that the government would have to increase funding for free school meals, and that it would be ""more complicated"" but manageable for suppliers to meet more stringent standards in Scotland based on nutritional values. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was meeting regularly with industry and retailers ""to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios as we leave the EU."" ""The food industry is well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply, from adverse weather damaging crops in other countries to transport issues abroad. The UK has robust supply chains across a range of countries to provide our food, in addition to the countless domestic food producers across the UK,"" it added. Bedford, Hastings, Slough, North Ayrshire and North Tyneside councils confirmed that the documents seen by the BBC formed part of their no-deal Brexit planning processes.

"Pop star Sir Elton John is friends with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex Sir Elton John has defended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's use of private jets - and said he paid to carbon offset their trip to his French home. The singer said he provided Prince Harry, Meghan and their son Archie with his private plane to ""maintain a high level of much-needed protection"". The royal couple have faced criticism after newspapers claimed they took four private jet journeys in 11 days, including to Sir Elton's home in Nice. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. Private jets usually carry fewer passengers than commercial planes, meaning they burn much more fuel per person per hour. In a message posted on social media, Sir Elton said: ""I am deeply distressed by today's distorted and malicious account in the press surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's private stay at my home in Nice last week. ""Prince Harry's mother, Diana Princess of Wales was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana's untimely death. ""After a hectic year continuing their hard work and dedication to charity, David and I wanted the young family to have a private holiday inside the safety and tranquillity of our home. ""To maintain a high level of much-needed protection, we provided them with a private jet flight."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Sir Elton said he paid for the flight to be carbon offset ""to support Prince Harry's commitment to the environment"". Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - such as planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Sir Elton urged the press to stop the ""relentless and untrue assassinations on their character that are spuriously crafted on an almost daily basis"". Comedian Ellen DeGeneres tweeted,externalthat the couple were ""the most down-to-earth, compassionate people"". ""Imagine being attacked for everything you do, when all you're trying to do is make the world better,"" she said. On Saturday,the Sun reported,externalthat the ""eco-warrior"" royals ""flew into the new hypocrisy row"" after taking a second European trip on a private plane in a month. The paper quoted Labour MP Teresa Pearce calling for the couple to ""lead by example"" on environmental issues. Labour MP David Lammytweeted his support for Sir Elton,external, adding: ""The hounding of Harry and Meghan is becoming a witch-hunt replete with nasty racial and xenophobic overtones"". Figures from accounts published in June,externalshow the Royal Household's carbon emissions due to business travel almost doubled last year. The increase was put down to the use of chartered flights for more overseas visits, which are planned by the Foreign Office. However, emissions savings from greener heating and lighting meant the household's overall carbon footprint stayed around the same as the previous year. A tacit understanding has long existed between the House of Windsor and Fleet Street, even as the power of the latter has waned. In return for access and regular stories, the newspapers would present an image of the monarchy to the public that maintained popular affection for them. Like all relationships, this one has highs and lows. This is a low. Senior executives across Britain's newspapers and PR industry say the current negative coverage of the Windsors is rooted in events. In recent weeks, the Duke of Sussex reportedly attended a Google summit in Sicily, where climate change was discussed. Many of the attendees arrived by private jet. This annoyed some editors and observers, especially coming soon after he and his wife said one reason they may not have more than two children is concern about over-population. It was reported in April that Prince Harry's family would move to Frogmore Cottage, around 20 miles from the goldfish bowl of Kensington Palace and other royals. On Monday,the Duke of York issued a strong statement deploring the allegations against Jeffrey Epstein, with whom he once associated. All this adds up to ammunition for journalists who, even though they work for royalist publications, like to criticise Britain's first family. And yet a recent torrent of negative headlines is also rooted in deeper problems: William and Harry's long-held disdain for parts of the press; the feeling that Meghan Markle doesn't conform to what is expected of a British royal (more power to her, some would say); and a PR operation across the family that has experienced considerable upheaval in recent years.

"The model railway exhibits were damaged at a school The parents of three teenagers who deliberately trashed a model railway exhibition worth Â£30,000 have been ordered to pay compensation. The Market Deeping Model Railway Club display was damaged at Welland Academy in Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 18 May. The boys, and a fourth defendant, shared a bottle of vodka as part of a ""pre-exam night out"" before going on a ""rampage"", a court heard. Lincoln Youth Court heard the youths had deliberately pushed tables over. The four 16-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted criminal damage. Three of them were handed 12-month referral orders and their parents were also ordered to pay Â£500 in compensation. A fourth boy was told he would be sentenced on 2 September. Some of the exhibits were worth thousands of pounds The court heard the teenagers had decided to play football in the gym and continued despite displays being destroyed. They also threw parts of displays at the wall. After police were called due to the school's alarm system, the teenagers were found in the toilets and arrested. Sir Rod 'devastated' for model railway club Vandals trash model railway show Latest news and stories from Lincolnshire Members of the Market Deeping Model Railway Club said a ""life's work"" had been destroyed with some displays taking years to complete. More than Â£107,000, including a Â£10,000 donation from model rail enthusiast Sir Rod Stewart, has been raised in a crowdfunding appeal to repair the exhibitions. Sentencing the boys, chairman of the bench of magistrates John Lock said: ""In nearly 20 years on the bench, I cannot recall such a case as this, of mindless, wanton destruction. It beggars belief. ""You came across the displays and models... and not content with kicking a ball, you then went on a rampage."" More than Â£107,000 has been pledged for the club Peter Davies, chairman of the Market Deeping Model Railway club, said he was glad due process had been followed but it was ""right they [the teenagers] make the best use of their future"". ""We have to allow them to make a second start, although I don't condone the damage, it was horrific,"" he said. The ""enormous"" amount of money raised would go to a charitable trust that is in the process of being set up, Mr Davies revealed. One of its objectives will be to establish youth projects. ""By October we could see 60 young people involved in modelling projects they would never have done before,"" he said. Prosecutor Shelley Wilson said the four boys had made admissions in interviews about the damage. One model railway enthusiast from St Neots Model Railway Club, John Kneeshaw, who contributed to the exhibition, had suffered Â£15,000 of damage, the court heard. One of the boys' defence solicitors said they were ""in drink"", which may have ""impaired their judgment"". The court heard the youths had apologised for their behaviour, while their parents said they were ""ashamed"" and ""disappointed"".

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew is appalled by sex abuse claims about his ex-friend Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace has said. It comes after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished footage that claimed to show the Duke of York inside the financier's Manhattan mansion in 2010 - two years after Epstein's first conviction. Epstein, 66, took his own life in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York. He previously socialised with Prince Andrew and President Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Buckingham Palace statement said: ""The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. ""His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" The short statement from the palace has all the right words: appalled, abhorrent, deplores. There is little doubt that the prince wants the world to know how much he is horrified by what his former friend Epstein is accused of. It was public knowledge that Prince Andrew had kept in contact with the billionaire sex offender after his 2008 conviction. The photo of the two men walking in Central Park in 2010 led to serious criticism of the prince's judgement. But to see him inside Epstein's house, as young women come and go, looking for all the world as if he was a happy house-guest, is a disturbing sight. And strong though the palace statement may be it, it fails to answer the central question. Just what was Prince Andrew doing visiting the house of a convicted paedophile? New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. Epstein death ruled 'suicide by hanging' Prince Andrew 'groped' woman, court files allege He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including former US President Bill Clinton. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine,Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"",external. Donald Trump once called Epstein a ""terrific guy"" But he later said the pair fell out ""12 or 15 years ago"" and reiterated last month that he was ""not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"". Reports of Epstein's wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. He was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. Police arrested him last month after he landed in New Jersey on his private jet. Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges and was being held without bail. He faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. The financier avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. The duke was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 after the tycoon had served his 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution. His former friendship with Epstein attracted criticism at the time and hequit his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011after the fallout from the photos. The pair had also met at Epstein's Florida home over the years. Prince Andrew later acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been a mistake.  2006Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor 2008Epstein gets an 18-month sentence following a plea deal 2010Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in New York 2015The duke is named in a US court case relating to Epstein Buckingham Palace has previously denied claims the duke groped a woman in Epstein's US home. The accusation was made in documents from a 2015 defamation case. Contained in the defamation case papers is an allegation by a woman called Johanna Sjoberg that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001. According to court filings, another of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 1999 and 2002, when she was under-age according to US law. But Buckingham Palace has previously branded the allegations ""false and without any foundation"", stating: ""Any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"".

"""If the till or safe was ever incorrect, the staff that were in had to make it correct again using their own money,"" said a former employee Costa Coffee employees at multiple stores claim they have had costs of Â£200 deducted from their final payslip for training, the BBC has learned. The BBC spoke to 13 current and former Costa employees at stores in Essex who say they have also been subjected to other deductions for till discrepancies and running costs. Costa said contracts for franchise stores are managed by partners. It added some staff contracts did have ""clauses relating to deductions"". ""Deductions are circumstantial and reviewed on a case by case basis by the partner,"" a Costa Coffee spokeswoman said. Courtney Morton was formerly a part-time employee at the Costa Coffee store in Upminster - she earned less than Â£200 in a week. Ms Morton was told the deduction for training would be equivalent to one week of pay, and therefore expected to be charged less than Â£200. ""When I was there I was told that it would be your last week's wages to cover training costs but it turned out to be a flat Â£200,"" Ms Morton told the BBC. And that was not the first deduction she had received. ""The deductions were really unfair,"" Ms Morton added. ""They deducted everyone if they were late, with the money increasing as the time went on up until an hour."" Another former employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said she had one month's pay deducted from her final salary, as well as paying out of her pocket to balance the tills. Costa Coffee said there are clauses in employment contracts outlining the deductions for training Other complaints about the Costa Coffee stores - run by Goldex Investments Essex Ltd - include allegations over contracts. Six people claim they were never given their written contracts, despite asking for them. And two people said they were given ""promotions"" without contracts, claiming that they were carrying out managerial roles while being underpaid for the work they were doing. Another person, who was promoted to a managerial role, said she was not paid properly for the role she carried out for six months. Costa Coffee said: ""We take complaints such as these very seriously and have shared those we've been made aware of with our partner who operates the franchise business to investigate as a matter of urgency."" The company added: ""Anyone you've heard from should get in touch with the partner directly."" Goldex Investments Essex Ltd said it took all the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and urged employees to outline the issues with their line manager. Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham and Rainham, said he was writing to the managing director of Costa Coffee UK and Ireland to ensure complaints of ""poor treatment of staff - particularly young workers"" is dealt with adequately. He added: ""A company that employs thousands of workers across the UK and the branch needs to be held to account."" A franchise is a type of licence that allows a third-party partner to have access and rights to a larger business's logo, name and model, so that the partner can sell a product or provide a service under the business's name. Claims of unfair deductions were triggered by a Twitter post suggesting that staff at a Costa store were forced to reimburse money lost to scammers who came in to the store. The Costa Coffee franchise partner, Kafeel Khan, denied he had asked staff to reimburse the scam losses and has since apologised for the ""miscommunication"" in a letter to the people affected. The letter was sent after Mr Khan and a Costa Coffee representative arranged a meeting on Friday morning with the father of some of the people employed by Mr Khan. Allow Twitter content?

"Greene King said CKA shared many of its business philosophies Pub giant and brewer Greene King has agreed to be bought by Hong Kong operator CKA, the latest deal in a wave of consolidation in the sector. Suffolk-based Greene King owns roughly 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels in total across the UK. The deal values Greene King at Â£2.7bn. The move comes just months after Fuller's, the brewer whose beers include London Pride,sold its entire drinks business to Japan's biggest brewer Asahi. And last month, pub group Stonegate Pub, which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, announced it was buying rival Ei Group - once known as Enterprise Inns - for Â£1.3bn. Greene King chief executive Nick Mackenzie said CKA shared ""many of Greene King's business philosophies"". ""They understand the strengths of our business and we welcome their commitment to working with the existing management team, evolving the strategy and investing in the business to ensure its continued long-term growth,"" he added. Greene King's directors said the terms of the deal were ""fair and reasonable"" and that they would unanimously recommend it to shareholders who will get the final vote on the tie-up. Shares in Greene King surged more than 50% after the deal was announced. Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said while the deal was good news for shareholders, it was likely to be bad news for Greene King's customers. ""I think we can comfortably expect more pub closures. It's a whopping [price] that implies CKA sees significant value in the property portfolio,"" he said. In its statement,external, Greene King said CKA had no plans to make ""material changes"" to group and management staff numbers and did not intend to ""initiate any material headcount reductions within the Greene King organisation as a result of the acquisition."" A combination of rising cost pressures and people spending less on going out has led to a wave of pub closures. Last year nearly 1,000 UK pubs shut, according to property firm Altus Group. Industry group the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) has said more people are drinking at home to save money, while younger people are consuming less alcohol in general. Meanwhile, pubs have faced a ""triple whammy"" of taxes in the form of high Beer Duty, VAT and business rates. Mr Wilson said the properties that pubs owned was making the sector attractive to investors. ""Greene King owns the freehold or long leasehold on 81% of its properties. The company recently carried out a revaluation of its property estate that indicated a market value of Â£4.5bn against the Â£3.5bn book value,"" he said. CKA was founded by Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-Shing, whose business empire spans retail, telecoms and power firms. Mr Li retired from leading the firm last year. He was ranked 28thin this year's Forbes rich list.,external He started work sweeping factory floors as a young boy, but subsequently became one of the first Hong Kong tycoons to invest in mainland China, with property playing a big part in his wealth.

"Ferguson was involved in a dispute with the Scottish government over the CalMac ferries The Scottish government has set a deadline for a new delivery schedule for two ferries being built at the now publicly-owned Ferguson shipyard. It took control of the base in Port Glasgow last weekafter bosses at the yard served notice of intent to put the business into administration. This would have left 300 jobs at risk. Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has now said details of a ""robust delivery schedule"" for the CalMac ferries must be announced by the end of October. Ferguson was involved in a dispute with the Scottish government over the construction of the two ferries. The yard was owned by industrialist Jim McColl, who could not persuade ministers to pay more than the Â£97m contract price for the disputed vessels. The Scottish government will now buy the yard if no private buyer is found within four weeks. Mr Mackay announced on Friday that a new review board had been set up to deal with the completion of the two ferries. Speaking after meeting board members at the shipyard on Monday, Mr Mackay said: ""We have always been clear that we want to complete the vessels, secure jobs and give the yard a future. ""On Friday, I met with the excellent workforce and stressed the Scottish government's commitment to achieving the best possible outcome for the yard. ""Today, I convened the first meeting of the newly-established programme review board and tasked them with establishing a new delivery schedule for both vessels and a revised cost window. ""This group will help assess the current situation and ensure the effective and efficient delivery schedule of the CMAL ferry contracts as quickly as possible."" Transport Scotland's director of major projects Michelle Rennie has been appointed to chair the board on an interim basis. The Scottish government and Scottish Enterprise each have a member on the board.

"The Labour Party is going into the 2019 general election with a promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" in six months. So, what exactly is its plan? If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. Rather than backing either Leave or Remain during the election campaign, the party will remain neutral until a later date. Should a referendum under a Labour government be held, voters would be able to choose between a ""credible Leave option"" and Remain. The party would organise the referendum within six months and decide which position to back at a special conference in the build up. Experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London say it would take a minimum of 22 weeks to organise another referendum. Labour's Brexit stance was adopted after Labour's delegates voted for it at the party conference in September. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry led a march in support of a ""People's Vote"" on Brexit Delegates rejected a motion which called on the party to back Remain outright in all circumstances. It was voted down despite receiving support from senior figures - such as shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Until July, Labour had resisted outright support for another referendum. Its deputy leader, Tom Watson, said ""ambiguity"" over the party's Brexit policy had cost it votes at the European elections in May. Mr Corbyn says Labour will negotiate a Brexit deal which maintains a very close trading relationship with the EU. This would be achieved by staying in a customs union and keeping close alignment to the single market. That would mean the UK would be able to continue trading with the EU without tariffs (taxes on imports) being applied. However, being in a customs union would prevent the UK from striking its own trade deals with other countries on goods, such as the US. Under the deal negotiated by Mr Johnson, the UK would leave both the single market and customs union. This would require checks to take place on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Labour believes it would take no longer than three months the renegotiate the current Brexit deal. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint urged Jeremy Corbyn not to call for another Brexit referendum Just like the Conservative Party, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. Many Labour MPs who represent parts of the country where most people voted Leave have previously expressed unhappiness with the party's shift on supporting a referendum. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"" and urged the party leadership to back a Brexit deal. Labour MPs urge Corbyn not to go 'full Remain' On the other hand, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, are among those to say remaining would be the best thing for the UK - even if the other option is a Labour-negotiated Brexit deal.

"Legal school meal nutrition standards may need to be amended, or discarded, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to internal local council planning documents seen by the BBC. The standards are designed to make sure school children are fed healthy food. Many councils say school meal costs will rise and funding for free school meals increase if there is no-deal. The government said the food industry was ""well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply."" ""We have a highly-resilient food supply chain and consumers in the UK have access to a range of sources of food. This will continue to be the case when we leave the EU."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted earlier on Mondaythat no-deal Brexit preparations are on track. Some councils are anticipating they will not meet nutrition standards because of a rise in food prices and restriction of choice anticipated after a no-deal Brexit, particularly on fresh imports from Europe. For example, North Ayrshire Council says it ""might need to amend school nutrition standards"", in its internal Brexit planning document. Local councils are legally obliged to provide high standard food to vulnerable users of public services and to manage the food supply challenges of leaving the EU without a deal. Brexit: How have UK councils prepared? Brexit: Local councils to receive Â£56.5m fund Other councils, such as North Tyneside, report that ""special dietary requirements may be difficult to meet"" and that ""if fresh produce is difficult to come by"" schools should ""increase use of tins and frozen goods"". Many councils say that prices for school meals will rise, and central government funding for free school meals will have to increase. Some also mention the possible use of food banks. Slough has contacted food banks in its area to check contingency plans for food shortages, and some Scottish councils have already increased funding for extra provision from food banks. The government says that school food standards must continue to be adhered to post Brexit, but thatschools have ""significant flexibilities,,externalwhich they can refer to if certain items are in short supply."" Bedford Council's planning document from its internal Brexit planning team says care homes are ""advised to hold four to six weeks supply of non-perishable foodstuffs"". Hastings Council's internal Brexit risk document even goes as far as saying: ""There might be the need for rationing. The severity would depend on what was available and particularly the duration of any shortages."" Insiders suggest this is a reference to the prevention of stockpiling, more than a return to wartime ration books. The documents seen by the BBC date from the end of last year - up until last month - but predate the appointment of Boris Johnson as prime minister. Most take at face value the government's national assessment for March that there will be no impact of a no-deal Brexit on overall food supply, but there could be an impact on price and choice. An October no-deal Brexit would come, however, at a time when the UK is particularly dependent on European imports for its fresh food, and when there is littleto no excess warehousing space, unlike in March. One catering industry veteran, Andy Jones, the chair of the Public Sector 100 Group of caterers, backed the councils: ""Given a no-deal Brexit, they're being very sensible. They're being very cautious, and rightly so, we're going into something that we don't know about, we're going to the unknown. ""If a no-deal Brexit happens, I feel that the supply chain long term will absolutely be under pressure. And that will affect the most vulnerable in society."" Brexit: Food industry seeks no-deal competition waiver Boris Johnson wins race to be Tory leader and PM Mr Jones said concern about rationing was excessive, unless supply disruptions lasted beyond the current four-to-six week worst case assumption. But he confirmed that menus would change and that ""certain nutritional standards will have to be altered or adapted for a short period of time"" for schools and hospitals. He said public services such as new hospitals, had been built without food storage, and that caterers were now effectively ""fighting each other for space"" in warehouses. Bidfood, one of the key suppliers to schools, hospitals, care homes and prisons, said it was now preparing for no-deal again having bought up warehouse space and assessed and identified alternatives for 400 key food imports to store. ""The key areas that we're looking at in terms of making sure we have surety of supply is around those key things that we import, like pasta, tuna, tinned tomatoes, olive oil, chips, french fries, rice. These are not exotic commodities, these are staples of everyday life, and we want to make sure that all of our customers can get those,"" said Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood. He said there was only limited scope to replace imports with domestic production. ""Because of our changing tastes, unless we're going to go back to a menu based on the 1700s, we are going to look at imported products and imported tastes and imported flavours."" However, he said his company would be ""ready"" to take care of key customers and he does not anticipate ""calamitous"" problems. ""There will be challenges around availability, delays at ports and around currency fluctuations,"" he said. He added that the government would have to increase funding for free school meals, and that it would be ""more complicated"" but manageable for suppliers to meet more stringent standards in Scotland based on nutritional values. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was meeting regularly with industry and retailers ""to make sure we are prepared for all scenarios as we leave the EU."" ""The food industry is well versed at dealing with scenarios that can affect food supply, from adverse weather damaging crops in other countries to transport issues abroad. The UK has robust supply chains across a range of countries to provide our food, in addition to the countless domestic food producers across the UK,"" it added. Bedford, Hastings, Slough, North Ayrshire and North Tyneside councils confirmed that the documents seen by the BBC formed part of their no-deal Brexit planning processes.

"The authorities fear the regular theft of sand could have a disproportionate impact on the environment A French couple who were caught with 40kg (90lb) of Sardinian sand in their car could face up to six years in jail. They say they wanted to take the sand home as a ""souvenir"" and did not realise they had committed an offence. Sardinia's famed white sand is considered a public good and it is strictly forbidden to remove it from the island. For years, residents have complained about the theft of natural assetsincluding sand. The couple face a jail term of between one and six years for the crime of theft with the aggravating circumstance of having stolen an asset of public utility. Under a 2017 law, the trade in sand, pebbles and shells is illegal, and usually punishable with fines of up to â¬3,000 ($3,330; Â£2,750). Police discovered the sand crammed into 14 plastic bottles,externaltaken from the beach in Chia, southern Sardinia, in the boot of an SUV belonging to the couple. They were about to board a ferry in Porto Torres heading to Toulon, France, reports say. eBay removes 'Hawaiian sand' listings Crimeans told to stop stealing sand Tourists often bottle sand, pebbles and shells in bottles to take home with them In 1994, access to the renowned pink beach on Budelli island to the north-east of Sardinia was banned amid concerns about its future. The authorities are concerned as several tonnes of the island's precious sand disappear every year. ""Sandy beaches are one of the main attractions of Sardinia. There are two threats: one is due to erosion, which is partly natural and partly induced by the increasing sea level due to climate change; the second is sand stealing by tourists,"" Pierluigi Cocco, a resident of the Sardinian capital, Cagliari, and environmental scientist, told the BBC. ""Only a fraction of the tourists visiting Sardinia spend their time digging  up to 40kg of sand each. But if you multiply half that amount times 5% of the one million tourists per year, in a few years that would contribute significantly to the reduction of beaches - the main reason why tourists are attracted by the island of Sardinia.""

"Stephen the hedgehog was left blind after being sprayed with chemicals A couple whose much-loved blind hedgehog was stolen in a vehicle theft said it would be ""a miracle"" if the animal turned up alive. The hedgehog, named Stephen, was inside the van when it was taken from Albion Place in Leeds on Saturday morning. Frank Tett, who runs Andrew's Hedgehog Hospital near Scunthorpe, said: ""We're absolutely devastated here. ""He'll probably last four or five days without food or water. After that he'll just die."" West Yorkshire Police said it was investigating the theft. Mr Tett, 80, and his wife Veronica, from Appleby, have been caring for the animal since June when he was brought to them after being sprayed with chemicals. He saidStephen was in a light grey-coloured cat carrier, that was inside the vanat the time of the theft at about 08:15 BST. The couple appealed for motorists to be vigilant as they think the carry box might have been thrown out of the vehicle and on to the roadside. The charity is named after another blind hedgehog the couple once looked after However, they are ""not very hopeful he will turn up"". ""The material things you can replace, but you can't replace a hedgehog,"" said Mr Tett. ""It'll be a miracle if he turns up. ""We'll travel to the ends of the earth to pick him up."" Mr Tett said he parked his white Vauxhall van outside Barclays Bank and was loading stock for his market stall when it was stolen. He said the couple had received ""a lot of messages of support and concern"" from the public and thanked them ""for their good wishes"". Mr and Mrs Tett hand-rear and care for hundreds of hedgehogs at their home in North Lincolnshire.

"This video can not be played Wildfires rip through Gran Canaria About 9,000 people have been evacuated as wildfires rip through Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. The fires, which started on Saturday, are advancing on two fronts in a mountainous area of the island. In a press conference on Monday, authorities called the incident ""an unprecedented environmental tragedy"". Efforts to tackle the fires are being hampered by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity, officials said. About 14 planes and helicopters, as well as about 700 firefighters on the ground including 200 from the military, have been deployed. The blaze has so far spared residential areas and tourist hotspots, but has spread into the island's Tamadaba natural park, home to some of the island's oldest pine forests. ""The fire is not contained nor stabilised or controlled,"" Canary Islands regional president Angel Victor Torres told a news conference on Sunday. Planes and helicopters have been deployed to tackle the blazes The fires are threatening old areas of pine forest In some areas, the flames were so high that water-dropping planes were unable to operate. The fires started near the town of Tejeda. Overnight, the affected area increased from 3400 to 6000 hectares and flames as high as 50 metres (164 ft) were reported. Requests for assistance had been made to the Spanish central government, Mr Torres added. Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries The wildfire that broke a community Hundreds of people were evacuated due to separate wildfires on the holiday island last week.

"""If the till or safe was ever incorrect, the staff that were in had to make it correct again using their own money,"" said a former employee Costa Coffee employees at multiple stores claim they have had costs of Â£200 deducted from their final payslip for training, the BBC has learned. The BBC spoke to 13 current and former Costa employees at stores in Essex who say they have also been subjected to other deductions for till discrepancies and running costs. Costa said contracts for franchise stores are managed by partners. It added some staff contracts did have ""clauses relating to deductions"". ""Deductions are circumstantial and reviewed on a case by case basis by the partner,"" a Costa Coffee spokeswoman said. Courtney Morton was formerly a part-time employee at the Costa Coffee store in Upminster - she earned less than Â£200 in a week. Ms Morton was told the deduction for training would be equivalent to one week of pay, and therefore expected to be charged less than Â£200. ""When I was there I was told that it would be your last week's wages to cover training costs but it turned out to be a flat Â£200,"" Ms Morton told the BBC. And that was not the first deduction she had received. ""The deductions were really unfair,"" Ms Morton added. ""They deducted everyone if they were late, with the money increasing as the time went on up until an hour."" Another former employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said she had one month's pay deducted from her final salary, as well as paying out of her pocket to balance the tills. Costa Coffee said there are clauses in employment contracts outlining the deductions for training Other complaints about the Costa Coffee stores - run by Goldex Investments Essex Ltd - include allegations over contracts. Six people claim they were never given their written contracts, despite asking for them. And two people said they were given ""promotions"" without contracts, claiming that they were carrying out managerial roles while being underpaid for the work they were doing. Another person, who was promoted to a managerial role, said she was not paid properly for the role she carried out for six months. Costa Coffee said: ""We take complaints such as these very seriously and have shared those we've been made aware of with our partner who operates the franchise business to investigate as a matter of urgency."" The company added: ""Anyone you've heard from should get in touch with the partner directly."" Goldex Investments Essex Ltd said it took all the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and urged employees to outline the issues with their line manager. Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham and Rainham, said he was writing to the managing director of Costa Coffee UK and Ireland to ensure complaints of ""poor treatment of staff - particularly young workers"" is dealt with adequately. He added: ""A company that employs thousands of workers across the UK and the branch needs to be held to account."" A franchise is a type of licence that allows a third-party partner to have access and rights to a larger business's logo, name and model, so that the partner can sell a product or provide a service under the business's name. Claims of unfair deductions were triggered by a Twitter post suggesting that staff at a Costa store were forced to reimburse money lost to scammers who came in to the store. The Costa Coffee franchise partner, Kafeel Khan, denied he had asked staff to reimburse the scam losses and has since apologised for the ""miscommunication"" in a letter to the people affected. The letter was sent after Mr Khan and a Costa Coffee representative arranged a meeting on Friday morning with the father of some of the people employed by Mr Khan. Allow Twitter content?

"The model railway exhibits were damaged at a school The parents of three teenagers who deliberately trashed a model railway exhibition worth Â£30,000 have been ordered to pay compensation. The Market Deeping Model Railway Club display was damaged at Welland Academy in Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 18 May. The boys, and a fourth defendant, shared a bottle of vodka as part of a ""pre-exam night out"" before going on a ""rampage"", a court heard. Lincoln Youth Court heard the youths had deliberately pushed tables over. The four 16-year-old boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted criminal damage. Three of them were handed 12-month referral orders and their parents were also ordered to pay Â£500 in compensation. A fourth boy was told he would be sentenced on 2 September. Some of the exhibits were worth thousands of pounds The court heard the teenagers had decided to play football in the gym and continued despite displays being destroyed. They also threw parts of displays at the wall. After police were called due to the school's alarm system, the teenagers were found in the toilets and arrested. Sir Rod 'devastated' for model railway club Vandals trash model railway show Latest news and stories from Lincolnshire Members of the Market Deeping Model Railway Club said a ""life's work"" had been destroyed with some displays taking years to complete. More than Â£107,000, including a Â£10,000 donation from model rail enthusiast Sir Rod Stewart, has been raised in a crowdfunding appeal to repair the exhibitions. Sentencing the boys, chairman of the bench of magistrates John Lock said: ""In nearly 20 years on the bench, I cannot recall such a case as this, of mindless, wanton destruction. It beggars belief. ""You came across the displays and models... and not content with kicking a ball, you then went on a rampage."" More than Â£107,000 has been pledged for the club Peter Davies, chairman of the Market Deeping Model Railway club, said he was glad due process had been followed but it was ""right they [the teenagers] make the best use of their future"". ""We have to allow them to make a second start, although I don't condone the damage, it was horrific,"" he said. The ""enormous"" amount of money raised would go to a charitable trust that is in the process of being set up, Mr Davies revealed. One of its objectives will be to establish youth projects. ""By October we could see 60 young people involved in modelling projects they would never have done before,"" he said. Prosecutor Shelley Wilson said the four boys had made admissions in interviews about the damage. One model railway enthusiast from St Neots Model Railway Club, John Kneeshaw, who contributed to the exhibition, had suffered Â£15,000 of damage, the court heard. One of the boys' defence solicitors said they were ""in drink"", which may have ""impaired their judgment"". The court heard the youths had apologised for their behaviour, while their parents said they were ""ashamed"" and ""disappointed"".

"British Transport Police said the accident happened close to Ashgill Road in the Milton area of Glasgow A 12-year-old boy is critically ill after an accident involving overhead railway power lines in Glasgow.

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew is appalled by sex abuse claims about his ex-friend Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace has said. It comes after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished footage that claimed to show the Duke of York inside the financier's Manhattan mansion in 2010 - two years after Epstein's first conviction. Epstein, 66, took his own life in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York. He previously socialised with Prince Andrew and President Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Buckingham Palace statement said: ""The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. ""His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" The short statement from the palace has all the right words: appalled, abhorrent, deplores. There is little doubt that the prince wants the world to know how much he is horrified by what his former friend Epstein is accused of. It was public knowledge that Prince Andrew had kept in contact with the billionaire sex offender after his 2008 conviction. The photo of the two men walking in Central Park in 2010 led to serious criticism of the prince's judgement. But to see him inside Epstein's house, as young women come and go, looking for all the world as if he was a happy house-guest, is a disturbing sight. And strong though the palace statement may be it, it fails to answer the central question. Just what was Prince Andrew doing visiting the house of a convicted paedophile? New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. Epstein death ruled 'suicide by hanging' Prince Andrew 'groped' woman, court files allege He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including former US President Bill Clinton. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine,Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"",external. Donald Trump once called Epstein a ""terrific guy"" But he later said the pair fell out ""12 or 15 years ago"" and reiterated last month that he was ""not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"". Reports of Epstein's wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. He was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. Police arrested him last month after he landed in New Jersey on his private jet. Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges and was being held without bail. He faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. The financier avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. The duke was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 after the tycoon had served his 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution. His former friendship with Epstein attracted criticism at the time and hequit his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011after the fallout from the photos. The pair had also met at Epstein's Florida home over the years. Prince Andrew later acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been a mistake.  2006Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor 2008Epstein gets an 18-month sentence following a plea deal 2010Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in New York 2015The duke is named in a US court case relating to Epstein Buckingham Palace has previously denied claims the duke groped a woman in Epstein's US home. The accusation was made in documents from a 2015 defamation case. Contained in the defamation case papers is an allegation by a woman called Johanna Sjoberg that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001. According to court filings, another of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 1999 and 2002, when she was under-age according to US law. But Buckingham Palace has previously branded the allegations ""false and without any foundation"", stating: ""Any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"".

"Greenpeace says limited checks are made on new-builds Building standards in Scotland should be enforced by a national agency, according to environment group Greenpeace. It criticised the current system for policing building regulations which relies on builders to certify much of their work, with limited checks by council officials. It is argued that a consistent, tougher approach would help new home buyers, ensuring quality, where some find housebuilders are slow to rectify construction problems. The green lobby group also argues that building energy standards should be significantly stepped up, to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) believed that a national buildings standards agency was not necessarily the way forward. The call for change comes as part of a series of reports on BBC Scotland about the implications of reducing emissions associated with climate change to net zero by 2045. Housebuilders and the Scottish government pointed to a significant increase in the energy efficiency of new homes, with emissions down by 70% in the past three decades. Homes for Scotland called for more action to retrofit existing homes. Doug Parr, head of policy with Greenpeace UK, told BBC Scotland the pledge to reduce carbon emissions meant that proper inspection and enforcement of regulations had become more important. ""We need to have a proper inspection and enforcement regime for new-build housing, to make sure that housebuilders who do build shoddy houses are penalised,"" he said. ""More than that, they ought to go in and change them back to how they're supposed to be, according to building standards. ""That whole regime needs to change from being a bit of a loose end that local authorities have to pick up at some point, to being a properly nationally-co-ordinated programme."" He added: ""In order to deliver the new-build houses we need for the 21st Century and net zero challenge, we need an agency that's going to have the expertise and capability to support local authorities in making sure these buildings are as good as they need to be. ""If we don't, we're going to have higher cost and higher emissions, and we're going to have cheated people. We're building ourselves a problem we're going to have to solve further down the line."" Homes for Scotland, representing the major housebuilders, declined to comment on the Greenpeace call, but a spokeswoman said: ""We firmly believe that local authorities should be properly resourced to carry out their statutory duties and facilitate the delivery of much-needed homes. ""We work closely with the Scottish government building standards division and other industry bodies on how to move the whole system forward to ensure it works both effectively and efficiently."" The builders' representative added that ""new homes are already highly energy-efficient"". He said: ""The focus on improvements in housing needs to be placed on existing stock - something we have been calling on for some time"". Asked about the call for a national agency to enforce building regulations, a Scottish government spokesman emphasised that responsibility lay with local authorities. He said: ""They are responsible for the operation of the building standards system. In line with legislation, when a warrant is required for new work, we expect them to undertake independent checks at design stage, and carry out reasonable inquiry prior to accepting a completion certificate before a building is occupied"". Looking to the raising of building standards in future, the St Andrew's House spokesman said they were reviewed and updated on a regular basis: ""A review considering where the greatest opportunities lie for further, cost-effective and practical improvements is currently under way and is expected to be completed in 2021,"" he added. ""From a climate-change perspective, building regulations have improved performance and reduced emissions from new homes by over 70% compared to the standards in force in 1990, the baseline year for climate change reporting."" Local government umbrella body Cosla said that it recognised that implications of achieving a net zero target by 2045 were ""profound"" and ""would impact on all aspects of society and the economy"", However, it was not convinced by Greenpeace's suggestion of an agency for building standards. A spokesman explained: ""If anything the long term solution to meeting the net zero target seem more likely to involve increasing decentralisation of power to local authorities and communities.  A strong, fully empowered local government will be critical to our future success in tackling the climate emergency.""

"The US central bank should consider cutting interest rates by one percentage point and introduce ""some quantitative easing"" stimulus measures, president Donald Trump has said. In a Twitter post he again complained about a strong dollar, which ""is sadly hurting other parts of the world"". The remarks came hours after the president said the US economy is not falling into a recession. The economy is doing ""tremendously well"", he said. Mr Trump has posted a series of critical tweets in recent months aimed at the Federal Reserve and its chief Jerome Powell. Last week the president called him ""clueless"" for not cutting rates sooner. A US-China trade war, gloomy economic data from Germany, and uncertainties over the UK's exit from the European Union have unsettled share markets. There are also worries that the bond markets are flashing recession signals. It is now cheaper for the US government to borrow for 10 years rather than two - an indication that lenders fear short-term economic risks have increased. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump's suggestion on Monday that the Fed should consider a return to its crisis-era money-printing programme comes despite him insisting a day earlier that the US economy was in good health. ""I don't think we're having a recession,"" the president said. ""We're doing tremendously well, our consumers are rich, I gave a tremendous tax cut, and they're loaded up with money"". He pointed to last week's healthy profits from Walmart, the US retailer often described as the world's biggest, and pointed to a strong performance from US consumers. ""Most economists actually say we are not going to have a recession. Most of them are saying we will not have a recession, but the rest of the world is not doing well like we are doing."" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow also said on Sunday there was ""no recession in sight"", telling Fox News Sunday: ""Consumers are working. Their wages are rising. They are spending and they are saving."" Are markets signalling that a recession is due? Fed member Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, warned that any lowering of interest rates could encourage a build up of debt as consumers borrow more. ""And is this the right stage in the cycle for us to encourage people to be taking on more debt?"" he said in an interview broadcast on Bloomberg Television. Mr Rosengren was one of two dissenting votes at the US central bank on its decision last month to cut borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. He also warned against more stimulus, saying that just because other countries are weak does not means the US should be easing. Markets around the world were rattled last week by the movement in the bond markets, which also knocked stock markets. On Wednesday last week, US stock markets fell by about 3% when the yield curve inverted, although they had recovered lost ground by the end of the week. Last month,the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008, and more cuts are expected. Janus Henderson's Laura Foll told the BBC's Today Programme that the US central bank was ""responding to global events"" such as the contraction in both the UK and German economies during the second quarter. The Bundesbank says the main reason for Germany's slowing economy is the manufacturing sector The German economy contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter of the year,according to figures released last week, and its central bank said on Monday that it could shrink again in the third quarter - indicating a recession. ""Overall economic performance could again decline slightly,"" the Bundesbank said in a monthly report. ""The main reason for this is the continuing downturn in industry."" The US economy also slowed in the last quarter, growing at an annualised pace of 2.1%. The US president has published about 40 tweets either criticising Fed chairman Jerome Powell or pushing for a rate cut. ""Of course, it is really hard to know how much of an effect Trump is having,"" Ms Foll said. ""I don't think you can rule out the extreme pressure the Fed is under from Trump, but it is really hard to know how much of a direct knock-on effect that is having on policy.""

"This video can not be played Wildfires rip through Gran Canaria About 9,000 people have been evacuated as wildfires rip through Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. The fires, which started on Saturday, are advancing on two fronts in a mountainous area of the island. In a press conference on Monday, authorities called the incident ""an unprecedented environmental tragedy"". Efforts to tackle the fires are being hampered by high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity, officials said. About 14 planes and helicopters, as well as about 700 firefighters on the ground including 200 from the military, have been deployed. The blaze has so far spared residential areas and tourist hotspots, but has spread into the island's Tamadaba natural park, home to some of the island's oldest pine forests. ""The fire is not contained nor stabilised or controlled,"" Canary Islands regional president Angel Victor Torres told a news conference on Sunday. Planes and helicopters have been deployed to tackle the blazes The fires are threatening old areas of pine forest In some areas, the flames were so high that water-dropping planes were unable to operate. The fires started near the town of Tejeda. Overnight, the affected area increased from 3400 to 6000 hectares and flames as high as 50 metres (164 ft) were reported.

"Tariffs on food such as beef and milk can be high Lidl's Irish business has reminded British suppliers they are expected to pay any EU import tariffs imposed on goods crossing borders after Brexit. Currently, as both countries are member states, no tariffs are paid. But Lidl's current contracts with suppliers contain a clause saying goods must be delivered with tariffs paid. The supermarket said it had held workshops with British suppliers to make sure they had the necessary information to ""avoid any disruption"". ""We have been working closely for over two years with external consultants, not only to get our business Brexit ready, but also to ensure our valued suppliers are as prepared as possible. ""All existing Lidl contracts contain a DDP ('delivered duty paid') clause. In an effort to understand the level of preparedness of key UK suppliers we are communicating proactively with them and working together to resolve any potential barriers to supply,"" the supermarket said in a statement. Gove: No-deal dossier is 'worst-case scenario' What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana? The delivered duty paid clause means that the cost of transporting goods, including tariffs on EU exports, are the responsibility of the supplier. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, tariffs on EU exports would come into force automatically, according to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. EU tariffs on food can be both high and complex. On some types of beef it is 12.8% plus 265 euros per 100kg for meat from outside the EU. The average for dairy products is more than 35%. Supplierstold the Times,externalnewspaper that other supermarkets are also likely to enforce deals similar to Lidl's agreement. A supermarket source told the newspaper that the potential costs were too high for all suppliers to be able to cover them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal on 31 October. While he has committed to cutting most tariffs on foreign goods being imported into the UK, tariffs for goods exported from the UK to the EU are outside of his control. Dr Peter Holmes, fellow of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, told the BBC: ""The UK suppliers will pay tariffs going into the EU, and EU suppliers will pay tariffs going into the UK [if there are any]. ""You can avoid this if you sign a free trade agreement, and the UK can unilaterally remove all trade tariffs but it has to do so for all trading partners and this would not remove the tariffs on UK exports to the EU."" He said that suddenly implementing WTO rules would be a ""serious shock"" to the economy. ""The point to make is that, tariffs are in general passed on from the supplier to the consumer, so it doesn't really make any difference who actually directly pays them. If Lidl lines up suppliers to cover no-deal costs, as soon as they can suppliers will pass those costs on, or withdraw from the market.""

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew is appalled by sex abuse claims about his ex-friend Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace has said. It comes after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished footage that claimed to show the Duke of York inside the financier's Manhattan mansion in 2010 - two years after Epstein's first conviction. Epstein, 66, took his own life in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York. He previously socialised with Prince Andrew and President Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Buckingham Palace statement said: ""The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. ""His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" The short statement from the palace has all the right words: appalled, abhorrent, deplores. There is little doubt that the prince wants the world to know how much he is horrified by what his former friend Epstein is accused of. It was public knowledge that Prince Andrew had kept in contact with the billionaire sex offender after his 2008 conviction. The photo of the two men walking in Central Park in 2010 led to serious criticism of the prince's judgement. But to see him inside Epstein's house, as young women come and go, looking for all the world as if he was a happy house-guest, is a disturbing sight. And strong though the palace statement may be it, it fails to answer the central question. Just what was Prince Andrew doing visiting the house of a convicted paedophile? New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. Epstein death ruled 'suicide by hanging' Prince Andrew 'groped' woman, court files allege He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including former US President Bill Clinton. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine,Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"",external. Donald Trump once called Epstein a ""terrific guy"" But he later said the pair fell out ""12 or 15 years ago"" and reiterated last month that he was ""not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"". Reports of Epstein's wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. He was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. Police arrested him last month after he landed in New Jersey on his private jet. Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges and was being held without bail. He faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. The financier avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. The duke was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 after the tycoon had served his 18-month prison sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution. His former friendship with Epstein attracted criticism at the time and hequit his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011after the fallout from the photos. The pair had also met at Epstein's Florida home over the years. Prince Andrew later acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been a mistake.  2006Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor 2008Epstein gets an 18-month sentence following a plea deal 2010Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in New York 2015The duke is named in a US court case relating to Epstein Buckingham Palace has previously denied claims the duke groped a woman in Epstein's US home. The accusation was made in documents from a 2015 defamation case. Contained in the defamation case papers is an allegation by a woman called Johanna Sjoberg that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001. According to court filings, another of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, claimed she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 1999 and 2002, when she was under-age according to US law. But Buckingham Palace has previously branded the allegations ""false and without any foundation"", stating: ""Any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"".

"Senior Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin has said he does not support Jeremy Corbyn becoming a caretaker prime minister in a bid to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But he backed discussions across the Commons to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the EU by 31 October ""do or die"". Mr Corbyn said the UK needs a government that is ""prepared to negotiate"" with the EU. His current plan is to win a no-confidence vote in the government, become interim prime minister and ""do everything we can"" to stop a no-deal Brexit. What is a vote of no confidence? Clarke and Harman 'open to leading government' Corbyn 'open to' law forcing Brexit delay Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Once in the role of caretaker prime minister, Mr Corbyn say he intends to delay Brexit, call a snap election, and campaign for another referendum. Sir Oliver, who was among senior Tories who received a letter from Mr Corbyn about the plan, was asked about Mr Corbyn's proposal on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That appears to be his agenda. I have to say it is not one I personally share,"" he said. ""I don't think it's at all likely that a majority would be formed for that and I personally wouldn't want to vote for it. I wouldn't be able to support that, no."" Sir Oliver, a former cabinet minister, has led several attempts in Parliament to break the Brexit impasse and prevent a no-deal Brexit. But he said he was ""not very inclined"" to help bring down the government in a no-confidence vote and would ""rule it out"" if it led to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. His comments came amid an ongoing row among MPs who oppose no deal, with Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson initially dismissing Mr Corbyn's plan as a ""nonsense"". Mr Corbyn said he assumed everyone who wanted to avoid a no-deal Brexit - including the Liberal Democrats - would vote for the motion of no confidence that Labour intends to launch against the government. ""What we need is a government that is prepared to negotiate with the European Union so we don't have a crash-out on the 31st,"" he added. Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group, said she would ""not support nor facilitate any government led by Jeremy Corbyn"". But the head of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, was among those applying pressure to Ms Swinson to change her stance. The Liberal Democrat leader suggested Tory grandee Ken Clarke or former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman could head a temporary government instead of Mr Corbyn. Mr Clarke responded on Friday to sayhe was willing to lead a government of national unityto avoid a no-deal Brexit. Asked if Mr Clarke or Ms Harman could lead the country through a political crisis, Mr Corbyn said: ""What we need is a respect for the electoral process that brought about the results from the last general election."" Sir Oliver suggested the majority of MPs did not want a no-deal Brexit, although he said he was ""not terribly optimistic"" they would reach an agreement. The former minister, who has agreed to meet with Mr Corbyn to discuss plans to avoid a no deal, said opponents of the government's Brexit position needed to ""talk a lot"" and ""talk frankly"". Meanwhile, fellow senior Tory MP Dominic Grieve said there was a ""a considerable head of steam growing to try to make sure that no deal doesn't occur"". He also refused to back the Labour leader to be a caretaker prime minister, telling BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme it was ""absolutely vital"" any interim PM commanded ""high levels of trust"". ""I simply don't think that Jeremy Corbyn, as leader of the Labour Party - and particularly with his very strong views, which he's entitled to - is the right person,"" he said. Although he said he himself would be willing to be a caretaker prime minister, he said, ""there are others who are rather more suitable for doing it than I am"". Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, said there was a ""growing number"" of Tory MPs who were ""horrified"" by the direction of Mr Johnson's government. ""His views, and the way he's expressing them, are so removed from what I would describe as proper and traditional conservatism as to cause real disquiet,"" he said. ""We have a deeply divided country and we are not going to resolve this problem by this type of tub-thumping populism. "" He accused the prime minister of ""behaving like a demagogue"". He said Mr Johnson's language had led to members of the public sending death threats to him for his role in trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson earlier this weekaccused MPs ""who think they can block Brexit"" of a ""terrible collaboration"" with the EU. ""If leading politicians use language - collaborator is an obvious one - or call people a traitor, you immediately start to receive really vile emails and communications,"" Mr Grieve said. Tory MP and Brexiteer Sir John Redwood told Today he was not worried about opposition to the government's Brexit stance. ""I would be surprised if this parliament developed a majority to thwart the British people because the overwhelming majority of MPs were elected on a clear promise to see us out of the European Union with a deal if there's a good deal on offer and without the deal if there wasn't a good deal on offer,"" he said.
