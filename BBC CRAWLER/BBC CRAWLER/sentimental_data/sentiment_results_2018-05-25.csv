"This video can not be played Sara, 9, paid tribute to her cousin Mehdi El-Wahabi A nine-year-old girl has paid tribute to her young cousin who died in Grenfell Tower fire alongside four members of his family. Sara Chebiouni recalled playing with Mehdi El-Wahabi and read a poem written by one of his school friendsat the inquiry into the blaze,external. The family - Abdulaziz, 52, Faouzia, 41, Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 16, and Mehdi, eight, died in their 21st floor flat. Sara's father Hamed El-Wahabi wept as he recalled the ""heartbreaking"" events. There were also tributes to Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who was two weeks away from her 13th birthday, and to the five members of the Kedir family, who had been in their flat when the fire took hold on 14 June last year, causing 72 deaths. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 5 The poem for Mehdi described him as ""marvellously generous"", ""incredible"" and ""happy and helpful"". Sara, who also lived in Grenfell Tower, read out a tribute to Mehdi from his head teacher and recalled her time with the young daughters of theGomes family, his neighbours on the 21st-floor, who managed to escape the fire but whose baby Logan was stillborn shortly after. Wearing a grey sweatshirt top with Grenfell written on it, she added: ""I am looking forward to continuing playing with baby Logan's sisters again, but it is difficult knowing that Mehdi will never be able to play with us ever again."" Born in Morocco, Abdulaziz was a porter at University College London Hospital and a ""popular colleague known for being kind to his patients"", said his brother. Hamed said: ""After our father passed away, Aziz became the heart of our family, he took on a father figure; the supporter, the protector and the carer."" Faouzia El-Wahabi was remembered by her sister-in-law Hanan as a wonderful baker with a talent for sewing and a ""real presence in the community"". The El-Wahabi family lived on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower (clockwise from top left): Faouzia, Nur Huda, Mehdi, Abdulaziz, Yasin Remembering Huda, who was in the middle of GCSEs, her younger cousin Mariam told the inquiry: ""We all wanted to be like her."" Zak Chebiouni said football coach and accountancy student Yasin was an ""inspiration"" to others, adding that a ""piece of him will always live on through me"". Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Hashim Kedir, 44, died alongside his wife Nura Jemal, 35, daughter Firdows Hashim, 12, and sons Yahya Hashim, 13, and Yaqub Hashim, six, in the family's 22nd-floor flat . The Kedir family (clockwise from left): Hashim Kedir, Firdows Hashim, Yaqub Hashim, Yahya Hashim and Nura Jemal In a statement, Mr Kedir's sister Assema Kedir Habib revealed the health of her elderly father in Ethiopia deteriorated after he heard about the fire. He died 12 days later. Ms Habib remembered Yaqub's ""boundless energy"" and the kind-hearted Yahya. Firdaws was described as an ""intelligent, wise and eloquent"" girl with an ""amazing voice"". In a video played to the inquiry the broadcaster Jon Snow recalled awarding her a speech-writing prize. Nura Jemal ""could befriend absolutely anyone"", Ms Habid said, and Hashim was ""our dearest, smartest, soft-hearted and generous brother and uncle and my best friend"". She said Mr Kedir made earning money and helping the family his priority, working in construction and as a parking attendant, before becoming a black-cab driver. Ms Habib questioned why more was not done to save the family. She said she was not blaming the firefighters and was sure they did their best. But Ms Habib said her family were ""cremated unwillingly"" after being told to stay in their flat, adding: ""It felt like the attempt to save them, to save what was left of them, stopped too early."" ""Why didn't the UK as a government try to do more that night?"" she asked. ""Was it because the lives of the victims of Grenfell Tower didn't matter?"" Questions about the response to the fire were also raised by the family of a long-time resident of Grenfell Tower, who died after going into the burning block to wake up his daughter. Steve Power's former partner Claudia Davis urged the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick to ""do right"". His daughter Sherrie told the hearing that reports suggesting her father, 63, decided to stay in his 15th-floor flat because of his Staffordshire Bull Terriers were untrue. Father-of-five Mr Power, a keen fisherman and dance music DJ, had been advised to stay put by the authorities, Sherrie said. Steve Power's family say he was advised to stay in his flat Sitting alongside three of Mr Power's other children, she added: ""He needs justice, all the victims do, because as much as he loved that block he didn't deserved to die in it."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News All the commemorations have paid tribute to the best qualities of each person. But what makes a particularly powerful impression are the little personal details. Vincent Chiejina was the only person his sister Obi knew who could actually make crisps at home. Abdulaziz El-Wahabi always greeted people in the same way, ""hello guv'nor"" for men and ""hello darling"" for women. His wife Faouzia was a talented baker and seamstress. It is those details, as much as the kindness, infectious happiness and all-round magnificence of the deceased, that really reminds you that behind these many names were real, relatable people. It's also worth noting the extent to which the inquiry is trying to make this incredibly hard task as easy as possible for the bereaved. From counsellors around the room and calm-down breathing classes after each session, to breaking on time for afternoon prayers, the emphasis is still very much on those who lost so much. In a video, Jessica Urbano Ramirez's sister said it broke her heart that she will not be able to watch her ""grow up into a beautiful girl"". ""Not a day goes by where she doesn't cross my mind,"" Melanie Urbano Ramirez said. ""I will miss having a sister but she will always be in my heart."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez was two weeks away from her 13th birthday Jessica's family had not been in their 20th floor flat when the blaze broke out and had launched frantic search for their daughter in the following days. Her father Ramiro Urbano said: ""There are no words to describe the feelings of emptiness inside us all. ""Every day, every hour, and every minute we will lose concentration on whatever we are doing, whether it is a family gathering, or at work, or even alone at home, because she will be in our thoughts forever."" A shrine to Jessica and photographs of her on a trampoline and smiling next to birthday cakes was shown in the film. The inquiry also remembered the ""lovely, bubbly"" Ligaya Moore, 78, who liked dancing, visits to restaurants and shopping trips. Ligaya Moore was said to love visiting restaurants and shopping Her friend Nenita Bunggay said the Filipino pensioner, who had lived in the UK for 43 years and worked as a nanny, ""was so proud to live in Grenfell. ""She would always say every time we walked past: 'Nenita, that's my building, 21st floor. It's a big building and I love it so much, even though I'm alone there, I love seeing it every day'"". Vincent Chiejina, 60, who was found dead on the 17th floor, was a fan of the original Star Trek TV series, his sister Obi said in a video tribute on behalf of his family. Like Star Trek's Captain Kirk, Vincent ""prepared for a series of fleeting journeys and then suddenly without warning simply disappeared without trace from his planned destinations"", she said. Vincent had grown up in Nigeria before their family moved to the UK and he studied engineering at Sheffield University, but never became an engineer. Vincent Chiejina's family paid tribute to him for helping others Obi said in his later years her brother ""guided and gave directions to others. Let's celebrate and remember those who help others"". Khadija Khaloufi was remembered by her husband, Sabah Abdullah, as a person who always thought of helping her friends and neighbours. Khadija Khaloufi was remembered as a person who always thought of helping her friends and neighbours The couple lived on the 17th floor of Grenfell Tower and Mr Sabah said their children could not believe what happened, adding: ""I am not trying to make my wife an angel or something, but to them she was more than an angel."" ""I lost part of me"", he said in a film tribute.

"Junk food is often promoted to kids on social media Social media stars might be encouraging children to eat more unhealthy snacks, a new study suggests. It found children who saw popular vloggers consuming sugary and fatty snacks went on to eat 26% more calories than those who did not. The study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity, examined the responses of children to images from social media. The findings come amid calls for tougher rules on junk food advertising. The social media stars used in the study were Zoella, who has 10.9 million followers on Instagram, and Alfie Deyes, who has 4.6 million. Children consuming online time 'like junk food' Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads on family shows Stop junk food ads on kids' apps - WHO Allow Twitter content?

The 176 children were split into three groups and shown either pictures of the personalities promoting unhealthy snacks, healthy foods or non-food products. The children were then offered a range of healthy and unhealthy snacks to choose from, including grapes, carrot sticks, chocolate buttons or jelly sweets. The children who had seen the unhealthy images consumed an average of 448 calories, while the others ate just 357. Alfie Deyes was one of the social media stars used in the study Dr Emma Boyland, one of the researchers from the University of Liverpool, said that children consider vloggers to be ""everyday people"" just like their peers. ""They've earned a position of trust among young people and there has to be some responsibility along the line,"" she said. The researchers called for more protection for children online, particularly on social media channels where it is unclear whether they understand the difference between an advert and genuine content. Dr Boyland said: ""On TV there are more cues as to when it's advertising - there's an advert break, there's a jingle - whereas digitally it's a lot more embedded in the rest of the content."" Anna Coates, the lead researcher on the study, said: ""We know that if you show children a traditional drink advert, then their preference for that drink rises. We wanted to test their reactions to this new type of celebrity, the social media star. ""Now that we've shown that children are influenced by online stars, our next study will look at whether they understand that, in many cases, celebrities are being paid to promote products."" Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, called on the government to consider more regulation to protect children in its forthcoming childhood obesity strategy. ""It's vital that children are protected from the marketing of junk food, not only on TV but also online where they are increasingly spending time. ""Companies are able to target their adverts on social media, which does provide the opportunity for regulators to put restrictions in place.""

"This video can not be played Trump: 'North Korea meeting could still happen' US President Donald Trump has said his summit with North Korea's leader could still happen on 12 June, despite earlier cancelling the meeting. ""We'll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We're talking to them now. They very much want to do it, we'd like to do it,"" he told reporters. On Thursday, he blamed the North's ""open hostility"" for the cancellation of his talks with Kim Jong-un. North Korea later said it was willing to talk ""at any time in any form"". Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said Mr Trump's cancellation decision was ""extremely regrettable"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance The 12 June summit in Singapore would have been the first time a sitting US president had met a North Korean leader. The details of the now scrapped talks were unclear. But they would have focused on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. Just hours before Mr Trump cancelled the summit,North Korea said it had carried out its promise to dismantle tunnels at its only nuclear test site. 'My country was trying to test Trump' Decoding Trump's letter to Kim How did it all fall apart so soon? What just happened? Speaking to reporters outside the White House in Washington, the US president said: ""We gonna see what happens. We're talking to them [North Korea] now. It was a very nice statement they put out."" And Mr Trump added: ""Everybody plays games."" Shortly before this, Mr Trump welcomed North Korea's willingness to hold talks ""at any time"", describing it as ""warm and productive"".

Separately, US Defence Secretary James Mattis echoed Mr Trump's comments. ""We have got... possibly some good news on the Korea summit, where it may, if our diplomats can pull it off, may have it back on,"" he told reporters. It was personally addressed to Mr Kim. Mr Trump said he had been ""very much looking forward"" to meeting Mr Kim. ""Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have the long-planned meeting,"" Mr Trump said in a letter to Mr Kim. ""You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" he added. But he called the meeting a ""missed opportunity"", saying ""some day, I look very much forward to meeting you"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a separate statement at the White House, Mr Trump said the step was a ""tremendous setback for North Korea and the world"", adding the US military was ""ready if necessary"" to respond to any ""reckless"" act from North Korea. A senior administration official in the US later gave further details, saying North Korea had shown ""a profound lack of good faith"". There were a series of ""broken promises"" from Pyongyang, the official told reporters, including when the White House sent the deputy chief of staff to Singapore to meet North Korean diplomats ahead of the summit. He was apparently responding tostatements from a senior North Korean diplomat attacking his administrationand casting doubt over the meeting. Choe Son-hui had said the suggestions from US Vice-President Mike Pence that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" was ""stupid"". This video can not be played Pompeo - US was ready but North Korea had gone silent on preparations Ms Choe, who has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade, said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed.

They stressed, however, there was a ""backdoor that's open still"". References to Libya have angered North Korea. There, former leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nascent nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. North Korea says that, unlike Libya, it is a fully fledged nuclear state. It is insistent it will not engage in any peace process that jeopardises its leadership or its survival as a state.

In April, the leaders of both Koreas had a historic meeting at the border,promising to end hostilities and work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the US and North Korea should not give up, saying ""nerves of steel"" were required. In the US, Republican Senator Tom Cotton praised President Trump for ""seeing through Kim Jong-un's fraud"".

"Online payment problems are continuing for frustrated TSB customers - five weeks on from the IT switchover that has caused a crisis at the bank. Some current account customers and some business clients still face problems making internet or app payments. The bank said experts from computing giant IBM, called in during the first week of the fiasco, would remain ""for as long as it takes"" to fix the errors. It has not estimated how long it will be until services return to normal. The ongoing problems come in a week when some customers have reported fraudsters emptying their accounts.  In addition, some customers who have switched away from the bank have reported receiving letters suggesting they have died. TSB left man on hold as his wedding savings were stolen Customer choice under threat at Britain's banks TSB said it had teams ""working around the clock"" to fix the issues which began after the migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current TSB owner Sabadell. Among the most serious are the payment problems faced by business banking customers, such as Sam Watterson, who runs a lettings firm in Leeds. He has spent recent weeks manually entering details into a spreadsheet, as it is impossible to download a file from his account. He is also struggling to set up new payments to landlords. ""This is creating a backlog of payments. We are muddling through, but it is taking forever to do something simple,"" he said. He said he had reported the issues to TSB but had not heard anything back. ""We are asking business banking customers, who may be experiencing problems making payments online, to contact us so we can help them meet their payment obligations, such as salaries and invoicing to suppliers,"" a spokeswoman for TSB said. ""We are really sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and we understand how challenging the past few weeks may have been for some of our business customers.  No customer will be left out of pocket as a result of any issues experienced."" On Friday, BBC Radio 4's You and Yours revealed howone TSB customer watched thousands of pounds in wedding savings being stolen from his internet accountas he waited on hold for the bank's fraud department. Ben Alford, from Weymouth in Dorset, said it took more than four and a half hours to get through to TSB, by which time most of the money had gone. TSB said it had put in ""additional resources"" to support customers. Letters received by former TSB customers who had switched created confusion Financial website Moneysavingexpert also reported how some customers had received lettersincorrectly suggesting account holders had died,external. Several former TSB customers reported receiving letters from various organisations including local councils saying they were sorry to hear of their passing. The letters also said that their direct debits had been cancelled. Customers had then got in contact with those who had sent them the letters, and been informed that TSB had told them that they had died. ""We are aware there was an issue with a small number of our customers switching from or closing their account with TSB, which resulted in an error in the cancellation or transfer of some of their direct debits,"" a TSB spokeswoman said. ""We are deeply sorry for any distress caused. We are working to rectify this issue and we are really sorry for the inconvenience caused."" Text message balance alerts, such as when customers are going into the red, are not working. Meanwhile, some customers are receiving redress. Ben and Lorna Connolly faced wedding payment problems The case of Lorna Connolly, formerly Lorna McHale, was raised with TSB chief executive Paul Pester during his appearance before the Treasury Committee of MPs after the BBC revealed how she was unable to access her account days before her wedding day. She said she had to ""ring to grovel"" with suppliers for the wedding, including the DJ, the wedding car provider, and those doing her hair and make-up, all of which were small businesses. TSB rang the day before her wedding to offer her compensation. ""They gave me Â£100 as a gesture of goodwill, which didn't really alleviate any of the stress, but I was flustered and just accepted,"" she said. She said her account was mostly back to normal - a conclusion yet to be the case for every TSB customer.

"This video can not be played As Harvey Weinstein turns himself in, an accuser, Rose McGowan, reacts Former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been charged in New York with rape and several counts of sexual abuse stemming from two separate accusers. Mr Weinstein turned himself in to police in the city earlier in the day. Dozens of women have made allegations against the 66 year old, including rape and sexual assault, and giving rise to the #MeToo movement. Mr Weinstein has denied committing any non-consensual sex acts and his lawyer said he would plead not guilty. He was released on a $1m bail bond and ordered to wear an electronic tag. A statement from the New York Police Department said Mr Weinstein ""was arrested, processed and charged with rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate women"". He arrived at the police station in lower Manhattan at 07:30 (12:30 BST) on Friday, carrying three books. After having his mugshot and fingerprints taken, he was led out in handcuffs and taken to court. Weinstein was led out of the police station in handcuffs During a brief court appearance, during which Mr Weinstein did not speak, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi said the former mogul had ""used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually"". Mr Weinstein's lawyer Ben Brafman told reporters outside the court that the disgraced mogul would enter a not guilty plea. ""We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges,"" Mr Brafman said. ""We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence."" Lucia Evans is thought to be one of the accusers who prompted Friday's charges In its statement, the New York Police Department thanked ""these brave survivors for their courage to come forward and seek justice"". The identity of one of the women whose accusations prompted the charges was confirmed by her lawyer on Friday. Lucia Evans, a former actress, had already publicly accused Mr Weinstein of forcing her into oral sex in 2004. ""This is an emotional moment,"" her lawyer Carrie Golberg said in a statement. ""Today is big. But sexual violence is still happening. A victim or offender's fame should not matter. These cases must be prosecuted."" These are the first criminal charges against Mr Weinstein, who already faces a raft of civil lawsuits. This video can not be played ""It's a concrete slap in the face of abuse of power,"" says actor Rose McGowan on Harvey Weinstein being charged. The actress Rose McGowan, who accused Mr Weinstein of rape, told the BBC it had been an ""amazing day for his survivors"". ""It's a very significant moment, it's a concrete slap in the face of abuse of power,"" she said. ""It's just the beginning of that process and if we can see this through to the end, I hope we emerge victorious."" The allegations against the disgraced mogul triggered the #MeToo movement, which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Nada Tawfik, North America reporter, in New York It was a carefully choreographed performance. As Harvey Weinstein turned himself in to police, the world's media got an unobstructed view of the ""perp walk"". At the police station in Tribeca, not far from where he ran his media empire, there is no underground passageway or back door. He could not avoid the spotlight that up until months ago had always been glowing and reverential. The disgraced Hollywood producer emerged from the back of his black SUV and ignored the questions shouted by reporters. Under his arm were three books, one of which was a biography of the controversial producer and director Elia Kazan, who was shunned by Hollywood after he outed several colleagues as communists during the McCarthy era. But Kazan's actions did not ultimately cost him his career. Many wonder, does Harvey Weinstein still believe in a comeback even after dozens of women have accused him of sexual assault, and after the powerful rise of the #MeToo movement? Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. ActressAshley Judd is suing the Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. One of the cases was in New York, where Italian model Ambra Battilana accused Mr Weinstein of groping her in 2015. Investigators decided not to charge him even though there was an audiotape of Mr Weinstein accepting he had touched Ms Battilana's breasts and pledging not to do so again. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing several cases involving accusations against Mr Weinstein after police investigations, and London's Metropolitan Police are also assessing a sexual abuse allegation against him. Mr Weinstein was fired last year from his production firm, the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. He has been condemned by top industry figures, and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him from its membership. The #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment and abuse swept through Hollywood last autumn in the wake of the accusations against Mr Weinstein. The movement was prompted by an invitation from actress Alyssa Milano on Twitter, asking those who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to reply ""Me Too"". She received half a million responses in 24 hours. What has #MeToo actually changed? ""Me Too"" began as an idea back in 2006, with rights activist Tarana Burke, who used it as the name for a group to help those who had been sexually harassed and assaulted. In January, more than 300 actresses, writers and directors launched the Time's Up project, raising $21m in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment, abuse or assault at work. A number of high-profile figures in entertainment have been accused since the Weinstein story.On Thursday US film star Morgan Freeman apologised following allegations of sexual misconduct.

"This video can not be played As Harvey Weinstein turns himself in, an accuser, Rose McGowan, reacts Former Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein has been released on $1m (Â£751,000) bail after being charged in New York with rape and sexual abuse. Mr Weinstein, 66, also agreed to wear a GPS tracker and to surrender his passport after turning himself in to police on Friday. He denies non-consensual sex and his lawyer said he would plead not guilty. The actress Rose McGowan, who accused Mr Weinstein of rape, told the BBC it was an ""amazing day for his survivors"". ""It's a very significant moment, it's a concrete slap in the face of abusive power,"" she said. ""It's just the beginning of that process and if we can see this through to the end, I hope we emerge victorious."" The allegations against the disgraced film producer triggered the #MeToo movement, which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Harvey Weinstein did not speak during his brief appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court More than 70 women have accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct although the charges relate to only two of them. Some allegations date back decades. New York City police said on Friday that Mr Weinstein had been charged with rape, sex abuse, sexual misconduct and a criminal sex act. The charges related to incidents involving two women, who were not identified. He had arrived at a police station in lower Manhattan during the morning, carrying three books. After having his mugshot and fingerprints taken, he was led out in handcuffs and taken to court. In the brief court appearance, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi said the former studio boss had ""used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually"". Where the Weinstein case goes from here Who has accused Weinstein of what? What has #MeToo actually changed? Witnesses say Mr Weinstein appeared pale and stared into space while prosecutors outlined the bail agreement. The case was then adjourned until 30 July. Outside the court, Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, told reporters his client would enter a not guilty plea. ""We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges,"" Mr Brafman said. ""We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence."" The New York Police Department issued a statement thanking ""these brave survivors for their courage to come forward and seek justice"". The identity of one of the women whose accusations prompted the charges was confirmed by her lawyer on Friday. Former actress Lucia Evans had already publicly accused Mr Weinstein of forcing her into oral sex in 2004. Lucia Evans is thought to be one of the accusers who prompted Friday's charges ""This is an emotional moment,"" her lawyer, Carrie Golberg, said in a statement. ""Today is big. But sexual violence is still happening. A victim or offender's fame should not matter. These cases must be prosecuted."" These are the first criminal charges against Mr Weinstein, who already faces a raft of civil lawsuits. Mr Weinstein was fired last year from his production firm, the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. He has been condemned by top industry figures, and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him from its membership. Where does the Weinstein case go from here?

"Back in 1977 when a sneering, snarling Sid Vicious joined the Sex Pistols to take the band's punk aesthetic up a notch or two, there was another young man making his own arty entrance on to the public stage. I have no idea if Peter Murray has ever worn a padlocked chain around his neck or sported a red T-shirt emblazoned with a swastika, but I'm guessing not. He doesn't strike me as the type. But that doesn't mean the mark he has made on the cultural landscape of Great Britain is any less indelible or incredible than the nihilistic sound of the late Sex Pistol. While Sid was being vicious, Peter Murray wasn't. He was hanging out at Bretton Hall near Wakefield teaching art teachers to teach art. The building was set in a nice location, the epitome of William Blake's ""green and pleasant land"" with rolling hills and all that. It was the perfect landscape, the enterprising Murray thought, in which to exhibit some modern art. Black and Blue The Invisible Men and the Masque of Blackness, by Zak Ove And so, with a Â£1,000 grant from a regional arts agency, he put on a group show of contemporary sculptors that included Mike Lyons, William Tucker, Kenneth Armitage (all male line-ups were de rigueur in the 1970s. And the '80s. And the '90s. And the noughties). That was then. Today, Murray's Yorkshire Sculpture Park spans 500 eye-popping acres, welcomes around half a million people a year, boasts one of the finest displays of sculpture you will ever rest your eyes upon, and has spawned copycat art parks across the world. You can go there and see - for free - grade A, five-star art by Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Phyllida Barlow, Joan MirÃ³ and Ai Weiwei, among many others. Their work is dotted about in fields and woods, where even the trees start to morph into sculptures. Ai Weiwei's Iron Tree (2013) Tete by Joan MirÃ³ (1974) That's not me coming over all dewy-eyed and poetic, by the way. Some of the trees really are sculptures: great big bronze trunks and branches that look just like the real thing until you give them a hug and feel cold metal rather than warm bark. They are the work of the respected septuagenarian Italian artist, Giuseppe Penone, the subject of a new special exhibition at YSP. He is the David Attenborough of art, an observer of nature who makes work to heighten our awareness of the beauty and power of the natural world. He says he is particularly keen on trees as he sees them as the ""perfect sculpture"" - an exquisitely balanced form with roots that dive deep into the watery underworld, and branches that reach up towards the light in the sky. He talks a lot about the ""forces of gravity"" (often expressed through placing one-tonne balls of concrete in his trees' branches) and the ""weight of life we are part of"". Giuseppe Penone, Luce e Ombra (2014) I asked him if his sculptures were a comment on the concept of a tree of life. He looked on me with benevolent pity, knotted his eyebrows, and replied with a winning smile: ""Errâ¦yeahâ¦if you want it to. It's possible."" In other words, no they aren't. What then, are they about beyond the obvious homage to nature? Getting an answer to that question from any artist is always tricky, and Signor Penone is no different. He speaks philosophically about how we can only truly relate to the material world by seeing objects as an extension of ourselves. Which is why in a pile of real potatoes arranged against a wall in the indoor gallery space, he has added three bronze spuds onto which human facial features have been subtly moulded. The idea of anthropomorphising nature is repeated in a marble wall sculpture called Corpo di Pietra - Rami (2016), in which the artist interprets the natural ridges on the marble's surface as the veins on the back of a human hand. Giuseppe Penone, Corpo di Pietra - Rami (2016) Sometimes, for me at least, he is a little too obvious when making the point about Man simply being a part of nature as opposed to being a separate or superior living entity. There are, for instance, a series of bronze casts called Trattenere Anni di Crescita (2004-16) that consist of a tree trunk with a hand embedded in it, from which a severed arm protrudes like a branch. Giuseppe Penone, Trattenere Anni di Crescita (2004-16) They looked a bit surreal to me, but the artist repeated his charming knotted eyebrow routine again when I dared to share that thought with him. They are what they are and no more, he explained: a meditation on nature, art, and life. It's an approach that also happens to eloquently sum up the YSP, which is why Giuseppe Penone is such a good choice for a special exhibition. Frankly, I think his outdoor pieces in the landscape are superior to those in the brightly lit gallery building, but they are all worthy of some time spent. What's more, if they are not quite your thing, you can always set off and explore the rest of the park, which, over the last 41 years has developed into one of the great jewels of the English countryside.

" About eight miles from Penzance, down one of those narrow, winding country lanes Cornwall is notorious for, lies Gwynver beach. Many will drive past without realising it is there, bound instead for the fishing village of Sennen or the tourist attraction of Land's End. But those who make the turn, opposite a chapel featuring a cross formed by two surfboards, will be rewarded. On a fine day, Gwynver could pass for paradise. A stretch of blindingly bright sand caressed by the blue Atlantic. A curved cliff envelops the beach like a pair of protective wings. Out to sea, trawlers chug along. The waves are dotted by surfers, undeterred by a smooth swell, their wetsuits shining black, their boards a grainy white. Gwynver was Jacob’s spiritual home. It was here he surfed and held late-night barbecue parties. It was here his friends gathered the day after his death to light fires and release lanterns. It was here his ashes were scattered along with those of his sister Grace. Jacob's existence was one of exhilaration, excitement and risk. Whether dancing at all-night raves, surfing impossible waves or exploring crystal-filled caves, Jacob attacked life full throttle. ""He had these crazy eyes that looked like the sea, his hair was always unkempt, he always looked happy,"" says his friend Barnaby Courtney. ""He made you believe magic existed."" Jacob grew up just outside Penzance and, although he travelled the world, he only felt truly at home in the town and the beaches that surround it. It was a quintessential Cornish childhood. Days were spent running around the countryside or bathing at the beach. Children were tanned or pink from days in the sun, or bundled up in Quiksilver coats against the murky mist that often smothered the land. ""Jacob loved the water,"" his mother Carolyn says. ""Once he was in you could never get him out."" Diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 10, school was a struggle. He would skip lessons with his friends to hitchhike to the beach, surfboards beneath their arms. Grace was the polar opposite of her brother - a star pupil. She worked hard, consistently scored top marks and was a champion at netball, hockey and cross country. ""Grace was great,"" says Paul Kellas, Jacob’s form tutor at Cape Cornwall Comprehensive and now the school's assistant head teacher. He smiles at his memories of her but the smile fades. ""What happened to her, well, it was heartbreaking. ""What more does that poor family have to go through?"" Jacob was the youngest of four children, the baby brother to Grace, Laura and Joe. But he was closest to Grace, three years his senior. When he was a toddler the pair devised a secret language and she would always speak for him. In fact people thought Jacob had a problem. ""They were genuinely worried that he didn't know how to talk,"" says his older sister Laura. ""But I said of course he knows how to talk, it's just he doesn't need to, Grace does it for him."" As Jacob grew older, his closeness to Grace remained. ""She was really bright but also really driven and determined; if she wanted to achieve something she did,"" says her best friend Dabriella Quayle. ""She was the sort of girl your parents talked about, 'why can't you be more like Grace'?"" Dabriella’s twin sister Aprilla nods in agreement. ""She was very headstrong, but she was also fun. ""She was older than her years, she had the sense of someone in their 30s or 40s."" The twins pause. ""Looking back now it was eerie,"" says Aprilla. ""Almost as if Grace knew she had limited time so had to excel and do everything."" We thought through it all she was going to survive."" The headaches had begun in the summer of 2001 while Grace was on a gap year working at children's camps in France. She came home in the August and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September. Grace underwent radiotherapy at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, her family camping nearby throughout. However, Jacob stayed at home. ""Because he was younger we did not tell Jacob a lot of what was happening,"" says his mother. ""We thought through it all she was going to survive."" After six months Grace's cancer returned and her only hope was an operation in Belgium. Grace went to Belgium, the operation was only a partial success. The tumour returned. This time it was terminal. Grace died on 18 December 2002. She was 20. After her death, Grace's ashes were stored in the airing cupboard, her ""favourite place in the house"". She had asked for them to be kept until another family member died. She had been afraid of being scattered alone. It surprised Dabriella. ""I thought it was a very strange request for her,"" she says. ""She had always been such an independent person, it was just very un-Grace."" Eleven years later, following the death of her grandmother, arrangements were finally being made to scatter their ashes together. Then, a day before the planned ritual, Grace's younger brother died. She was no longer alone. Jacob was the youngest of four children, the baby brother to Grace, Laura and Joe. But he was closest to Grace, three years his senior. When he was a toddler the pair devised a secret language and she would always speak for him. In fact people thought Jacob had a problem. ""They were genuinely worried that he didn't know how to talk,"" says his older sister Laura. ""But I said of course he knows how to talk, it's just he doesn't need to, Grace does it for him.""

Eleven years later, following the death of her grandmother, arrangements were finally being made to scatter their ashes together. Then, a day before the planned ritual, Grace's younger brother died. She was no longer alone. Jacob was 17 when Grace died and her death had a devastating impact on him. It changed his view of life. He believed her energy transferred into him. This inspired him to ""throw everything to the wind and give it a try,"" his girlfriend Rachel says. ""He thought, as a young beautiful woman she did not do anything in life to deserve that, there was no karma to it, it was just cruel. ""He felt like he needed to live his life for her as well as for himself. ""Maybe that's why he lived his life twice as hard."" On a board in his bedroom, a teenage Jacob had laid bare his ambition. ""I am becoming a world famous photographer and filmer,"" he had written. ""I will concentrate my mind on this desire for 10 minutes daily for the purpose of determining just how I shall transform it into reality. ""I will permit nothing to intervene with my doing so."" The photography normally went hand in hand with his other obsession - taking risks. He would usually be armed with a camera during each daredevil escapade and was prepared to do anything to get the best shots. Jacob pushed himself to greater extremes. He taught himself to hold his breath for long periods so he could explore the depths. He would also surf over rocks or towards cliffs.The danger of it all was part of the draw. ""He and his friends dared to surf where others did not,"" says Gary Richards, a friend who had known Jacob since babysitting him. ""They wanted to catch the bigger waves and do bigger tricks."" After he and his friends surfed a storm in Newlyn in 2008, numerous national newspapers splashed with this photograph showing Jacob moments before he was struck by a huge wave. A regular stunt was to throw himself from tall buildings into the water below, such as the three-storey Abbey Warehouse in Penzance harbour. He received a police caution after leaping from a railway bridge in Hayle. And on another occasion, he jumped into the harbour outside Bosun’s Locker Nightclub in Penzance and had to be rescued from being crushed by a ship. Zain Ishmael was one of those who came to his aid, forming a four-man human chain with his friends to pull a jubilant Jacob to safety. Everyone cheered, Jacob laughed and then just ran off into the night. ""What a crazy cat,"" Zain recalled. Jacob was 17 when Grace died and her death had a devastating impact on him. It changed his view of life. He believed her energy transferred into him. This inspired him to ""throw everything to the wind and give it a try,"" his girlfriend Rachel says.

Everyone cheered, Jacob laughed and then just ran off into the night. ""What a crazy cat,"" Zain recalled. By his early 20s, he had won awards from National Geographic and The Sunday Times. He was a regular contributor to surf magazines, often providing the much-coveted cover shot. Most of his pictures featured the sea. His shot of a fishing boat returning to port in a large swell won a competition to appear on posters on the London Underground. Weeks before his death, he won a £28,000 expedition to Antarctica, the adventure of a lifetime. Jacob's shot of his friend Seb surfing near a supertanker in Sumatra was the winning image in a travel photography contest run by The Guardian. Judges said the picture would ""stand the test of time"". As well as being a stunning photograph it also epitomised his ethos - the shoot had been ""extremely dangerous"", according to Jacob. Waves bouncing off the great hulk of the hull were wildly unpredictable and just below the surface there were great twists of metal waiting to skewer the unfortunate. Another photograph Jacob entered for the same competition won a photograph of the month prize for August. A selfie of him and his friends partying in a small Cornish pub, its magic-of-the-moment unbridled joy and energy was typical of his style. ""His career was photography but that encompassed so much of what he found important in life,"" says Rachel. ""Everything he did was in symbiosis with the way he lived his life. It was all kind of one big experiment."" The money he earned was quickly spent on new photography gadgets. Prizes, such as a new television, were typically given away to friends. He won expeditions, stays in fancy hotels, exhibition space. One contest saw him win a pair of custom design Nike trainers which he called the Yak 2000, Yak being one of the various nicknames he was known by. He sought new experiences and wanted to capture them all with his camera. One of these was close to his home. It seemed to offer the perfect combination of excitement and visual art. It was the whirlpool. The vortex in Hayle harbour only appeared a few times a year. It was a quirk of Victorian engineering devised to stop the harbour silting up. Water would be stored in a pool at high tide and, once the tide had retreated, released back into the harbour to wash away the sand. The water would get into the pool through a tunnel beneath a quay. But once every spring tide the sea would come back in faster than the water could pass through the tunnel. This would create the whirlpool. The swift-swirling vortex appealed to Jacob's adventurous spirit and enticed him in. Ignoring the warning signs placed around the sluice, he would swim with the whirlpool and film it. Jacob posted the videos on YouTube where they were watched millions of times, making him hundreds of pounds. The videos are beautiful and hypnotic. They are also terrifying. It was 28 May 2013 when the whirlpool returned. Artist David Raine, who had collaborated with Jacob in the past, was in his living room when he saw his friend running towards the house. Jacob was excited, already wearing his wetsuit and clutching his camera. David agreed to film him as he swam around the whirlpool. By the time he reached the harbour, Jacob was already in the water. He was wearing a rubber horse’s head, a prop he thought would make the video more eyecatching on YouTube. Jacob had already shot a lot of footage but while the whirlpool was there he wanted to make the most of it. David filmed from the quay as a whooping Jacob swirled around the whirlpool's edge. ""It looks a powerful one,"" David called to Jacob. ""Ah yeah, earlier on it was really scary,"" Jacob shouted back. ""It's fine now because it's so deep but when I first got in I was a bit scared to be honest. ""It's safe as now, though."" He let the whirlpool carry him around again. It caught Jacob, tugging him down. ""Woah woah,"" he cackled as he escaped the drag. ""That was pretty scary."" He asked David to pass him a GoPro camera attached to a short pole. Jacob wanted to get one last shot below the surface. Jacob dived down. David watched. Jacob did not reappear. David began to worry. He called his friend's name. David ran across to the other end of the quay where the tunnel the whirlpool funneled into flowed into a pool. He asked a fisherman if he had seen anyone come through, but he hadn't. There was a grill in the ground through which he could see the water churning through the tunnel below. But there was no sign of Jacob. David ran back and forth. Then he saw him. Jacob was in the pool, the tunnel had spat him out. He was floating in the water, face down. David waded out to him. He knew it was too late.

That night, Carolyn was in bed when the police arrived at her home. She was taken to Treliske Hospital in Truro to identify her son. She was so shocked she could not even cry. When she got home her house was full of people. It would remain so for days, a stream of mourners washing through. Jacob's funeral was a major event. The church could not accommodate all of the people who wished to attend. His coffin was painted with a wave motif and his body was dressed in his hole-riddled pants, shorts and favourite hat. Afterwards, about 40 of his friends did what they thought Jacob would have wanted them to; they went skinny dipping in Penzance's open-air, sea-filled pool The Jubilee. Shortly after Jacob’s death, Carolyn moved out of Penzance. She just had to. ""I would go to the supermarket and I would have people I did not even know coming up to me crying and hugging me,"" she says. ""We had to get away so we moved here."" Home is now an old farmhouse near Sennen, on the other side of a hill from Land's End airport. I do not think he was scared of death."" A few fields away is Gwynver, where Grace and Jacob’s ashes were scattered. Carolyn has transformed part of her garden into a shrine. At the top sits a statue of the Buddha. Buried beneath are the sunflowers from Grace's bedroom window and the dreadlocks which adorned Jacob's head. His surfboard stands in the front garden, next to the A30. Five years after he died, surfers bound for the nearby beaches and coves still honk their horns as they drive past. Inside, almost every wall is covered by Jacob’s photographs or paintings. ""He won every award going,"" Carolyn says proudly. But his absence is still being felt, she adds. ""There is never a day that I don't think about it."" A year after Jacob's death, the sluicing system in Hayle harbour was altered. It meant the whirlpool which had fascinated and ultimately killed Jacob vanished forever.

" About eight miles from Penzance, down one of those narrow, winding country lanes Cornwall is notorious for, lies Gwynver beach. Many will drive past without realising it is there, bound instead for the fishing village of Sennen or the tourist attraction of Land's End. But those who make the turn, opposite a chapel featuring a cross formed by two surfboards, will be rewarded. On a fine day, Gwynver could pass for paradise. A stretch of blindingly bright sand caressed by the blue Atlantic. A curved cliff envelops the beach like a pair of protective wings. Out to sea, trawlers chug along. The waves are dotted by surfers, undeterred by a smooth swell, their wetsuits shining black, their boards a grainy white. Gwynver was Jacob’s spiritual home. It was here he surfed and held late-night barbecue parties. It was here his friends gathered the day after his death to light fires and release lanterns. It was here his ashes were scattered along with those of his sister Grace. Jacob's existence was one of exhilaration, excitement and risk. Whether dancing at all-night raves, surfing impossible waves or exploring crystal-filled caves, Jacob attacked life full throttle. ""He had these crazy eyes that looked like the sea, his hair was always unkempt, he always looked happy,"" says his friend Barnaby Courtney. ""He made you believe magic existed."" Jacob grew up just outside Penzance and, although he travelled the world, he only felt truly at home in the town and the beaches that surround it. It was a quintessential Cornish childhood. Days were spent running around the countryside or bathing at the beach. Children were tanned or pink from days in the sun, or bundled up in Quiksilver coats against the murky mist that often smothered the land. ""Jacob loved the water,"" his mother Carolyn says. ""Once he was in you could never get him out."" Diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 10, school was a struggle. He would skip lessons with his friends to hitchhike to the beach, surfboards beneath their arms. Grace was the polar opposite of her brother - a star pupil. She worked hard, consistently scored top marks and was a champion at netball, hockey and cross country. ""Grace was great,"" says Paul Kellas, Jacob’s form tutor at Cape Cornwall Comprehensive and now the school's assistant head teacher. He smiles at his memories of her but the smile fades. ""What happened to her, well, it was heartbreaking. ""What more does that poor family have to go through?"" Jacob was the youngest of four children, the baby brother to Grace, Laura and Joe. But he was closest to Grace, three years his senior. When he was a toddler the pair devised a secret language and she would always speak for him. In fact people thought Jacob had a problem. ""They were genuinely worried that he didn't know how to talk,"" says his older sister Laura. ""But I said of course he knows how to talk, it's just he doesn't need to, Grace does it for him."" As Jacob grew older, his closeness to Grace remained. ""She was really bright but also really driven and determined; if she wanted to achieve something she did,"" says her best friend Dabriella Quayle. ""She was the sort of girl your parents talked about, 'why can't you be more like Grace'?"" Dabriella’s twin sister Aprilla nods in agreement. ""She was very headstrong, but she was also fun. ""She was older than her years, she had the sense of someone in their 30s or 40s."" The twins pause. ""Looking back now it was eerie,"" says Aprilla. ""Almost as if Grace knew she had limited time so had to excel and do everything."" We thought through it all she was going to survive."" The headaches had begun in the summer of 2001 while Grace was on a gap year working at children's camps in France. She came home in the August and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in September. Grace underwent radiotherapy at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, her family camping nearby throughout. However, Jacob stayed at home. ""Because he was younger we did not tell Jacob a lot of what was happening,"" says his mother. ""We thought through it all she was going to survive."" After six months Grace's cancer returned and her only hope was an operation in Belgium. Grace went to Belgium, the operation was only a partial success. The tumour returned. This time it was terminal. Grace died on 18 December 2002. She was 20. After her death, Grace's ashes were stored in the airing cupboard, her ""favourite place in the house"". She had asked for them to be kept until another family member died. She had been afraid of being scattered alone. It surprised Dabriella. ""I thought it was a very strange request for her,"" she says. ""She had always been such an independent person, it was just very un-Grace."" Eleven years later, following the death of her grandmother, arrangements were finally being made to scatter their ashes together. Then, a day before the planned ritual, Grace's younger brother died. She was no longer alone. Jacob was the youngest of four children, the baby brother to Grace, Laura and Joe. But he was closest to Grace, three years his senior.

Eleven years later, following the death of her grandmother, arrangements were finally being made to scatter their ashes together. Then, a day before the planned ritual, Grace's younger brother died. She was no longer alone. Jacob was 17 when Grace died and her death had a devastating impact on him. It changed his view of life. He believed her energy transferred into him. This inspired him to ""throw everything to the wind and give it a try,"" his girlfriend Rachel says. ""He thought, as a young beautiful woman she did not do anything in life to deserve that, there was no karma to it, it was just cruel. ""He felt like he needed to live his life for her as well as for himself. ""Maybe that's why he lived his life twice as hard."" On a board in his bedroom, a teenage Jacob had laid bare his ambition. ""I am becoming a world famous photographer and filmer,"" he had written. ""I will concentrate my mind on this desire for 10 minutes daily for the purpose of determining just how I shall transform it into reality. ""I will permit nothing to intervene with my doing so."" The photography normally went hand in hand with his other obsession - taking risks. He would usually be armed with a camera during each daredevil escapade and was prepared to do anything to get the best shots. Jacob pushed himself to greater extremes. He taught himself to hold his breath for long periods so he could explore the depths. He would also surf over rocks or towards cliffs.The danger of it all was part of the draw. ""He and his friends dared to surf where others did not,"" says Gary Richards, a friend who had known Jacob since babysitting him. ""They wanted to catch the bigger waves and do bigger tricks."" After he and his friends surfed a storm in Newlyn in 2008, numerous national newspapers splashed with this photograph showing Jacob moments before he was struck by a huge wave. A regular stunt was to throw himself from tall buildings into the water below, such as the three-storey Abbey Warehouse in Penzance harbour. He received a police caution after leaping from a railway bridge in Hayle. And on another occasion, he jumped into the harbour outside Bosun’s Locker Nightclub in Penzance and had to be rescued from being crushed by a ship. Zain Ishmael was one of those who came to his aid, forming a four-man human chain with his friends to pull a jubilant Jacob to safety. Everyone cheered, Jacob laughed and then just ran off into the night. ""What a crazy cat,"" Zain recalled. Jacob was 17 when Grace died and her death had a devastating impact on him.

Everyone cheered, Jacob laughed and then just ran off into the night. ""What a crazy cat,"" Zain recalled. By his early 20s, he had won awards from National Geographic and The Sunday Times. He was a regular contributor to surf magazines, often providing the much-coveted cover shot. Most of his pictures featured the sea. His shot of a fishing boat returning to port in a large swell won a competition to appear on posters on the London Underground. Weeks before his death, he won a £28,000 expedition to Antarctica, the adventure of a lifetime. Jacob's shot of his friend Seb surfing near a supertanker in Sumatra was the winning image in a travel photography contest run by The Guardian. Judges said the picture would ""stand the test of time"". As well as being a stunning photograph it also epitomised his ethos - the shoot had been ""extremely dangerous"", according to Jacob. Waves bouncing off the great hulk of the hull were wildly unpredictable and just below the surface there were great twists of metal waiting to skewer the unfortunate. Another photograph Jacob entered for the same competition won a photograph of the month prize for August. A selfie of him and his friends partying in a small Cornish pub, its magic-of-the-moment unbridled joy and energy was typical of his style. ""His career was photography but that encompassed so much of what he found important in life,"" says Rachel. ""Everything he did was in symbiosis with the way he lived his life. It was all kind of one big experiment."" The money he earned was quickly spent on new photography gadgets. Prizes, such as a new television, were typically given away to friends. He won expeditions, stays in fancy hotels, exhibition space. One contest saw him win a pair of custom design Nike trainers which he called the Yak 2000, Yak being one of the various nicknames he was known by. He sought new experiences and wanted to capture them all with his camera. One of these was close to his home. It seemed to offer the perfect combination of excitement and visual art. It was the whirlpool. The vortex in Hayle harbour only appeared a few times a year. It was a quirk of Victorian engineering devised to stop the harbour silting up. Water would be stored in a pool at high tide and, once the tide had retreated, released back into the harbour to wash away the sand. The water would get into the pool through a tunnel beneath a quay. But once every spring tide the sea would come back in faster than the water could pass through the tunnel. This would create the whirlpool. The swift-swirling vortex appealed to Jacob's adventurous spirit and enticed him in. Ignoring the warning signs placed around the sluice, he would swim with the whirlpool and film it. Jacob posted the videos on YouTube where they were watched millions of times, making him hundreds of pounds. The videos are beautiful and hypnotic. They are also terrifying. It was 28 May 2013 when the whirlpool returned. Artist David Raine, who had collaborated with Jacob in the past, was in his living room when he saw his friend running towards the house. Jacob was excited, already wearing his wetsuit and clutching his camera. David agreed to film him as he swam around the whirlpool. By the time he reached the harbour, Jacob was already in the water. He was wearing a rubber horse’s head, a prop he thought would make the video more eyecatching on YouTube. Jacob had already shot a lot of footage but while the whirlpool was there he wanted to make the most of it. David filmed from the quay as a whooping Jacob swirled around the whirlpool's edge. ""It looks a powerful one,"" David called to Jacob. ""Ah yeah, earlier on it was really scary,"" Jacob shouted back. ""It's fine now because it's so deep but when I first got in I was a bit scared to be honest. ""It's safe as now, though."" He let the whirlpool carry him around again. It caught Jacob, tugging him down. ""Woah woah,"" he cackled as he escaped the drag. ""That was pretty scary."" He asked David to pass him a GoPro camera attached to a short pole. Jacob wanted to get one last shot below the surface. Jacob dived down. David watched. Jacob did not reappear. David began to worry. He called his friend's name. David ran across to the other end of the quay where the tunnel the whirlpool funneled into flowed into a pool. He asked a fisherman if he had seen anyone come through, but he hadn't. There was a grill in the ground through which he could see the water churning through the tunnel below. But there was no sign of Jacob. David ran back and forth. Then he saw him. Jacob was in the pool, the tunnel had spat him out. He was floating in the water, face down. David waded out to him. He knew it was too late.

"A coat of arms created for the Duchess of Sussex that reflects her Californian background has been unveiled. It includes a shield containing the colour blue, representing the Pacific Ocean, and rays, symbolising sunshine. The duchess worked closely with the College of Arms in London to create the design, Kensington Palace said. The lion supporting the shield on the left is an image that dates back to early medieval times and relates to her husband, the Duke of Sussex. The songbird supporting the shield on the right relates to the Duchess of Sussex. Traditionally wives of members of the Royal Family have two - one of their husband's supporters on the shield and one relating to themselves. Beneath the shield is California's state flower - the golden poppy - and Wintersweet, a flower that grows at Kensington Palace and was also depicted on the duchess' wedding veil. Harry and Meghan attend first royal event How do you get a coat of arms? The three quills illustrate the power of words and communication. The duchess has also been assigned a coronet bearing fleurs-de-lys and strawberry leaves. Wintersweet also featured on the Duchess of Sussex's wedding veil Garter King of Arms Thomas Woodcock, who is based at the College of Arms said: ""The Duchess of Sussex took a great interest in the design. ""Good heraldic design is nearly always simple and the Arms of The Duchess of Sussex stand well beside the historic beauty of the quartered British Royal Arms. ""Heraldry as a means of identification has flourished in Europe for almost nine hundred years and is associated with both individual people and great corporate bodies such as cities, universities and, for instance, the livery companies in the City of London."" The Duchess of Sussex's coat of arms reflects her Californian background In 2011 a coat of arms was designed for the family of the Duchess of Cambridge - then Kate Middleton - which featured white chevronels symbolising mountains representing the family's love of the Lake District and skiing. As the grant was made to the Middleton family, the Duchess of Cambridge's siblings are also allowed to use the coat of arms. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's coat of armscombined the shields of Prince William and the Middleton family. The conjugal coat of arms for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Samantha Grant, a half sister of the duchess,told the Telegraph it was ""a huge insult,external"" that their father Thomas Markle had not been given a coat of arms. As an American, Mr Markle could apply for honorary arms - in addition to meeting the standard criteria of eligibility, however, he would also have to demonstrate his descent from a subject of the British Crown. This could include ancestors dating back to before 1783, when Britain recognised American independence. For any British person to have a legal right to a coat of arms it must have been granted to them or they must be descended in the male line from a person to whom arms were awarded. Organisations can also be granted a coat of arms. Coats of arms date back to 12th Century and were traditionally worn over armour in tournaments so participants could identify their opponents.

"Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the front line in Helmand Province A scheme aimed at protecting Afghan civilians who worked as interpreters for the Army has not resettled a single person in the UK and has proved an ""utter failure"", MPs have said. The Commons Defence Committee said the Intimidation Scheme had instead gone to lengths to stop relocations. The Ministry of Defence says Britain is the only nation that has a team in Kabul, investigating intimidation. But Col Simon Diggins said interpreters were being attacked in Afghanistan. ""We have credible evidence of individuals being murdered, others have been chased out of their homes,"" the former defence attachÃ© to Kabul told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. About 2,000 former interpreters are ""stuck"" in Afghanistan ""under continual daily threat"", he said. In Afghanistan, ""if you worked for any coalition countries including the British, your neighbours will know"", BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale added. Afghan interpreters' immigration fee waived Army interpreter fears death if deported Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK' Tory MP and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan, said the government had a ""duty of care"" for locally employed civilians. Mr Tugendhat told the BBC an interpreter he had served alongside ""earned his place in the UK many times over"". ""But there are others and that is why I gave evidence to the committee,"" he added. The cross-party report said the Intimidation Scheme's shortcomings were in contrast to another initiative, known as the Redundancy Scheme, which has seen 1,150 Afghans re-homed in Britain. It called for a more ""sympathetic approach"" to those who risked their lives to support British forces during their 13-year combat mission in Afghanistan, which ended in 2014. Tory MP Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence committee, said if the UK earns a reputation ""for leaving those people who put their lives at risk to help our soldiers, at the mercy of our enemies"",  it would be difficult to find local people prepared to help in future conflicts. Mohammed Hares, an Afghan interpreter for the British Army from 2009 to 2014 Mohammed Hares was relocated to the UK in 2016 and now chairs the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters When you leave home in the morning, you don't know whether you are going to come back home alive. And that is not just the interpreters themselves, but also the families. They can't tell anybody even nowadays that they were interpreters. If people find out even now, they will just kill them. They will kill their families, they will kill them, they will torture them, they will put the videos on social media as a lesson for everybody else. I think when we were working with the British Army in Afghanistan, we helped them to achieve their aims. We helped them in the worst situations. We saved their lives. Now it is their duty to do their job and to help those people who are still in Afghanistan. The Redundancy Scheme is open to Afghan civilians who had been working in front-line roles for at least 12 months when the UK began to reduce its troop presence in late 2012. The committee noted that despite previous criticism of its criteria, that scheme had been ""generous and proportionate"". While the Intimidation Scheme was ""in theory"" open to all civilians working for the British, the report found that it had focused ""overwhelmingly"" on ways of keeping them in Afghanistan, through internal relocation or the offer of security advice, and that resettlement to the UK was seen as a last resort. The report also criticised the Afghan government, which was involved in creating the schemes, saying its claim that relocation might lead to a ""brain drain"" was ""disingenuous"". ""It is impossible to reconcile the generosity of the Redundancy Scheme with the utter failure of the Intimidation Scheme to relocate even a single locally employed citizen to the United Kingdom,"" it concluded. Campaigners welcomed the report and urged the government to reconsider its approach. ""Many of our brother interpreters found themselves in significant danger after the British campaign in Helmand,"" said a spokesman for the Sulha Network - which represents Afghan interpreters. ""The eligibility criteria for the resettlement scheme was arbitrary and narrow and the intimidation scheme has only served to give false hope to those who fear for their safety."" The Ministry of Defence said it would take note of the criticism. ""Our intimidation policy is designed to ensure that former Afghan local staff are safe to live their lives in the country and we provide tailored security advice and support to individuals,"" a spokesman said. Earlier this month, it was announced that Afghan interpreters who were relocated to Britain wouldnot have to paythe Home Office to stay. More than 150 translators given a five-year visa to seek sanctuary in Britain wrote to new Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to highlight their concerns. The interpreters who worked on the battlefield in Helmand Province had said they faced deportation if they could not find the Â£2,398 per person to apply for indefinite leave to remain once their visas expired.

"The Australian owner of Homebase has sold the DIY chain for Â£1, ending its disastrous foray into the UK. Wesfarmers paid Â£340m for the retailer two years ago, but losses and other costs will bring its total bill to about Â£1bn. The chain is being bought by restructuring specialist Hilco,which rescued music chain HMV in 2013. The 24 stores that had been converted to the Bunnings brand will revert to the Homebase name. Richard Lim, of consultancy Retail Economics, said the Wesfarmers takeover had been an ""unbelievable disaster"" due to ""woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and a misguided perception of the UK market"". He expected the restructuring would result in store closures and more job losses on the High Street. Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 workers. Dave Gill, national officer at shopworkers' trade union Usdaw, said: ""Staff in Homebase stores are extremely worried for the future after company's ownership changes hands yet again. ""Clearly the sale for just one pound is very disturbing. I am in touch with the company and we are seeking urgent meetings to secure jobs."" Yours for a pound: the companies sold on the cheap Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent This must go down as one of the most disastrous retail acquisitions ever - a textbook example of how not to do it. The Australian firm thought they could show the Brits how to do DIY. So confident, they immediately sacked Homebase's senior management team. That was a huge mistake. They then began to strip out the soft furnishings that were popular at Homebase. Instead, Bunnings opted for no frills DIY sheds. But it failed to understand the UK market and the losses soon started to mount. Deteriorating economic conditions certainly didn't help. The few stores that were trading as Bunnings will convert back to the Homebase brand as this company makes an ignominious retreat. The new owners will need to act fast to stem the losses across the Homebase business, which will inevitably mean store closures and job losses ahead. Wesfarmers has admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, such as underestimating winter demand for a range of items from heaters to cleaning and storage, and dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Rob Scott, chief executive of Wesfarmers, said the UK market proved to be ""very competitive"", with ""quite challenging"" retail conditions. Asked whether investors could trust Australia's biggest retail group with future acquisitions, he said he hoped the disposal ""demonstrates the capability of our team to act decisively"". Wesfarmers expects the disposal to cost up to Â£230m. It will be entitled to 20% of any future sale of the business. Homebase chief Damian McGloughlin, who will stay on as part of the management buyout funded by Hilco, ""marks an exciting new chapter"" for the retailer. ""With Hilco's support we have the commitment of an experienced partner, substantial additional capital, stability for the business and the opportunity to reinvigorate a brand that has been a mainstay of UK retail for over 40 years,"" he said. Hilco was given a ""Turnaround of the Decade"" award last year for its revival of HMV. Paul Gainford is a Bunnings fan By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The newly branded Bunnings store in Penge, south-east London, opened its doors with some fanfare in March - including an appearance by Peppa Pig. But now that Bunnings has failed to bring home the bacon for Wesfarmers, the store will become a Homebase once more. Shoppers at the store seem bemused. Carpenter Paul Gainford said: ""I'm a bit gutted that it is going back to Homebase. It has got everything here - things that you can't get elsewhere."" Other shoppers agreed that some ranges, such as tools and plants, had improved since the switchover. Ultimately, they were keen for the store to stay open in some form under the new ownership. ""There is not much choice around here so it is important that places like this remain,"" said Wayne Obee, who was buying plants and compost for his garden. Retired banker Neil Rank, 60, was concerned about the impact on workers: ""There seems to be more staff here now it is a Bunnings. But whenever costs are cut, it is staff costs that they look at first.""

"Young Britons could be at risk of modern slavery if they work as touts outside the bars of Majorca, the Foreign Office has warned. An undercover investigation commissioned by the department found that many of the workers had their passports seized by employers, were charged high rents and paid low wages. It discovered 20 of the 25 Britons in prison on the island were former touts. The Border Force is carrying out a week-long campaign to raise awareness. Touts - also known as PRs - are employed to encourage customers to come into their bars with drinks deals and to ensure they stay. The investigation was conducted by criminologists, who also found women were subject to sexual abuse from customers and men were attacked or bullied when working to bring people into clubs. Lloyd Milen, the British Consul for Barcelona and the Balaeric Islands, said: ""We wanted to understand what factors were at play, and then how we could prevent it. ""We commissioned some independent research, which showed us that many PR workers ended up in serious debt, many were working illegally, some had their passports retained and others faced repeated sexual harassment and assault."" The research also revealed that some of the touts took up drug dealing to make ends meet, whilst others began to have problems with alcohol. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: ""By highlighting the issue we want to ensure that those contemplating PR work in Majorca, many of whom are tourists tempted by the idea of an extended stay in the sunshine, do not find their summer turning into a nightmare."" The touts or PR workers are employed to get people into bars and clubs with drinks offers The modern day slavery charity, Unseen, will be visiting airports and targeting flights to the island with leaflets to ensure young people heading out there are cautious. Justine Currell, one of the charity's directors, said: ""It can be really hard to tell the scale of the problem as the people doing the jobs can seem quite happy. ""But they can be stuck in situations where they are not allowed to leave, they don't have their passports and are forced to pay extortionate amounts of rent. ""We just want them to know that they have somewhere to turn - they can call our confidential helpline and there is help available."" Fashion vlogger Jasmine Clough is releasing a video to warn her 200,000 followers to be careful if they choose to work abroad. ""It is something I have considered doing, and I have a friend working in Magaluf at the moment who said it is really long hours and a lot of hard work,"" she said. ""She hasn't had any bad experiences yet, but she is lucky. ""You think it will be loads of fun but the reality can be very different - I just want to warn people about the risks."" The Foreign Office advises that anyone who is overseas and has had their passport taken should first report it to the police. British nationals should then contact the local British Consulate for help and advice and to get a replacement.

""We wish him and his mother all the love in the world,"" frontman James Dean Bradfield told the crowd in Belfast. The band's guitar technician Richard stood in, ably delivering hits like Motorcycle Emptiness and You Love Us. The only major difference was that he didn't share Wire's penchant for cross-dressing.

"Emotions have been running high during the campaign Counting has started in the Irish abortion referendum, hours after exit polls suggested a landslide vote in favour of liberalising the law. Polls by The Irish Times and RTÃ suggested about 69% voted to repeal a part of the constitution that effectively bans terminations. One of the main anti-abortion campaigns has already conceded defeat. ""The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state,"" said John McGuirk, from Save the 8th. Live coverage: Referendum results Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Counting began at 09:00 local time and the result is expected by the evening. Those taking part in Friday's referendum were asked whether they wanted to repeal or retain a part of the constitution known as the Eighth Amendment, which says an unborn child has the same right to life as a pregnant woman. Mr McGuirk, communications director of the anti-abortion Save The 8th campaign, conceded defeat and said No campaigners were ""deeply broken-hearted"". ""Shortly, legislation will be introduced that will allow babies to be killed in our country,"" his statement said. The Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983 However, he vowed that No campaigners would continue to protest, ""if and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland"". ""Every time an unborn child has his or her life ended in Ireland, we will oppose that, and make our voices known,"" he added. Earlier, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, who supported the reforms, said it looked as if the country was about to ""make history"". Broadcaster RTÃ's exit poll suggested 69.4% in favour of the Yes side and 30.6% for No.  In Dublin, 79% of people voted for repeal, according to the RTÃ poll. An exit poll released by The Irish Times points to 68% Yes to 32% for No. Tweeting on Friday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: ""Thank you to everyone who voted today. Democracy in action.,externalIt's looking like we will make history tomorrow... "" In other reaction: Irish health minister Simon Harris tweeted: ""Will sleep tonight in the hope of waking up to a country that is more compassionate, more caring and more respectful"" Prominent No campaigner Cora Sherlock expressed disappointment at the exit polls but said the pro-life movement would ""rise to any challenge it faces"". She added: ""Let's go into tomorrow with this in mind"" Penny Mordaunt, the UK's minister for women and equalities, called it a ""historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland"".  Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK The leader of Northern Ireland's centrist Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said it appeared to be an ""incredible result"" for the Yes campaign Currently, abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. This video can not be played ""Legislation will go as quickly as possible"" The turnout looks to have been higher than that for the country's referendum on same-sex marriage and its most recent general election. More than 3.2 million people were registered to vote in the referendum, withmore than 100,000 new voters registering ahead of the poll. The referendum was the result of a decades-long debate about abortion in the Republic of Ireland and was the country's sixth vote on the issue. The now-controversial Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983. It ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"" - meaning the life of the woman and the unborn are seen as equal. Since 2013, terminations have only been allowed in Ireland when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. Young and old have been turning out at count centres The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up to advise the Irish government on constitutional change, voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitution which strictly limits the availability of abortion. So the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper was: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies."" This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum The ballot paper did not mention the Eighth Amendment or abortion, instead asking: ""Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?"" Those who wanted to retain the Eighth Amendment voted No, while those who wanted to replace it voted Yes. If a majority has voted yes - as appears to be the case - then the Irish government's recommendation is that women will be able to access a termination within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion referendum explained. Video, 00:01:35Abortion referendum explained Timeline: Ireland and abortion What is the law?

"Ireland has voted decisively in a referendum to reform the country's strict abortion laws, which had effectively banned all terminations. It was Ireland's sixth referendum on the issue, and the country's younger voters led it in a two-thirds landslide in favour of ending the ban. Here we look back at how one of the most controversial legal issues in Irish history unfolded over more than a century-and-a-half. 1861 -The law Abortion is first banned in Ireland in 1861 by theOffences Against the Person Act,,externaland stays in place after Irish independence. Opponents of repealing the amendment say the mother and the unborn have an equal right to life 1983 -Areferendum The Eighth Amendment to the Republic's constitution, or Article 40.3.3, is introduced after a referendum. It ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"". It meansthe life of the woman and the unborn are seen as equal.,external 1992 -The X case, and another referendum A 14-year-old suicidal rape victim is initially prevented by the courts from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy.  It is a controversy that will become known as the X Case. The ruling prompts demonstrations by both anti-abortion and pro-choice campaigners across Ireland, in New York and London. However, the ruling is later overturned by Ireland's Supreme Court. It says the credible threat of suicide is grounds for an abortion in Ireland. No government since then has enacted legislation to give medical practitioners legal certainty as to when terminations can be carried out. In November that year, as a result of the X case and the judgement in the Supreme Court appeal, the government put forward three possible amendments to the constitution. A woman holds 'repeal the Eighth' badges up in front of her eyes at a pro-choice rally They are enumerated as the twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments. Two of them are passed. The Thirteenth Amendment said the abortion ban would not limit freedom of travel from Ireland to other countries for a legal abortion. The Fourteenth Amendment said Irish citizens had the freedom to learn about abortion services in other countries. However, the Twelfth Amendment is rejected. It had proposed that the possibility of suicide was not a sufficient threat to justify an abortion. 2002  -A referendumon suicide Another referendum is held and the people of Ireland are asked if the threat of suicide as a ground for legal abortion should be removed. It is again rejected (this time marginally) by voters. 2010 -European Court of Human Rightsruling After three women take a case against Ireland, the European Court of Human Rightsrules the state has failed to provideclarity on the legal availability of abortion in circumstances where the mother's life is at risk. 2012 -The Savita Halappanavarcase A campaign to liberalise abortion gathers momentum, after Indian woman Savita Halappanavardies in a Galway hospital after she is refused an abortion during a miscarriage. Her husband, Praveen Halappanavar, says she repeatedly asked for a termination but was refused because there was a foetal heartbeat. A vigil for Savita Halappanavar, who died in 2012 after being denied an abortion When asked if he thought his wife would still be alive if the termination had been allowed, Mr Halappanavar told the BBC: ""Of course, no doubt about it."" Following her death, about 2,000 protesters assemble outside the Irish parliament in Dublin to call for the Irish government to urgently reform the Republic's abortion laws. Candle-lit vigils are held around the country. 2013 -A new law to protect women Abortion legislation is again amended to allow terminations under certain conditions - the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act is signed into law. Itlegalises abortion when doctors deem that a woman's life is at riskdue to medical complications, or at risk of taking her life. It also introduces a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for having or assisting in an unlawful abortion. This law gives effect to the 1992 Supreme Court ruling that abortion is permitted where the mother's life, as opposed to her health, is at risk. Anti-abortion groups argue that two sets of human rights are at stake 2015 -The UN calls for another referendum The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommends a referendum on abortion, saying it is concerned at Ireland's ""highly restrictive legislation"" and calls for a referendum to repeal Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution. It says it's ""particularly concerned at the criminalization of abortion, including in the cases of rape and incest and of risk to the health of a pregnant woman; the lack of legal and procedural clarity on what constitutes a real substantive risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the pregnant woman; and the discriminatory impact on women who cannot afford to obtain an abortion abroad or access to the necessary information"". The committee calls for a revision of the 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and urges the adoption of guidelines to clarify what constitutes ""a real substantive risk"" to a woman's life. Tens of thousands rallied in Dublin in September for constitutional change 2016 -TheUnited Nations weighs inon human rights The United Nations Human Rights Committee says thatIreland's ban on abortion subjected a woman carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality to discrimination and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.,external It calls for the strict prohibition to be reversed, including reforming the right to life of the unborn in the constitution if necessary, to allow women to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy safely. The case involves a woman called Amanda Mellet who had to travel abroad for an abortion. The UN committee says the hospital where she was treated did not provide any options regarding the foetus's remains and she had to leave them behind. Three weeks later, the ashes are unexpectedly delivered to her by courier. Ms Mellet files a complaint with the UN over her experiences. Anti-abortion campaigners say the unborn should have rights to life She is later awarded compensation by the Irish government - thought to be the first time this had happened. The move is hailed as ""highly significant"" by pro-choice campaigners. Meanwhile, the terms of reference are outlined for a Citizens' Assembly to begin examining the Eighth amendment. This isa public body set up to advise the Irish government on a number of ethical and political,externaldilemmas facing the Irish people. 2017 -ACitizens' Assembly makes recommendations The Citizens' Assemblyvotes to recommend the introduction of unrestricted access to abortion. It votes 64% to 36% in favour of having no restrictions in early pregnancy. Recent years have seen demonstrations both for and against repealing the Eighth Amendment The chairperson, Justice Mary Laffoy, said: ""The members voted that they wanted to remove Article 40.3.3 from the constitution, and for the avoidance of doubt, to replace it with a provision in the constitution, which would make it clear that termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn, and any rights of the pregnant woman are matters for the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament). ""In other words, it would be solely a matter for the Oireachtas to decide how to legislate on these issues."" However, anti-abortion campaigners dismiss the results of the ballots as a ""muddled and confused farce"". An Oireachtas committee in 2017 also recommends substantial reform of the law. The committee's chair, Senator Catherine Noone, concludes that ""we need some change"" and in order to effect that the constitution needed to be amended to remove Article 40.3.3. The Irish government says it will hold a referendum in 2018 onwhether to change the abortion laws. 2018 -A historic vote for choice In March, Irish Housing Minister Eoghan Murphysigns an order to set the date for an abortion referendum. The wording is then finalised, giving the go-ahead for voters to have their say on the issue. On 25 May, voters go to the polls, where the ballot asks if they wish to approve the 36th Amendment to Ireland's constitution - a bill which would repeal the Eighth Amendment, the ban on abortion. Turnout is 64.51%, and the result is just short of two-thirds in favour of ending the country's ban on abortion: 66.4% yes to 33.6% no. The Yes vote allows the government in Dublin to introduce legislation allowing abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and between 12 and 24 weeks in exceptional circumstances. ""What we have seen today really is a culmination of a quiet revolution that's been taking place in Ireland for the past 10 or 20 years,"" says Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.

"Francesca Cuff and Ben Alford had money stolen from their joint bank account with TSB A TSB customer has described how he watched thousands of pounds in wedding savings being stolen from his internet account as he waited on hold for the bank's fraud department. Ben Alford from Weymouth in Dorset said it took more than four and a half hours to get through to TSB, by which time most of the money had gone. He is one of many affected by fraud who have struggled to contact the bank. TSB says it has put in ""additional resources"" to support customers. Ben called TSB after he noticed a Â£9,000 loan with another company had been taken out in his name without his knowledge. The money had been paid into the TSB joint bank account he shares with his girlfriend, Francesca Cuff. Ben said a Â£1,000 overdraft had also been set up without their permission. He says he was logged into internet banking, and waiting for someone at TSB to answer his telephone call, when he noticed that money had begun to be stolen. ""There was initially Â£5,000 taken out of that account followed by another amount of Â£4,000, he told BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme. ""Had they answered their fraud line promptly, none of this money would have been taken because it could have been stopped. I literally watched the money go out of our account"". Complaints over TSB's missing fraud alerts How it all went so wrong for TSB Among the money stolen was more than Â£7,000 the couple had put aside for their wedding. ""I just felt helpless. It was like being robbed in broad daylight"", said Ben. A spokesperson for TSB said it was ""really sorry"" about what happened to Ben and Francesca and ""the distress and inconvenience this caused them"". ""While our systems are safe and secure unfortunately fraudsters are increasingly sophisticated and looking to take advantage of situations like these. ""If customers have been a victim of fraud as a direct result of our recent IT issues they won't be left out of pocket,"" the spokesperson added. Ben Alford and Francesca Cuff pictured in Barbados shortly after they got engaged Ben is adamant that he has not handed over sensitive information by responding to any dubious texts, emails or telephone calls. Instead it seems the criminals already knew enough about him to raid his bank account, and they even had control of his mobile phone number. Ben says someone had called his mobile phone network pretending to be him. They had closed his account and got his mobile number transferred onto their own phone. It meant they would receive any text messages sent by TSB containing the passcodes needed to authorise changes to Ben's bank account. The migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current Spanish owner Sabadell created major difficulties for the bank. Criminals have taken advantage of the confusion, specifically targeting TSB customers with ""phishing"" emails and texts designed to con them into handing over personal details, passwords and passcodes. Many people have reported long waits to get through to TSB's fraud team and have complained about the bank's failure to get back to them after they have finally managed to report a fraud. The UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre Action Fraud says the number of ""phishing"" reports it has received about TSB have risen from 30 in April to just over 320 since the start of May. That is an increase of 970%, and those are just the ones reported to the police. TSB has declined to say exactly how many of its customers have actually had money taken since its troubled move onto a new computer system. In Ben Alford's case, the bank has refunded some of the money, but without telling him and it took almost a week to do so. The regulator the Financial Conduct Authority requires banks to refund unauthorised transactions by the end of the business day following the day it becomes aware of a problem. Ben says he is still due more money back and, to date, no one from TSB has been in touch with him or his girlfriend. ""TSB have not given us any information whatsoever. All they have done is log it. From my point of view their customer service is leaving a lot to be desired"".

"The recall notice is in relation to glass bottles of AG Barr drinks, including Irn Bru Soft drinks maker AG Barr is recalling 750ml glass bottles due to concerns the caps may pop off unexpectedly and could cause injury. The company said 11 of its fizzy drinks products - including Irn Bru, cola, and lemonade - were affected. It said it has taken steps to remove the products from the market. Customers who have bought the bottles were urged to open them at arm's length to release the pressure then return them to the shop or contact AG Barr. The firm blamed a ""manufacturing fault"" for the issue and said it had taken the decision to recall 750ml glass bottles on a precautionary basis because there had been a small number of reports that the bottle caps pop off unexpectedly. The products affected are: Irn Bru Irn Bru sugar free Inr Bru Xtra Cola Cream Soda Ginger Beer Lemonade Limeade Pineapple Red Kola Soda Water They have a use by date up to and including May 2019.

"Police have begun a murder investigation A 95-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a female carer died in north London. The victim, 61, was taken to hospital with head injuries at 07:10 BST on 24 May. She died the following day. A murder investigation has been launched by the Metropolitan Police following the incident in Holloway. The man, who is believed to suffer from dementia, was taken to hospital pending a ""transfer to a location where his complex needs can be managed"". Detectives say the woman's next-of-kin have been informed, and they are not looking for anyone else in connection with their investigation. The woman who died was an employee of a care agency commissioned by Islington Council. Two ambulance crews arrived at his first-floor flat in Islington, north London, on Thursday morning after a neighbour heard a scream at around 04:00 BST. Colleagues said they were left ""devastated"" after the woman, 61, died in hospital on Friday morning. Max Wurr, senior spokesman for the woman's employer, said: ""We were devastated that a member of our care team in Islington has died in hospital after paramedics were called to the home of one of our customers overnight.""

"Emotions have been running high during the campaign Counting has started in the Irish abortion referendum, hours after exit polls suggested a landslide vote in favour of liberalising the law. Polls by The Irish Times and RTÃ suggested about 69% voted to repeal a part of the constitution that effectively bans terminations. One of the main anti-abortion campaigns has already conceded defeat. ""The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state,"" said John McGuirk, from Save the 8th. Live coverage: Referendum results Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Counting began at 09:00 local time and the result is expected by the evening. Those taking part in Friday's referendum were asked whether they wanted to repeal or retain a part of the constitution known as the Eighth Amendment, which says an unborn child has the same right to life as a pregnant woman. Mr McGuirk, communications director of the anti-abortion Save The 8th campaign, conceded defeat and said No campaigners were ""deeply broken-hearted"". ""Shortly, legislation will be introduced that will allow babies to be killed in our country,"" his statement said. The Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983 However, he vowed that No campaigners would continue to protest, ""if and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland"". ""Every time an unborn child has his or her life ended in Ireland, we will oppose that, and make our voices known,"" he added. Earlier, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, who supported the reforms, said it looked as if the country was about to ""make history"". Broadcaster RTÃ's exit poll suggested 69.4% in favour of the Yes side and 30.6% for No.  In Dublin, 79% of people voted for repeal, according to the RTÃ poll. An exit poll released by The Irish Times points to 68% Yes to 32% for No. Tweeting on Friday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: ""Thank you to everyone who voted today. Democracy in action.,externalIt's looking like we will make history tomorrow... "" In other reaction: Irish health minister Simon Harris tweeted: ""Will sleep tonight in the hope of waking up to a country that is more compassionate, more caring and more respectful"" Prominent No campaigner Cora Sherlock expressed disappointment at the exit polls but said the pro-life movement would ""rise to any challenge it faces"". She added: ""Let's go into tomorrow with this in mind"" Penny Mordaunt, the UK's minister for women and equalities, called it a ""historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland"".  Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK The leader of Northern Ireland's centrist Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said it appeared to be an ""incredible result"" for the Yes campaign Currently, abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. This video can not be played ""Legislation will go as quickly as possible"" The turnout looks to have been higher than that for the country's referendum on same-sex marriage and its most recent general election. More than 3.2 million people were registered to vote in the referendum, withmore than 100,000 new voters registering ahead of the poll. The referendum was the result of a decades-long debate about abortion in the Republic of Ireland and was the country's sixth vote on the issue. The now-controversial Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983. It ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"" - meaning the life of the woman and the unborn are seen as equal. Since 2013, terminations have only been allowed in Ireland when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. Young and old have been turning out at count centres The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up to advise the Irish government on constitutional change, voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitution which strictly limits the availability of abortion. So the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper was: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies."" This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum The ballot paper did not mention the Eighth Amendment or abortion, instead asking: ""Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?"" Those who wanted to retain the Eighth Amendment voted No, while those who wanted to replace it voted Yes. If a majority has voted yes - as appears to be the case - then the Irish government's recommendation is that women will be able to access a termination within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion referendum explained. Video, 00:01:35Abortion referendum explained Timeline: Ireland and abortion What is the law?

"The Australian owner of Homebase has sold the DIY chain for Â£1, ending its disastrous foray into the UK. Wesfarmers paid Â£340m for the retailer two years ago, but losses and other costs will bring its total bill to about Â£1bn. The chain is being bought by restructuring specialist Hilco,which rescued music chain HMV in 2013. The 24 stores that had been converted to the Bunnings brand will revert to the Homebase name. Richard Lim, of consultancy Retail Economics, said the Wesfarmers takeover had been an ""unbelievable disaster"" due to ""woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and a misguided perception of the UK market"". He expected the restructuring would result in store closures and more job losses on the High Street. Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 workers. Dave Gill, national officer at shopworkers' trade union Usdaw, said: ""Staff in Homebase stores are extremely worried for the future after company's ownership changes hands yet again. ""Clearly the sale for just one pound is very disturbing. I am in touch with the company and we are seeking urgent meetings to secure jobs."" Yours for a pound: the companies sold on the cheap Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent This must go down as one of the most disastrous retail acquisitions ever - a textbook example of how not to do it. The Australian firm thought they could show the Brits how to do DIY. So confident, they immediately sacked Homebase's senior management team. That was a huge mistake. They then began to strip out the soft furnishings that were popular at Homebase. Instead, Bunnings opted for no frills DIY sheds. But it failed to understand the UK market and the losses soon started to mount. Deteriorating economic conditions certainly didn't help. The few stores that were trading as Bunnings will convert back to the Homebase brand as this company makes an ignominious retreat. The new owners will need to act fast to stem the losses across the Homebase business, which will inevitably mean store closures and job losses ahead. Wesfarmers has admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, such as underestimating winter demand for a range of items from heaters to cleaning and storage, and dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Rob Scott, chief executive of Wesfarmers, said the UK market proved to be ""very competitive"", with ""quite challenging"" retail conditions. Asked whether investors could trust Australia's biggest retail group with future acquisitions, he said he hoped the disposal ""demonstrates the capability of our team to act decisively"". Wesfarmers expects the disposal to cost up to Â£230m. It will be entitled to 20% of any future sale of the business. Homebase chief Damian McGloughlin, who will stay on as part of the management buyout funded by Hilco, ""marks an exciting new chapter"" for the retailer. ""With Hilco's support we have the commitment of an experienced partner, substantial additional capital, stability for the business and the opportunity to reinvigorate a brand that has been a mainstay of UK retail for over 40 years,"" he said. Hilco was given a ""Turnaround of the Decade"" award last year for its revival of HMV. Paul Gainford is a Bunnings fan By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The newly branded Bunnings store in Penge, south-east London, opened its doors with some fanfare in March - including an appearance by Peppa Pig. But now that Bunnings has failed to bring home the bacon for Wesfarmers, the store will become a Homebase once more. Shoppers at the store seem bemused. Carpenter Paul Gainford said: ""I'm a bit gutted that it is going back to Homebase. It has got everything here - things that you can't get elsewhere."" Other shoppers agreed that some ranges, such as tools and plants, had improved since the switchover. Ultimately, they were keen for the store to stay open in some form under the new ownership. ""There is not much choice around here so it is important that places like this remain,"" said Wayne Obee, who was buying plants and compost for his garden. Retired banker Neil Rank, 60, was concerned about the impact on workers: ""There seems to be more staff here now it is a Bunnings. But whenever costs are cut, it is staff costs that they look at first.""

"Young Britons could be at risk of modern slavery if they work as touts outside the bars of Majorca, the Foreign Office has warned. An undercover investigation commissioned by the department found that many of the workers had their passports seized by employers, were charged high rents and paid low wages. It discovered 20 of the 25 Britons in prison on the island were former touts. The Border Force is carrying out a week-long campaign to raise awareness. Touts - also known as PRs - are employed to encourage customers to come into their bars with drinks deals and to ensure they stay. The investigation was conducted by criminologists, who also found women were subject to sexual abuse from customers and men were attacked or bullied when working to bring people into clubs. Lloyd Milen, the British Consul for Barcelona and the Balaeric Islands, said: ""We wanted to understand what factors were at play, and then how we could prevent it. ""We commissioned some independent research, which showed us that many PR workers ended up in serious debt, many were working illegally, some had their passports retained and others faced repeated sexual harassment and assault."" The research also revealed that some of the touts took up drug dealing to make ends meet, whilst others began to have problems with alcohol.

"This video can not be played Jim Booth described how Joseph Isaacs attacked him A man who attacked a 96-year-old D-Day veteran with a claw hammer has been found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 20 years. Joseph Isaacs, 40, of no fixed address, shouted ""money, money, money"" as he repeatedly hit Jim Booth. Mr Booth spent nine days in hospital after the raid at his home in Taunton. He said later he should have known how to deal with the assault, because he had been in the special services, but was now too old. Isaacs had previously admitted aggravated burglary, causing grievous bodily harm and seven counts of fraud. He will spend 16 years in custody and four on licence, the judge ruled. During sentencing, Judge David Ticehurst said Mr Booth was an ""extraordinarily remarkable gentleman"" whom Isaacs ""savagely attacked with a claw hammer which you took with you for that purpose"". He said: ""It was a brutal and utterly senseless attack on him."" Judge Ticehurst also said Isaacs met the criteria for the extended sentence as he showed an ""apparent lack of remorse or concern"" for attacking Mr Booth for a ""paltry"" amount of money. The court heard Isaacs, formerly from Exeter, went to Mr Booth's home on 22 November intending to obtain money as he had not eaten for days and was ""starving"". He initially offered to carry out repairs to the roof, but when he was turned down he repeatedly hit the 96-year-old with a hammer and left him for dead. This video can not be played Joseph Isaacs denied carrying out the attack when he was arrested Isaacs used Mr Booth's bank card to buy food at a McDonald's fast-food restaurant in Bridgwater after the attack. The court heard Mr Booth was hit six times on the head, as well as on the arms with the claw side of the tool. Between each blow Isaacs shouted ""money, money, money"". Mr Booth suffered a number of skull fractures, bleeds to the brain, deep wounds to both his arms and a fracture to his right hand. Speaking after he had recovered, he said he was told one of his arm injuries showed he had hit back at his attacker. ""I'm saying I blame myself because I was special services and I think I really should have known how to deal with this, but I didn't. ""I was too old, obviously,"" said Mr Booth. In a statement released after the sentencing, the veteran's family said: ""On 22 November last year, a light was shone on the very best and worst of humankind, when our father was subjected to a brutal and cowardly attack inside his home. ""Miraculously, though left for dead, and against all odds, he survived. ""In the very difficult six months since, our father has shown extraordinary courage and determination as he's battled with the pain and long-term effects of the injuries. ""He is truly inspirational."" Det Ch Insp James Riccio, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""It was a cowardly act and it's a miracle Mr Booth survived these horrific injuries."" Joseph Isaacs used Mr Booth's bank card to buy food a few hours after the attack Mr Booth, who joined the Royal Navy at 18, took part in one of the most secret operations of the D-Day invasion in Normandy in 1944, andtalked about it in a 2013 BBC documentary. He was part of a team of submariners who submerged close to Sword Beach. On the day of the landings he and his colleagues left their craft in a fold-up canoe to shine beacons to guide the Allied landing craft safely to shore.

"Emotions have been running high during the campaign Counting has started in the Irish abortion referendum, hours after exit polls suggested a landslide vote in favour of liberalising the law. Polls by The Irish Times and RTÃ suggested about 69% voted to repeal a part of the constitution that effectively bans terminations. One of the main anti-abortion campaigns has already conceded defeat. ""The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state,"" said John McGuirk, from Save the 8th. Live coverage: Referendum results Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Counting began at 09:00 local time and the result is expected by the evening. Those taking part in Friday's referendum were asked whether they wanted to repeal or retain a part of the constitution known as the Eighth Amendment, which says an unborn child has the same right to life as a pregnant woman. Mr McGuirk, communications director of the anti-abortion Save The 8th campaign, conceded defeat and said No campaigners were ""deeply broken-hearted"". ""Shortly, legislation will be introduced that will allow babies to be killed in our country,"" his statement said. The Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983 However, he vowed that No campaigners would continue to protest, ""if and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland"". ""Every time an unborn child has his or her life ended in Ireland, we will oppose that, and make our voices known,"" he added. Earlier, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, who supported the reforms, said it looked as if the country was about to ""make history"". Broadcaster RTÃ's exit poll suggested 69.4% in favour of the Yes side and 30.6% for No.  In Dublin, 79% of people voted for repeal, according to the RTÃ poll. An exit poll released by The Irish Times points to 68% Yes to 32% for No. Tweeting on Friday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: ""Thank you to everyone who voted today. Democracy in action.,externalIt's looking like we will make history tomorrow... "" In other reaction: Irish health minister Simon Harris tweeted: ""Will sleep tonight in the hope of waking up to a country that is more compassionate, more caring and more respectful"" Prominent No campaigner Cora Sherlock expressed disappointment at the exit polls but said the pro-life movement would ""rise to any challenge it faces"". She added: ""Let's go into tomorrow with this in mind"" Penny Mordaunt, the UK's minister for women and equalities, called it a ""historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland"".  Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK The leader of Northern Ireland's centrist Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said it appeared to be an ""incredible result"" for the Yes campaign Currently, abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. This video can not be played ""Legislation will go as quickly as possible"" The turnout looks to have been higher than that for the country's referendum on same-sex marriage and its most recent general election. More than 3.2 million people were registered to vote in the referendum, withmore than 100,000 new voters registering ahead of the poll. The referendum was the result of a decades-long debate about abortion in the Republic of Ireland and was the country's sixth vote on the issue. The now-controversial Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983. It ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"" - meaning the life of the woman and the unborn are seen as equal. Since 2013, terminations have only been allowed in Ireland when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. Young and old have been turning out at count centres The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up to advise the Irish government on constitutional change, voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitution which strictly limits the availability of abortion. So the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper was: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies."" This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum The ballot paper did not mention the Eighth Amendment or abortion, instead asking: ""Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?"" Those who wanted to retain the Eighth Amendment voted No, while those who wanted to replace it voted Yes. If a majority has voted yes - as appears to be the case - then the Irish government's recommendation is that women will be able to access a termination within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion referendum explained. Video, 00:01:35Abortion referendum explained Timeline: Ireland and abortion What is the law?

"Francesca Cuff and Ben Alford had money stolen from their joint bank account with TSB A TSB customer has described how he watched thousands of pounds in wedding savings being stolen from his internet account as he waited on hold for the bank's fraud department. Ben Alford from Weymouth in Dorset said it took more than four and a half hours to get through to TSB, by which time most of the money had gone. He is one of many affected by fraud who have struggled to contact the bank. TSB says it has put in ""additional resources"" to support customers. Ben called TSB after he noticed a Â£9,000 loan with another company had been taken out in his name without his knowledge. The money had been paid into the TSB joint bank account he shares with his girlfriend, Francesca Cuff. Ben said a Â£1,000 overdraft had also been set up without their permission. He says he was logged into internet banking, and waiting for someone at TSB to answer his telephone call, when he noticed that money had begun to be stolen. ""There was initially Â£5,000 taken out of that account followed by another amount of Â£4,000, he told BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme. ""Had they answered their fraud line promptly, none of this money would have been taken because it could have been stopped. I literally watched the money go out of our account"". Complaints over TSB's missing fraud alerts How it all went so wrong for TSB Among the money stolen was more than Â£7,000 the couple had put aside for their wedding. ""I just felt helpless. It was like being robbed in broad daylight"", said Ben. A spokesperson for TSB said it was ""really sorry"" about what happened to Ben and Francesca and ""the distress and inconvenience this caused them"". ""While our systems are safe and secure unfortunately fraudsters are increasingly sophisticated and looking to take advantage of situations like these. ""If customers have been a victim of fraud as a direct result of our recent IT issues they won't be left out of pocket,"" the spokesperson added. Ben Alford and Francesca Cuff pictured in Barbados shortly after they got engaged Ben is adamant that he has not handed over sensitive information by responding to any dubious texts, emails or telephone calls. Instead it seems the criminals already knew enough about him to raid his bank account, and they even had control of his mobile phone number. Ben says someone had called his mobile phone network pretending to be him. They had closed his account and got his mobile number transferred onto their own phone. It meant they would receive any text messages sent by TSB containing the passcodes needed to authorise changes to Ben's bank account. The migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current Spanish owner Sabadell created major difficulties for the bank. Criminals have taken advantage of the confusion, specifically targeting TSB customers with ""phishing"" emails and texts designed to con them into handing over personal details, passwords and passcodes. Many people have reported long waits to get through to TSB's fraud team and have complained about the bank's failure to get back to them after they have finally managed to report a fraud. The UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre Action Fraud says the number of ""phishing"" reports it has received about TSB have risen from 30 in April to just over 320 since the start of May. That is an increase of 970%, and those are just the ones reported to the police. TSB has declined to say exactly how many of its customers have actually had money taken since its troubled move onto a new computer system. In Ben Alford's case, the bank has refunded some of the money, but without telling him and it took almost a week to do so. The regulator the Financial Conduct Authority requires banks to refund unauthorised transactions by the end of the business day following the day it becomes aware of a problem. Ben says he is still due more money back and, to date, no one from TSB has been in touch with him or his girlfriend. ""TSB have not given us any information whatsoever. All they have done is log it. From my point of view their customer service is leaving a lot to be desired"".

"The boy was taken to hospital but died later A 15-year-old boy has been stabbed to death in Sheffield, the second fatal stabbing in the city in a week. The boy was attacked in Lowedges Road, in the Lowedges district, at about 19:50 BST on Thursday. He died about an hour later in hospital. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested and is in custody on suspicion of murder, said South Yorkshire Police. The force said it had been granted special stop and search powers to tackle knife crime. More stories from Yorkshire The measures will be in place from 19:00 until 06:00 on Saturday in the Lowedges and Manor areas of the city, police said. A spokesman said there would be an option to extend it over the bank holiday weekend and would be reviewed daily. Under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, officers do not have to have reasonable suspicion about the individual being stopped and searched. Meanwhile, police have asked witnesses to contact them especially if they have any dashcam footage as the investigation, involving a ""vast"" number of officers continues. A number of roads have been closed The stabbing is not linked to the one two days earlier, when19-year-old Ryan Jowle in the Woodhouse area of the city, said police. In March,22-year-old Jarvin Blake was also killedin the Burngreave area. Ch Supt Stuart Barton said the latest stabbing might not be a random attack but contain ""a degree of targeting"". The force is considering additional powers of stop-and-search in parts of the city. ""We're looking at certain areas if necessary - we have to look at doing that,"" he said. Ch Supt Barton, the Sheffield commander, was asked on Wednesday about the level of knife crime in the city in recent months. ""It's a huge concern to the force. It's a huge concern nationally, not just in Sheffield. ""What I can say is that we continue to do what we can to work with people in schools, work within the city centre night-time operation. ""But the answers to knife crime lies with the people who carry those knives"", he said. The scene of the boy's death was marked with a white forensics tent on the side of the main A61 route from Sheffield to Chesterfield. One carriageway of the road is closed and the cordon is expected to remain in place until the early evening, said police.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish currency 'entirely credible' An independent Scotland would keep the pound for at least 10 years under proposalsset out by the SNP's Growth Commission,external. The country could potentially then move towards introducing its own currency if six economic tests were met. The commission wasset up two years agoto build a new economic case for independence following the Brexit vote. Opposition parties say the SNP's pursuit of independence is doing nothing for Scotland's economy. The 354-page analysis document - which has been billed as a ""new case for optimism"" - also says attracting more immigrants to Scotland is crucial. Reality Check: Could Scotland keep the pound? Brian Taylor on the significance of the report Our summary of the key points Its aim is to ""restart the debate"" on independence, with the long-awaited report being discussed by special assemblies of SNP members around the country in the run-up to the party's autumn conference. Andrew Wilson handed over the report to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon earlier this week But the commission also said many of the measures they were calling for could be implemented without independence. And its author, former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, stressed that independence was not a ""magic wand"", but would instead provide a ""toolbox"" that could help to grow the economy. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to set out her thinking on when there might be a second independence referendum in the autumn, once there is more clarity over Brexit. The Scottish government wanted a formal currency union with the rest of the UK if Scotland voted for independence in 2014 The commission says Scotland should keep sterling after independence, with the Bank of England continuing to set interest rates and other monetary policies. But crucially, it says this would be done without a formal currency union between Scotland and the rest of the UK. It also says that a ""future choice to establish a Scottish currency could be considered"" once the economy was ""on track to the sustainable high-performance position our ambitions require"". But the report says that ""unless those tests were met and a decision to change was made, our currency would remain the pound sterling"". Sarah Smith: Money talks when it comes to indyref2 Douglas Fraser: Rebooting Scottish independence Are we on course for indyref2? Mr Wilson told BBC Scotland that sticking with the pound, at least initially, would offer ""stability and certainty, and straight answers to hard questions for people about what happens to their pension or their mortgage"". He added: ""We think the government should be focused on getting the economy growing, setting up the new country, getting the public finances stable and in order from where we inherit them"" rather than on the ""symbol"" of a new currency. The SNP proposal ahead of the last independence referendum was for Scotland to continue using the pound through a formal currency union with the rest of the UK. But the arrangement was ruled out by then-Chancellor George Osborne in a move that was widely seen as being akey factor in Yes losing the vote. At the time, the Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Nicholas Macpherson""strongly"" advised Mr Osborneagainst agreeing to the currency union proposal, which he said would have been ""fraught with difficulty"". But the SNP argues that an independent Scotland would not need the permission of the UK government to continue using sterling. George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 independence referendum How does this get around the fact that if there were to be another independence referendum the UK government would almost certainly rule out, once again, a currency union? Because they are no longer proposing a formal pact, and the UK government cannot stop Scotland simply using the pound. But under those circumstances Scotland would have to accept monetary policy and interest rates set by the Bank of England without any concern for the economic circumstances in Scotland. That doesn't sound like true ""independence"" will come the cry - both from those who oppose independence and from some die hard supporters who would like to see Scotland go the whole hog and create its own currency as a symbol of its new found sovereignty. But the SNP think that's a price worth paying to answer one of the trickiest questions they faced repeatedly in 2014. Read more from Sarah Mr Wilson fears current UK immigration policy could be damaging to Scotland The report includes detailed plans to help fund continuing UK debt to promote ""respect and good order"" towards the rest of the United Kingdom. Historic debts would fall to the rest of the UK - but Scotland would contribute about Â£5bn a year to meet debt commitments and fund international aid. Mr Wilsonstudied 12 successful small countriesaround the world, with Denmark, Finland and New Zealand highlighted as examples to take lessons from. The report sets out details of a ""come to Scotland"" campaign to drive immigration and population growth This would include tax relief for highly skilled migrant workers to attract the ""best and brightest"" talent, measures to encourage international graduates to stay in Scotland, and a new visa system modelled on ""the most efficient and easy to use in the world"". Ruth Davidson questioned whether Scots would be willing to ""gamble their future"" on the proposals Mr Wilson warned of a ""real danger"" that current UK policies could see the working population fall, and said Scotland has a ""great opportunity to strike a completely different tone"". The report also includes policy ideas to grow the economy through greater participation in the labour market and improved productivity. But Mr Wilson said independence ""must never be seen as a magic wand or quick and easy step to success"" and that there was ""no pot of gold, black or otherwise, at the foot of the independence rainbow"". Instead, he said independence would offer a ""toolbox"" that could be used to ""create a stronger economy, sustainable public finances and a fairer society"". Read more about what's in the report here Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said the report ""rightly doesn't shy away from the challenges we face but presents ways in which those challenges can be addressed"". And she said she was ""looking forward to debating the report's recommendations - both within the SNP and with business, trade unions and communities across Scotland."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP plan to retain sterling would leave an independent Scotland using ""the currency of what would then be a foreign country without asking, without their own central bank and without any backstops"". She added that the plans for what would follow sterling were not clear, telling the BBC's World at One: ""I'm not entirely sure that is enough for the people of Scotland to want to gamble their mortgage on, their pensions on, their wages on and their future on."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the report was a ""cuts commission"" rather than a growth commission. He added: ""Proposals to cut Scotland's deficit by almost two thirds over a decade would result in a level of austerity that not even George Osborne attempted"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens said many of those who voted No in 2014 ""will no doubt be open to the case for independence, especially when this report is compared to the bleak, post-Brexit economic analysis papers"". But Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said there was ""nothing hopeful or optimist about inflicting yet more division and economic risk on our country by separating us from the UK"".

"This video can not be played Trump: 'North Korea meeting could still happen' US President Donald Trump has said his summit with North Korea's leader could still happen on 12 June, despite earlier cancelling the meeting. ""We'll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We're talking to them now. They very much want to do it, we'd like to do it,"" he told reporters. On Thursday, he blamed the North's ""open hostility"" for the cancellation of his talks with Kim Jong-un. North Korea later said it was willing to talk ""at any time in any form"". Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan said Mr Trump's cancellation decision was ""extremely regrettable"". This video can not be played Trump and Kim's on/off bromance The 12 June summit in Singapore would have been the first time a sitting US president had met a North Korean leader. The details of the now scrapped talks were unclear. But they would have focused on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. Just hours before Mr Trump cancelled the summit,North Korea said it had carried out its promise to dismantle tunnels at its only nuclear test site. 'My country was trying to test Trump' Decoding Trump's letter to Kim How did it all fall apart so soon? What just happened? Speaking to reporters outside the White House in Washington, the US president said: ""We gonna see what happens. We're talking to them [North Korea] now. It was a very nice statement they put out."" And Mr Trump added: ""Everybody plays games."" Shortly before this, Mr Trump welcomed North Korea's willingness to hold talks ""at any time"", describing it as ""warm and productive"".

Separately, US Defence Secretary James Mattis echoed Mr Trump's comments. ""We have got... possibly some good news on the Korea summit, where it may, if our diplomats can pull it off, may have it back on,"" he told reporters. It was personally addressed to Mr Kim. Mr Trump said he had been ""very much looking forward"" to meeting Mr Kim. ""Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have the long-planned meeting,"" Mr Trump said in a letter to Mr Kim. ""You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" he added. But he called the meeting a ""missed opportunity"", saying ""some day, I look very much forward to meeting you"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a separate statement at the White House, Mr Trump said the step was a ""tremendous setback for North Korea and the world"", adding the US military was ""ready if necessary"" to respond to any ""reckless"" act from North Korea. A senior administration official in the US later gave further details, saying North Korea had shown ""a profound lack of good faith"". There were a series of ""broken promises"" from Pyongyang, the official told reporters, including when the White House sent the deputy chief of staff to Singapore to meet North Korean diplomats ahead of the summit. He was apparently responding tostatements from a senior North Korean diplomat attacking his administrationand casting doubt over the meeting. Choe Son-hui had said the suggestions from US Vice-President Mike Pence that North Korea ""may end like Libya"" was ""stupid"". This video can not be played Pompeo - US was ready but North Korea had gone silent on preparations Ms Choe, who has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade, said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. What cancelled summit says about Trump foreign policy North Korea crisis in 300 words Kim Jong-un: The king of Pyongyang Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation A White House official quoted by Reuters news agency described the comments about Mr Pence as the ""last straw"". They stressed, however, there was a ""backdoor that's open still"". References to Libya have angered North Korea. There, former leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nascent nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. North Korea says that, unlike Libya, it is a fully fledged nuclear state. It is insistent it will not engage in any peace process that jeopardises its leadership or its survival as a state.

In April, the leaders of both Koreas had a historic meeting at the border,promising to end hostilities and work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the US and North Korea should not give up, saying ""nerves of steel"" were required. In the US, Republican Senator Tom Cotton praised President Trump for ""seeing through Kim Jong-un's fraud"".

"The boy was taken to hospital but died later A 15-year-old boy has been stabbed to death in Sheffield, the second fatal stabbing in the city in a week. The boy was attacked in Lowedges Road, in the Lowedges district, at about 19:50 BST on Thursday. He died about an hour later in hospital. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested and is in custody on suspicion of murder, said South Yorkshire Police. The force said it had been granted special stop and search powers to tackle knife crime. More stories from Yorkshire The measures will be in place from 19:00 until 06:00 on Saturday in the Lowedges and Manor areas of the city, police said. A spokesman said there would be an option to extend it over the bank holiday weekend and would be reviewed daily. Under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, officers do not have to have reasonable suspicion about the individual being stopped and searched. Meanwhile, police have asked witnesses to contact them especially if they have any dashcam footage as the investigation, involving a ""vast"" number of officers continues. A number of roads have been closed The stabbing is not linked to the one two days earlier, when19-year-old Ryan Jowle in the Woodhouse area of the city, said police. In March,22-year-old Jarvin Blake was also killedin the Burngreave area. Ch Supt Stuart Barton said the latest stabbing might not be a random attack but contain ""a degree of targeting"". The force is considering additional powers of stop-and-search in parts of the city. ""We're looking at certain areas if necessary - we have to look at doing that,"" he said. Ch Supt Barton, the Sheffield commander, was asked on Wednesday about the level of knife crime in the city in recent months. ""It's a huge concern to the force. It's a huge concern nationally, not just in Sheffield. ""What I can say is that we continue to do what we can to work with people in schools, work within the city centre night-time operation. ""But the answers to knife crime lies with the people who carry those knives"", he said. The scene of the boy's death was marked with a white forensics tent on the side of the main A61 route from Sheffield to Chesterfield. One carriageway of the road is closed and the cordon is expected to remain in place until the early evening, said police.

"Chloe Dutton (left) got her ticket as a 21st birthday present from mum Samantha Hundreds of fans turned up to the first stadium date of Ed Sheeran's UK tour on Thursday to discover their tickets were invalid and they had to buy new ones. On Tuesday,Sheeran's promoters saidthey had cancelled all tickets bought on Viagogo in a crack-down on touting. Many affected fans in Manchester were not aware and were told to buy new face-value tickets in order to get in, before seeking a refund from Viagogo. ""I was fuming,"" said Samantha Dutton from Stoke-on-Trent. ""I paid Â£400 for two tickets, now I've got to pay Â£150 to go and see him, and then I'll get my money back within five days, apparently. ""If you haven't got a spare Â£150 to pay for your tickets again, then you can't get in - and it's my girl's 21st birthday."" How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts The woman taking on Viagogo Ticket resellers 'misleading' consumers Affected fans had their tickets stamped and were advised to apply for refunds from Viagogo Sheeran's promoters have cancelled more than 10,000 tickets that were resold on Viagogo - often at vastly inflated prices - for 18 dates in the star's sold-out tour. Millie Nicholson, 18, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, supported Sheeran's attempts to tackle touting, but said this was ""definitely not"" the best way to go about it. ""To come all the way here to be pulled aside and be told your ticket's not valid, it's not good,"" she said. ""I paid Â£180 for mine and it's not on. And to be here to pay for another one - you're supposed to be here to have a good timeâ¦ But I do think it's the right thing to do, to crack down."" Yasmin Campbell (right): ""It's filled us with anxiety"" Yasmin Campbell, from Harrogate, found out on Facebook the day before that the tickets had been cancelled and agreed that it was ""definitely the right thing to do"". She said: ""At least we're going to get to see the concert and it's not a total sham, but it's just horrible. It's taken all the excitement out of the build-up of the event and instead it's filled us with anxiety, and I will never buy from Viagogo again. ""A lot of people aren't fortunate enough to be able to pay again. ""My brother and his partner have stayed at home today and they're just hoping to get the refund through the bank because they couldn't afford to put the payment down again and they weren't interested in going through all of this farce to be able to do that."" Ed Sheeran is playing four nights at Manchester's Etihad Stadium Stuart Galbraith, chief executive of the tour's promoters Kilimanjaro Live, said they were trying to make sure people paid no more than ""the price on the ticket that Ed wanted them to pay"". He said: ""Although it's inconvenient for customers, we are helping them achieve refunds on transactions where they've just been ripped off. ""We have people we're helping out today who have paid up to Â£4,000, which is just outrageous. ""Everyone we've dealt with today, and we've dealt with hundreds, we've given them advice about how to receive refunds against their fraudulently traded tickets and we've sold them face-value tickets. So we've achieved what Ed wanted us to."" Viagogo customers were met by representatives of the gig promoters He advised fans with tickets bought from Viagogo for other dates to arrange refunds and buy new face value tickets in advance. He said those affected should follow instructionson FanFairAlliance.org,external. He said: ""Our whole process has been to try to deal with as much of this as possible in advance. We don't want to inconvenience people queuing and to be honest we don't want to deal with this ourselves on the day. ""If people have got tickets they know they've bought on the secondary market and they've paid over the odds, go to FanFairAlliance.org."" Fans who only discover that their tickets are invalid on the day and can't immediately afford to buy new face value tickets will be given the chance to come back and buy tickets for a different date, he said. Asked for a response to this story, Viagogo directed the BBC to the FAQ section of its website, where it protests against concert promoters who deny entry to fans using resold tickets. ""These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal,"" it says.

"Police have asked for public help to find the men Canadian police have launched a huge manhunt for two suspects who set off a homemade bomb at a restaurant in a Toronto suburb. Peel Regional Police has asked for the public's help to identify the men behind the ""horrendous act"", which injured 15 people, three critically. Two suspects entered the Bombay Bhel restaurant in Mississauga and detonated the improvised bomb on Thursday night. The pair then fled the scene after the blast at 22:30 local time. ""There is no indication this is a terrorist act,"" Peel Regional Police Chief Jennifer said, ""no indication this is a hate crime."" Shattered glass at the Bombay Bhel restaurant But she noted investigators are not ruling out any particular motive at this early stage in the investigation. Police issued CCTV footage of the two suspects, describing them both as men around 5ft 10in tall with light or fair skin, and appealing for help identifying them. One man was described as ""stocky"" and in his mid-20s, while the other was of thin build. Both wore blue jeans and dark hoodies, and had covered their faces. India's High Commissioner to Canada Vikram Swarup tweeted on Friday morning that India's consul general in Toronto had visited the three critically injured Indian-Canadians in hospital.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish currency 'entirely credible' An independent Scotland would keep the pound for at least 10 years under proposalsset out by the SNP's Growth Commission,external. The country could potentially then move towards introducing its own currency if six economic tests were met. The commission wasset up two years agoto build a new economic case for independence following the Brexit vote. Opposition parties say the SNP's pursuit of independence is doing nothing for Scotland's economy. The 354-page analysis document - which has been billed as a ""new case for optimism"" - also says attracting more immigrants to Scotland is crucial. Reality Check: Could Scotland keep the pound? Brian Taylor on the significance of the report Our summary of the key points Its aim is to ""restart the debate"" on independence, with the long-awaited report being discussed by special assemblies of SNP members around the country in the run-up to the party's autumn conference. Andrew Wilson handed over the report to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon earlier this week But the commission also said many of the measures they were calling for could be implemented without independence. And its author, former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, stressed that independence was not a ""magic wand"", but would instead provide a ""toolbox"" that could help to grow the economy. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to set out her thinking on when there might be a second independence referendum in the autumn, once there is more clarity over Brexit. The Scottish government wanted a formal currency union with the rest of the UK if Scotland voted for independence in 2014 The commission says Scotland should keep sterling after independence, with the Bank of England continuing to set interest rates and other monetary policies. But crucially, it says this would be done without a formal currency union between Scotland and the rest of the UK. It also says that a ""future choice to establish a Scottish currency could be considered"" once the economy was ""on track to the sustainable high-performance position our ambitions require"". But the report says that ""unless those tests were met and a decision to change was made, our currency would remain the pound sterling"". Sarah Smith: Money talks when it comes to indyref2 Douglas Fraser: Rebooting Scottish independence Are we on course for indyref2? Mr Wilson told BBC Scotland that sticking with the pound, at least initially, would offer ""stability and certainty, and straight answers to hard questions for people about what happens to their pension or their mortgage"". He added: ""We think the government should be focused on getting the economy growing, setting up the new country, getting the public finances stable and in order from where we inherit them"" rather than on the ""symbol"" of a new currency. The SNP proposal ahead of the last independence referendum was for Scotland to continue using the pound through a formal currency union with the rest of the UK. But the arrangement was ruled out by then-Chancellor George Osborne in a move that was widely seen as being akey factor in Yes losing the vote. At the time, the Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Nicholas Macpherson""strongly"" advised Mr Osborneagainst agreeing to the currency union proposal, which he said would have been ""fraught with difficulty"". But the SNP argues that an independent Scotland would not need the permission of the UK government to continue using sterling. George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 independence referendum How does this get around the fact that if there were to be another independence referendum the UK government would almost certainly rule out, once again, a currency union? Because they are no longer proposing a formal pact, and the UK government cannot stop Scotland simply using the pound. But under those circumstances Scotland would have to accept monetary policy and interest rates set by the Bank of England without any concern for the economic circumstances in Scotland. That doesn't sound like true ""independence"" will come the cry - both from those who oppose independence and from some die hard supporters who would like to see Scotland go the whole hog and create its own currency as a symbol of its new found sovereignty. But the SNP think that's a price worth paying to answer one of the trickiest questions they faced repeatedly in 2014. Read more from Sarah Mr Wilson fears current UK immigration policy could be damaging to Scotland The report includes detailed plans to help fund continuing UK debt to promote ""respect and good order"" towards the rest of the United Kingdom. Historic debts would fall to the rest of the UK - but Scotland would contribute about Â£5bn a year to meet debt commitments and fund international aid. Mr Wilsonstudied 12 successful small countriesaround the world, with Denmark, Finland and New Zealand highlighted as examples to take lessons from. The report sets out details of a ""come to Scotland"" campaign to drive immigration and population growth This would include tax relief for highly skilled migrant workers to attract the ""best and brightest"" talent, measures to encourage international graduates to stay in Scotland, and a new visa system modelled on ""the most efficient and easy to use in the world"". Ruth Davidson questioned whether Scots would be willing to ""gamble their future"" on the proposals Mr Wilson warned of a ""real danger"" that current UK policies could see the working population fall, and said Scotland has a ""great opportunity to strike a completely different tone"". The report also includes policy ideas to grow the economy through greater participation in the labour market and improved productivity. But Mr Wilson said independence ""must never be seen as a magic wand or quick and easy step to success"" and that there was ""no pot of gold, black or otherwise, at the foot of the independence rainbow"". Instead, he said independence would offer a ""toolbox"" that could be used to ""create a stronger economy, sustainable public finances and a fairer society"". Read more about what's in the report here Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said the report ""rightly doesn't shy away from the challenges we face but presents ways in which those challenges can be addressed"". And she said she was ""looking forward to debating the report's recommendations - both within the SNP and with business, trade unions and communities across Scotland."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP plan to retain sterling would leave an independent Scotland using ""the currency of what would then be a foreign country without asking, without their own central bank and without any backstops"". She added that the plans for what would follow sterling were not clear, telling the BBC's World at One: ""I'm not entirely sure that is enough for the people of Scotland to want to gamble their mortgage on, their pensions on, their wages on and their future on."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the report was a ""cuts commission"" rather than a growth commission. He added: ""Proposals to cut Scotland's deficit by almost two thirds over a decade would result in a level of austerity that not even George Osborne attempted"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens said many of those who voted No in 2014 ""will no doubt be open to the case for independence, especially when this report is compared to the bleak, post-Brexit economic analysis papers"". But Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said there was ""nothing hopeful or optimist about inflicting yet more division and economic risk on our country by separating us from the UK"".

"This video can not be played Sara, 9, paid tribute to her cousin Mehdi El-Wahabi A nine-year-old girl has paid tribute to her young cousin who died in Grenfell Tower fire alongside four members of his family. Sara Chebiouni recalled playing with Mehdi El-Wahabi and read a poem written by one of his school friendsat the inquiry into the blaze,external. The family - Abdulaziz, 52, Faouzia, 41, Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 16, and Mehdi, eight, died in their 21st floor flat. Sara's father Hamed El-Wahabi wept as he recalled the ""heartbreaking"" events. There were also tributes to Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who was two weeks away from her 13th birthday, and to the five members of the Kedir family, who had been in their flat when the fire took hold on 14 June last year, causing 72 deaths. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 5 The poem for Mehdi described him as ""marvellously generous"", ""incredible"" and ""happy and helpful"". Sara, who also lived in Grenfell Tower, read out a tribute to Mehdi from his head teacher and recalled her time with the young daughters of theGomes family, his neighbours on the 21st-floor, who managed to escape the fire but whose baby Logan was stillborn shortly after. Wearing a grey sweatshirt top with Grenfell written on it, she added: ""I am looking forward to continuing playing with baby Logan's sisters again, but it is difficult knowing that Mehdi will never be able to play with us ever again."" Born in Morocco, Abdulaziz was a porter at University College London Hospital and a ""popular colleague known for being kind to his patients"", said his brother. Hamed said: ""After our father passed away, Aziz became the heart of our family, he took on a father figure; the supporter, the protector and the carer."" Faouzia El-Wahabi was remembered by her sister-in-law Hanan as a wonderful baker with a talent for sewing and a ""real presence in the community"". The El-Wahabi family lived on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower (clockwise from top left): Faouzia, Nur Huda, Mehdi, Abdulaziz, Yasin Remembering Huda, who was in the middle of GCSEs, her younger cousin Mariam told the inquiry: ""We all wanted to be like her."" Zak Chebiouni said football coach and accountancy student Yasin was an ""inspiration"" to others, adding that a ""piece of him will always live on through me"". Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Hashim Kedir, 44, died alongside his wife Nura Jemal, 35, daughter Firdows Hashim, 12, and sons Yahya Hashim, 13, and Yaqub Hashim, six, in the family's 22nd-floor flat . The Kedir family (clockwise from left): Hashim Kedir, Firdows Hashim, Yaqub Hashim, Yahya Hashim and Nura Jemal In a statement, Mr Kedir's sister Assema Kedir Habib revealed the health of her elderly father in Ethiopia deteriorated after he heard about the fire. He died 12 days later. Ms Habib remembered Yaqub's ""boundless energy"" and the kind-hearted Yahya. Firdaws was described as an ""intelligent, wise and eloquent"" girl with an ""amazing voice"". In a video played to the inquiry the broadcaster Jon Snow recalled awarding her a speech-writing prize. Nura Jemal ""could befriend absolutely anyone"", Ms Habid said, and Hashim was ""our dearest, smartest, soft-hearted and generous brother and uncle and my best friend"". She said Mr Kedir made earning money and helping the family his priority, working in construction and as a parking attendant, before becoming a black-cab driver. Ms Habib questioned why more was not done to save the family. She said she was not blaming the firefighters and was sure they did their best. But Ms Habib said her family were ""cremated unwillingly"" after being told to stay in their flat, adding: ""It felt like the attempt to save them, to save what was left of them, stopped too early."" ""Why didn't the UK as a government try to do more that night?"" she asked. ""Was it because the lives of the victims of Grenfell Tower didn't matter?"" Questions about the response to the fire were also raised by the family of a long-time resident of Grenfell Tower, who died after going into the burning block to wake up his daughter. Steve Power's former partner Claudia Davis urged the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick to ""do right"". His daughter Sherrie told the hearing that reports suggesting her father, 63, decided to stay in his 15th-floor flat because of his Staffordshire Bull Terriers were untrue. Father-of-five Mr Power, a keen fisherman and dance music DJ, had been advised to stay put by the authorities, Sherrie said. Steve Power's family say he was advised to stay in his flat Sitting alongside three of Mr Power's other children, she added: ""He needs justice, all the victims do, because as much as he loved that block he didn't deserved to die in it."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News All the commemorations have paid tribute to the best qualities of each person. But what makes a particularly powerful impression are the little personal details. Vincent Chiejina was the only person his sister Obi knew who could actually make crisps at home. Abdulaziz El-Wahabi always greeted people in the same way, ""hello guv'nor"" for men and ""hello darling"" for women. His wife Faouzia was a talented baker and seamstress. It is those details, as much as the kindness, infectious happiness and all-round magnificence of the deceased, that really reminds you that behind these many names were real, relatable people. It's also worth noting the extent to which the inquiry is trying to make this incredibly hard task as easy as possible for the bereaved. From counsellors around the room and calm-down breathing classes after each session, to breaking on time for afternoon prayers, the emphasis is still very much on those who lost so much. In a video, Jessica Urbano Ramirez's sister said it broke her heart that she will not be able to watch her ""grow up into a beautiful girl"". ""Not a day goes by where she doesn't cross my mind,"" Melanie Urbano Ramirez said. ""I will miss having a sister but she will always be in my heart."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez was two weeks away from her 13th birthday Jessica's family had not been in their 20th floor flat when the blaze broke out and had launched frantic search for their daughter in the following days. Her father Ramiro Urbano said: ""There are no words to describe the feelings of emptiness inside us all. ""Every day, every hour, and every minute we will lose concentration on whatever we are doing, whether it is a family gathering, or at work, or even alone at home, because she will be in our thoughts forever."" A shrine to Jessica and photographs of her on a trampoline and smiling next to birthday cakes was shown in the film. The inquiry also remembered the ""lovely, bubbly"" Ligaya Moore, 78, who liked dancing, visits to restaurants and shopping trips. Ligaya Moore was said to love visiting restaurants and shopping Her friend Nenita Bunggay said the Filipino pensioner, who had lived in the UK for 43 years and worked as a nanny, ""was so proud to live in Grenfell. ""She would always say every time we walked past: 'Nenita, that's my building, 21st floor. It's a big building and I love it so much, even though I'm alone there, I love seeing it every day'"". Vincent Chiejina, 60, who was found dead on the 17th floor, was a fan of the original Star Trek TV series, his sister Obi said in a video tribute on behalf of his family. Like Star Trek's Captain Kirk, Vincent ""prepared for a series of fleeting journeys and then suddenly without warning simply disappeared without trace from his planned destinations"", she said. Vincent had grown up in Nigeria before their family moved to the UK and he studied engineering at Sheffield University, but never became an engineer. Vincent Chiejina's family paid tribute to him for helping others Obi said in his later years her brother ""guided and gave directions to others. Let's celebrate and remember those who help others"". Khadija Khaloufi was remembered by her husband, Sabah Abdullah, as a person who always thought of helping her friends and neighbours. Khadija Khaloufi was remembered as a person who always thought of helping her friends and neighbours The couple lived on the 17th floor of Grenfell Tower and Mr Sabah said their children could not believe what happened, adding: ""I am not trying to make my wife an angel or something, but to them she was more than an angel.""

"Emotions have been running high during the campaign Counting has started in the Irish abortion referendum, hours after exit polls suggested a landslide vote in favour of liberalising the law. Polls by The Irish Times and RTÃ suggested about 69% voted to repeal a part of the constitution that effectively bans terminations. One of the main anti-abortion campaigns has already conceded defeat. ""The unborn child no longer has a right to life recognised by the Irish state,"" said John McGuirk, from Save the 8th. Live coverage: Referendum results Ireland's time of reckoning The people travelling #HomeToVote Timeline: Ireland and abortion Counting began at 09:00 local time and the result is expected by the evening. Those taking part in Friday's referendum were asked whether they wanted to repeal or retain a part of the constitution known as the Eighth Amendment, which says an unborn child has the same right to life as a pregnant woman. Mr McGuirk, communications director of the anti-abortion Save The 8th campaign, conceded defeat and said No campaigners were ""deeply broken-hearted"". ""Shortly, legislation will be introduced that will allow babies to be killed in our country,"" his statement said. The Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983 However, he vowed that No campaigners would continue to protest, ""if and when abortion clinics are opened in Ireland"". ""Every time an unborn child has his or her life ended in Ireland, we will oppose that, and make our voices known,"" he added. Earlier, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar, who supported the reforms, said it looked as if the country was about to ""make history"". Broadcaster RTÃ's exit poll suggested 69.4% in favour of the Yes side and 30.6% for No.  In Dublin, 79% of people voted for repeal, according to the RTÃ poll. An exit poll released by The Irish Times points to 68% Yes to 32% for No. Tweeting on Friday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: ""Thank you to everyone who voted today. Democracy in action.,externalIt's looking like we will make history tomorrow... "" In other reaction: Irish health minister Simon Harris tweeted: ""Will sleep tonight in the hope of waking up to a country that is more compassionate, more caring and more respectful"" Prominent No campaigner Cora Sherlock expressed disappointment at the exit polls but said the pro-life movement would ""rise to any challenge it faces"". She added: ""Let's go into tomorrow with this in mind"" Penny Mordaunt, the UK's minister for women and equalities, called it a ""historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland"".  Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK The leader of Northern Ireland's centrist Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said it appeared to be an ""incredible result"" for the Yes campaign Currently, abortion is only allowed when a woman's life is at risk, but not in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. This video can not be played ""Legislation will go as quickly as possible"" The turnout looks to have been higher than that for the country's referendum on same-sex marriage and its most recent general election. More than 3.2 million people were registered to vote in the referendum, withmore than 100,000 new voters registering ahead of the poll. The referendum was the result of a decades-long debate about abortion in the Republic of Ireland and was the country's sixth vote on the issue. The now-controversial Eighth Amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983. It ""acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right"" - meaning the life of the woman and the unborn are seen as equal. Since 2013, terminations have only been allowed in Ireland when the life of the mother is at risk, including from suicide. Young and old have been turning out at count centres The maximum penalty for accessing an illegal abortion is 14 years in prison. In 2017, the Citizens' Assembly, a body set up to advise the Irish government on constitutional change, voted to replace or amend the part of Ireland's Constitution which strictly limits the availability of abortion. So the Irish people were asked if they wanted to remove the Eighth Amendment and allow politicians to set the country's abortion laws in the future. The wording on the ballot paper was: ""Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancies."" This video can not be played The background and potential outcomes to the Republic of Ireland's abortion referendum The ballot paper did not mention the Eighth Amendment or abortion, instead asking: ""Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill?"" Those who wanted to retain the Eighth Amendment voted No, while those who wanted to replace it voted Yes. If a majority has voted yes - as appears to be the case - then the Irish government's recommendation is that women will be able to access a termination within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy. However, beyond 12 weeks, abortions would only be permitted where there is a risk to a woman's life or of serious harm to the physical or mental health of a woman, up until the 24th week of pregnancy. Terminations would also be permitted in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion referendum explained. Video, 00:01:35Abortion referendum explained Timeline: Ireland and abortion What is the law?

Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Hashim Kedir, 44, died alongside his wife Nura Jemal, 35, daughter Firdows Hashim, 12, and sons Yahya Hashim, 13, and Yaqub Hashim, six, in the family's 22nd-floor flat . The Kedir family (clockwise from left): Hashim Kedir, Firdows Hashim, Yaqub Hashim, Yahya Hashim and Nura Jemal In a statement, Mr Kedir's sister Assema Kedir Habib revealed the health of her elderly father in Ethiopia deteriorated after he heard about the fire. He died 12 days later. Ms Habib remembered Yaqub's ""boundless energy"" and the kind-hearted Yahya. Firdaws was described as an ""intelligent, wise and eloquent"" girl with an ""amazing voice"". In a video played to the inquiry the broadcaster Jon Snow recalled awarding her a speech-writing prize. Nura Jemal ""could befriend absolutely anyone"", Ms Habid said, and Hashim was ""our dearest, smartest, soft-hearted and generous brother and uncle and my best friend"". She said Mr Kedir made earning money and helping the family his priority, working in construction and as a parking attendant, before becoming a black-cab driver. Ms Habib questioned why more was not done to save the family. She said she was not blaming the firefighters and was sure they did their best. But Ms Habib said her family were ""cremated unwillingly"" after being told to stay in their flat, adding: ""It felt like the attempt to save them, to save what was left of them, stopped too early."" ""Why didn't the UK as a government try to do more that night?"" she asked. ""Was it because the lives of the victims of Grenfell Tower didn't matter?"" Questions about the response to the fire were also raised by the family of a long-time resident of Grenfell Tower, who died after going into the burning block to wake up his daughter. Steve Power's former partner Claudia Davis urged the inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick to ""do right"". His daughter Sherrie told the hearing that reports suggesting her father, 63, decided to stay in his 15th-floor flat because of his Staffordshire Bull Terriers were untrue. Father-of-five Mr Power, a keen fisherman and dance music DJ, had been advised to stay put by the authorities, Sherrie said. Steve Power's family say he was advised to stay in his flat Sitting alongside three of Mr Power's other children, she added: ""He needs justice, all the victims do, because as much as he loved that block he didn't deserved to die in it."" This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News All the commemorations have paid tribute to the best qualities of each person. But what makes a particularly powerful impression are the little personal details. Vincent Chiejina was the only person his sister Obi knew who could actually make crisps at home. Abdulaziz El-Wahabi always greeted people in the same way, ""hello guv'nor"" for men and ""hello darling"" for women. His wife Faouzia was a talented baker and seamstress. It is those details, as much as the kindness, infectious happiness and all-round magnificence of the deceased, that really reminds you that behind these many names were real, relatable people. It's also worth noting the extent to which the inquiry is trying to make this incredibly hard task as easy as possible for the bereaved. From counsellors around the room and calm-down breathing classes after each session, to breaking on time for afternoon prayers, the emphasis is still very much on those who lost so much. In a video, Jessica Urbano Ramirez's sister said it broke her heart that she will not be able to watch her ""grow up into a beautiful girl"". ""Not a day goes by where she doesn't cross my mind,"" Melanie Urbano Ramirez said. ""I will miss having a sister but she will always be in my heart."" Jessica Urbano Ramirez was two weeks away from her 13th birthday Jessica's family had not been in their 20th floor flat when the blaze broke out and had launched frantic search for their daughter in the following days. Her father Ramiro Urbano said: ""There are no words to describe the feelings of emptiness inside us all. ""Every day, every hour, and every minute we will lose concentration on whatever we are doing, whether it is a family gathering, or at work, or even alone at home, because she will be in our thoughts forever."" A shrine to Jessica and photographs of her on a trampoline and smiling next to birthday cakes was shown in the film. The inquiry also remembered the ""lovely, bubbly"" Ligaya Moore, 78, who liked dancing, visits to restaurants and shopping trips. Ligaya Moore was said to love visiting restaurants and shopping Her friend Nenita Bunggay said the Filipino pensioner, who had lived in the UK for 43 years and worked as a nanny, ""was so proud to live in Grenfell. ""She would always say every time we walked past: 'Nenita, that's my building, 21st floor. It's a big building and I love it so much, even though I'm alone there, I love seeing it every day'"". Vincent Chiejina, 60, who was found dead on the 17th floor, was a fan of the original Star Trek TV series, his sister Obi said in a video tribute on behalf of his family. Like Star Trek's Captain Kirk, Vincent ""prepared for a series of fleeting journeys and then suddenly without warning simply disappeared without trace from his planned destinations"", she said. Vincent had grown up in Nigeria before their family moved to the UK and he studied engineering at Sheffield University, but never became an engineer. Vincent Chiejina's family paid tribute to him for helping others Obi said in his later years her brother ""guided and gave directions to others. Let's celebrate and remember those who help others"". Khadija Khaloufi was remembered by her husband, Sabah Abdullah, as a person who always thought of helping her friends and neighbours. Khadija Khaloufi was remembered as a person who always thought of helping her friends and neighbours The couple lived on the 17th floor of Grenfell Tower and Mr Sabah said their children could not believe what happened, adding: ""I am not trying to make my wife an angel or something, but to them she was more than an angel."" ""I lost part of me"", he said in a film tribute.

"Four web giants are accused of breaking the law Complaints have been filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram and WhatsApp within hours of the new GDPR data protection law taking effect. The companies are accused of forcing users to consent to targeted advertising to use the services. Privacy groupnoyb.eu,externalled by activist Max Schrems said people were not being given a ""free choice"". If the complaints are upheld, the websites may be forced to change how they operate, and they could be fined. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new EU law that changes how personal data can be collected and used. Even companies based outside the EU must follow the new rules if offering their services in the EU. In its four complaints, noyb.eu argues that the named companies are in breach of GDPR because they have adopted a ""take it or leave it approach"". This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? The activist group says customers must agree to having their data collected, shared and used for targeted advertising, or delete their accounts. This, the organisation suggests, falls foul of the new rules because forcing people to accept wide-ranging data collection in exchange for using a service is prohibited under GDPR. ""The GDPR explicitly allows any data processing that is strictly necessary for the service - but using the data additionally for advertisement or to sell it on needs the users' free opt-in consent,"" said noyb.eu in a statement. ""GDPR is very pragmatic on this point: whatever is really necessary for an app is legal without consent, the rest needs a free 'yes' or 'no' option."" Privacy advocate Max Schrems said: ""Many users do not know yet that this annoying way of pushing people to consent is actually forbidden under GDPR in most cases."" Lawyer Max Schrems is a privacy advocate The complaints were filed by four EU citizens with local regulators in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany. Analysts and regulators had expected complaints to be filed shortly after the introduction of the law, as organisations and privacy advocates argue over how the law should be interpreted. Some companies based outside the EU have temporarily blocked their services across Europe to avoid falling foul of the new legislation. However, others such as Twitter have introduced granular controls that let people opt out of targeted advertising. Companies that fall foul of GDPR can be - in extreme cases - fined more than Â£17m. Facebook said in a statement that it had spent 18 months preparing to make sure it met the requirements of GDPR. Google told the BBC: ""We build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the EU General Data Protection Regulation.""

The summit would have been the first time a sitting US president had met a North Korean leader. The details of the meeting in Singapore on 12 June were unclear. But talks would have focused on ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula and reducing tensions. Just hours before Mr Trump's announcement cancelling the summit on Thursday,North Korea said it carried out its promise to dismantle tunnels at its only nuclear test site. This video can not be played Is North Korea's nuclear site destruction for real? Mr Trump's decision to scrap the summit wasin the form of a letter personally addressed to Mr Kim. A senior administration official in the US later gave further details, saying North Korea had shown ""a profound lack of good faith"".

"This video can not be played Harvey Weinstein made no comment as he walked into a police station in New York Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has turned himself in to police in New York, where he is expected to face sexual misconduct charges. The charges have not been announced but US media say some may relate to accusations by actress Lucia Evans. Dozens of women have made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, against the 66 year old. Mr Weinstein has always denied non-consensual sex and this would be the first time he has been charged. Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The allegations triggered the #MeToo movement which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Dozens of journalists were at the 1st Precinct police station in Manhattan when Mr Weinstein appeared at about 07:25 local time (11:25 GMT), dressed casually and carrying one book about director Elia Kazan and another about Rodgers and Hammerstein. The charges will stem from an investigation made by a Manhattan grand jury. They have not been made official and the indictment depends on district attorney Cyrus Vance. What is a US grand jury? The New York Times reports that some of the charges relate to an allegation brought by Lucia Evans,external. She detailed her accusations against Mr Weinsteinin an article in the New Yorker in October last year,external. It is not clear if he will face more charges brought by other accusers. Dozens of reporters and photographers covered a case that has worldwide interest It is known that New York police have been investigating allegations of rape made by actress Paz de la Huerta. And this monthNetflix producer Alexandra Canosa filed court papers in New Yorkalleging Mr Weinstein raped, sexually assaulted and verbally abused her over a five-year period. The statute of limitations will be an issue in some cases but it is not thought to apply in the Evans case. Even if the limitations apply, a judge could still call women to testify to establish a pattern of behaviour, as in therecent trial of actor Bill Cosby. Mr Weinstein is expected to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken at the police station. The Times said he would then be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court. The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out ActressAshley Judd is suing the 66-year-old Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. One of the cases was in New York, where Italian model Ambra Battilana accused Mr Weinstein of groping her in 2015. Investigators decided not to charge him even though there was an audiotape of Mr Weinstein accepting he had touched her breasts and pledging not to do so again. Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing several cases involving accusations against Weinstein after police investigations. London's Metropolitan police are also assessing a sexual abuse allegation against Mr Weinstein. The allegations have left his career in tatters. He was fired last year from his production firm the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. Top industry figures have condemned him and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him. Some of Mr Weinstein's accusers have spoken out to welcome the impending charges. Actress Rose McGowan wrote that some women had given up hope he would be held accountable. She said: ""Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice.""

"This video can not be played Liverpool fans in Kiev speak of the frustration of fans being stranded at home Liverpool fans have spoken of their anger after their flights to the Champions League final were cancelled. Operator Worldchoice Sports said it could not secure landing slots at Kiev's Boryspil Airport for three planes but it said it had secured an extra last-minute three-night trip. Disappointed supporters had paid up to Â£2,000 to get to Ukraine. Fan Chris Bolland said he was ""disgusted"" over the fiasco which means he now cannot get to the match. Liverpool play Real Madrid on Saturday in the Ukrainian capital in their first Champions League final in 11 years. The Merseyside club said up to 1,000 fans had been affected by the flight problems, and it had offered a full refund on tickets for fans whose flights had been cancelled. Chris Bolland said he watched his first game in 1966 when Liverpool beat Blackburn Rovers 4-1 Chris Bolland, who has supported Liverpool for 50 years, paid Â£2,000 to Worldchoice for a flight and ticket. But his flight has been cancelled and he will now have to watch the game at home on the TV. He told the BBC: ""I am gutted, to say the least. I am absolutely disgusted and there is nothing I can do about it. ""I will now have to watch it with my dear wife - but that's not a problem as she's a big Liverpool fan as well."" Ironically Mr Bolland had been in Poland, which shares a border with Ukraine, on a business trip and to came home to catch his flight. Liverpool fans' Kiev flights cancelled Liverpool fans tortuous journeys to Kiev Fans offered free rooms in Kiev The owner of Worldchoice Sports said he was ""devastated"" to have to cancel flights but vowed to keep trying to help stranded supporters. Shay Soni blamed the airport authorities in Ukraine for the mess and confirmed all fans will be fully refunded. ""The past 24 hours have been an absolute nightmare. It really has been a very difficult time,"" he said. ""The issue started last Friday when the slot co-ordinators at Kiev airport were unable to give us slots for our aircraft."" He said they had gone through ""almost every avenue"" without success until the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, stepped in and one flight was reinstated. Mr Soni said the company would keep working to get the remaining flights reinstated but added: ""I'm not very hopeful. ""I'm a Liverpool fan. I am really, really upset and sad... We have never had an issue like this before."" Liverpool fan Rob Andrews had his flight cancelled but has now secured one from Dublin Asif Badat, 32, from Leeds, is also stranded despite having match tickets. He said: ""We were being given assurances about our tickets and then suddenly the flights were cancelled. ""I'm now considering flying to Romania and driving 10 hours from there."" Rob Andrews had his Liverpool-Kiev flight cancelled but has now managed to secure a flight from Dublin. He will fly back to Dublin via Istanbul. He told the BBC: ""I don't even want to work out how much it's costing me. We got very little information from Worldchoice."" On Thursday, Mr Anderson said he had negotiated an agreement with Kiev mayor Vitali Klitschko - a former world heavyweight boxing champion - in a round of phone calls. In a series of tweets on Friday, Liverpool's mayor said he was chasing an ""urgent update"" from Worldchoice on ""why we have a shambles regarding fans flights, after the concessions made by airport yesterday. Will keep searching for solutions until none left"". He revealed he and Mayor Klitschko were exploring the possibility of another airport nearby being used. The Liverpool squad was greeted by fans at the team hotel The decision by Uefa - the governing body of European football - to stage its most prestigious club match in Kiev has been heavily criticised. Liverpool FC's head of club and supporter liaison Tony Barrett said: ""The decision to hold the final at a location which is so difficult and so extraordinarily expensive to get to is one that needs explaining by those who made it. ""To every Liverpool fan who is having a nightmare, and I use the word nightmare deliberately, arranging travel to Kiev I can only apologise. ""What should be one of the most exciting times of your lives is currently anything but and that, to me, is inexcusable."" Fans who have secured a means of making the final have complained of the complicated route they are having to take. Ivan Mulla, 46, from Liverpool, said: ""It's been a nightmare, I'm flying from Leeds to Rome then from Rome to Kiev. ""The return is from Kiev to Ankara and then Ankara to Antalya then Antalya to Leeds."" Liverpool FC said on its website: ""The decision to offer refunds has been made in response to the cancellation of two flights chartered by Widnes-based travel company World Choice Sport, leaving around 650 supporters without a flight to Kiev for the Champions League final.""

"The Oscars, the Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival. Until 2017 they were Tinsel Town's glitziest back-slapping forums. Now they're its favourite protest events. Of course it's down to #MeToo, the campaign against sexual harassment and abuse that swept through Hollywood last autumn and has since been Googled in every country on Earth. In its current form, the movement began with film executive Harvey Weinstein - or rather, with the dozens of women who accuse him of sexual harassment, abuse or rape.The New York Times printed the first allegations on 5 October,external, and the mogul was fired from his own company inside a week. Pandora's box was open. Harvey Weinstein denies engaging in non-consensual sex. On 15 October, actress Alyssa Milano suggested on Twitter that anyone who had been ""sexually harassed or assaulted"" should reply to her Tweet with ""Me Too"", to demonstrate the scale of the problem. Half a million people responded in the first 24 hours. A barrage of allegations has since emerged against high-profile men in entertainment, the media, politics, and tech. Many deny any wrongdoing. The repercussions are still in flux, but Hollywood's power dynamics have undoubtedly shifted. That's less obviously true in the world beyond, and begs the question: What's different for the millions of ordinary people who shared their own #MeToo stories? Are the currents of the movement visible in their lives too? How far has the rallying cry been converted into real-world change? One initiative has made solid progress (and spent solid millions) in a bid to make things better on the ground: the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. More than 300 actresses, writers and directorslaunched the project on 1 January,external, raising $21m (Â£15m) in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment, abuse or assault at work. The National Women's Law Center (NWLC) in Washington DC is fielding the considerable admin, matching applicants with lawyers who can offer them free advice. ""We have received more than 2,700 requests for assistance from every state in the United States, and there are more than 500 attorneys in the network who are ready to take on Time's Up cases,"" Sharyn Tejani, director of the fund at the NWLC, told the BBC. ""The fund prioritises cases involving low-wage workers, women in non-traditional jobs, people of colour, LGBTQ people, and people facing legal retaliation because they dared to speak out about sexual harassment,"" said Ms Tejani. Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Reported sex offences against men triple in 10 years Secret world: The women who cannot report sexual abuse Tina Tchen, who jointly leads the fund's legal aid efforts, said the beneficiaries include ""construction workers, prison guards [and] police officers,"" adding: ""There are men who have come forward too. There are some men who have experienced sexual harassment, and then there are some men who are calling, for example, on behalf of their wives or loved ones."" That's unlikely to raise surprise in some quarters. Sian Brooke of the Oxford Internet Institute, who studies gender and sexism online, says the fact that men are often victims of sexual violence was one of the most powerful takeaways from #MeToo. ""One group can be given attention and be taken seriously with regards to allegations of rape, without it taking any of the severity or weight away from another part of it,"" she notes. From October to December 2017, calls to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network - a US crisis hotline - rose by 23% compared with the same period in 2016. Some abuse survivors have cited #MeToo as a stressful influence, saying it resurfaced the pain of their abuse. Others have reported feeling less alone, saying it encouraged them to address past trauma by talking to loved ones, counsellors, or people with similar experiences. ""It's brought the idea of sexual harassment and assault into the public consciousness,"" Ms Brooke says. ""Even if the discussion around the movement is criticism, you are still bringing about an awareness that this happens."" 1in6 is a Los Angeles-based non-profit group that supports male sex abuse survivors. The group's development and communications director Meredith Alling told the BBC that #MeToo had a rapid, measurable impact on the number of men reaching out to them when the hashtag first went viral. ""We saw a 110% increase in web traffic and a 103% increase in the use of our online helpline service between September and October 2017, and the trend has continued,"" she said. In the US, employers are considering how best to create a positive workplace culture in the wake of #MeToo. Ted Bunch is a co-founder of A Call To Men, a social activism group that promotes healthy, respectful ways of ""being a man"", and says the group has noticed an increase in enquiries. ""Most notably, we have seen an increase in corporations seeking to understand why sexual harassment in the workplace is so pervasive,"" he says. Mr Bunch believes problems can arise because the workplace is a microcosm of society, in which men and boys are sometimes taught to view women as objects, and of less value than men. ""Most men are not abusive,"" he says, ""but nearly all men have laughed at a sexist joke or objectified a woman in some way. Once you connect the dots and show men how the jokes they see as harmless actually validate and fuel more harmful behaviour, they are quick to change."" Has the push to ditch bad work cultures spread beyond the US? One British human resources consultant said she had been surprised by the lack of #MeToo-inspired queries. ""We haven't seen any spikes in the volume of training requests, or the volume of training we're recommending. I don't think it's had a significant impact,"" said Elaine Howell, HR manager at PlusHR. ""We have clients in professional services, manufacturing clients, financial, marketing... It appears to be quite specific to that industry [entertainment]."" Teaching boys that 'real men' would stop rape How can businesses tackle sexual harassment? Speak to Equity, the 43,000-strong British actors' union, and it's clear they've had a different experience. The union won't give exact figures, but says it's witnessed a ""significant increase in enquiries and case work since #MeToo"". Vice president Maureen Beattie will take on Equity's presidency this summer, and she's keen to get the message out: toxic behaviour will not go unpunished. Or as she puts it, ""If you do something to one of our members which is wrong, unacceptable, we're going to come after you. And we will come after you big-time."" ""These people haven't gone away,"" she says. ""They are under a stone. They are lurking, just waiting for the time they think nobody's looking any more. ""One of the things we're doing is asking people who have been in the business for a long time, people who are stars, people who have clout, to keep an eye out. Not that they have to be trained up in how to help somebody who's been sexually harassed, but [they] can say - with impunity and no danger of never being worked with again - 'Excuse me? You can't behave like that with people'."" The #MeToo most of us know is still a new-ish creation. But it had a life before the viral hashtag. In 2006, black activist Tarana Burke founded the movement as an initiative to unite survivors of sexual violence. Since it morphed from a low-key project into a global byword, she has embraced #MeToo's A-List flag-bearers - but her focus is on lasting change at all levels of society. One of her most telling remarks came the week before she walked the red carpet at the 2017 Oscars: ""If we keep on 'making statements' and not really doing the work, we are going to be in trouble."" Sarah J Jackson, a professor of communication studies at Northeastern University, believes context is the key to anchoring Me Too. ""I wouldn't call hashtag 'Me Too' a movement at all,"" she says. ""I would call it a campaign that is part of a larger movement. So I would call women's rights the movement, and feminism the movement. And I would say #MeToo is one indication of the sort of conversations that need to happen. ""The next step is, OK so now we know the problem - how do we as a global community expand this conversation?"" Through its ""Me Too Rising"" project,Google has charted how awareness spread around the world,external. While data shows the term has been searched for in every corner of the planet, its resonance has inevitably been greater in some countries than others. The freedom of a nation's press and social media can certainly have impact on that - and it's too soon to tell how the movement will shape countries where it's gained traction more slowly - Japan and South Korea, for example. Karuna Nundy, a prominent lawyer in India's Supreme Court, shared her view on #MeToo's relevance to India, where outrage over sex crimes has sparked waves of public protests in recent years. ""The #MeToo conversations in India are limited to a swathe of English-speaking, internet-enabled people. It's quite a lot in absolute numbers, but small for India. It's added, though, to the huge conversations that were already happening. The idea that due process is failing women, and civil disobedience can be legitimate."" Ms Nundy, who helped draft India's tougher anti-rape law in 2013, says victims are now more likely to be believed. ""I had a rape case yesterday against a leading Bollywood producer. My client is a very young woman; we told the court that she was raped over a period of six months on pain of bodily harm. Regardless of what the court decides, I think the way we were heard by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the two judges is very different from the way we would have been heard, say, 15 years ago. Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment? Bollywood: The reality of sexual harassment ""There's an interplay between public consciousness, and the law and due process. And that's exactly what I think is happening."" Perhaps, then, #MeToo is not an endgame - but a clarion call to something bigger. A reminder for people to seek change in their communities, and push to make damaging systems better - especially for those who lack the power to fight alone.

"Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow are among dozens of women who have come forward with allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. He is currently facing five charges relating to two women in New York. He has previously admitted his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". His spokesperson has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down. Clockwise from top left: Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette and Lea Seydoux Here are some of those who have made allegations against him. The actress has accused Weinstein of raping her by performing oral sex in a hotel at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, when she was 23 and had just appeared in Scream. She later reached a $100,000 settlement with him - andsays he offered her$1m for a further non-disclosure deal to stay silent. She declined and has been one of his most vocal accusers. The Emmy-nominated former Sopranos actresshas allegedthat Weinstein forced himself into her apartment in New York in 1992 and raped her. ""I was so ashamed of what happened,"" Sciorratold the New Yorker,external. ""And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?"" The actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower. She refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career.Director Peter Jackson has come forward to say he removed her from a casting list ""as a direct result"" of what he now thinks was ""false information"" provided by Weinstein. In May 2018 Juddsued Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advancesbut a Los Angeles court later dismissed her sexual harassment suit. Her defamation claim may still proceed, the judge said. Mira Sorvino was photographed at a Weinstein Company party in January 2017 The Mighty Aphrodite star says he harassed her in a hotel room in 1995. ""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" she said. Like with Ashley Judd,Peter Jackson said Weinstein warned him off casting her. Hayek said Weinstein threatened to kill her The Frida actress saysshe turned down repeated sexual advances from Weinstein while making the 2002 film Frida. And she says his persuasion tactics included threats. Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" The Italian actress and director Asia Argento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage in a hotel room on the French Riviera, but he then raped her. Weinstein ""terrified me, and he was so big"", she said. ""It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare."" Lucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting. ""The type of control he exerted, it was very real,"" she told The New Yorker. ""Even just his presence was intimidating."" The Boardwalk Empire starhas accused Weinsteinof raping her twice in New York in 2010. The first time was after he offered her a ride home, and the second was when he turned up uninvited at her apartment. ""I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, 'I don't want to do this',"" she said. Gwyneth Paltrow with Harvey Weinstein in 2002 Paltrow says Weinstein asked her to give him a massage in his hotel suite after casting her in the leading role of 1996's Emma when she was 22. She refused. ""He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal,"" she said. She told then boyfriend Brad Pitt - who threatened to kill the producer if he did anything like that to Paltrow again. Former production worker Mimi Haleyi alleges that she was raped by Weinstein when he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 in his New York apartment. ""I told him 'no, no, no'. But he insisted,"" Ms Haleyi told a press conference in New York. The actress also alleges she was raped by Weinstein when he performed oral sex on her without her consent. She says he lured her to a hotel room in 2010 under the guise of helping her procure future TV and film roles. ""I didn't know how to say no to someone like him at the time, which I regret,"" she said. The Norwegian actress accuses Weinstein of raping herin a London hotel after the 2008 Bafta Awards ceremony. She also alleges that he then asked her to engage in a threesome with him and another woman when back in Los Angeles following the Baftas. British actress Lysette Anthony says he carried out a ""pathetic, revolting"" attack at her London home in the late 1980s, which left her ""disgusted and embarrassed"". Lysette Anthony toldThe Sunday Times,externalshe had reported an attack by Weinstein to the Metropolitan Police in London. In anInstagram post,external, Delevingne writes how uncomfortable she felt during an encounter with Weinstein in a hotel room and describes what allegedly happened when she told him she wanted to leave. ""He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,"" she says. The French actress has written about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink. ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,""she wrote in The Guardian,external. ""I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him."" Angelina Jolie with Gillian Anderson at the premiere of Playing by Heart in 1998 Jolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room in 1998. ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,"" she said. The Pulp Fiction actress saysWeinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s. ""He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman said. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" Harvey Weinstein and Heather Graham at a film party in 1999 The Boogie Nights actress toldVariety,externalshe was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies. She alleges he implied she had to sleep with him to get a film role, telling her that his wife would have been fine with it. This video can not be played Model Zoe Brock tells Radio 4's Today that she was one of Harvey Weinstein's victims The model and actress says he asked for a massage in the south of France in 1997. She said: ""I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow."" Before long, she ""bolted"" into the bathroom. He banged on the door with his fists before eventually retreating, putting on a dressing gown and starting to cry. Louisette Geiss holding a press conference on Tuesday The actress and producer says she was attacked by Weinstein when he invited her to his office in a hotel for a meeting about a script she had written at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. He insisted on listening to her pitch in his hot tub, then asked her to watch him masturbate, she says - and told her he could green-light her script if she did so. She left. The Splash actress saysshe repeatedly turned down Weinstein's advances during promotion for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried, she says, to get into her hotel room on multiple occasions, once getting a key and ""burst[ing] in like a raging bull."" He asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she alleges. She suffered physical repercussions as her flights were cancelled and she was left stranded after she turned him down on one occasion, she adds. The actress says she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. She told the New York Times,externalin the early 1990s she was directed to his hotel room, where he was in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage. When she refused she says he grabbed her hand and pulled it toward his crotch. ModelAmbra Battilana Gutierrezhas said she was groped by Weinstein and later went to New York police in 2015, saying the producer assaulted her. She then met Weinstein wearing a hidden microphone. But prosecutors took no action. Other stars to have detailed how he made advances in his home or hotel rooms includeBrit Marling,external,Lupita Nyong'O,external,Lena Headey,externalandKate Beckinsale,external. Other women who have come forward since then with their stories include French actressesFlorence Darel,external,Judith Godreche,externalandEmma de Caunes,external. British modelKadian Noble, US actressesJessica Barth,external,Katherine Kendall,externaland aspiring actressesDawn Denning,external, who is now a costume designer,Tomi-Ann Roberts,external, who is now a psychology professor, have also gone on the record.

And other workers at the Weinstein film companytold the New Yorker,externalabout their experiences, includingEmily Nestor, who was a temporary front desk assistant who said she had had to refuse his advances ""at least a dozen times"". ActressClaire Forlanihas said ""nothing happened"" between her and Weinstein - but only because she ""escaped five times"". In an interview with Canadian TV, actressLauren Hollysaid the producer approached her naked and requested a massage, at which point she ""pushed him and ran"". Zelda Perkins, a British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein,says she resignedafter a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement on 10 October in response to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault. ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,"" she said. ""Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.

"The ban would be enforced from next summer A ban on smoking in outdoor grounds of hospitals, schools and playgrounds in Wales has moved a step closer. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething has launched a consultation with the ban planned for summer 2019 and those who break it could face a fine. Voluntary bans are currently in place in some school and hospital grounds and also in public playgrounds. If the new law is passed, it will mean patients and visitors will have to leave hospital grounds to smoke. The consultation, which will help shape the final legislation, is also seeking views on plans to introduce additional changes to theexisting smoking ban, which did not include hospital grounds or playgrounds.,external These include: Placing an 18 month time limit on the permission to designate a room for smoking within mental health units. The time limit would allow managers to work towards the removal of indoor smoking facilities and designate outdoor areas instead. A similar time limit on the permission to designate a bedroom in hotels, guesthouses, inns, hostels and members' clubs. The changes will be introduced under the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017, which was passed by Assembly Members last year. Mr Gething launched the consultation at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire. The hospital has received complaints about people ignoring the current voluntary ban in place, so mothers visiting the maternity unit have to bring babies in and out past people who are smoking. No fines issued for smoking in cars with children Plan to ban smoking on popular tourist beaches Proposal to make smoking illegal in Austria scrapped The ban is part of moves to change the culture around smoking, by making it seen as unacceptable where children might be influenced or in places where good health is being promoted. Mr Gething said: ""We have seen significant changes to the attitudes to smoking since 2007. ""Back then we received some resistance to change, but we have seen a remarkable culture change and I am pleased our plan to extend smoke-free areas to outdoor public spaces has received overwhelming public support."" ""This is another step in the right direction to de-normalise smoking in Wales."" Around 18% of people in Wales are smokers, while around 11,720 will quit this year, it is estimated. This video can not be played Health boards 'powerless' to stop smoking outside hospitals But it could be 2025 at the current rate before a Welsh Government target of reducing smoking prevalence reaches 16%. Public health experts believe smoking still accounts for more than 5,000 deaths in Wales each year, around one in every six of all deaths in people aged 35 and over. Lyndsey Watson, communications officer for the British Lung Foundation in Wales said taking her 20-month-old son Thomas near to areas where people are smoking was a concern. ""I have an asthma cough, so pollution is high on my radar,"" she said. ""I really want the best start in life for Thomas, so I am really happy with this announcement."" But Simon Clark of smokers' group Forest said: ""Smoking outside poses no threat to public health, nor is there evidence that children start smoking because they witness complete strangers lighting up in public."" He also said threatening hospital patients, visitors and staff with fines was ""despicable"" when some of them may be at their most vulnerable.

"This video can not be played Harvey Weinstein made no comment as he walked into a police station in New York Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has turned himself in to police in New York, where he is expected to face sexual misconduct charges. The charges have not been announced but US media say some may relate to accusations by actress Lucia Evans. Dozens of women have made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, against the 66 year old. Mr Weinstein has always denied non-consensual sex and this would be the first time he has been charged. Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The allegations triggered the #MeToo movement which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Dozens of journalists were at the 1st Precinct police station in Manhattan when Mr Weinstein appeared at about 07:25 local time (11:25 GMT), dressed casually and carrying one book about director Elia Kazan and another about Rodgers and Hammerstein. The charges will stem from an investigation made by a Manhattan grand jury. They have not been made official and the indictment depends on district attorney Cyrus Vance. What is a US grand jury? The New York Times reports that some of the charges relate to an allegation brought by Lucia Evans,external. She detailed her accusations against Mr Weinsteinin an article in the New Yorker in October last year,external. It is not clear if he will face more charges brought by other accusers. Dozens of reporters and photographers covered a case that has worldwide interest It is known that New York police have been investigating allegations of rape made by actress Paz de la Huerta. And this monthNetflix producer Alexandra Canosa filed court papers in New Yorkalleging Mr Weinstein raped, sexually assaulted and verbally abused her over a five-year period. The statute of limitations will be an issue in some cases but it is not thought to apply in the Evans case. Even if the limitations apply, a judge could still call women to testify to establish a pattern of behaviour, as in therecent trial of actor Bill Cosby. Mr Weinstein is expected to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken at the police station. The Times said he would then be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court. The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out ActressAshley Judd is suing the 66-year-old Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. One of the cases was in New York, where Italian model Ambra Battilana accused Mr Weinstein of groping her in 2015. Investigators decided not to charge him even though there was an audiotape of Mr Weinstein accepting he had touched her breasts and pledging not to do so again. Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing several cases involving accusations against Weinstein after police investigations. London's Metropolitan police are also assessing a sexual abuse allegation against Mr Weinstein. The allegations have left his career in tatters. He was fired last year from his production firm the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. Top industry figures have condemned him and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him. Some of Mr Weinstein's accusers have spoken out to welcome the impending charges. Actress Rose McGowan wrote that some women had given up hope he would be held accountable. She said: ""Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice.""

The #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment and abuse swept through Hollywood last autumn. What has #MeToo actually changed? It followed an invitation from actress Alyssa Milano on Twitter for those who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to reply ""Me Too"". She received half a million responses in 24 hours. In January, more than 300 actresses, writers and directors launched the Time's Up project, raising $21m (Â£15m) in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment, abuse or assault at work.

"Why did the carefully planned summit collapse? President Donald Trump's shock announcement to cancel a planned summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un follows weeks of fiery language. Analyst Ankit Panda looks at what happened. In a letter released on Thursday morning, President Trump declared that the scheduled 12 June summit meeting in Singapore between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un - a meeting that would have been the first of its kind - would no longer take place. Trump justified his decision based on the ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" shown in a statement released by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency this week. Choe Son-hui, a vice minister at North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called US Vice President Mike Pence a ""political dummy"" for repeating remarks Trump made a week earlier, threatening to attack Kim Jong-un if he didn't submit to a deal on the United States' terms at the meeting. Trump pulls out of North Korea summit Analysing Trump's letter to Kim Jong-un What cancelled summit says about Trump foreign policy The story of the summit's collapse, however, ultimately began with Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, who had worked to raise expectations for what concessions the US should expect from North Korea to stratospheric levels. Mr Bolton had built a maximalist ""denuclearization"" objective, seeking a deal at the Singapore meeting that would see North Korea turn over all its weapons of mass destruction - not only its nuclear weapons, but also its chemical and biological weapons. This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man But Mr Bolton was probably never sincerely interested in seeing a diplomatic process with North Korea succeed. Weeks before becoming President Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, as a then-private citizen, said in the aftermath of the president's acceptance of Kim Jong-un's invitation to meet that the goal of the process would be to ""foreshorten the amount of time that we're going to waste in negotiations that will never produce the result we want"". Who is John Bolton? Five things Trump's new security chief believes His maximalist conception of what the United States should seek came to be known as the 'Libya model,' after the 2003 disarmament process that saw late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi deprived of his nascent nuclear program. North Korea has long dreaded any comparisons to Libya and has said as much in recent statements. Protesters toppled Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 Ms Choe's statement lashed out against the comparison to Libya, noting that North Korea was a full-fledged nuclear power, with intercontinental-range ballistic missiles and thermonuclear weapons to mount on them. Libya meanwhile was a fledgling nuclear pariah state that had ""simply installed a few items of equipment and fiddled around with them."" The moment the summit became doomed was when President Trump, speaking off the cuff, confused the 2003 ""Libya model"" of disarmament with the 2011 US-led intervention in Libya - a move that led directly to the demise of Muammar Gaddafi. This is what Kim Jong-un learned from Libya's experience: that agreeing to disarm at the behest of the United States will sooner or later lead to his end. The US has tens of thousands of troops in South Korea North Korea effectively saw Trump's comment as a threat. US Vice-President Mike Pence's decision to support Mr Trump's interpretation in a separate interview made it appear as if the president's off-the-cuff comment was a considered a US policy position - that should Kim come to Singapore and do anything other than submit to US demands, he would face US military action. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea The Trump administration has, by all accounts, failed to take what North Korea has said about its negotiating position seriously. Even before Ms Choe's statement - the one that, according to Mr Trump's own letter, brought down the summit - North Korea communicated its displeasure with the US over John Bolton's rhetoric and over plans by the US and South Korea to conduct an aerial military exercise involving nuclear-capable bombers, something Pyongyang has long viewed as threatening. (If the message wasn't clear,North Korean officials reportedly stood up their US counterparts,externalat a planning meeting in Singapore earlier this month.) The US has angered North Korea with aerial exercises over the peninsula before More seriously, a statement by the Trump administration that Washington paid no costs and made no concessions in the run-up to the cancellation of this summit is false. The president's decision to cancel the summit appears to have blindsided Seoul, stressing an important US alliance at a pivotal time. Secondly, the decision to cancel the summit just hours after North Korea apparently carried through with its decision to dismantle its nuclear testing site creates unfavourable international optics. Washington comes off as the recalcitrant party, willing to scuttle a promising diplomatic process over nothing more than a harshly worded statement from a North Korean Foreign Ministry official. A satellite image of the Punggye-ri site before it was reportedly destroyed Looking ahead, there's a real possibility that President Trump will choose to blame the North Koreans for duplicity - for pulling the rug out from under him and his chances of a Nobel Peace Prize. North Korea's negotiating position never changed; it didn't change after Mr Kim's two meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and it didn't change after the inter-Korean summit meeting on 27 April. What does Kim Jong-un want? Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies? President Trump's letter appears to leave open an avenue for Kim Jong-un to work with him to restore the summit. He ends with an invitation for the North Korean leader, whom he addressed collegially as ""His Excellency,"" to not hesitate to ""call me or write"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Kim won't be eager to take up the president on his offer. While North Korea had much to gain from the summit, it has probably become apparent for Pyongyang that should it choose to meet Donald Trump, it would have little idea of what to expect. That assumption would appear to be well-founded; the administration does not have a clear idea of what it seeks out of high-stakes diplomacy with North Korea.

The new charges include two counts of predatory sexual assault for allegedly forcing a woman into oral sex. Speaking outside the courthouse, lawyer Benjamin Brafman says: ""Mr Weinstein is not a predator; he is not a rapist and I believe that when this case is over we will ultimately see him be exonerated."" Weinstein seeks to dismiss the criminal case, citing dozens of ""warm"" emails they say Weinstein received from one of his accusers after an alleged rape. Other objections include a lack of detail on the timeline of an alleged assault in 2004, and the lack of advance warning from the District Attorney's office about the presentation of more serious charges. German actress Emma Loman sues Weinstein for alleged rape.Loman - understood to be a pseudonym - says Weinstein invited her to meet him in his hotel suite in Cannes in 2006 for a meeting about what was presumed to be upcoming film roles. Weinstein's lawyer says the claims are ""untrue"", adding they were seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed.

Weinstein is accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old Polish modelin New York and subjecting her to years of harassment and abuse, starting in 2002. The complaint by Jane Doe, as she is known in legal documents, is an update to a class action lawsuit against Weinstein, the Weinstein Company and Miramax. ActressAshley Judd's sexual harassment lawsuit is dismissedby a Los Angeles federal court, with the judge ruling the allegations did not fall within the scope of the statute she sued under. Her defamation claim - that Weinstein ""blackballed"" her after she refused his advances - would still be heard, the judge said. Oscar-winning actress Juliette Binochecalls for the public censure of Weinstein to end, saying ""justice has to do its work"", adding: ""I'm trying to put my feet in his shoes. He's had enough, I think."" Weinstein and his former studio's board members reach a tentative deal with women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, US media report.Lawyers saythe settlement to resolve civil lawsuits and compensate alleged victims is worth about $44m (Â£34.7m). Weinsteinpleads not guilty to two additional charges of predatory sexual assault. They relate to an alleged assault that took place in Manhattan in 1993 - too long ago to be prosecuted under New York state law. His trial - which had been due to start in September - is pushed back by four months to 6 January 2020. Weinstein's lawyer Donna Rotunno tells CBS,externalthe evidence will exonerate the movie mogul of any criminal wrongdoing. ""I'm not here to say he was not guilty of committing sins,"" she says. ""But there's a difference between sins and crimes, and I don't think he's a rapist."" Weinstein loses his bid to get his trial moved out of New York City. His lawyers say it is ""the least likely place on Earth"" where jurors can discharge their duty ""in an atmosphere free of intimidation from pressure to deliver a result that the politicians, the activists, the celebrities and the media demand"". Rose McGowan files a lawsuit against Weinstein, his ex-lawyers and a private intelligence agency, accusing them of trying to silence her. Former Harvey Weinstein assistants Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkinsgive their first joint interview to BBC Newsnight. Ms Chiu says Weinstein tried to rape her, and that she wore two pairs of tights for protection. ""It at times appeared to be a sort of game where I bought time, and my two pairs of tights bought time,"" she says. Weinstein's bail is increased from $1m (Â£760,000) to $5m (Â£3.8m) after prosecutors claim he mishandled or disabled his electronic ankle monitor dozens of times. His lawyer said the apparent violations were caused by technical problems. The producer attends court using a walking frame, with his lawyers saying he is due to have back surgery later in the week. A tentative settlement with accusers floated in May is said by lawyers to have been agreed by most parties.It would pay out $25m (Â£19m) to nearly 30 actresses and ex-employees. However, a number of plaintiffs and lawyers express anger at the terms. The deal has still to be signed off. Weinstein gives an interview to the New York Post,externalsaying he has overseen ""more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker"". He added: ""I pioneered it! It all got eviscerated because of what happened. My work has been forgotten."" In response,a statement from 23 female accuserssaid: ""Harvey Weinstein is trying to gaslight society again."" Former model Kaja Sokola accuses Weinstein of sexually assaulting her when she was 16. She was anonymous in an earlier class action legal case, but has removed herself from that group and gone public in order to file her own case, saying the above settlement is not ""fair or just"". When she initially came forward in 2018, Weinstein's then lawyer described the allegations as ""preposterous"". The trial process begins in New York, with a frail-looking Weinstein using a walking aid and accusers including Rose McGowan and Rosanna Arquette protesting outside the court. Meanwhile, LA County prosecutors charge Weinstein with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over a two-day period in 2013. Following jury selection, the trial begins in earnest in New York with graphic prosecution statements on his alleged crimes. Prosecutor Meghan Hast says he was a ""seasoned"" sexual predator, giving explicit details of allegations by three women, only two of whom are on the charge sheet. His defence team say his actions were consensual, including in one ""loving"" relationship. Former Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorra testifiesthat the film producer raped her at her home 25 years earlier, after having forced himself into her apartment and attacked her. Further testimony just over a week later isheard from one-time aspiring actress Jessica Mann, who details a catalogue of abuse by the Hollywood producer, saying he once trapped her in a hotel bedroom and raped her. Three of the five charges against Mr Weinstein relate to Ms Mann. In her closing arguments, Weinstein's lead attorney Donna Rotunno urges the 12 jurors to make themselves ""unpopular"" by acquitting him, insisting he had been innocent from the start. The prosecution's case rests on whether the jury believes the accusations of six women, although the jury is considering charges related to just two: ex-actress Jessica Mann and former production assistant Mimi Haleyi, as other claims are too old to prosecute. With all the evidence heard, the jury begins deliberations. Judge James Burke reminds them that to convict, they must be sure of the defendant's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt and must reach unanimous verdicts on each count. If they cannot, the judge may be forced to declare a mistrial. Judge Burke warns lead defence lawyer Donna Rotunno not to talk to the pressafter an opinion piece she wrote for Newsweek,externaldrew the ire of prosecutors. After five days of deliberation,the jury finds Weinstein guiltyof a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape. The 67-year-old is convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013. He is acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault, charges that could have seen him jailed for life. Though cleared of the most serious charges made against him, the producer still faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction. Weinstein issentenced to 23 years in prisonfor rape and sexual assault. The 67-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair. His lawyers had appealed for leniency, saying even the minimum sentence of five years could be a ""life sentence"" but prosecutors argued Weinstein should be given the maximum possible sentence, given his ""lifetime of abuse"" towards women and ""lack of remorse"" for his actions. Weinstein isaccused of sexual assault by four further womenas he serves a 23-year prison sentence. Court documents filed in New York on Thursday allege several sexual offences dating from 1984 to 2013. One of the four anonymous women was 17 at the time of an alleged attack. Weinstein's legal representative told BBC News: ""Mr Weinstein intends to defend against the claims filed anonymously against him yesterday."" Weinstein's lawyerslaunch an appeal against his conviction, arguing the judge made errors that denied his right to a fair trial. In a 166-page brief they raise seven examples of alleged errors and say the judge disregarded ""fundamental principles of New York law and violated Mr Weinstein's constitutional rights"". A New York judge ruled Weinsteincan be extradited to Californiato face additional sexual assault charges. Weinstein's defence team had argued that he should remain in New York to receive appropriate medical care. Weinsteinpleaded not guiltyto rape and sexual assault charges in a Los Angeles court. He appeared in court in a wheelchair after being extradited from New York, where he is serving a 23-year jail sentence for similar crimes. A New York appellate courtupheld Weinstein's rape conviction,external, rejecting his claims that the judge had prejudiced him by allowing women to testify about allegations that were not part of the criminal case. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised the Metropolitan Police tocharge Weinstein with two counts of indecent assaultagainst a woman in London in the summer of 1996. It came after a review of evidence gathered by the force. It is alleged two offences took place in London between 31 July and 31 August 1996. Weinstein goes on trial in LA, facing 11 charges involving five alleged victims. Weinstein isfound guilty by a Los Angeles jury of raping a woman. The two-month trial heard how Weinstein used his influence to lure women into private meetings before attacking them. The 70-year-old Oscar winner faces up to 24 years in prison when he is sentenced. Weinstein issentenced to 16 years in prisonfor the 2013 rape of an actress in Los Angeles. He begged for leniency in a Los Angeles court moments before he was sentenced, saying he did not ""deserve"" life in prison. The anonymous victim told the court before the sentencing about the trauma she had endured for ""many years"" since the assault. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"An elderly man weeps as he watches the symbolic April meeting between North and South Korea It's happened: US President Donald Trump has pulled out of a highly anticipated meeting with Kim Jong-un, citing North Korea's ""tremendous anger and open hostility"". The move may have shocked the world but as the BBC's Heather Chen and Minji Lee ofBBC News Koreanwrite, it's an even bigger setback for the people at the heart of it: North and South Koreans. Hwang Yeon was putting her seven-year-old son to bed on Thursday night when a barrage of notifications flooded her phone. ""I wondered what on Earth had happened and then I found out the bad news,"" she told BBC News by email from her home in the South Korean capital, Seoul. The mother of twin boys fled North Korea in 2006. We are not using her real name to protect her identity. A sinking feeling had come over her when she loaded up KakaoTalk, South Korea's most popular instant messaging app. ""The American leader says he no longer wants to meet with Kim Jong-un. All those peace talks were for nothing,"" she said, admitting that she had a quiet cry on the sofa afterwards. This video can not be played Trump: ""US military is ready if necessary"" Ms Hwang was among tens of thousands who watched history being made in April as Kim Jong-un crossed the border to meet President Moon Jae-in. Pyongyang says it remains willing to talk after Mr Trump cancelled,but chances of the summit happening at all now look minimal. ""I was born in North Korea and now live with a South Korean identity. Both these countries are my worlds and naturally, I want what's best,"" says Ms Hwang. ""It's been more than 10 years now but I still think about my life in the North and I long to see my friends and relatives who I left behind. ""You can't imagine rooting for peace for so long and then see it being taken away."" North Korea still ready to talk 'at any time' with Donald Trump Decoding Trump's letter to Kim Jong-un US-North Korea summit: How did it all fall apart so soon? Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation Many South Koreans hope for an end to the long-standing war On Naver, the country's largest internet portal, keywords relating to the ill-fated meeting continue to trend. ""I knew this would happen,"" wrote one angry user in criticism of Mr Trump. ""He never wanted our countries to reunify. He had other plans."" Another user said: ""No-one will now believe you, Trump. It's not only Korea, you've also broken promises with Iran. Can you even believe yourself?"" ""We've been waiting for peace for over 60 years,"" lamented another. ""But who knows? Maybe these two strong men leaders could soon reach a consensus."" This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea Casey Lartigue, co-founder of the Seoul-based organisationTeach North Korean Refugees,external(TNKR), said he had predicted the summit would be cancelled ""at least once"". ""I never expected things to go smoothly so I can't say that I'm the least bit surprised,"" he told the BBC, adding that there was a lot of disappointment from South Koreans. But he said many North Korean defectors he knows have remained pragmatic. ""The North Koreans here I know are unfazed. They've already seen and been through so much but they are hopeful."" Ken Eom, 37, served in the North Korean military for more than a decade. He now lives in Seoul. ""I'm not surprised or bothered. My country was trying to test Donald Trump but he is a different kind of leader, he's more a business man and he doesn't think about politics,"" he said. ""He probably sees it as a business deal and if it looks like it won't happen, he walks away from the table. North Korea may be unpredictable but Mr Trump is even more so I think this is all part of the negotiation process."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

In the middle of reading Mr Trump's letter to her elderly mother, North Korean Lee Sa-hee - also not her real name - came across a word that she did not understand. ""It was detriment. And when I looked it up, I was shocked [at the way things turned],"" she explained. While the young North Korean says she expected shock tactics from both leaders, the latest development has left her feeling incredibly disappointed. ""We can't give up on the idea of peace in Korea yet. I'm hoping that it could eventually lead to a better solution,"" she said. ""As a Korean, I feel sorry for both Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un. Kim is probably hurt now because he came out to speak to people in the world for the first time and got rejected. ""I do worry that Mr Trump has made things more dangerous for us in Korea and I just hope that no-one pushes the button.""

"The Oscars, the Golden Globes, Cannes Film Festival. Until 2017 they were Tinsel Town's glitziest back-slapping forums. Now they're its favourite protest events. Of course it's down to #MeToo, the campaign against sexual harassment and abuse that swept through Hollywood last autumn and has since been Googled in every country on Earth. In its current form, the movement began with film executive Harvey Weinstein - or rather, with the dozens of women who accuse him of sexual harassment, abuse or rape.The New York Times printed the first allegations on 5 October,external, and the mogul was fired from his own company inside a week. Pandora's box was open. Harvey Weinstein denies engaging in non-consensual sex. On 15 October, actress Alyssa Milano suggested on Twitter that anyone who had been ""sexually harassed or assaulted"" should reply to her Tweet with ""Me Too"", to demonstrate the scale of the problem. Half a million people responded in the first 24 hours. A barrage of allegations has since emerged against high-profile men in entertainment, the media, politics, and tech. Many deny any wrongdoing. The repercussions are still in flux, but Hollywood's power dynamics have undoubtedly shifted. That's less obviously true in the world beyond, and begs the question: What's different for the millions of ordinary people who shared their own #MeToo stories? Are the currents of the movement visible in their lives too? How far has the rallying cry been converted into real-world change? One initiative has made solid progress (and spent solid millions) in a bid to make things better on the ground: the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. More than 300 actresses, writers and directorslaunched the project on 1 January,external, raising $21m (Â£15m) in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment, abuse or assault at work. The National Women's Law Center (NWLC) in Washington DC is fielding the considerable admin, matching applicants with lawyers who can offer them free advice. ""We have received more than 2,700 requests for assistance from every state in the United States, and there are more than 500 attorneys in the network who are ready to take on Time's Up cases,"" Sharyn Tejani, director of the fund at the NWLC, told the BBC. ""The fund prioritises cases involving low-wage workers, women in non-traditional jobs, people of colour, LGBTQ people, and people facing legal retaliation because they dared to speak out about sexual harassment,"" said Ms Tejani. Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Reported sex offences against men triple in 10 years Secret world: The women who cannot report sexual abuse Tina Tchen, who jointly leads the fund's legal aid efforts, said the beneficiaries include ""construction workers, prison guards [and] police officers,"" adding: ""There are men who have come forward too. There are some men who have experienced sexual harassment, and then there are some men who are calling, for example, on behalf of their wives or loved ones."" That's unlikely to raise surprise in some quarters. Sian Brooke of the Oxford Internet Institute, who studies gender and sexism online, says the fact that men are often victims of sexual violence was one of the most powerful takeaways from #MeToo. ""One group can be given attention and be taken seriously with regards to allegations of rape, without it taking any of the severity or weight away from another part of it,"" she notes. From October to December 2017, calls to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network - a US crisis hotline - rose by 23% compared with the same period in 2016. Some abuse survivors have cited #MeToo as a stressful influence, saying it resurfaced the pain of their abuse. Others have reported feeling less alone, saying it encouraged them to address past trauma by talking to loved ones, counsellors, or people with similar experiences. ""It's brought the idea of sexual harassment and assault into the public consciousness,"" Ms Brooke says. ""Even if the discussion around the movement is criticism, you are still bringing about an awareness that this happens."" 1in6 is a Los Angeles-based non-profit group that supports male sex abuse survivors. The group's development and communications director Meredith Alling told the BBC that #MeToo had a rapid, measurable impact on the number of men reaching out to them when the hashtag first went viral. ""We saw a 110% increase in web traffic and a 103% increase in the use of our online helpline service between September and October 2017, and the trend has continued,"" she said. In the US, employers are considering how best to create a positive workplace culture in the wake of #MeToo. Ted Bunch is a co-founder of A Call To Men, a social activism group that promotes healthy, respectful ways of ""being a man"", and says the group has noticed an increase in enquiries. ""Most notably, we have seen an increase in corporations seeking to understand why sexual harassment in the workplace is so pervasive,"" he says. Mr Bunch believes problems can arise because the workplace is a microcosm of society, in which men and boys are sometimes taught to view women as objects, and of less value than men. ""Most men are not abusive,"" he says, ""but nearly all men have laughed at a sexist joke or objectified a woman in some way. Once you connect the dots and show men how the jokes they see as harmless actually validate and fuel more harmful behaviour, they are quick to change."" Has the push to ditch bad work cultures spread beyond the US? One British human resources consultant said she had been surprised by the lack of #MeToo-inspired queries. ""We haven't seen any spikes in the volume of training requests, or the volume of training we're recommending. I don't think it's had a significant impact,"" said Elaine Howell, HR manager at PlusHR. ""We have clients in professional services, manufacturing clients, financial, marketing... It appears to be quite specific to that industry [entertainment]."" Teaching boys that 'real men' would stop rape How can businesses tackle sexual harassment? Speak to Equity, the 43,000-strong British actors' union, and it's clear they've had a different experience. The union won't give exact figures, but says it's witnessed a ""significant increase in enquiries and case work since #MeToo"". Vice president Maureen Beattie will take on Equity's presidency this summer, and she's keen to get the message out: toxic behaviour will not go unpunished. Or as she puts it, ""If you do something to one of our members which is wrong, unacceptable, we're going to come after you. And we will come after you big-time."" ""These people haven't gone away,"" she says. ""They are under a stone. They are lurking, just waiting for the time they think nobody's looking any more. ""One of the things we're doing is asking people who have been in the business for a long time, people who are stars, people who have clout, to keep an eye out. Not that they have to be trained up in how to help somebody who's been sexually harassed, but [they] can say - with impunity and no danger of never being worked with again - 'Excuse me? You can't behave like that with people'."" The #MeToo most of us know is still a new-ish creation. But it had a life before the viral hashtag. In 2006, black activist Tarana Burke founded the movement as an initiative to unite survivors of sexual violence. Since it morphed from a low-key project into a global byword, she has embraced #MeToo's A-List flag-bearers - but her focus is on lasting change at all levels of society. One of her most telling remarks came the week before she walked the red carpet at the 2017 Oscars: ""If we keep on 'making statements' and not really doing the work, we are going to be in trouble."" Sarah J Jackson, a professor of communication studies at Northeastern University, believes context is the key to anchoring Me Too. ""I wouldn't call hashtag 'Me Too' a movement at all,"" she says. ""I would call it a campaign that is part of a larger movement. So I would call women's rights the movement, and feminism the movement. And I would say #MeToo is one indication of the sort of conversations that need to happen. ""The next step is, OK so now we know the problem - how do we as a global community expand this conversation?"" Through its ""Me Too Rising"" project,Google has charted how awareness spread around the world,external. While data shows the term has been searched for in every corner of the planet, its resonance has inevitably been greater in some countries than others. The freedom of a nation's press and social media can certainly have impact on that - and it's too soon to tell how the movement will shape countries where it's gained traction more slowly - Japan and South Korea, for example. Karuna Nundy, a prominent lawyer in India's Supreme Court, shared her view on #MeToo's relevance to India, where outrage over sex crimes has sparked waves of public protests in recent years. ""The #MeToo conversations in India are limited to a swathe of English-speaking, internet-enabled people. It's quite a lot in absolute numbers, but small for India. It's added, though, to the huge conversations that were already happening. The idea that due process is failing women, and civil disobedience can be legitimate."" Ms Nundy, who helped draft India's tougher anti-rape law in 2013, says victims are now more likely to be believed. ""I had a rape case yesterday against a leading Bollywood producer. My client is a very young woman; we told the court that she was raped over a period of six months on pain of bodily harm. Regardless of what the court decides, I think the way we were heard by the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the two judges is very different from the way we would have been heard, say, 15 years ago. Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment? Bollywood: The reality of sexual harassment ""There's an interplay between public consciousness, and the law and due process. And that's exactly what I think is happening."" Perhaps, then, #MeToo is not an endgame - but a clarion call to something bigger. A reminder for people to seek change in their communities, and push to make damaging systems better - especially for those who lack the power to fight alone.

"Mr Trump has made a number of controversial decisions around complicated global issues recently The decision to pull out of the summit with North Korea rounds off a momentous six weeks for US foreign policy. It has provided a window on President Trump's approach to foreign affairs; one that may worry friends and potential enemies alike. In mid-April there were the US-led strikes on Syria as punishment for the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. Less than a month later, President Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the JCPOA - a deal he had always insisted was bad for the US and bad for its friends in the region. In mid-May he followed through on another campaign promise when the US symbolically moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Now, some 10 days later,he has pulled out of the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. One thing that Mr Trump has certainly demonstrated is his willingness to follow through on commitments he made during the campaign. But both the decision to pull out of the JCPOA and the embassy move in Israel were approached with little real consideration of the wider context or consequences. The Jerusalem embassy decision was made in isolation; it was never seen as part of any broader effort to move ahead with Israel-Palestinian peace. It came at a time of growing tension in the Gaza Strip and, along with heavy-handed Israeli security tactics and the cynicism of the Hamas leadership, it may well have inflamed the violence. Of the Trump administration's much-trumpeted peace plan there is simply no sign. On the Iran deal, there was again no apparent strategic vision. Would this step ultimately make it harder to constrain Iran's nuclear programme? Might it further strain relations with Washington's key Nato allies? And would it not also add an additional level of tension between the US and other key international players like China and Russia? The earlier bombing in Syria was supposed to send a message to President Assad that enough was enough. But again where was the wider strategy? Mr Trump has spoken about wanting to pull all US troops out of Syria, but this seems to fly in the face of another of the administration's stated goals which is to contain and curb Iran's rising influence in Syria and beyond. Will there be a return to the vitriolic exchanges of last year between Kim and Trump? Now we have the decision to pull out of the Singapore summit with North Korea. The problem here was probably a different one; over-optimism and plain lack of experience or realism. North Korea is certainly a difficult country to deal with. Previous administrations have tried to get deals. Twice they have reached agreement and twice they have collapsed. The Americans say that this time they had been reaching out to the North Koreans to discuss the details about what might have been agreed and received little response. Analysing Trump's letter to Kim What does Kim Jong-un really want? North Korea crisis in 300 words It looks as though the summit might have turned into a photo opportunity for Kim Jong-un and that was simply unacceptable in Washington. But this tells us something else about the highly personalised and dysfunctional approach of this administration to foreign affairs. The summit idea emerged almost out of nowhere. It came as a welcome antidote to the growing level of invective between Washington and Pyongyang, as each traded nuclear threats with the other. But it was almost stillborn at birth. The timescale was just far too short. Little preliminary work had been done. The issues were just too complex and the gaps between the two sides seemingly unbridgeable. To even set the summit hare running was a decision that in large part reflected Mr Trump's ego and his bombastic self-belief in his own powers as a deal-maker. But that, it should be clear, is not how diplomacy works. To a large extent, the US foreign policy machine is running in a void. Senior western diplomats point to the almost empty floor at the state department where the essential assistant secretaries for this region or another should be sitting. But they have simply not been appointed yet. This is why the European governments negotiating with the Americans on a follow-on deal for Iran were aghast when they found that their efforts were simply not heading upwards in the US foreign policy machine. Vital pieces of that machinery were simply not in place. The problem of the malaise at the state department and tumbling morale there may well be resolved by the new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But all you can say is better late than never. Already some momentous foreign policy decisions have been made and the US and the world will have to live with the consequences.

"This video can not be played Harvey Weinstein made no comment as he walked into a police station in New York Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has turned himself in to police in New York, where he is expected to face sexual misconduct charges. The charges have not been announced but US media say some may relate to accusations by actress Lucia Evans. Dozens of women have made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, against the 66 year old. Mr Weinstein has always denied non-consensual sex and this would be the first time he has been charged. Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The allegations triggered the #MeToo movement which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Dozens of journalists were at the 1st Precinct police station in Manhattan when Mr Weinstein appeared at about 07:25 local time (11:25 GMT), dressed casually and carrying one book about director Elia Kazan and another about Rodgers and Hammerstein. The charges will stem from an investigation made by a Manhattan grand jury. They have not been made official and the indictment depends on district attorney Cyrus Vance. What is a US grand jury? The New York Times reports that some of the charges relate to an allegation brought by Lucia Evans,external. She detailed her accusations against Mr Weinsteinin an article in the New Yorker in October last year,external. It is not clear if he will face more charges brought by other accusers. Dozens of reporters and photographers covered a case that has worldwide interest It is known that New York police have been investigating allegations of rape made by actress Paz de la Huerta. And this monthNetflix producer Alexandra Canosa filed court papers in New Yorkalleging Mr Weinstein raped, sexually assaulted and verbally abused her over a five-year period. The statute of limitations will be an issue in some cases but it is not thought to apply in the Evans case. Even if the limitations apply, a judge could still call women to testify to establish a pattern of behaviour, as in therecent trial of actor Bill Cosby. Mr Weinstein is expected to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken at the police station. The Times said he would then be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court. The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out ActressAshley Judd is suing the 66-year-old Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. One of the cases was in New York, where Italian model Ambra Battilana accused Mr Weinstein of groping her in 2015. Investigators decided not to charge him even though there was an audiotape of Mr Weinstein accepting he had touched her breasts and pledging not to do so again. Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing several cases involving accusations against Weinstein after police investigations. London's Metropolitan police are also assessing a sexual abuse allegation against Mr Weinstein. The allegations have left his career in tatters. He was fired last year from his production firm the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. Top industry figures have condemned him and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him. Some of Mr Weinstein's accusers have spoken out to welcome the impending charges. Actress Rose McGowan wrote that some women had given up hope he would be held accountable.

"The show will go ahead with a stand-in bassist Manic Street Preachers star Nicky Wire has pulled out of the band's headline performance at the BBC's Biggest Weekend performance. The star is unable to perform ""due to a serious family illness"", the band said in a statement. Frontman James Dean Bradfield has told the BBC, a member of their road crew will stand in for the bassist ""I don't want to put too much pressure on the lad, but he's a guy called Richard from Pontypool in Wales."" Bradfield added: ""Rich has stood in for Nick a couple of times when his mother was so ill he couldn't travel, so he's done it before and he's a brilliant musician. He's very adept at doing stuff like this."" ""He's been with us for over 10 years now and he's cool. ""He hasn't quite got the calf muscles Nicky's got, so he's not going to be wearing a skirt!""

"Alison Chabloz had claimed the prosecution was an attempt to limit her free speech A blogger has been found guilty of broadcasting anti-Semitic songs on YouTube. Alison Chabloz, 54, from Glossop, Derbyshire, wrote and performed three songs about Nazi persecution, including one about the young diarist Anne Frank. Chabloz claimed the Holocaust was ""a bunch of lies"" and referred to Auschwitz as a ""theme park"". She was warned she may be jailed at her sentencing on 14 June. There was scuffle outside court. There were several heated arguments outside court Chabloz was convicted of two counts of sending an offensive, indecent or menacing message through a public communications network. Live updates from the East Midlands She was further convicted of a third charge relating to a song on YouTube. District Judge John Zani, sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court, said the offences were serious and ""the custody threshold may well have been passed."" When the verdict was given supporters of Chabloz shouted ""shame"" from the public gallery. Chabloz was released on bail on the condition she was placed on a night curfew at her home and does not leave England and Wales. When Chabloz left court there was a scuffle and heated arguments outside, before police arrived to keep the peace. Police arrived to keep the peace after a scuffle outside court The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism initially brought a private prosecution against Chabloz, before the Crown Prosecution Service took over. Gideon Falter, the group's chairman, said: ""Alison Chabloz has dedicated herself over the course of years to inciting others to hate Jews, principally by claiming that the Holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by Jews to defraud the world. ""She is now a convicted criminal. This verdict sends a strong message that in Britain Holocaust denial and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories will not be tolerated."" A CPS spokesman said it first became aware of the private prosecution in December 2016 when Alison Chabloz's solicitors asked the CPS to take it over and  stop it. However, in 2017, the CPS determined the case should continue and Alison Chabloz was prosecuted. Alison Chabloz previously told the court she wanted put across her ""political, artistic, creative point"" Chabloz, who describes herself as a Holocaust revisionist, said her music was ""satire"" and had previously told the court there was ""no proof"" gas chambers were used to kill Jewish people in World War Two. However, prosecutors said three of Chabloz's songs, including one which referred to the notorious Nazi death camp Auschwitz as a ""theme park"", were criminally offensive. Another song included a section set to the tune of a popular Jewish song Hava Nagila. The defence had told Judge Zani his ruling would set a precedent on the exercise of free speech. Chabloz had claimed many Jewish people found her songs funny and that no-one was forced to listen to them. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"The Australian owner of Homebase has sold the DIY chain for Â£1, ending its disastrous foray into the UK. Wesfarmers paid Â£340m for the retailer two years ago, but losses and other costs will bring its total bill to about Â£1bn. The chain is being bought by restructuring specialist Hilco,which rescued music chain HMV in 2013. The 24 stores that had been converted to the Bunnings brand will revert to the Homebase name. Richard Lim, of consultancy Retail Economics, said the Wesfarmers takeover had been an ""unbelievable disaster"" due to ""woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and a misguided perception of the UK market"". He expected the restructuring would result in store closures and more job losses on the High Street. Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 workers. Dave Gill, national officer at shopworkers' trade union Usdaw, said: ""Staff in Homebase stores are extremely worried for the future after company's ownership changes hands yet again. ""Clearly the sale for just one pound is very disturbing. I am in touch with the company and we are seeking urgent meetings to secure jobs."" Yours for a pound: the companies sold on the cheap Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent This must go down as one of the most disastrous retail acquisitions ever - a textbook example of how not to do it. The Australian firm thought they could show the Brits how to do DIY. So confident, they immediately sacked Homebase's senior management team. That was a huge mistake. They then began to strip out the soft furnishings that were popular at Homebase. Instead, Bunnings opted for no frills DIY sheds. But it failed to understand the UK market and the losses soon started to mount. Deteriorating economic conditions certainly didn't help. The few stores that were trading as Bunnings will convert back to the Homebase brand as this company makes an ignominious retreat. The new owners will need to act fast to stem the losses across the Homebase business, which will inevitably mean store closures and job losses ahead. Wesfarmers has admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, such as underestimating winter demand for a range of items from heaters to cleaning and storage, and dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Rob Scott, chief executive of Wesfarmers, said the UK market proved to be ""very competitive"", with ""quite challenging"" retail conditions. Asked whether investors could trust Australia's biggest retail group with future acquisitions, he said he hoped the disposal ""demonstrates the capability of our team to act decisively"". Wesfarmers expects the disposal to cost up to Â£230m. It will be entitled to 20% of any future sale of the business. Homebase chief Damian McGloughlin, who will stay on as part of the management buyout funded by Hilco, ""marks an exciting new chapter"" for the retailer. ""With Hilco's support we have the commitment of an experienced partner, substantial additional capital, stability for the business and the opportunity to reinvigorate a brand that has been a mainstay of UK retail for over 40 years,"" he said. Hilco was given a ""Turnaround of the Decade"" award last year for its revival of HMV. Paul Gainford is a Bunnings fan By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The newly branded Bunnings store in Penge, south-east London, opened its doors with some fanfare in March - including an appearance by Peppa Pig. But now that Bunnings has failed to bring home the bacon for Wesfarmers, the store will become a Homebase once more. Shoppers at the store seem bemused. Carpenter Paul Gainford said: ""I'm a bit gutted that it is going back to Homebase. It has got everything here - things that you can't get elsewhere."" Other shoppers agreed that some ranges, such as tools and plants, had improved since the switchover. Ultimately, they were keen for the store to stay open in some form under the new ownership. ""There is not much choice around here so it is important that places like this remain,"" said Wayne Obee, who was buying plants and compost for his garden. Retired banker Neil Rank, 60, was concerned about the impact on workers: ""There seems to be more staff here now it is a Bunnings. But whenever costs are cut, it is staff costs that they look at first.""

"This video can not be played Harvey Weinstein made no comment as he walked into a police station in New York Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has turned himself in to police in New York, where he is expected to face sexual misconduct charges. The charges have not been announced but US media say some may relate to accusations by actress Lucia Evans. Dozens of women have made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, against the 66 year old. Mr Weinstein has always denied non-consensual sex and this would be the first time he has been charged. Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The allegations triggered the #MeToo movement which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Dozens of journalists were at the 1st Precinct police station in Manhattan when Mr Weinstein appeared at about 07:25 local time (11:25 GMT), dressed casually and carrying one book about director Elia Kazan and another about Rodgers and Hammerstein. The charges will stem from an investigation made by a Manhattan grand jury. They have not been made official and the indictment depends on district attorney Cyrus Vance. What is a US grand jury? The New York Times reports that some of the charges relate to an allegation brought by Lucia Evans,external. She detailed her accusations against Mr Weinsteinin an article in the New Yorker in October last year,external. It is not clear if he will face more charges brought by other accusers. Dozens of reporters and photographers covered a case that has worldwide interest It is known that New York police have been investigating allegations of rape made by actress Paz de la Huerta. And this monthNetflix producer Alexandra Canosa filed court papers in New Yorkalleging Mr Weinstein raped, sexually assaulted and verbally abused her over a five-year period. The statute of limitations will be an issue in some cases but it is not thought to apply in the Evans case. Even if the limitations apply, a judge could still call women to testify to establish a pattern of behaviour, as in therecent trial of actor Bill Cosby. Mr Weinstein is expected to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken at the police station. The Times said he would then be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court. The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out ActressAshley Judd is suing the 66-year-old Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances.

"The sending of a private conversation was a rare occurrence, Amazon insisted A couple in Portland, Oregon joked that their Amazon Alexa might be listening in to their private conversations. The joke came to an abrupt end when they discovered a conversation was indeed recorded by Alexa - and then sent to an apparently random person in their contact list. ""Unplug your Alexa devices right now!"" warned the puzzled recipient, according to CBS affiliate station KIRO7,which first reported the story.,external Amazon has an explanation as to what happened. But first, here's how Danielle - who didn't want to share her surname with KIRO7's reporter - described the rather alarming chain of events. It starts with a phone call from a person working for Danielle's husband. ""He proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files of recordings from inside our house,"" Danielle says. ""At first, my husband was, like, 'no you didn't!' And the [recipient of the message] said, 'You sat there talking about hardwood floors.' And we said, 'oh gosh, you really did hear us.'"" Creepy, eh? Today's hardwood floors might be tomorrow's intimate sweet nothings. So I asked Amazon what could possibly have caused this to happen, and here's what a spokesperson said: ""Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa'."" Ok... ""Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a 'send message' request."" Uh-oh... ""At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list."" Bit of a stretch, but fine... ""Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right'"" This is getting ridiculous. ""As unlikely as this string of events is..."" You're telling me! ""...we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely."" One option immediately springs to mind. For what it's worth, Danielle told ABC that there were no audible warnings from Alexa that it (she?) was doing anything. And to offer one suggestion - sometimes the voice can be pretty quiet, especially if you're deep in conversation about hardwood floors. It's a reminder of the susceptibility of voice-operated devices, particularly ones that want to be as chummy and personal as Alexa. At leastshe isn't laughing at us anymore.

"This road in Cambridge saw six homes sold for more than Â£1m Householders are increasingly likely to live on millionaire row as sales of Â£1m-plus homes rose to a new high in England and Wales last year. A total of 16,119 property sales for Â£1m or more were completed last year, up 5.4% from the previous high in 2016. Over the past decade, most were sold in London, but sales have doubled in the East of England - the biggest increase of any region in England and Wales. University cities such as Cambridge and Bristol have seen Â£1m-plus sales surge. Rising house prices and demand prompted by investment in these areas has pushed many properties' sale prices above the Â£1m threshold. Inthere werehomes over Â£1m sold since 2007, with the most expensive sold for. If the postcode search does not load,click to launch the interactive content,external. The findings are based on analysis by the BBC data team of Land Registry figures for England and Wales.

It also does not cover Scotland, where Registers of Scotland data is not free to download. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built using Carto Overlooked by cranes and within earshot of a soundtrack of construction on a huge new development on the outskirts of Cambridge is Hobson Road. This newly-built ""signature"" street of four and five-bedroom homes saw six Â£1m-plus sales in 2017. Across the city as a whole, a total of 119 sales of Â£1m-plus properties were completed last year - the first time the number has topped 100. Over the past 10 years there has been a fourfold rise in sales in this price bracket in the university city. More are being built to meet demand, in part, from newcomers employed at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus - one of the largest medical research sites in the world. This show home is marketing newly-built homes on sale for Â£1,050,000 In the window of the local estate agent in Trumpington in the south of the city, 20 posters are advertising properties for sales, and 13 of them are being sold for Â£1m or more. David Bentley, partner at Bidwells, said: ""Cambridge is a global brand that appeals to all four corners of the globe. [The city] has a continually growing population which leads to a shortage of good quality housing, which leads to house price rises each year, which gradually edges transaction numbers over the Â£1m threshold. ""It is also true the science and tech sectors are growing faster than any other business sector, which has a corresponding impact on incomes."" Sales of Â£1m-plus homes have more than doubled in 104 local authority areas of England and Wales in the 10 years since 2007. Investment in areas with leading universities has led these locations to see some of the biggest increases in such sales. In addition to Cambridge (a 441% rise), there has also been a surge in Warwick (up 317%), Oxford (up 270%), Bristol (up 260%), and York (up 150%). The rises over the past decade come despite a drop in Â£1m-plus property sales in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, which hit the housing market as a whole. In some parts of the country, a property sold for Â£1m or more guarantees a certain level of luxury. That is not necessarily true in London, which has consistently witnessed the highest house prices in the past 10 years. Kensington and Chelsea is the only borough that has seen sales in this price bracket fall since 2007, although until recently it still had the most properties sold for Â£1m or more than any other part of England and Wales. Such sales are now more frequent in Westminster and Wandsworth. The borough of Hackney has seen the biggest percentage rise, up from 15 sales in 2007 to 270 in 2017. Regionally, the biggest increase in Â£1m-plus sales in the past decade was not in London, but in the East of England. The BBC data team analysed all residential transactions sold at full market value in England and Wales from the Land Registry price paid dataset for the period from January 2007 to December 2017. All transactions over Â£1m (including those at exactly Â£1m) were mapped to local authorities using the latest Ordinance Survey's Codepoint Open mapping file from February 2018 that contains data for each postcode unit in England and Wales. Postcodes not found in the OS Codepoint Open mapping file were not counted as part of the analysis, as they could not be matched to a local authority.

"The sending of a private conversation was a rare occurrence, Amazon insisted A couple in Portland, Oregon joked that their Amazon Alexa might be listening in to their private conversations. The joke came to an abrupt end when they discovered a conversation was indeed recorded by Alexa - and then sent to an apparently random person in their contact list. ""Unplug your Alexa devices right now!"" warned the puzzled recipient, according to CBS affiliate station KIRO7,which first reported the story.,external Amazon has an explanation as to what happened. But first, here's how Danielle - who didn't want to share her surname with KIRO7's reporter - described the rather alarming chain of events. It starts with a phone call from a person working for Danielle's husband. ""He proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files of recordings from inside our house,"" Danielle says. ""At first, my husband was, like, 'no you didn't!' And the [recipient of the message] said, 'You sat there talking about hardwood floors.' And we said, 'oh gosh, you really did hear us.'"" Creepy, eh? Today's hardwood floors might be tomorrow's intimate sweet nothings. So I asked Amazon what could possibly have caused this to happen, and here's what a spokesperson said: ""Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa'."" Ok... ""Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a 'send message' request."" Uh-oh... ""At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list."" Bit of a stretch, but fine... ""Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right'"" This is getting ridiculous. ""As unlikely as this string of events is..."" You're telling me! ""...we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely."" One option immediately springs to mind. For what it's worth, Danielle told ABC that there were no audible warnings from Alexa that it (she?) was doing anything. And to offer one suggestion - sometimes the voice can be pretty quiet, especially if you're deep in conversation about hardwood floors. It's a reminder of the susceptibility of voice-operated devices, particularly ones that want to be as chummy and personal as Alexa. At leastshe isn't laughing at us anymore.

"Alison Chabloz had claimed the prosecution was an attempt to limit her free speech A blogger has been found guilty of broadcasting anti-Semitic songs on YouTube. Alison Chabloz, 54, from Glossop, Derbyshire, wrote and performed three songs about Nazi persecution, including one about the young diarist Anne Frank. Chabloz claimed the Holocaust was ""a bunch of lies"" and referred to Auschwitz as a ""theme park"". She was warned she may be jailed at her sentencing on 14 June. There was scuffle outside court. There were several heated arguments outside court Chabloz was convicted of two counts of sending an offensive, indecent or menacing message through a public communications network. Live updates from the East Midlands She was further convicted of a third charge relating to a song on YouTube. District Judge John Zani, sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court, said the offences were serious and ""the custody threshold may well have been passed."" When the verdict was given supporters of Chabloz shouted ""shame"" from the public gallery. Chabloz was released on bail on the condition she was placed on a night curfew at her home and does not leave England and Wales. When Chabloz left court there was a scuffle and heated arguments outside, before police arrived to keep the peace. Police arrived to keep the peace after a scuffle outside court The Campaign Against Anti-Semitism initially brought a private prosecution against Chabloz, before the Crown Prosecution Service took over. Gideon Falter, the group's chairman, said: ""Alison Chabloz has dedicated herself over the course of years to inciting others to hate Jews, principally by claiming that the Holocaust was a hoax perpetrated by Jews to defraud the world. ""She is now a convicted criminal. This verdict sends a strong message that in Britain Holocaust denial and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories will not be tolerated."" A CPS spokesman said it first became aware of the private prosecution in December 2016 when Alison Chabloz's solicitors asked the CPS to take it over and  stop it. However, in 2017, the CPS determined the case should continue and Alison Chabloz was prosecuted. Alison Chabloz previously told the court she wanted put across her ""political, artistic, creative point"" Chabloz, who describes herself as a Holocaust revisionist, said her music was ""satire"" and had previously told the court there was ""no proof"" gas chambers were used to kill Jewish people in World War Two. However, prosecutors said three of Chabloz's songs, including one which referred to the notorious Nazi death camp Auschwitz as a ""theme park"", were criminally offensive. Another song included a section set to the tune of a popular Jewish song Hava Nagila. The defence had told Judge Zani his ruling would set a precedent on the exercise of free speech. Chabloz had claimed many Jewish people found her songs funny and that no-one was forced to listen to them. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Jim Booth described how Joseph Isaacs attacked him A man who attacked a 96-year-old D-Day veteran with a claw hammer has been found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 20 years. Joseph Isaacs, 40, of no fixed address, shouted ""money, money, money"" as he repeatedly hit Jim Booth. Mr Booth spent nine days in hospital after the raid at his home in Taunton. He said later he should have known how to deal with the assault, because he had been in the special services, but was now too old. Isaacs had previously admitted aggravated burglary, causing grievous bodily harm and seven counts of fraud. He will spend 16 years in custody and four on licence, the judge ruled. During sentencing, Judge David Ticehurst said Mr Booth was an ""extraordinarily remarkable gentleman"" whom Isaacs ""savagely attacked with a claw hammer which you took with you for that purpose"". He said: ""It was a brutal and utterly senseless attack on him."" Judge Ticehurst also said Isaacs met the criteria for the extended sentence as he showed an ""apparent lack of remorse or concern"" for attacking Mr Booth for a ""paltry"" amount of money. The court heard Isaacs, formerly from Exeter, went to Mr Booth's home on 22 November intending to obtain money as he had not eaten for days and was ""starving"". He initially offered to carry out repairs to the roof, but when he was turned down he repeatedly hit the 96-year-old with a hammer and left him for dead. This video can not be played Joseph Isaacs denied carrying out the attack when he was arrested Isaacs used Mr Booth's bank card to buy food at a McDonald's fast-food restaurant in Bridgwater after the attack. The court heard Mr Booth was hit six times on the head, as well as on the arms with the claw side of the tool. Between each blow Isaacs shouted ""money, money, money"". Mr Booth suffered a number of skull fractures, bleeds to the brain, deep wounds to both his arms and a fracture to his right hand. Speaking after he had recovered, he said he was told one of his arm injuries showed he had hit back at his attacker. ""I'm saying I blame myself because I was special services and I think I really should have known how to deal with this, but I didn't. ""I was too old, obviously,"" said Mr Booth. In a statement released after the sentencing, the veteran's family said: ""On 22 November last year, a light was shone on the very best and worst of humankind, when our father was subjected to a brutal and cowardly attack inside his home. ""Miraculously, though left for dead, and against all odds, he survived. ""In the very difficult six months since, our father has shown extraordinary courage and determination as he's battled with the pain and long-term effects of the injuries. ""He is truly inspirational."" Det Ch Insp James Riccio, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""It was a cowardly act and it's a miracle Mr Booth survived these horrific injuries."" Joseph Isaacs used Mr Booth's bank card to buy food a few hours after the attack Mr Booth, who joined the Royal Navy at 18, took part in one of the most secret operations of the D-Day invasion in Normandy in 1944, andtalked about it in a 2013 BBC documentary. He was part of a team of submariners who submerged close to Sword Beach. On the day of the landings he and his colleagues left their craft in a fold-up canoe to shine beacons to guide the Allied landing craft safely to shore.

"This video can not be played Harvey Weinstein made no comment as he walked into a police station in New York Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has turned himself in to police in New York, where he is expected to face sexual misconduct charges. The charges have not been announced but US media say some may relate to accusations by actress Lucia Evans. Dozens of women have made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, against the 66 year old. Mr Weinstein has always denied non-consensual sex and this would be the first time he has been charged. Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The allegations triggered the #MeToo movement which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Dozens of journalists were at the 1st Precinct police station in Manhattan when Mr Weinstein appeared at about 07:25 local time (11:25 GMT), dressed casually and carrying one book about director Elia Kazan and another about Rodgers and Hammerstein. The charges will stem from an investigation made by a Manhattan grand jury. They have not been made official and the indictment depends on district attorney Cyrus Vance. What is a US grand jury? The New York Times reports that some of the charges relate to an allegation brought by Lucia Evans,external. She detailed her accusations against Mr Weinsteinin an article in the New Yorker in October last year,external. It is not clear if he will face more charges brought by other accusers. Dozens of reporters and photographers covered a case that has worldwide interest It is known that New York police have been investigating allegations of rape made by actress Paz de la Huerta. And this monthNetflix producer Alexandra Canosa filed court papers in New Yorkalleging Mr Weinstein raped, sexually assaulted and verbally abused her over a five-year period. The statute of limitations will be an issue in some cases but it is not thought to apply in the Evans case. Even if the limitations apply, a judge could still call women to testify to establish a pattern of behaviour, as in therecent trial of actor Bill Cosby. Mr Weinstein is expected to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken at the police station. The Times said he would then be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court. The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out ActressAshley Judd is suing the 66-year-old Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. One of the cases was in New York, where Italian model Ambra Battilana accused Mr Weinstein of groping her in 2015. Investigators decided not to charge him even though there was an audiotape of Mr Weinstein accepting he had touched her breasts and pledging not to do so again. Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing several cases involving accusations against Weinstein after police investigations. London's Metropolitan police are also assessing a sexual abuse allegation against Mr Weinstein. The allegations have left his career in tatters. He was fired last year from his production firm the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. Top industry figures have condemned him and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him. Some of Mr Weinstein's accusers have spoken out to welcome the impending charges. Actress Rose McGowan wrote that some women had given up hope he would be held accountable. She said: ""Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice."" Italian actress Asia Argento, who alleges Mr Weinstein sexual assaulted her in the 1990s, reflected on the latest news in a simple tweet: Allow Twitter content?

In January, more than 300 actresses, writers and directors launched the Time's Up project, raising $21m (Â£15m) in just a month to fund legal assistance for people who suffer harassment, abuse or assault at work.

"The way secondary school league tables in England are now devised is unfairly stigmatising schools in white working-class areas, head teachers say. They say the format is ""toxic"" for schools with a combination of high levels of deprivation and few pupils speaking English as a second language. ""Disenfranchised"" communities will be even more disillusioned if their schools are unfairly blamed, say heads. The Department for Education says the revised rankings have become ""fairer"". Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the league-table changes had been welcomed as an improvement but the patterns emerging meant it was ""definitely time to look at it again"" and talks with the Department for Education were expected. Hundreds of thousands of teenagers are currently taking their GCSEs - and the results will be used in the next round of school league tables. But there are complaints from heads in the North West that the measure for comparing schools, known as Progress 8, is skewed against schools serving deprived white communities. ""If this was any other ethnic group at the bottom, people would be unsettled,"" says James Eldon, principal of the Manchester Enterprise Academy, where 90% of the GCSE year are eligible for free school meals. ""But because it's the white working-class, it's somehow less controversial,"" says Mr Eldon, who chairs the secondary head teachers group in Manchester and is chief executive of an academy trust. How are school league tables measured now? Why do white working class children fail in school? Radio 4's More or Less untangles how Progress 8 works He warns of the ""disillusionment"" for communities already feeling ""socially isolated and disenfranchised"". White working-class boys have one of the lowest rates of entry to university of any group. Mr Eldon says the new league table measurements were brought in with good intentions, but are having unintended consequences. Progress 8 was meant to move beyond comparing only final results - and instead measures the progress that pupils make between primary school and GCSEs. Heads have analysed the link between deprivation and scores in schools with few EAL pupils It was introduced to be fairer, so that pupils who began secondary school from a low base would be measured on how much progress they had made. Ian Butterfield, head of Hindley High School, in Wigan, says the flaw in the system is not taking deprivation into account. Pupils in schools with a more deprived intake make less progress through secondary school - and will therefore be given a negative score in the league tables, he says. Another factor is that ""English as an additional language"" (EAL) pupils, sometimes starting from a lower base, are likely to score higher on the measure of progress. There are also cultural factors - with EAL pupils often migrants from families with strong support for their children's education. The ""winners"" in this system are more affluent schools, where pupils on average make better progress, and those with more EAL pupils, Mr Butterfield says, with London the most successful example. League tables are based on progress rather than final results But for white working-class schools, such as in parts of the North West and North East of England, with a very poor intake and few EAL pupils, Mr Butterfield says, it is ""almost impossible"" for them not to have a negative score. He says the league tables are not measuring the achievements of schools in adversity but describing the demographics of their intake. Professor Becky Allen, Director of the Centre for Education Improvement Science at UCL, said: ""The problem with school performance tables is that they assume that the schooling system is solely responsible for everything that children learn during their childhood. ""So, if white working-class students learn less than other students, the blame for this lesser progress is entirely placed on the schools. Of course, this notion is nonsense - learning is co-produced by the actions of schools, parents, communities and the students themselves. ""The dilemma for government is what we do about this. Should we just accept that schools serving white working-class communities will have less good exam results? And how can we be sure that these schools are working as hard as they can to provide a high-quality education?"" But the head teachers' concerns have been backed by Dr Terry Wrigley, of the University of Northumbria, who has written a report for the National Education Union about why so many schools in north-east England are appearing to do so badly. Almost twice as many are below the minimum ""floor"" standard, compared with the national average. ""This is not special pleading or complacency,"" says Dr Wrigley. ""Poorer areas are being unfairly penalised."" As pupils go through secondary school the impact of deprivation grows, with less well-educated parents not able to help as much with homework and higher risks of disaffection. The gap in vocabulary can also widen and poorer youngsters are less likely to have families making sure they are on course for university. Dr Wrigley says that Progress 8 seems to mirror levels of affluence and poverty and is ""an unreliable identifier of school ineffectiveness"". Head teacher Mr Butterfield says there are serious consequences for schools - with Ofsted likely to intervene and schools' leaders at risk of losing their jobs. He warns it is becoming a serious disincentive when trying to recruit staff. ""Start labelling all these schools as failing and you begin to destroy local communities and the confidence of those dedicated to improving the lives of these youngsters,"" says Mr Butterfield. Mike Kane, shadow schools minister, has asked whether the rankings will be amended Mr Eldon says teachers in such areas have worked hard to turn around attitudes where it was ""soaked into the bones"" that local schools were bad. Labour's shadow schools minister and MP for Wythenshawe, Mike Kane, has asked the government whether it will amend the league tables in the light of the impact on schools serving white working-class pupils. A Department for Education spokesman defended the league tables as making sure that schools focused on the results of all pupils, including low performers. ""Far from being unfair, our Progress 8 measure means that schools are now recognised for the progress made by all pupils, as every grade from every pupil contributes to the school's performance - taking into account their ability when they started school,"" said the spokesman. ""The measure has been broadly welcomed by the sector, as it is a fairer way to assess overall school effectiveness as it doesn't focus on the attainment at a particular grade threshold.""

"Are they back to yelling at each other again? US President Donald Trump has just cancelled what would have been a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The shock move could undo months of diplomatic effort and throws the future of the Korean peninsula back into doubt. The 12 June meeting was supposed to discuss ways of reducing the nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula. It would have been historic - the first time a sitting US president had met their North Korean counterpart. This video can not be played Trump: ""US military is ready if necessary"" Past days, though, had seen increasing hostility and a certain lack of diplomatic courtesy from both sides, casting doubt over whether the summit would go ahead. On Thursday,Mr Trump sent a letter to Mr Kimsaying that he wouldn't be going. He blamed North Korea's ""tremendous anger and open hostility"". While both Washington and Pyongyang have said there is still a chance for talks at a later stage, they have also brought back aggressive military threats against the other. Decoding Trump's letter to Kim What cancelled summit says about Trump foreign policy 'A total goat rodeo' - Reaction and analysis Last year saw seen tensions between North Korea and the US reach worrying levels,with threats of mutual nuclear destruction and petty name calling.North Korea carried out its largest ever nuclear weapon testand repeatedly fired off missiles. 1 January 2018 brought an unexpected turn, whenKim Jong-un reached out to South Korea. After lots of careful negotiations, North Korea took part in the Winter Olympics in the South, and Mr Kim said he was willing to sit down with the US to talk denuclearisation. What followed was a historic meeting between North and South Korea where they agreed to end hostilities and work together towards denuclearisation. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea The world eagerly awaited the next event: direct talks between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.That was finally confirmed two weeks ago. In the run-upNorth Korea released three US detaineesandblew up its nuclear testing siteas gestures of good intent. After the initial enthusiasm though, the actual preparations for the summit proved to be - predictably - difficult. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on While the stated goal was denuclearisation, it soon became clear that Pyongyang and Washington were not exactly on the same page over what that meant. For the US it appeared to mean complete and irreversible dismantling of the North's nuclear programme and weapons, allowing international inspectors to check every step of that process, before any talk of sanctions being lifted. For North Korea, it meant a much more reciprocal progress. If Pyongyang was to give up its nuclear asset, it wanted to see similar gestures from Washington. The US has a large military presence in South Korea and in Japan - both of which North Korea would expect to be scaled down, along with assurances that its survival as a state would never be in question. North Korea crisis in 300 words What does Kim Jong-un really want? Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation Pyongyang has for years wanted to be accepted as an equal nuclear power. Once it appeared to have mastered nuclear technology and antiballistic missiles, it wanted that fact to be reflected in the negotiations. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? What not to say to North Korea But top US diplomats have repeatedly brought up the one example for denuclearisation that North Korea least wants to hear about: Libya. There, former leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be brutally lynched and killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. The Libya model was first mentioned by US National Security Advisor John Bolton, and then -despite strong North Korean outrage at Bolton- again by Vice-President Mike Pence. This video can not be played Why North Korea is angry at this man: John Bolton In reaction to Mr Pence's comments,Pyongyang slammed the VP a ""dummy"" and his remarks ""stupid"", threatening that a nuclear showdown was the alternative to talks. And in reaction to that, the US axed the summit. While the US says there's still a backdoor open for talks and North Korea has expressed similar sentiment, both sides have also brought back the big rhetorical guns. Mr Trump warned the North of the ""massive and powerful"" nuclear capabilities of the US, adding: ""I pray to God they will never have to be used."" Pyongyang has already said a ""nuclear-to-nuclear showdown"" was the alternative to the summit and so the situation seems to be back where it was in 2017 when the Trump-Kim relationship was marked by an escalating string of insults and threats of mutual destruction. With one failed summit down, military conflict might still be unlikely - but it seems a lot less unlikely than when the talks were still on.

"Mr Trump has made a number of controversial decisions around complicated global issues recently The decision to pull out of the summit with North Korea rounds off a momentous six weeks for US foreign policy. It has provided a window on President Trump's approach to foreign affairs; one that may worry friends and potential enemies alike. In mid-April there were the US-led strikes on Syria as punishment for the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. Less than a month later, President Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the JCPOA - a deal he had always insisted was bad for the US and bad for its friends in the region. In mid-May he followed through on another campaign promise when the US symbolically moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Now, some 10 days later,he has pulled out of the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. One thing that Mr Trump has certainly demonstrated is his willingness to follow through on commitments he made during the campaign. But both the decision to pull out of the JCPOA and the embassy move in Israel were approached with little real consideration of the wider context or consequences. The Jerusalem embassy decision was made in isolation; it was never seen as part of any broader effort to move ahead with Israel-Palestinian peace. It came at a time of growing tension in the Gaza Strip and, along with heavy-handed Israeli security tactics and the cynicism of the Hamas leadership, it may well have inflamed the violence. Of the Trump administration's much-trumpeted peace plan there is simply no sign. On the Iran deal, there was again no apparent strategic vision. Would this step ultimately make it harder to constrain Iran's nuclear programme? Might it further strain relations with Washington's key Nato allies? And would it not also add an additional level of tension between the US and other key international players like China and Russia? The earlier bombing in Syria was supposed to send a message to President Assad that enough was enough. But again where was the wider strategy? Mr Trump has spoken about wanting to pull all US troops out of Syria, but this seems to fly in the face of another of the administration's stated goals which is to contain and curb Iran's rising influence in Syria and beyond. Will there be a return to the vitriolic exchanges of last year between Kim and Trump? Now we have the decision to pull out of the Singapore summit with North Korea. The problem here was probably a different one; over-optimism and plain lack of experience or realism. North Korea is certainly a difficult country to deal with. Previous administrations have tried to get deals. Twice they have reached agreement and twice they have collapsed. The Americans say that this time they had been reaching out to the North Koreans to discuss the details about what might have been agreed and received little response. Analysing Trump's letter to Kim What does Kim Jong-un really want? North Korea crisis in 300 words It looks as though the summit might have turned into a photo opportunity for Kim Jong-un and that was simply unacceptable in Washington. But this tells us something else about the highly personalised and dysfunctional approach of this administration to foreign affairs. The summit idea emerged almost out of nowhere. It came as a welcome antidote to the growing level of invective between Washington and Pyongyang, as each traded nuclear threats with the other. But it was almost stillborn at birth. The timescale was just far too short. Little preliminary work had been done. The issues were just too complex and the gaps between the two sides seemingly unbridgeable. To even set the summit hare running was a decision that in large part reflected Mr Trump's ego and his bombastic self-belief in his own powers as a deal-maker. But that, it should be clear, is not how diplomacy works. To a large extent, the US foreign policy machine is running in a void. Senior western diplomats point to the almost empty floor at the state department where the essential assistant secretaries for this region or another should be sitting. But they have simply not been appointed yet. This is why the European governments negotiating with the Americans on a follow-on deal for Iran were aghast when they found that their efforts were simply not heading upwards in the US foreign policy machine. Vital pieces of that machinery were simply not in place. The problem of the malaise at the state department and tumbling morale there may well be resolved by the new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But all you can say is better late than never. Already some momentous foreign policy decisions have been made and the US and the world will have to live with the consequences.

"Breast cancer screening is offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in England Tens of thousands more women in England may have missed out on breast screening invitations dating back further than previously thought, according to a leading cancer expert. Earlier this month,the health secretary said a 2009 computer failure may have shortened up to 270 lives. But Prof Peter Sasieni said the problems go back to 2005, and could have been spotted earlier. Public Health England said his analysis was ""flawed"". And it said an independent review would look at all aspects of the breast screening service. PHE discovered in January that some women aged 68-71 had not received their final invitation for breast screening. Jeremy Hunt told the Commons that 450,000 women were affected between 2009 and the start of 2018. Prof Sasieni, professor of cancer prevention at King's College London, looked closely at data from the breast cancer screening programme in England from 2004 to 2017in a letter published in The Lancet,external. This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter He found that the percentage of 65-70 year old eligible women invited for screening was consistently less, by 2-3%, than those invited in the group aged 55-64. This is the case dating back to 2004-05 when the programme was first extended to include women up to their 71st birthday. The difference amounts to 140,000 women being missed between 2005 and 2008 - adding up to a total of more than 502,000 not getting invitations since 2005, Prof Sasieni concluded. Breast screening error angers survivor and family of deceased Health secretary reveals breast screening letters error Is the NHS screening programme working? Breast cancer screening 'does more harm than good' Prof Sasieni, who is also lead investigator of the Cancer Research UK programme in cancer screening and statistics, said: ""Data that could have alerted people to the lack of invitations being sent to women aged 70 was publicly available, but no one looked at it carefully enough."" Although the error should not be seen as ""a major public health failure"" and women should not feel anxious, he said it was right ""to investigate how this error occurred and why it was not spotted for so long"". He added: ""It is important that the computer systems used to run our cancer screening programmes are reviewed and, if necessary replaced - and that detailed anonymous data are made available for independent scrutiny."" Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England, said: ""This is a flawed analysis which fails to take into account some important facts, such as when the breast screening programme was rolled out to all 70 year olds in England or when a clinical trial was started called Age X."" This trial looked at offering screening to women from 47 up to the age of 73 to see what the risks and benefits would be. Prof Newton said their top priority was making sure that all women who did not receive an invitation for a screen were supported. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said it was ""concerning"" to hear that even more women could have been affected by missed screening invitations. ""We urge Public Health England to make clear the full extent of the error as soon as possible,"" she said. The risk of breast cancer increases with age and screening helps early detection of cancers, offering the best chance of survival. But it is not yet known if the long-term benefits of screening outweigh the risks for women over 70.

"The Australian owner of Homebase has sold the DIY chain for Â£1, ending its disastrous foray into the UK. Wesfarmers paid Â£340m for the retailer two years ago, but losses and other costs will bring its total bill to about Â£1bn. The chain is being bought by restructuring specialist Hilco,which rescued music chain HMV in 2013. The 24 stores that had been converted to the Bunnings brand will revert to the Homebase name. Richard Lim, of consultancy Retail Economics, said the Wesfarmers takeover had been an ""unbelievable disaster"" due to ""woeful management decisions, clumsy execution and a misguided perception of the UK market"". He expected the restructuring would result in store closures and more job losses on the High Street. Homebase has about 250 stores and 11,500 workers. Dave Gill, national officer at shopworkers' trade union Usdaw, said: ""Staff in Homebase stores are extremely worried for the future after company's ownership changes hands yet again. ""Clearly the sale for just one pound is very disturbing. I am in touch with the company and we are seeking urgent meetings to secure jobs."" Yours for a pound: the companies sold on the cheap Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent This must go down as one of the most disastrous retail acquisitions ever - a textbook example of how not to do it. The Australian firm thought they could show the Brits how to do DIY. So confident, they immediately sacked Homebase's senior management team. That was a huge mistake. They then began to strip out the soft furnishings that were popular at Homebase. Instead, Bunnings opted for no frills DIY sheds. But it failed to understand the UK market and the losses soon started to mount. Deteriorating economic conditions certainly didn't help. The few stores that were trading as Bunnings will convert back to the Homebase brand as this company makes an ignominious retreat. The new owners will need to act fast to stem the losses across the Homebase business, which will inevitably mean store closures and job losses ahead. Wesfarmers has admitted making a number of ""self-induced"" blunders, such as underestimating winter demand for a range of items from heaters to cleaning and storage, and dropping popular kitchen and bathroom ranges. Rob Scott, chief executive of Wesfarmers, said the UK market proved to be ""very competitive"", with ""quite challenging"" retail conditions. Asked whether investors could trust Australia's biggest retail group with future acquisitions, he said he hoped the disposal ""demonstrates the capability of our team to act decisively"". Wesfarmers expects the disposal to cost up to Â£230m. It will be entitled to 20% of any future sale of the business. Homebase chief Damian McGloughlin, who will stay on as part of the management buyout funded by Hilco, ""marks an exciting new chapter"" for the retailer. ""With Hilco's support we have the commitment of an experienced partner, substantial additional capital, stability for the business and the opportunity to reinvigorate a brand that has been a mainstay of UK retail for over 40 years,"" he said. Hilco was given a ""Turnaround of the Decade"" award last year for its revival of HMV. Paul Gainford is a Bunnings fan By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The newly branded Bunnings store in Penge, south-east London, opened its doors with some fanfare in March - including an appearance by Peppa Pig. But now that Bunnings has failed to bring home the bacon for Wesfarmers, the store will become a Homebase once more. Shoppers at the store seem bemused. Carpenter Paul Gainford said: ""I'm a bit gutted that it is going back to Homebase. It has got everything here - things that you can't get elsewhere."" Other shoppers agreed that some ranges, such as tools and plants, had improved since the switchover. Ultimately, they were keen for the store to stay open in some form under the new ownership. ""There is not much choice around here so it is important that places like this remain,"" said Wayne Obee, who was buying plants and compost for his garden. Retired banker Neil Rank, 60, was concerned about the impact on workers: ""There seems to be more staff here now it is a Bunnings. But whenever costs are cut, it is staff costs that they look at first.""

"The sending of a private conversation was a rare occurrence, Amazon insisted A couple in Portland, Oregon joked that their Amazon Alexa might be listening in to their private conversations. The joke came to an abrupt end when they discovered a conversation was indeed recorded by Alexa - and then sent to an apparently random person in their contact list. ""Unplug your Alexa devices right now!"" warned the puzzled recipient, according to CBS affiliate station KIRO7,which first reported the story.,external Amazon has an explanation as to what happened. But first, here's how Danielle - who didn't want to share her surname with KIRO7's reporter - described the rather alarming chain of events. It starts with a phone call from a person working for Danielle's husband. ""He proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files of recordings from inside our house,"" Danielle says. ""At first, my husband was, like, 'no you didn't!' And the [recipient of the message] said, 'You sat there talking about hardwood floors.' And we said, 'oh gosh, you really did hear us.'"" Creepy, eh? Today's hardwood floors might be tomorrow's intimate sweet nothings. So I asked Amazon what could possibly have caused this to happen, and here's what a spokesperson said: ""Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like 'Alexa'."" Ok... ""Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a 'send message' request."" Uh-oh... ""At which point, Alexa said out loud 'To whom?' At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list."" Bit of a stretch, but fine... ""Alexa then asked out loud, '[contact name], right?' Alexa then interpreted background conversation as 'right'"" This is getting ridiculous. ""As unlikely as this string of events is..."" You're telling me! ""...we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely."" One option immediately springs to mind. For what it's worth, Danielle told ABC that there were no audible warnings from Alexa that it (she?) was doing anything. And to offer one suggestion - sometimes the voice can be pretty quiet, especially if you're deep in conversation about hardwood floors. It's a reminder of the susceptibility of voice-operated devices, particularly ones that want to be as chummy and personal as Alexa. At leastshe isn't laughing at us anymore.

"The update posted on the Worldchoice Sports website spoke of the firm's ""deep regret"" Hundreds of Liverpool fans have been left stranded after flights to the Champions League final were cancelled. Operator Worldchoice Sports said it could not secure landing slots at Kiev's Boryspil Airport for three planes but it said it has secured an extra last minute three-night trip. Disappointed fans, who had paid up to Â£1,000 each for flights, were frantically trying to make alternative arrangements. Liverpool face Real Madrid on Saturday. Asif Badat, aged 32, from Leeds, is among those who fear being stranded in the UK despite having match tickets. ""As recently as this morning we were being given assurances about our tickets and then suddenly the flights were cancelled,"" he said. ""I'm now considering flying to Romania and driving 10 hours from there."" In its statement, Widnes-based Worldchoice Sports said it would start to issue refunds from Friday. It said passengers would be notified by email. Liverpool FC said about 1,000 fans were involved and believed the issue was caused by a dispute over the size of aircraft. The club said it would work with authorities until all avenues to get fans to the game had been exhausted. Worried Reds fans had shared concerns on Twitter before Worldchoice Sports issued a statement on its website at 15:00 BST on Thursday announcing the cancellations. It said talks with authorities in Kiev, police and UEFA had not been able to find a resolution to a lack of landing slots. The Liverpool squad has arrived in Kiev City mayor Joe Anderson later said he had secured landing slots in Kiev for two planes. Mr Anderson said he negotiated an agreement with Kiev mayor Vitali Klitschko - a former world heavyweight boxing champion - in a series of phone calls. But a second statement from Worldchoice, issued at 20:00 BST, said the additional three-night trip was the the only flight the company was able to secure. ""With deep regret we cannot get a flight on 26 May from Liverpool or Manchester. Unfortunately we cannot put you on any other flights,"" the company said. Joe Anderson said he secured slots at Kiev's Boryspil Airport The mayor tweeted,externalthat he was ""frustrated and angry"" for the fans. ""I can tell you I had six long calls today and sorted out slots for two planes to land. The airline said they could go ahead, so what's happened? Over to you Worldchoice,"" he said. Worldchoice Sports' website said the firm had ""worked extremely hard over the last 48 hours trying to resolve these issues"". ""We have exhausted all avenues to try and get landing slots.

"This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? Tough new data protection laws come into effect on Friday that promise to bolster consumer rights. But there are concerns that many firms have not done enough to prepare for the new rules, known as GDPR. Big fines could be imposed on companies that ""persistently, deliberately or negligently flout the regulations"", the UK's data watchdog says. But it told small businesses there is no need to panic and that it is ""here to help"". TheGeneral Data Protection Regulation,external(GDPR) applies to all organisations that handle European Union citizens' data. The rules give consumers new rights, including rights to find out what data is being held on them, and to delete that information, unless a firm has a good reason to keep it. Companies now have to get consumers' explicit consent to use personal information, unless they have a lawful reason not to, and getting people to give more personal information in exchange for a premium service is not allowed. Firms also have to meet higher standards for keeping data safe. Many have been sending out emails asking people to renew their consent to receive marketing. The new laws will be good for consumers, says Which? Definitely, says the Which? consumer rights group. ""GDPR will strengthen your personal data rights, including the way companies handle your data and redress for misuse of that data,"" says Which? consumer rights expert Adam French. ""Companies will need to tell you exactly what you're signing up for and you will have more control when it comes to opting out of future communications. ""You will also have more opportunities to make a claim for damage caused by the misuse of your data,"" he says. Ailidh Callander, legal officer for campaign group Privacy International, says the new rules have ""been a long time coming"". ""GDPR is an important step in the right direction,"" she says. The penalties for wrongdoing could be quite hefty, especially for big companies. The new rules give the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) powers to fine firms up to â¬20m (Â£17.5m) or 4% of global annual turnover for serious breaches. Many smaller firms may not be prepared for the regulations coming into force, business body the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says. ""GDPR is here and the likelihood is that many of the UK's 5.7 million smaller businesses will not be compliant,"" chairman Mike Cherry said. He says the ""burden and scale"" of the reforms have proven too much to handle for some. And he says many small firms fear the ICO will be heavy handed in dealing with non-compliance, ""slapping"" them with fines. Firms could have to pay hefty fines for not complying with the new rules Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that small businesses which did not make extensive use of customer data would not come under close scrutiny. Instead, the focus would be on big companies - particularly those in the technology sector - that ""deliberately, persistently or negligently misuse data"", she said. While small businesses ""should not panic"" if they suffer a data breach, Ms Denham said there were some basic steps that companies should take to protect data. As well as individuals being able to bring a complaint to the ICO, she said it could take action as it did in the case of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.

"A US court has ordered South Korea's Samsung Electronics pay $539m (Â£403m) in damages for copying features of Apple's original iPhone. The jury's decision is thelatest step in a long-running legal battle between the world's top smartphone makers. It began in 2011 when Apple argued Samsung had infringed on some patents. Apple was awarded $1.05bn in damages a year laterbut the rivals have fought over the final amount ever since. In the latest court ruling, most of the damages payment - $533.3m - was awarded for infringing three Apple design patents. The remainder was for violating two patented functions. In a statement, Apple said it was pleased that the members of the jury ""agree that Samsung should pay for copying our products."" ""This case has always been about more than money,"" the tech giant said, adding that it was important that it continued to protect the ""hard work and innovation of so many people at Apple"". But Samsung said the decision ""flies in the face"" of the unanimous Supreme Court ruling in its favour on the way the design patent damages are calculated. Samsung had argued that it should only have to pay $28m in damages - limiting the sum to profits directly related to the components or features covered by the patents. Apple argued for a much bigger figure, calculated on the profits made from an entire iPhone. ""It is not a clear win for either firm because Apple had asked for $2.5bn in damages in its original claim"", according to Kiranjeet Kaur, tech analyst at research firm IDC in Singapore. And Ms Kaur added that the possibility of another appeal by Samsung ""cannot be eliminated"". ""It is clearly not the verdict Samsung wanted or expected, and apart from the damages it has to pay, it points out that indeed designs were copied,"" she said. She added the ruling should serve as a warning to smaller players to be ""more wary of overstepping [patents], especially in markets like the US"".

"Freeman said making women feel uncomfortable was ""never my intent"" US film star Morgan Freeman has apologised following allegations of sexual misconduct made by eight women and several other people. One production assistantaccused Freeman of harassing her for months during filming of bank robbery comedy Going in Style, CNN reported.,external She said the 80-year-old touched her repeatedly, tried to lift her skirt and asked if she was wearing underwear. Freeman apologised to ""anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected"". ""Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,"" he said in a statement. Making women feel uncomfortable was ""never my intent"", he said. He is the latest well-known Hollywood figure to be accused of sexual misconduct after allegations of sex attacks by producer Harvey Weinstein led to the development of the #MeToo campaign against sexual harassment. What has #MeToo actually changed? Harvey Weinstein's accusers How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded The production assistant was among eight women to tell CNN they had been the victims of harassment. She told CNN that during the harassment another actor, Alan Arkin, ""made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say"". Meanwhile a woman who worked on the 2013 film Now You See Me said staff knew ""not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms"" or any close-fitting clothes if Freeman was around. Morgan is also said to have stared at women's breasts and asked women to twirl for him. CNN also said it had spoken to dozens more people who worked with or for Mr Freeman, some of whom praised Freeman and insisted his behaviour was always professional.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish currency 'entirely credible' An independent Scotland would keep the pound for at least 10 years under proposalsset out by the SNP's Growth Commission,external. The country could potentially then move towards introducing its own currency if six economic tests were met. The commission wasset up two years agoto build a new economic case for independence following the Brexit vote. Opposition parties say the SNP's pursuit of independence is doing nothing for Scotland's economy. The 354-page analysis document - which has been billed as a ""new case for optimism"" - also says attracting more immigrants to Scotland is crucial. Reality Check: Could Scotland keep the pound? Brian Taylor on the significance of the report Our summary of the key points Its aim is to ""restart the debate"" on independence, with the long-awaited report being discussed by special assemblies of SNP members around the country in the run-up to the party's autumn conference. Andrew Wilson handed over the report to SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon earlier this week But the commission also said many of the measures they were calling for could be implemented without independence. And its author, former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, stressed that independence was not a ""magic wand"", but would instead provide a ""toolbox"" that could help to grow the economy. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to set out her thinking on when there might be a second independence referendum in the autumn, once there is more clarity over Brexit. The Scottish government wanted a formal currency union with the rest of the UK if Scotland voted for independence in 2014 The commission says Scotland should keep sterling after independence, with the Bank of England continuing to set interest rates and other monetary policies. But crucially, it says this would be done without a formal currency union between Scotland and the rest of the UK. It also says that a ""future choice to establish a Scottish currency could be considered"" once the economy was ""on track to the sustainable high-performance position our ambitions require"". But the report says that ""unless those tests were met and a decision to change was made, our currency would remain the pound sterling"". Sarah Smith: Money talks when it comes to indyref2 Douglas Fraser: Rebooting Scottish independence Are we on course for indyref2? Mr Wilson told BBC Scotland that sticking with the pound, at least initially, would offer ""stability and certainty, and straight answers to hard questions for people about what happens to their pension or their mortgage"". He added: ""We think the government should be focused on getting the economy growing, setting up the new country, getting the public finances stable and in order from where we inherit them"" rather than on the ""symbol"" of a new currency. The SNP proposal ahead of the last independence referendum was for Scotland to continue using the pound through a formal currency union with the rest of the UK. But the arrangement was ruled out by then-Chancellor George Osborne in a move that was widely seen as being akey factor in Yes losing the vote. At the time, the Treasury's top civil servant, Sir Nicholas Macpherson""strongly"" advised Mr Osborneagainst agreeing to the currency union proposal, which he said would have been ""fraught with difficulty"". But the SNP argues that an independent Scotland would not need the permission of the UK government to continue using sterling. George Osborne ruled out a formal currency union ahead of the 2014 independence referendum How does this get around the fact that if there were to be another independence referendum the UK government would almost certainly rule out, once again, a currency union? Because they are no longer proposing a formal pact, and the UK government cannot stop Scotland simply using the pound. But under those circumstances Scotland would have to accept monetary policy and interest rates set by the Bank of England without any concern for the economic circumstances in Scotland. That doesn't sound like true ""independence"" will come the cry - both from those who oppose independence and from some die hard supporters who would like to see Scotland go the whole hog and create its own currency as a symbol of its new found sovereignty. But the SNP think that's a price worth paying to answer one of the trickiest questions they faced repeatedly in 2014. Read more from Sarah Mr Wilson fears current UK immigration policy could be damaging to Scotland The report includes detailed plans to help fund continuing UK debt to promote ""respect and good order"" towards the rest of the United Kingdom. Historic debts would fall to the rest of the UK - but Scotland would contribute about Â£5bn a year to meet debt commitments and fund international aid. Mr Wilsonstudied 12 successful small countriesaround the world, with Denmark, Finland and New Zealand highlighted as examples to take lessons from. The report sets out details of a ""come to Scotland"" campaign to drive immigration and population growth This would include tax relief for highly skilled migrant workers to attract the ""best and brightest"" talent, measures to encourage international graduates to stay in Scotland, and a new visa system modelled on ""the most efficient and easy to use in the world"". Ruth Davidson questioned whether Scots would be willing to ""gamble their future"" on the proposals Mr Wilson warned of a ""real danger"" that current UK policies could see the working population fall, and said Scotland has a ""great opportunity to strike a completely different tone"". The report also includes policy ideas to grow the economy through greater participation in the labour market and improved productivity. But Mr Wilson said independence ""must never be seen as a magic wand or quick and easy step to success"" and that there was ""no pot of gold, black or otherwise, at the foot of the independence rainbow"". Instead, he said independence would offer a ""toolbox"" that could be used to ""create a stronger economy, sustainable public finances and a fairer society"". Read more about what's in the report here Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said the report ""rightly doesn't shy away from the challenges we face but presents ways in which those challenges can be addressed"". And she said she was ""looking forward to debating the report's recommendations - both within the SNP and with business, trade unions and communities across Scotland."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP plan to retain sterling would leave an independent Scotland using ""the currency of what would then be a foreign country without asking, without their own central bank and without any backstops"". She added that the plans for what would follow sterling were not clear, telling the BBC's World at One: ""I'm not entirely sure that is enough for the people of Scotland to want to gamble their mortgage on, their pensions on, their wages on and their future on."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the report was a ""cuts commission"" rather than a growth commission. He added: ""Proposals to cut Scotland's deficit by almost two thirds over a decade would result in a level of austerity that not even George Osborne attempted"". The pro-independence Scottish Greens said many of those who voted No in 2014 ""will no doubt be open to the case for independence, especially when this report is compared to the bleak, post-Brexit economic analysis papers"". But Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said there was ""nothing hopeful or optimist about inflicting yet more division and economic risk on our country by separating us from the UK"".

"This video can not be played Harvey Weinstein made no comment as he walked into a police station in New York Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has turned himself in to police in New York, where he is expected to face sexual misconduct charges. The charges have not been announced but US media say some may relate to accusations by actress Lucia Evans. Dozens of women have made allegations, including of rape and sexual assault, against the 66 year old. Mr Weinstein has always denied non-consensual sex and this would be the first time he has been charged. Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded The allegations triggered the #MeToo movement which sought to demonstrate and draw attention to the widespread prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Dozens of journalists were at the 1st Precinct police station in Manhattan when Mr Weinstein appeared at about 07:25 local time (11:25 GMT), dressed casually and carrying one book about director Elia Kazan and another about Rodgers and Hammerstein. The charges will stem from an investigation made by a Manhattan grand jury. They have not been made official and the indictment depends on district attorney Cyrus Vance. What is a US grand jury? The New York Times reports that some of the charges relate to an allegation brought by Lucia Evans,external. She detailed her accusations against Mr Weinsteinin an article in the New Yorker in October last year,external. It is not clear if he will face more charges brought by other accusers. Dozens of reporters and photographers covered a case that has worldwide interest It is known that New York police have been investigating allegations of rape made by actress Paz de la Huerta. And this monthNetflix producer Alexandra Canosa filed court papers in New Yorkalleging Mr Weinstein raped, sexually assaulted and verbally abused her over a five-year period. The statute of limitations will be an issue in some cases but it is not thought to apply in the Evans case. Even if the limitations apply, a judge could still call women to testify to establish a pattern of behaviour, as in therecent trial of actor Bill Cosby. Mr Weinstein is expected to have his mugshot and fingerprints taken at the police station. The Times said he would then be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court. The Hollywood mogul has faced accusations of sexual harassment and assault from dozens of women. Some have alleged rape. Who has accused Weinstein of what? Actresses Kate Beckinsale, Lysette Anthony and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the high-profile figures to have spoken out. Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out ActressAshley Judd is suing the 66-year-old Hollywood producer,claiming he damaged her career after she rejected his sexual advances. One of the cases was in New York, where Italian model Ambra Battilana accused Mr Weinstein of groping her in 2015. Investigators decided not to charge him even though there was an audiotape of Mr Weinstein accepting he had touched her breasts and pledging not to do so again. Prosecutors in Los Angeles are reviewing several cases involving accusations against Weinstein after police investigations. London's Metropolitan police are also assessing a sexual abuse allegation against Mr Weinstein. The allegations have left his career in tatters. He was fired last year from his production firm the Weinstein Company, which later filed for bankruptcy. Top industry figures have condemned him and the organisation behind the Oscars expelled him. Some of Mr Weinstein's accusers have spoken out to welcome the impending charges. Actress Rose McGowan wrote that some women had given up hope he would be held accountable. She said: ""Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice."" Italian actress Asia Argento, who alleges Mr Weinstein sexual assaulted her in the 1990s, reflected on the latest news in a simple tweet: Allow Twitter content?

"The Trump-Kim summit isn't happening - but has that only added to the allure of special coins made to commemorate the event? Confusingly, there are in fact two commemorative coins doing the rounds. The focus of most of the attention is the coin created by the White House Communications Agency (WHCA) - it hails the talks between Mr Trump and ""Supreme Leader"" Kim Jong-un. Such coins are often presented to foreign guests and diplomats. The other features silhouettes of Mr Trump, Mr Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in and is available from the White House Gift Shop website. Its popularity appears to be soaring, with demand crashing the site. Reaction: 'A total goat rodeo' Analysing Trump's letter to Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis in 300 words The coin had been offered at a discount price of $19.95 (Â£14.90), down from $24.95, earlier on Thursday, with the gift shop also offering refunds if the summit did not take place. But it said ""most supporters have said they want this heirloom of political history regardless of outcome"". That does seem to be the case. BBC North America Correspondent Anthony Zurcher says the WHCA coin could be the ""1804 Dollar"" of numismatics - referring to a series of coins created for diplomatic gifts in the 1800s that now command ultra-high prices.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""US military is ready if necessary"" US President Donald Trump has cancelled a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, blaming ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" from the North. He said it was possible a meeting could still take place but warned North Korea against committing ""foolish"" acts. The meeting would have discussed ways of denuclearising the Korean peninsula, building on a historic North-South Korea summit in April. The ""unexpected"" decision, Pyongyang said, was ""extremely regrettable"". In a statement released by the North's central news agency, Vice-Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said the country held Mr Trump's efforts to hold a summit ""in high regards"". ""We tell the United States once more that we are open to resolving problems at any time in any way,"" he said. But even before the US president's announcement, doubts had emerged on both sides about whether the talks would take place. Mr Trump's statement marks a fresh twist in the turbulent relationship between him and Mr Kim. Last year saw the two exchange lurid insultsand mutual threats of annihilation. This year though has seen warmer relations. In the build up to the meeting, as a goodwill gesture,North Korea released three Americans it had in prison.. North Korea had also dismantled tunnels at its only nuclear test siteonly hours before Mr Trump's announcement. Decoding Trump's letter to Kim What cancelled summit says about Trump foreign policy 'A total goat rodeo' - Reaction and analysis North Korea crisis in 300 words What does Kim Jong-un really want? Rush to buy Trump-Kim coin after summit cancellation A senior administration official later gave more details about the summit's cancellation, saying North Korea showed ""a profound lack of good faith"" in the run-up to the meeting. There were a series of ""broken promises"" from Pyongyang, the official told reporters, including when the White House sent the deputy chief of staff to Singapore to meet North Korean diplomats ahead of the summit. ""The North Koreans didn't show up. They simply stood us up."" The official also said President Trump had ""dictated every word"" of the letter to Kim Jong-un after talking with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The meeting - in Singapore on 12 June - would have been the first time a sitting US president met a North Korean leader. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent The Trump administration insists that North Korea was not responding sufficiently in the summit preparations, raising doubts that the meeting would be able to achieve a positive outcome. The big question is what happens now? Prior to the thaw in relations between North and South Korea that began the process that led to the summit date, wild rhetoric was being exchanged between Pyongyang and Washington raising serious fears of a renewed conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Will North Korea now resume its long-range ballistic missile testing? Will the war of words be renewed? Or might there be a slim chance of some kind of diplomatic process being maintained? And finally, can relations between North and South Korea be insulated in any way from the growing tensions between Pyongyang and Washington? Mr Trump said he had been ""very much looking forward"" to meeting Mr Kim. ""Sadly, based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement,I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have the long-planned meeting,"" Mr Trump said in a letter to Mr Kim,external. ""You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" he added. But he called the meeting a ""missed opportunity"", saying ""someday, I look very much forward to meeting you"". In a later statement at the White House, Mr Trump said the step was a ""tremendous setback for North Korea and the world"", adding the US military was ""ready if necessary"" to respond to any ""reckless"" act from North Korea. Mr Trump was apparently responding to statements from North Korea attacking his administration and casting doubt over the meeting. Earlier on Thursday, North Korean official Choe Son-hui dismissed remarks by US Vice-President Mike Pence - who had said North Korea ""may end like Libya"" - as ""stupid"". This video can not be played Pompeo - US was ready but North Korea had gone silent on preparations Ms Choe, who has been involved in several diplomatic interactions with the US over the past decade, said the North would not ""beg"" for dialogue and warned of a ""nuclear showdown"" if diplomacy failed. A White House official quoted by Reuters described the comments about Mr Pence as the ""last straw"". They stressed, however, there was a ""backdoor that's open still"". References to Libya have angered North Korea. There, former leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un crossed into South Korea South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was ""very perplexed and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-US summit will not be held"", the Yonhap agency reported. It was South Korean officials who first informed the US thatMr Kim was prepared to discuss potential nuclear disarmament. In April, the leaders of both Koreas had a historic meeting at the border,promising to end hostilities and work towards a denuclearisation of the Korea peninsula. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the US and North Korea should not give up, saying ""nerves of steel"" were required. In the US, Republican Senator Tom Cotton praised President Trump for ""seeing through Kim Jong-un's fraud"". But Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said the move was what happened ""when amateurs are combined with warmongers"".

the size of our nuclear arsenals, the decision to call off the summit was the
necessary result of a poor negotiating strategy in which the President made it
all too clear to North Korea that he needed the summit more than the North

"The Bank of England governor has said a ""disorderly"" Brexit could delay rises in interest rates as the Bank would be obliged to act to shore up the economy. Mark Carney made clear what he described as a ""sharp Brexit"" could mean a reassessment of whether an interest rate rise is imminent. And whatever progress is made towards the ""new trading arrangements"" with the EU, weaker income growth ""is likely to accompany that adjustment"". He was speaking at a London conference. Mr Carney said that the negotiations were entering a ""critical phase"" and the Bank was prepared in case the transition was not ""smooth"". Carney: Brexit has cost households Â£900 Carney: Brexit talks could delay rate rises He said the Bank was ""ready for Brexit whatever form it takes"" and suggested that it might be willing to tolerate higher inflation and retain ultra-low interest rates to support growth and jobs. The Governor also said that weak growth in the first three months of the year may not just be down to the harsh weather. Mr Carney said that recent weak growth may not just be due to the harsh weather of February and March Consumer spending statistics were weaker and the housing market was also showing signs of decline, the Governor argued. Many economists believe a weaker economy would also be likely to head off any plans to increase interest rates. The governor also re-iterated the Bank's analysis that the referendum result had damaged the economy. People's incomes had been squeezed and spending had been cut back, he said, leaving households 4% worse off than the Bank expected before the referendum. Businesses were also investing less than expected. ""As the consequences of sterling's fall showed up in the shops and squeezed their real incomes, [consumers] have cut back spending growth to rates about one half of those pre-referendum,"" he said. Mr Carney argued the fall in the value of sterling happened because ""financial markets are valuing today what they expect tomorrow: a relative fall in real incomes as the UK moves toward its new trading arrangements"". ""Inflation rose well above the 2% target, peaking at 3.1% late last year, an overshoot entirely due to the referendum-induced fall in the exchange rate."" His speech comes two days after telling the Treasury Select Committee that households were Â£900 a year worse off due to the referendum. Those comments brought a sharp response from the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, who said that it was ""absolutely not the case that Brexit has damaged the interests of this country"". Mr Carney made clear that the Bank was preparing for all eventualities. ""A sharper Brexit could put monetary policy on a different path,"" the Governor said. ""For example, if the transition were disorderly, or the end state agreement materially worse than the average potential outcome, then the MPC [the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates] could once again be confronted by a trade-off between the speed with which it returns inflation to target and the support policy provides to jobs and activity. ""On this path, the MPC can be expected to set policy to manage any trade-off using the framework it applied following the referendum."" After the referendum result the Bank cut interest rates and increased the amount of financial stimulus it provided to businesses. Senior sources have made clear that while interest rates cuts are not at present on the agenda, the speed with which any interest rate rises are brought in could be slowed if the negotiations with the EU do not progress as hoped. The same sources also said that the Bank was ready for any eventuality and did not believe that a ""sharp Brexit"" was the most likely outcome. Progress via an implementation period was still probable and if it was agreed that could lead to a sharp pick up business confidence, for example.
