"Busy airports have become a familiar sight this year. The summer tourist season is under way, with some people travelling abroad for the first time since the Covid pandemic. But what is causing chaos at some UK airports? BBC News has spoken to a number of airline workers anonymously over the last few weeks. We got the inside story from front-line staff, including pilots, baggage handlers and cabin crew. Here's what they had to say about what's going on behind the scenes and how the airport and airlines have responded to them. A British Airways cabin crew member based at Heathrow Airport told the BBC that most long-haul flights are operating short of crew, which has a knock-on effect on staff tiredness. Though flights are still crewed above the legal minimums, he said the company was ""recruiting like mad to fill the gaps"". This can be a lengthy process, with delays to processing airside passes slowing things down. ""Whether it's us, or baggage handlers, we have to go through so much security checking in advance of employment. The system is way too slow."" He said team morale was a ""mixed bag"", with most happy to be flying with customers again. However, he described the negative feeling that sets in for cabin crew, as the plane descends into Heathrow. ""You used to land and think '30 minutes later I'll be on the way home'. Now, it's 'how long will this go on for?'."" He says that a shortage of airport workers and cleaners is behind delays in getting passengers and crew off the plane, includingpeople who use wheelchairs. ""None of us feel we can walk off the plane and leave people. It's a huge security risk. I'm sick to death with delays to that sort of thing."" British Airways told BBC News: ""We're grateful for the hard work of our colleagues whose wellbeing is extremely important to us and we are doing everything we can to support them during this busy time, while still providing the best service to our customers."" Throughout the summer, pictures of baggage piled up at airports has become a common sight. Another senior cabin crew member at a major airline operating out of Heathrow said pressure on staff to redress the backlogs made things worse. ""Stress is leading to a high sickness rate and absenteeism. Stand-by cover has been reduced, which can lead to flight cancellations, even a couple of hours before a plane is due to depart. ""We're flying our socks off to the legal minimums and maximums, and so many of the staff are new that it's much harder. We have to do half their jobs and it's not what they were expecting, so they often just leave. ""Customers are so rude and that can be a lot to take when it's someone's first real job."" A ground baggage handler, who has worked at Heathrow for 12 years, described the situation as ""a shambles"". ""Imagine a duck paddling on water; it's manic,"" he told the BBC. ""There are not enough baggage belts for the amount of flights. You could be waiting half an hour for a belt when a flight comes in. Within that half an hour, another flight will come in, which makes it 10 times worse. It's disheartening when you walk out and see all the passengers."" In more than a decade of ground handling, he says he has never seen things this bad, including whenash from an Icelandic volcanogrounded planes in 2011. He feels the problems stem from a lack of investment - on top of recruitment problems - and added that some baggage is sorted on a system that is about 40 years old. ""This is like a really bad snow day, but three months of it,"" he says. ""The school holidays will be worse. I'm petrified to go on holiday. I would not want to be transferring now - the chances of your bag making it are very slim."" A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport said: ""We recognise that the baggage system in T2 is old - that's why we want to replace it and have urged the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] to allow us to invest in a new system as part of the next regulatory settlement. ""There is no shortage of airport workers - all parts of the airport are operational and we have the same capacity in security as summer 2019. ""We aren't responsible for airline ground handlers or air crew - both work directly for airlines."" The summer holidays will be a key test for an industry scarred by the impact of Covid. To try to better match demand to available resources, schedules and ambitions have been trimmed - in some cases, slashed - and some airports have placed limits on flight or passenger numbers. The calculation is that this sort of advance disruption is better than last-minute, on-the-day delays and cancellations. Will it be enough to ensure things do go smoothly? Some businesses appear to have done much better than others on the staffing front, and some airlines have made far fewer cancellations than others. Airports say they have recruited hundreds of new security officers. But aviation is a complex ecosystem, involving many different teams - and businesses. There are still some staffing weak spots, for example among ground handlers. Generally, firms say they have done what they can to minimise the chances of further disruption and delays, and they are focused on getting people away for their long-awaited holidays. But no-one can promise a completely hitch-free summer. Airport staff have told BBC News that they believe there has been a lack of forward planning ahead of the summer holidays. ""This year airports are more chaotic than usual,"" according to a pilot, who has worked for Virgin Atlantic for decades. He said staff have their own security queues which have been longer than normal and presumes that is because there are fewer staff. He added that passenger queues have been longer this summer, with some people even queueing outside. ""Passengers seem to realise the stress the industry is suffering. I was called out from stand-by to take a flight for which we had no captain. Passengers had been waiting for an hour or so past the departure time at the gate. I got a round of applause and high-fived."" He said cabin crew are telling him that passengers are in good spirits once they are under way but staff themselves are stressed. Cabin crew are working at or near minimum cabin manning levels with pilots experiencing fatigue. ""I feel the company has adopted a hostile working culture,"" he said. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: ""Due to airside ID referencing delays for new crew members, we've recently operated some flights with fewer cabin crew than would typically be on board. ""The crew complement on all flights fully adheres to the strict safety regulations stipulated by the CAA. ""We recognise the challenges that Heathrow Airport and the wider aviation ecosystem faces this summer and apologise to any of our customers who have been affected by longer wait times or sticking points in their journey."" Another pilot, who is taking a break from the industry, told us: ""My experience of the aviation industry is of a gradual decline, with periods of chaos due to that decline and not being prepared."" He added that the current problems are effects of decisions made since the start of the Covid pandemic, with no thought of the increased demand for travel afterwards. However, his biggest criticism lies with the drive for low prices and big profits where ""everything gets cut to the bone and during unusual times it will mean system breakdown"".

"Sebastian Kalinowski, 15, came from Poland to stay with his mother in October 2020 A mother and her partner have been found guilty of the murder of her 15-year-old son. Agnieszka Kalinowska, 35, and Andrzej Latoszewski, 38, tortured Sebastian Kalinowski for months before he died in Huddersfield in August. Sebastian was beaten with a bed slat, whipped with an extension cable and stabbed with a needle, jurors heard. The couple had denied murder but were found guilty after a six-week trial at Leeds Crown Court. Sebastian died in hospital on 13 August of an infection caused by ""untreated complications of multiple rib fractures"", after weeks of what prosecutors described as ""cruel assaults and abuse"". Agnieszka Kalinowska and Andrzej Latoszewski are due to be sentenced in October The teenager arrived in the UK from Poland in October 2020 to live with his mother and her long-term partner, the court heard. However, the arrangement quickly turned sour, with one family friend telling jurors they believed the couple came to view him as a ""hindrance"". Over the following months Sebastian was repeatedly beaten by the couple and subjected to cruel and humiliating punishments. In text messages between the partners, they described their own actions as ""torture"". Footage from a CCTV system installed by Latoszewski to spy on Sebastian captured the abuse. In one 30-minute clip played to the jury he could be seen hitting the boy more than 100 times, pausing at one stage to wipe the sweat from his face, while Kalinowska watched TV and ate toast. On the day before Sebastian's death, Latoszewski was seen on CCTV forcing food and drink into the boy's mouth and stabbing him with a needle in the groin and thigh. Prosecutors said he was ""apparently laughing whilst he did so"" before Kalinowska took over stabbing her son. How killer couple were caught by their own CCTV Agnieszka Kalinowska and Andrzej Latoszewski were convicted after a trial at Leeds Crown Court Sebastian was also verbally abused by the couple and ordered to address Latozsewski as Mr or Sir. On the day the boy died Latoszewski waited more than two hours after finding him unconscious before calling for an ambulance. He later claimed Sebastian had drowned in the bath and that his injuries had been the result of a fall from a tree or a fight. The jury took just three hours and 39 minutes before returning unanimous verdicts against both defendants. After the verdicts were delivered Kalinowska began crying in the dock. Daniel Lee from the Crown Prosecution Service said it was ""impossible to contemplate the agony and fear this young boy experienced, inflicted in his own home, byÂ his supposed care-givers"". Sebastian was due to start his final year at school when he was killed Adjourning sentencing until October at the earliest, Mrs Justice Lambert paid tribute to the jury's ""truly extraordinary"" dedication. She told them: ""You have had to endure quite horrifying footage of Sebastian suffering great pain over a long period of time and then his death. ""You have gone beyond the call of duty. Therefore, I take this step of discharging you from all jury service in the future."" Det Ch Insp Tony Nicholson, who led the investigation, said the jury had sat through ""very harrowing evidence in what has been a lengthy and difficult court process"". ""Detectives and partners in the CPS firmly believe that the charge of murder truly reflected the physical abuse Latoszewski and Kalinowska inflicted on Sebastian, and we are pleased they have been found guilty of this offence,"" he said. ""We await their sentencing and our thoughts are with Sebastian's relatives in Poland."" Sebastian's headteacher Andrew Fell, of North Huddersfield Trust School (NHTS), said the teenager would ""be remembered for his charming smile, his sharp sense of humour and his kindness"". He said: ""Sebastian was happy at NHTS. ""His spoken English improved significantly, helping him blossom from an initially shy student into one with much more confidence and a strong circle of friends."" Tracy Brabin, mayor of West Yorkshire, welcomed the verdict and said it was a ""deeply upsetting and truly shocking"" case of abuse. ""I will never understand how someone could treat any child, let alone their own, with such abhorrent cruelty and contempt,"" she added. Helen Westerman, from the NSPCC, said Sebastian's mother and her partner were the ""very people who should have been nurturing him"". ""People will be asking how any child in our society could suffer such an appalling campaign of abuse without anyone intervening. ""That is why it is so important that no stone is left unturned in the review looking into the circumstances around his death,"" she said. A spokesperson for Kirklees Safeguarding Children Partnership said a review of the case had been commissioned, adding that ""the outcome will be published in as timely a manner as possible"".

"Annie McCormack (far left) and some of the other volunteers outside the small church hall where Broke Not Broken is based UK food banks have seen a rise in demand since the start of the year coupled with a drop in food donations, Radio 4's Money Box research suggests. More than 100 organisations that run 203 food banks from the anti-poverty campaign group Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) were contacted. Almost all said more people were coming to them for help, while more than half reported fewer food donations. Organisers said the trend was ""unsustainable"". They also said they're supporting more clients for longer and helping more elderly people than ever before. Annie McCormack, chair of theBroke Not Broken,externalfood bank in Kinross, said there was no such thing as a typical food bank user. ""When you talk about poverty there's a Dickensian kind of picture that comes into your head and that's not the modern day poverty,"" she said. ""We live in a rural area - [poverty] is people who can't afford transport to go to look for different kinds of employment, or different kinds of education after school,"" she added. ""We see young mums, older people, people with disabilities, lots of people with mental health problems, a lot of which stem from being in poverty."" Like most of the food banks Money Box contacted, Annie's Broke Not Broken is facing a sharp increase in demand. In May 2021 it handed out 80 food parcels. In May 2022 it handed out 183. Annie also said the period of time that they're helping clients for has lengthened. ""Back in the day, pre-Covid times, generally it would be people who were needing an emergency parcel for something that had gone wrong and an unexpected expense, maybe a relationship breakdown, or losing their job. ""They would need help for a short amount of time to get back on their feet,"" she said. ""Now it's a completely different story. ""We're seeing people being referred for months upon months upon months at a time. Repeat referrals coming back, because their financial situations aren't getting better... no matter if they're in work, they just don't have enough income to afford food and gas and electric and rent. Everything's increasing except their income."" Stock controller Susan is one of several dozen volunteers who give up their time to help Broke Not Broken IFAN, a registered charity and anti-poverty campaign group, helps operate food banks, which tend to be run by volunteers across local communities. Research by Money Box, which took place in June, heard from 116 out of 505 IFAN food bank organisations, from all parts of the UK. Of these, 111 said they had seen an increase in users since the start of this year. The figures also showed 69 organisations - just under two-thirds - saw a fall in food donations, and for some this came alongside a decrease in funding. One of the people Broke Not Broken helps, who we're going to call Amy, described the service it provides as a ""life-saver"". ""It's unbelievable [the help I get],"" said Amy. ""That small parcel can help feed me for two weeks."" ""If Broke Not Broken had not been on the doorstep I don't know what I would've done. They've been a life-saver for a lot of people in Milnathort and Kinross."" Food parcels from Broke Not Broken food bank in Kinross will help feed a household for a week - this is what's given out to help a single adult Volunteers at Broke Not Broken also said they're helping support a growing number of people who are in work. One delivery Money Box joined was to a family where both parents were in work but could not afford to put enough food on the table for themselves and their children, along with covering other bills such as housing costs and energy. The total number of food banks across the UK is unknown. But the Trussell Trust, which has its own network of more than 1,400 food banks, recently reportedgiving out more than 2.1 million food parcels in the year to March 2022. This was a fall on the number of parcels it gave out in the previous year during the coronavirus pandemic, at 2.5 million, but was about 250,000 more than the year to March 2020. A smaller number of IFAN organisations, 73, reported an estimated 50,000 people used its 136 food banks in May 2022, more than double the number seen in May 2019. IFAN attributes the surge in parcels handed out in May 2020 to more people needing help during the first coronavirus lockdown. The UK government has announced a Â£15bn support package to help people afford rising energy bills - a key driver of the cost of living crisis. Much of the funding will be targeted at eight million of the lowest income households. The Scottish government told Money Box it shares the same vision as food bank operators - that they are not a long term solution to poverty. A spokesperson said it takes a ""human rights approach on the issue of food insecurity"" and it will publish a plan in the autumn aimed at ending the need for food banks. The Welsh government said it recognises the valuable contribution that food banks make in supporting vulnerable families and has allocated Â£14.8m since 2019 to support an increasing number of families facing food poverty. The Northern Ireland executive meanwhile, said in a statement to Money Box it's piloting a social supermarket scheme which offers access to food alongside wraparound support including help dealing with debt and benefits advice as an alternative to food banks.

"Thirty years ago, a bold plan was cooked up to spread doubt and persuade the public that climate change was not a problem. The little-known meeting - between some of America's biggest industrial players and a PR genius - forged a devastatingly successful strategy that endured for years, and the consequences of which are all around us. On an early autumn day in 1992, E Bruce Harrison, a man widely acknowledged as the father of environmental PR, stood up in a room full of business leaders and delivered a pitch like no other. At stake was a contract worth half a million dollars a year - about Â£850,000 in today's money. The prospective client, the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) - which represented the oil, coal, auto, utilities, steel, and rail industries - was looking for a communications partner to change the narrative on climate change. Don Rheem and Terry Yosie, two of Harrison's team present that day, are sharing their stories for the first time. ""Everybody wanted to get the Global Climate Coalition account,"" says Rheem, ""and there I was, smack in the middle of it."" The GCC had been conceived only three years earlier, as a forum for members to exchange information and lobby policy makers against action to limit fossil fuel emissions. Though scientists were making rapid progress in understanding climate change, and it was growing in salience as a political issue, in its first years the Coalition saw little cause for alarm. President George HW Bush was a former oilman, and as a senior lobbyist told the BBC in 1990, his message on climate was the GCC's message. There would be no mandatory fossil fuel reductions. But all that changed in 1992. In June, the international community created a framework for climate action, and November's presidential election brought committed environmentalist Al Gore into the White House as vice-president. It was clear the new administration would try to regulate fossil fuels. The Coalition recognised that it needed strategic communications help and put out a bid for a public relations contractor. E Bruce Harrison was known as the âDean of green PRâ Though few outside the PR industry might have heard of E Bruce Harrison or the eponymous company he had run since 1973, he had a string of campaigns for some of the US's biggest polluters under his belt. He had worked for the chemical industry discrediting research on the toxicity of pesticides; for the tobacco industry, and had recently run a campaign against tougher emissions standards for the big car makers. Harrison had built a firm that was considered one of the very best. Media historian Melissa Aronczyk, who interviewed Harrison before he died in 2021, says he was a strategic linchpin for his clients, ensuring everyone was on the same page. ""He was a master at what he did,"" she says. Big Oil v the World Drawing on thousands of newly discovered documents, this three-part film charts how the oil industry mounted a campaign to sow doubt about the science of climate change, the consequences of which we are living through today. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Before the pitch, Harrison had assembled a team of both seasoned PR professionals and almost total novices. Among them was Don Rheem, who had no industry credentials. He had studied ecology before becoming an environmental journalist. A chance meeting with Harrison, who must have seen the strategic value of adding Rheem's environmental and media connections to the team, led to a job offer on the GCC pitch. ""I thought, 'Wow, this is an opportunity to get a front row seat at probably one of the most pressing science policy and public policy issues that we were facing.' ""It just felt enormously important,"" Rheem says. Don Rheem as a younger man Terry Yosie - who had recently been recruited from the American Petroleum Institute, becoming a senior vice-president at the firm - remembers that Harrison began the pitch by reminding his audience that he was instrumental in fighting the auto reforms. He had done so, in part, by reframing the issue. The same tactics would now help beat climate regulation. They would persuade people that the scientific facts weren't settled, and that alongside the environment, policy makers needed to consider how action on climate change would - in the GCC's view - negatively affect American jobs, trade and prices. The strategy would be implemented through an extensive media campaign, everything from placing quotes and pitching opinion pieces (so-called op-eds), to direct contacts with journalists. An extract from a GCC business card for reporters, shared by former journalist Nicky Sundt ""A lot of reporters were assigned to write stories,"" Rheem says, ""and they were struggling with the complexity of the issue. So I would write backgrounders so reporters could read them and get up to speed."" Uncertainty ran through the full gamut of the GCC's publications, a creative array of letters, glossy brochures, and monthly newsletters. Rheem and the team were prolific - within a year, Harrison's firm claimed to have secured more than 500 specific mentions in the media. An extract from a 1994/5 GCC booklet made by E Bruce Harrison's team, from the collection of Nicky Sundt In August 1993, Harrison took stock of progress in another meeting with the GCC. ""The rising awareness of the scientific uncertainty has caused some in Congress to pause on advocating new initiatives,"" declared an updated internal strategy pitch, shared with the BBC by Terry Yosie. ""Activists sounding the alarm over 'global warming' have publicly conceded that they lost ground in the communications arena over the past year."" Now, Harrison counselled, they needed to expand the external voices making their case. ""Scientists, economists, academics and other noted experts carry greater credibility with the media and general public than industry representatives."" Harrison was ""a master at what he did,"" says historian Melissa Aronczyk, who shared this undated advert with the BBC While most climate scientists agreed that human-caused climate change was a real issue that would require action, a small group argued there was no cause for alarm. The plan was to pay these sceptics to give speeches or write op-eds - about $1,500 (Â£1,250) per article - and to arrange media tours so they could appear on local TV and radio stations. ""My role was to identify the voices that were not in the mainstream and to give those voices a stage,"" Rheem says. ""There was a lot we didn't know at the time. And part of my role was to highlight what we didn't know."" He says the media was hungry for these perspectives. ""Journalists were actually actively looking for the contrarians. It was really feeding an appetite that was already there."" Many of these sceptics or deniers have rejected the idea that funding from the GCC and other industry groups had any impact on their views. But the scientists and environmentalists tasked with repudiating them - arguing the reality of climate change - encountered a well-organised and effective campaign they found hard to match. ""The Global Climate Coalition is seeding doubt everywhere, fogging the airâ¦ And environmentalists really don't know what's hitting them,"" environmental campaigner John Passacantando remembers. ""What the geniuses of the PR firms who work for these big fossil fuel companies know is that truth has nothing to do with who wins the argument. If you say something enough times, people will begin to believe it."" Harrison's company paid experts to argue that mainstream climate scientists were overstating the problem In a document dating from around 1995, shared with the BBC by Melissa Aronczyk, Harrison wrote that the ""GCC has successfully turned the tide on press coverage of global climate change science, effectively countering the eco-catastrophe message and asserting the lack of scientific consensus on global warming."" The groundwork had been laid for the industry's biggest campaign to date - opposing international efforts to negotiate emissions reductions at Kyoto, in Japan, in December 1997. By then, a consensus had emerged among scientists that human-caused warming was now detectable. But the US public was still showing signs of doubt. As many as 44% of respondents to a Gallup poll believed scientists were divided. Public antipathy made it harder for politicians to fight for action, and America never implemented the agreement reached in Kyoto. It was a major victory for the industry coalition. ""I think E Bruce Harrison was proud of the work he did. He knew how central he had been to moving the needle on how companies intervened in the conversation about global warming,"" says Aronczyk. The same year as the Kyoto negotiation, Harrison sold his firm. Rheem decided that public relations wasn't the right career, while Yosie had long since moved on to other environmental projects for the firm. Meanwhile, the GCC began to disintegrate, as some members grew uncomfortable with its hard line. But the tactics, the playbook, and the message of doubt were now embedded and would outlive their creators. Three decades on, the consequences are all around us. ""I think it's the moral equivalent of a war crime,"" says former US Vice-President Al Gore of the big oil companies' efforts to block action. ""I think it is, in many ways, the most serious crime of the post-World War Two era, anywhere in the world. The consequences of what they've done are just almost unimaginable."" Don Rheem is now a workplace and leadership consultant ""Would I do anything differently? It's a hard question to answer,"" reflects Don Rheem, who says he was ""way down the totem pole"" of the GCC's operation. ""There's some sadness that not much has happened."" He maintains that climate science was too uncertain in the 1990s to warrant ""drastic actions"", and that developing countries - particularly China and Russia - have ultimately been responsible for the decades of climate inaction, rather than American industry. ""I think it's really easy to create a conspiracy theory about really pernicious intent of industry to completely halt any progress,"" Rheem says. ""Personally, I didn't see that. ""I was very young. I was very curious... Knowing what I know today, would I have done some things differently then? ""Perhaps, probably."" How do we know climate change is caused by humans?

"Helen and Lee Kuchczynski have bought their first home after winning Â£3.6m on the EuroMillions A couple who won Â£3.6m on the lottery said their first purchase was a Â£17 backscratcher. Lee Kuchczynski, 52, a HGV driver from Kendal, was at work when wife Helen, 58, rang to tell him they had won on the EuroMillions draw on 12 July. Asked about his first purchase, he said: ""I bought a new backscratcher because I snapped my other so I bought one worth Â£17 instead of Â£8."" Since then the couple have also splashed out on a new home and a car. Helen said she was at home with their 21-year-old daughter when she got an email to tell her of the win, but initially she thought the message might have been a scam. But after calling the National Lottery to check, she passed on the good news to her husband. Mr Kuchczynski said: ""She goes 'are you sat down?'. ""Well, obviously, I'm driving, so I pulled into a layby and she says 'we've won the lottery'."" After passing on the news, Mrs Kuchczynski, a financial administrator for a charity, still logged on to her laptop and started work.

"A strike by more than 40,000 rail workers will go ahead next Wednesday after no breakthrough in talks, the RMT trade union has said. The walkout by staff at Network Rail and 14 train operating companies is part of a continuing row over pay, jobs, and terms and conditions. The strike will affect theWomen's Euro 2022semi-final in Milton Keynes. It follows a similar strike in June that saw rail services severely disrupted across three days. The fresh walkout on 27 July will coincide with a strike at Avanti West Coast, which serves the Birmingham line, the day before the Commonwealth Games begin in the city. Transport for London (TfL) said it expected disruption across lines and stations that share infrastructure with Network Rail. The strikes look set to kick off a week of pain for travellers, with knock-on effects expected into Thursday 28 July and a separate walkout by train drivers at eight operators on Saturday 30 July. When are the next train strikes? RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said its members were ""more determined than ever to secure a decent pay rise, job security and good working conditions"". He said Network Rail - the government-owned agency that maintains tracks and operates big stations - had not improved its pay offer. ""In fact Network Rail have upped the ante, threatening to impose compulsory redundancies and unsafe 50% cuts to maintenance work if we did not withdraw our planned strike action,"" he claimed. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said that despite its ""best efforts to find a breakthrough, I'm afraid there will be more disruption for passengers next week"" and accused the RMT of political campaigning. He added: ""It is frustrating to yet again ask our passengers to change their plans and only make essential journeys."" Thousands of workers walked out on three days in June, causing severe disruption to millions of passengers. As well as the two further days of action scheduled in July, the RMT is planning to strike again on 18 and 20 August if differences haven't been resolved. The dispute centres around whether workers, including guards, signallers, catering staff and cleaners, will receive pay rises to keep up with the sharply rising cost of living. But the railway workers' union has also highlighted proposed changes to pension schemes, working practices, and what it says is insufficient general funding for the transport system. During the pandemic many workers adapted to working from home for at least part of their working week, reducing demand for rail services. The rail industry says working practices need to be updated to save money in the light of these new habits. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's lead negotiator, said the RMT had walked away from ""ongoing and constructive talks"". ""A two-year, 8% deal with a no-compulsory-redundancy guarantee and other benefits and extras was on the table and they have walked away without giving their members a voice or a choice,"" he said. Network Rail's pay deal would be funded through productivity gains with a 4% pay rise in the first year backdated to January and a further 4% in the second year if modernisation reforms targets are met. A Department for Transport spokesperson said it was now ""clearer than ever that the RMT has no interest in engaging in constructive discussions"". ""The rail industry has to modernise and be brought into the 21st century for the benefit of passengers and staff. We're extremely disappointed to see that instead of staying at the table, RMT executives have chosen to walk away once more,"" the DfT spokesperson said. The RMT's Mick Lynch said the government needed to ""stop interfering"" and that RMT would ""continue to negotiate in good faith but we will not be bullied or cajoled by anyone"".

"Claire Foy received more than 1,000 emails from Jason Penrose in a month, the court heard Actor Claire Foy's ""delusional"" stalker has been ordered to stay away from her for five years after sending her thousands of emails. Ms Foy, 38, who starred in Netflix's The Crown, was targeted by Jason Penrose, 39, in November and December. Penrose also knocked on the Wolf Hall actor's door on one occasion. A full stalking protection order (SPO) was granted at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. Penrose, who gave his address as Highgate Mental Health Centre, was accompanied by NHS workers during the hearing. At the hearing, District Judge Michael Oliver said: ""I am sure based on the evidence Mr Penrose has carried out acts associated with stalking."" Claire Foy faced 'significant risk' from stalker He went on: ""Thousands of emails were sent to Ms Foy and on one occasion he attended her address."" Judge Oliver added: ""I am satisfied this order is necessary, this was sustained and repeated conduct due to a delusional belief Mr Penrose had about Ms Foy."" He said the actor was ""entitled to protection from further acts of stalking"". It was heard that Penrose has been ""deemed fit for release"" from the mental health centre. Police can apply at the magistrates' court for a civil SPO to block alleged stalkers from contacting or approaching their alleged victims while a criminal investigation into their behaviour continues. Claire Foy won numerous awards for her role as the Queen in The Crown Penrose sent an email to Ms Foy's agent saying he was a film director and producer and wanted her to appear in his next film. Ms Foy told her agent she did not know who he was and, from 2 November to mid-December, he sent more than 1,000 emails, contacted her sister and went to the actor's home, the court heard. Judge Oliver also said that after an interim SPO was granted in February Penrose sent a letter and parcel later that month, breaching the restrictions. The five-year order prohibits Penrose from directly or indirectly contacting Ms Foy. There is also an exclusion zone covering all but five districts in the London borough of Camden.

"Doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales are being offered a pay rise of between 4% and 5.5% A nursing union is to ballot members on possible industrial action after most NHS workers in Wales were offered a below-inflation pay rise. Doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales are being offered between 4% and 5.5%, the Welsh government said. Other NHS workers, including cleaners and porters, will get an average of 7.5%, it said. The pay rises are below the9.4% rate of inflation. The offer includes a real living wagepay rise announced in April,external. ""Nurses will be outraged to hear the pay award is well below inflation yet again,"" said Helen Whyley, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales. Ms Whyley said RCN Wales would ballot members on whether to take industrial action, which she said was ""something that the college has never done before"". She also warned the pay offer would ""do nothing"" to fill nursing vacancies in Wales or inspire young people to become nurses. How does public sector pay get sorted in Wales? Millions of workers get below-inflation pay rises Teachers, police officers, nurses: Who's getting what? The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, said it was ""shameful"" the Welsh government did not revisit the 2021 multi-year contract agreed with some specialist doctors. ""It is nothing short of a kick in the teeth for hard-working doctors in Wales,"" said BMA Wales council chairman Dr David Bailey. Other NHS workers, including nurses, cleaners and porters, will receive an extra Â£1,400 The health minister said this equated to an average pay rise of 7.5% for the lowest paid staff compared to the last financial year. But for nurses, who are in higher pay bands, this would equate to a pay rise of between 4% and 5.5%. Health Minister Eluned Morgan says the lowest paid NHS workers will see the 'biggest uplift in their pay' ""This pitiful and insulting pay announcement does not even come close to making up for the fall in the value of nursing pay, compared with a decade ago,"" Ms Whyley added. But the health minister, Eluned Morgan, said the offer ""goes some way"" to recognising the ""hard work"" of NHS staff. The very lowest paid will see an uplift of 10.8%, which the Welsh government claims is the most generous deal of any UK nation. ""We are all facing a cost of living crisis,"" Ms Morgan said. ""We have structured this pay award so the lowest paid staff in the NHS would see the biggest uplift."" Unions say the pay offer was in fact a pay cut after staff had gone ""above and beyond"" during the pandemic But Dr Bailey said the offer amounted to ""nothing more than a pay cut"" at a time when doctors had worked ""above and beyond"" during the pandemic and now faced under-staffing and under-funding. Instead of a pay rise to their salary, some specialist doctors will receive a one-off payment of Â£1,400. The union was also aggrieved the highest-paid doctors on older contracts will only receive a one-off payment equivalent to 4.5%, rather than a salary uplift. Midwives and maternity support workers were awarded Â£1,400, which will mean a 4% pay increase for most. Members will be ""disappointed and angered"", the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said, explaining the uplift will not be enough to ""cope with the rising cost of living"". ""We are disappointed they have not listened to our warnings of the consequences of a below inflation pay rise,"" said Vicky Richards from the RCM in Wales. Nurses in England also got a lower than inflation pay offer this week Earlier this week the UK government agreed with the pay recommendations for the NHS in England. The UK government said it planned to fund pay rises in England from existing budgets, which means the Welsh government would not receive extra funding and will have to find the cash from elsewhere. Ms Morgan said that without additional funding from the UK government, ""there are inevitably limits to how far we can go in Wales"". In a previous response to the criticism, the UK government said the Welsh government has had more funding than at any time since devolution began. Inflation currently stands at 9.4% in the UK and is predicted to reach 11% by the autumn. The NHS in Wales employs nearly 90,000 people. The offer comes after abelow-inflation pay rise for Welsh teacherstriggered complaints from trade unions. Plaid Cymru said the below-inflation pay rise was a ""bitter blow"" for healthcare workers, particularly after ""unprecedented"" challenges in recent years. Its health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said the pay award was a ""significant pay cut"" in real terms. He added: ""In addition to ensuring that salaries catch-up with today's living costs, there also needed to be an uplift to make up for a decade and more of cuts. ""The Welsh government have failed to do that in recent years and now, as the cost-of-living soars, it is our front-line workers who are bearing the brunt. "" The Welsh Conservatives said the Welsh government should spend the money it receives from the UK government more wisely. The party's finance spokesman, Peter Fox, said: ""Whilst I welcome that NHS pay is being increased in line with the recommendations from the independent panel, the Labour government has been guaranteed an additional Â£2.5bn a year in their budgets. ""It's a shame that the Welsh government are choosing the wrong priorities such as wasting money on buying up farms, more politicians or stifling the Welsh economy with their road building freeze, instead of supporting our Welsh NHS.""

"Ukrainian farmers load barley grain during a harvest in Odesa Russia's invasion has forced Ukraine to reroute its grain exports, as its six major Black Sea ports remain under a blockade. The standoff has left millions at increased risk of starvation. A deal is being discussed to allow the resumption of exports but it may take months until the ports re-open. The BBC's Nick Thorpe has seen the bottlenecks in Hungary and Romania. ""You have to understand this as a logistical chain, and there are so many weak links,"" says Capt Botond Szalma. In his office in Budapest, a chart of the Black Sea, the Danube river, and the whole eastern flank of Europe, from Poland to Turkey, is spread out on the table. He is a third-generation ship's captain; his grandfather and father both moved grain on the Danube. ""We're trying to catch up on 30 years of disastrous neglect of the rail infrastructure in the whole region, including Hungary,"" says Capt Szalma, who is also executive vice-president of the Federation of National Associations of Ship Brokers and Agents (Fonasba). These problems, from lack of storage to inadequate transport, are now being felt as the Russian blockade continues. Ukraine is one of the world's largest grain producers. Since Russia invaded the country in February, new ways had to be found for Ukraine to export 20m tonnes of wheat left from the 2021 harvest, and the expected 60m tonnes of this year's harvest. ""We're trying to catch up on 30 years of disastrous neglect of the rail infrastructure,"" Botond Szalma says There are 12 rail crossings for goods trains between Ukraine and its five western neighbours - Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. The first logistical nightmare is shifting wagons or their loads from broad gauge tracks - 1,524mm wide, in use in the former Soviet Union - to narrower European gauge - 1,432mm wide. Dilapidated tracks, and a shortage of wagons, cranes, conveyor belts, and trained personnel make up the picture. The many resulting trickles now add up to a flow, but experts say it will only be enough to export one third, at best, of Ukrainian food to the world, something that has threatened to push millions of people into food insecurity. A cloud of corn dust envelops the wagons, workers, and a lone sunflower by the track in a fine film of white powder at Eperjeske, close to Zahony on the Hungary-Ukrainian border. A 30 wagon block train from Ukraine edges forward. Each wagon contains 70 tonnes of Ukrainian corn, bound for farmers in Italy, to feed their cows. After quality inspection, the wagons jettison their loads, one by one, into a cavity under the track. It is then taken up by conveyor belt, to pour into Hungarian wagons on a parallel track. The whole process takes several hours. There is only capacity here for four trains a day, to cross the railway bridge and return for more. Yet the quantity being moved is already ten times more than the pre-war period. ""We have 3,500 clients who have a lot of grain for export,"" says Denys Mararenko of the Ukrainian Agrosem trading company, overseeing the trans-shipment. ""There are a lot of bottlenecks during loadingâ¦ we're trying to set up one big supply chain. We have no other option."" He thanks the Hungarians, for getting this much out. At the Comvex terminal of the big deep-sea port at Constanta in Romania, barley from Serbia and Romania funnels down into the bowels of the Pretty Sight, a 30,000 tonne ship registered in the Marshall Islands. In 24 hours, 17,000 tonnes, about half the ships' capacity, will be loaded, bound for Tunisia. Chaff from the grain blows everywhere, like a summer snowstorm. The docks here work round the clock, channelling grain, not just from Ukraine, but from all over Central Europe. Constanta is the biggest port on the whole Black Sea, shipping 65m tonnes a year, double the volume even of Odesa. The problem here is that the port was developed for the past decade as the main outlet for Romanian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Hungarian and Slovak grain, to world markets. They are now competing for space in the dock area, even as Romanian and EU money tries to increase capacity. ""Speed is everything,"" says Viorel Panait, Comvex director and president of the Constanta Port Business Association. Since the start of the war, his company has invested â¬4m (Â£3.1m; $4m), he says, mainly in new conveyors, and doubled its turnover to 70,000 tonnes in, and 70,000 tonnes out per day. Of the 12m tonnes of grain shipped from Constanta this year, only 1.2 million tonnes were Ukrainian. But it is not just about grain. Ukraine also needs to export its minerals, Panait says. ""We're expecting iron ore as well. If we fail, the cost of the fridges in people's kitchens will double next year."" About 40% of the goods arriving in Constanta come by barge along the River Danube. The rest is brought by rail and road. But the Ukrainian river ports, at Reni and Ismail, are overloaded. They were built for local river transport, and a long queue of trucks leads back from the river, deep into Ukraine. Viorel Panait, president of the Constanta Port Business Association, says ""speed is everything"" It takes 36 hours for the barges to travel 250km (155 miles) up the Danube to Cernavoda, then down the canal to Constanta. When the water is high, a barge can transport 1,800 tonnes. But low water in the river, blamed on climate change, means they cannot fill each to over 1,300 tonnes. What if the war ends, or Turkey brokers an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, to re-open Odesa and other ports? How long would it take to resume full transport from Ukraine, across the mine-strewn Black Sea, and restore the transport corridors? Six months is the most optimistic estimate, I hear. Others suggest a year or more.

"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"This video can not be played NHS waiting lists: 'I was in pain constantly through the day' After 23 years of being told her pain was normal, Kim Williams paid for treatment out of desperation. She has endometriosis and was told her life could be at risk without surgery. ""It's terrifying knowing we're in a tough financial situation because I've paid to have surgery,"" she said. The Welsh government said it will spend an extra Â£1bn this Senedd term to help cut waiting times, but new figures show more people in Wales are now paying for private treatment. Mrs Williams, 36, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said she was presented with limited options. 'I thought I would die from period blood loss' Cancer waiting times performance hits low She could either ""stay on the NHS list, which at the time was at least three years; wait to have the bowel obstruction that the doctor was convinced was going to happen imminently; or have the surgery, privately"". Mrs Williams had already had to give up her job as a learning support assistant in a school, so initially though spending just over Â£4,000 on the procedure was not an option. ""But my husband said 'we can't wait for a bowel obstruction to happen and potentially lose you', so we took out a credit card,"" said the mother of five-year-old Olivia. ""It's the guilt that you feel that you've put yourself in this financial burden. Kim and her husband Anthony, and daughter Olivia, on a family holiday in Cyprus - a treat from her in-laws. ""You've got a little one who wants to go out and have ice creams and go on different adventures and you can't afford to do that because all you're thinking is, 'I need to make this minimum payment, I need to pay off this credit card'."" Figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) show 3,575 people in Wales chose to pay for one-off procedures from October to December 2021. In 2019, the total was 1,885 for the same period, though the numbers had dropped during lockdown and the latest figures are likely to include patients who had postponed treatment. These figures do not include more routine consultations, diagnostic appointments or private health insurance. Just over half of these procedures were either cataract, hip or knee surgery, according to data from PHIN, an independent organisation that collates data on private consultants and hospitals. Those three surgery types alone have seen a rise of 148% in Wales since 2019, though numbers here are lower than other parts of the UK. ""My symptoms started from about the age of 11 and had progressively got worse,"" said Mrs Williams. ""Before I went for the private consultation, it had gotten to the point where I was in pain, continuously throughout the day. ""I would be in tears and couldn't breathe. You'd feel sick from the pain - I was vomiting daily. Kim said she was told without surgery she'd be waiting for endometriosis to cause a bowel obstruction, which could risk her life. ""I spent most of my time in bed or curled up on the sofa with heat packs. ""I gave myself burns all over my stomach just trying to get some sense of relief because painkillers didn't touch it."" While surgery initially helped, Mrs Williams knows the endometriosis has returned and further surgery is needed. ""And so I'm back to not being the mum that I want to be, or the wife that I want to be,"" she added. The rising use of private healthcare is set against the wider context of the backlog for planned care in Wales, following the pandemic. There were 722,000 patient pathways in May (described as such because each patient could be on more than one list), which wasanother record high. The numbers waiting more than two years for treatment remains high. The latest set of figures show 65,053 treatments had been waiting more than two years, although this number dropped by nearly 3,000 compared to the previous month. Wales appoints specialist endometriosis nurses Call to teach menstrual wellbeing in Wales While some can afford to take the private route, charities have said it exacerbates a two-tier health system. ""Within the current climate, if you haven't got the finances to be able to opt for private healthcare and you're not getting the care that you need from the NHS then this is going to have a huge impact on your quality of life,"" said Christina Tanti, from Race Equality First. She explained that women, people from ethnic minorities and people in deprived areas face barriers to basic health care because of existing health inequalities. ""We know from our advocacy service and case work services here at Race Equality First, that cultural differences and language barriers hinder ethnic minority people's access to healthcare in the UK,"" she said. ""I think we're going to see these health inequalities that ethnic minority people are facing and have been facing for many years, becoming even more deeply ingrained - and I think this is going to have a knock on effect on life expectancy."" Alex Osborne from Disability Wales said there can be unforeseen costs if someone has a number of health conditions. Many disabled patients find private healthcare will often have additional, unexpected costs. Alex Osborne from Disability Wales said doctors will understandably recommend extra MRIs for those with a number of health conditions, to better understand complicating factors - bumping up the cost. ""They might go in thinking 'I can afford Â£4,000 to have my knee replaced' but come out being told that it's going to be a minimum of Â£10,000 because of all the other conditions,"" she added. ""And that's not going to take into account they probably need more physio sessions than someone that's not disabled, or specialist physio."" Ms Osborne said the longer patients wait, the more it can increase the risk of developing further problems. ""People are getting arthritis in their wrists and elbows because they've had to start using a stick daily because they've been waiting so long for a knee replacement,"" she said. ""It impacts on all parts of their life, with ongoing issues that could have been avoided."" A Welsh government spokesperson said it had ""committed more than Â£1bn extra this Senedd term to help the NHS recover from the pandemic and cut waiting times"" and that ""the pandemic has had a massive impact on our health and care services"". They added: ""Working with health boards, we have set ambitious but realistic targets to tackle the pandemic backlog for planned care, backed by significant extra long-term funding. ""In addition a dedicated recovery director and team will support each health board to develop and implement their local proposals in line with the national strategy.""

"This video can not be played Aerial video shows scale of queues leading up to Dover The Port of Dover has declared a ""critical incident"" due to six-hour queues leading to the ferry terminal. Chief executive Doug Bannister said the port had been ""badly let down"" by French border controls. French authorities said an ""unforeseeable technical incident"" in the Channel Tunnel meant French border police were delayed into Dover. However Eurotunnel rejected this, saying it was ""categorically not the reason for the difficulties"". A spokesman added: ""The critical incident in Dover started overnight.  The minor technical incident at the Channel Tunnel occurred at 07:00 BST, well after the critical incident."" French border resources have now increased, the port said, and ""traffic is slowly beginning to move"". Dover's MP Natalie Elphicke claimed French border officers ""didn't turn up for work"", causing traffic to queue for miles. Holidaymakers are being delayed at French border checks in Dover However in a statement this afternoon, the prefect for the Haut-de-France region,Â Georges-Francois Leclerc, said it was not correct to say that the French had failed to mobilise sufficient border police for the predicted rush. ""The increase in traffic for this weekend was fully anticipated and a suitable deployment was prepared,"" the statement said. ""The plan was to have all the police booths manned at Dover by 08:30 BST. ""An unforeseeable technical incident in the tunnel meant that police had to push back their full deployment by an hour."" The port has warned that it would ""take some time to clear the backlog."" Live updates: Travellers warned of six-hour delays at Dover A UK government spokesperson said they were ""working closely with French authorities, the Port of Dover, Kent Resilience Forum and police to ease disruptionÂ and provide on the ground support"". People are being advised to bring provisions as they face a six-hour delay The leader of Dover District Council, Trevor Bartlett, said: ""Alongside the delays for tens of thousands of tourists, the local community is the biggest loser."" He added: ""Serious questions need to be asked about how the emergency services would be able to respond to a major incident in Dover when it is completely gridlocked, and how this situation has been allowed to develop yet again?"" This video can not be played Watch: 'We arrived in Dover at 7.30 and been in traffic since' Eurotunnel is not affected, but it will not have capacity to take any passengers from Dover. With most schools in England and Wales breaking up for summer this week, the RAC said an estimated 18.8 million leisure trips were planned in the UK between Friday and Monday. That is the most since the company began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014. Francesco Caputo and his three children, aged 12, 11 and 7, were travelling from Southampton to Italy, via Dover, to see family. Speaking this morning he said: ""Everything has gone pear shaped."" The family left Southampton with the advice to arrive two hours before the ferry. ""The ferry we were meant to catch was 07:50 BST. We arrived two hours before, 1.7 miles from the ferry terminal, but we're not even there now. ""I've tried to keep the children busy, so far so good. They've been rather patient."" One traveller posted on Twitter: ""I'm booked onto 8am ferry from Dover and it's total gridlock. Moved 50 metres per hour. At this rate it'll be 34 hours before I get to the port."" Another person attempting to make the Channel crossing said they had been ""waiting five hours and still not in the port"". Ferry operator P&O Ferries has advised passengers to arrive prepared with snacks and water, adding: ""Please be aware that there is heavy traffic at border control in the port of Dover. ""If you are booked to travel today please allow at least six hours to clear all security checks."" The Port of Dover says it is working with the government over the ""logjam"" The UK government blamed French authorities for the delays at Dover, with Europe minister Graham Stewart saying some disruption was inevitable, but the issue laid with French authorities. Ms Elphicke added there had been ""weeks of preparation"" for an anticipated busy week, by the port, the Department for Transport and Kent Resilience Forum, and ""much work with French counterparts too"". She said: ""Despite all this, French border officers didn't turn up for work at the passport controls as needed."" In a statement the Port of Dover said: ""The port is working to do all it can with ferry operators and local partners to assist with clearing the queues caused by inadequate French border capacity. ""We urge French colleagues to adequately resource the border, not just to relieve the current situation, but for the rest of the weekend and indeed the rest of the summer to keep our community clear, to get families on their holidays and to keep essential trade moving."" The port also called on the UK government to continue working with France to make sure this happened. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"Travellers heading to France are facing delays of several hours amid continuing gridlock on roads near Dover and the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone. More than 17,000 passengers had left Dover on ferries by lunchtime on one of the busiest weekends of the year. P&O Ferries warned customers to allow three to four hours to clear local roads and security checks on Saturday. Passengers using Eurotunnel also faced lengthy delays on the journey to the Folkestone terminal. Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? This weekend is one of the busiest for UK overseas travel as most schools in England and Wales have broken up for the summer. Families travelling to the Eurotunnel terminal told the BBC they faced delays of more than six hours amid heavy congestion around Folkestone. Passengers using Eurotunnel were asked to arrive two hours early by the operator. John Keefe, director of public affairs for Eurotunnel, said traffic disruption had been caused by an accident on the M20 on Friday, and stretches of the road being used solely for freight traffic, with holidaymakers diverted on to A-roads. Saturday's delays follow long waits on Friday when a major incident was declared after routes around the Kent terminals were in gridlock and traffic queues four miles long also formed on the eastbound M2. This video can not be played Thousands of lorries stacked on M20 outside Dover A war of words broke out between UK and French officials over the cause of the disruption. In a visit to Kent on Saturday afternoon, Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss claimed delays at Dover ferry port were down to a lack of French border staff. She said: ""I'm very clear that we need to see action from them to resolve the terrible situation that people are facing."" But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont rejected this and said additional checks post-Brexit and a lack of capacity at the port were behind the problem. He also told BBC News the Port of Dover was ""too small"" and there were too few kiosks due to lack of space. Some 3,000 lorries are also waiting to cross the Channel. They are currently parked on the M20 outside Dover, while holiday traffic is prioritised. Natalie Chapman, from haulier group Logistics UK, said some lorry drivers had waited to cross the Channel for ""well over 18 hours"" in queues with no toilet facilities. Jane Dennis and her family managed to escape the gridlock after six hours by taking a detour Jane Dennis, her husband and their five children, aged between three and 11, barely moved for six hours while trying to reach the Eurotunnel terminal. Between around 7am and 1pm they advanced approximately 70 metres before deciding to take a detour that friends had used. ""We hit the queue at about 07:05 BST, and we left the queue six hours later at about 13:10 BST, when we'd travelled 70 metres or so,"" she told the BBC. ""Literally inching a couple of cars' worth forward every hour."" She said the traffic queues weren't being managed by anyone, adding: ""It was just the way the gridlock happened, the one we were in initially there was nowhere for people to budge."" Once they made the detour, traffic was flowing freely on other roads. They eventually arrived in France 12 hours after setting off from home in Hampshire, and had to try to find a hotel to stay in overnight, before continuing their journey to a campsite in Vendee on Sunday. Anna Parkinson faced long delays while travelling with her three children. Holidaymaker Anna Parkinson took seven hours to travel two miles to the Eurotunnel terminal - with three ""fractious"" children sat in the back. She said she felt for local residents who ""currently can't leave their local villages because they're hemmed in by all of us desperately trying to get on the train that we should have caught five hours ago"". Tim Povall, travelling to Budapest with his wife, two sons and their dog, had been queuing for nearly seven hours when he spoke to the BBC, meaning their planned stopover in Bruges was disrupted. He says there should have been better organisation at Folkestone to avoid a ""free-for-all"". ""It's ruined this evening. My two sons are angry and my dog isn't happy. It just doesn't make sense. ""There are lots of pregnant people and people with kids walking around. It's hot, I feel sorry for them."" By Dan Johnson, BBC News We're told that things are flowing a bit more freely and that they are starting to eat into that backlog that built up yesterday. There are a lot of cars queuing here at the port at the moment. But in a sense this is the good queue. This is the queue you want to be part of. The problem is that thousands of people are stuck on the roads miles out from Dover trying to get across Kent to the port. They've been held back by the police operations that have been in place to try to manage the traffic, to try to stop Dover itself getting completely snarled up. And that does seem to have been a bit more successful today, but drivers are still being warned that they do face big delays. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"This video can not be played Thousands of Welsh jobs depend on the Port Talbot steelworks The owner of the UK's biggest steelworks has warned its sites could be shut without subsidies for reducing carbon emissions, reports claim. Tata Group wants to reach a deal for the UK government to provide Â£1.5bn towards this,the Financial Times says,external. The UK's biggest steelworks, in Port Talbot, employs 4,000 people. The UK government said steel ""plays a critical role"" in the UK economy and Tata was ""a valued steel producer and significant employer"". It comes as Tata's former head of strategy, Nirmalya Kumar, told BBC Wales the Port Talbot plant had not been profitable for 15 years and his answer would be to ""close it down"". Call to help steel firms decarbonise Industry's 23 million tonne carbon problem Speaking to the FT, Tata Group chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said: ""A transition to a greener steel plant is the intention that we haveâ.â.â.âBut this is only possible with financial help from the government. ""We have been in discussions over the last two years and we should come to an agreement within 12 months. Without this, we will have to look at closures of sites."" The report says Tata wants to close two blast furnaces at Port Talbot and build two electric arc furnaces, that will be less carbon intensive. However, the FT adds this process will cost about Â£3bn, with Tata seeking Â£1.5bn from the UK government. Thousands of Welsh jobs are linked to Port Talbot steelworks Mr Kumar said when he left Tata in 2016 the losses had ""skyrocketed to Â£1m a day"". ""It's not a problem that has happened in the last year, it has been a problem for the last 15 years,"" he said. The current professor of marketing at Singapore Management University said he believed the site needed government support for a profitable future. ""As a dispassionate business person the answer is to close it down,"" he explained. ""The other perspective is we can continue and there is a path to profitability if it is converted into a more efficient process. Having said that we can't justify the investment as a business person unless the government participates."" This video can not be played What do people in Port Talbot think about the possible closure of the steelworks? Union Unite said it had ""grave concerns"" about the situation, with national officer Tony Brady saying: ""The words of Mr Chandrasekaran will hang heavy over the steel towns of Wales this morning, and in particular at Port Talbot. ""The steel industry is central to the economy of Wales and as a critical foundation industry must be maintained at all costs."" Steel is currently responsible for 14% of the climate-warming gases produced by UK industry A spokesman for the Community union said: ""This intervention from Tata is shocking, and has been made without any consultation with the trade unions. ""For months we've been in discussions with the company, but we should be clear there is no agreement on the decarbonisation roadmap."" The spokesman said its experts had been exploring low carbon options that will protect steelmaking in the UK, adding: ""That process is unfinished, but Tata's comments make a mockery of the company's commitments to an open and transparent dialogue with the unions."" Tata Steel employs about 6,600 people in Wales Responding to the news, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said the steelworks in Port Talbot made the ""best steel money can buy"". Mr Kinnock described the plant in Port Talbot as being ""a huge part of the pride in our community"", where thousands are employed ""in good relatively well paid jobs"". He told BBC Radio Wales that ""we have to do whatever it takes"" to keep steelmaking in the town, and added: ""If we don't have a partnership, an industrial partnership on strategy between government and industry. You are not going to be able to make any of the changes not just in the steel industry but across the board. ""There isn't a single country in the world where the government isn't partnering with industry to make this stuff happen, so I think the steel workers in my constituency are going to be waking up this morning with yet another worrying story. ""We've been in this constant state of flux in the steel industry."" Regulator accused of failing steel pension members Poo converts CO2 to useful chemicals In total, Tata employs 8,000 people across the UK, with half of these in Port Talbot, and thousands more indirectly through the supply chain. Like all industrial groups that emit carbon dioxide, it has been asked to cut these, and executives have been in discussion with the UK government. Charlotte Childs from the GMB union told the FT: ""This is deeply worrying news. ""UK steel is a critical part of the nation's industrial infrastructure and central to our national securityâ.â.â. It's essential the government act quickly and show they are serious about this vital industry."" A UK government spokesman said: ""Steel plays a critical role in all areas of the UK economy and Tata is a valued steel producer and significant employer in the UK. ""Our ongoing support for the sector's low-carbon transition includes the Â£289m Industrial Energy Transformation Fund and more than Â£1bn to help with energy efficiency, decarbonisation, low-carbon infrastructure and for research and development."" The Welsh government said a ""successful, low carbon future"" for Welsh steel was ""entirely possible"". It called the industry ""a crucial cornerstone to our economy"", adding: ""We have repeatedly called on UK ministers to urgently bring forward a package of support to secure steel-making at Port Talbot.""

"Doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales are being offered a pay rise of between 4% and 5.5% A nursing union is to ballot members on possible industrial action after most NHS workers in Wales were offered a below-inflation pay rise. Doctors, consultants, GPs and nurses in Wales are being offered between 4% and 5.5%, the Welsh government said. Other NHS workers, including cleaners and porters, will get an average of 7.5%, it said. The pay rises are below the9.4% rate of inflation. The offer includes a real living wagepay rise announced in April,external. ""Nurses will be outraged to hear the pay award is well below inflation yet again,"" said Helen Whyley, director of the Royal College of Nursing in Wales. Ms Whyley said RCN Wales would ballot members on whether to take industrial action, which she said was ""something that the college has never done before"". She also warned the pay offer would ""do nothing"" to fill nursing vacancies in Wales or inspire young people to become nurses. How does public sector pay get sorted in Wales? Millions of workers get below-inflation pay rises Teachers, police officers, nurses: Who's getting what? The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, said it was ""shameful"" the Welsh government did not revisit the 2021 multi-year contract agreed with some specialist doctors. ""It is nothing short of a kick in the teeth for hard-working doctors in Wales,"" said BMA Wales council chairman Dr David Bailey. Other NHS workers, including nurses, cleaners and porters, will receive an extra Â£1,400 The health minister said this equated to an average pay rise of 7.5% for the lowest paid staff compared to the last financial year. But for nurses, who are in higher pay bands, this would equate to a pay rise of between 4% and 5.5%. Health Minister Eluned Morgan says the lowest paid NHS workers will see the 'biggest uplift in their pay' ""This pitiful and insulting pay announcement does not even come close to making up for the fall in the value of nursing pay, compared with a decade ago,"" Ms Whyley added. But the health minister, Eluned Morgan, said the offer ""goes some way"" to recognising the ""hard work"" of NHS staff. The very lowest paid will see an uplift of 10.8%, which the Welsh government claims is the most generous deal of any UK nation. ""We are all facing a cost of living crisis,"" Ms Morgan said. ""We have structured this pay award so the lowest paid staff in the NHS would see the biggest uplift."" Unions say the pay offer was in fact a pay cut after staff had gone ""above and beyond"" during the pandemic But Dr Bailey said the offer amounted to ""nothing more than a pay cut"" at a time when doctors had worked ""above and beyond"" during the pandemic and now faced under-staffing and under-funding. Instead of a pay rise to their salary, some specialist doctors will receive a one-off payment of Â£1,400. The union was also aggrieved the highest-paid doctors on older contracts will only receive a one-off payment equivalent to 4.5%, rather than a salary uplift. Midwives and maternity support workers were awarded Â£1,400, which will mean a 4% pay increase for most. Members will be ""disappointed and angered"", the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said, explaining the uplift will not be enough to ""cope with the rising cost of living"". ""We are disappointed they have not listened to our warnings of the consequences of a below inflation pay rise,"" said Vicky Richards from the RCM in Wales. Nurses in England also got a lower than inflation pay offer this week Earlier this week the UK government agreed with the pay recommendations for the NHS in England. The UK government said it planned to fund pay rises in England from existing budgets, which means the Welsh government would not receive extra funding and will have to find the cash from elsewhere. Ms Morgan said that without additional funding from the UK government, ""there are inevitably limits to how far we can go in Wales"". In a previous response to the criticism, the UK government said the Welsh government has had more funding than at any time since devolution began. Inflation currently stands at 9.4% in the UK and is predicted to reach 11% by the autumn. The NHS in Wales employs nearly 90,000 people. The offer comes after abelow-inflation pay rise for Welsh teacherstriggered complaints from trade unions. Plaid Cymru said the below-inflation pay rise was a ""bitter blow"" for healthcare workers, particularly after ""unprecedented"" challenges in recent years. Its health spokesman, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said the pay award was a ""significant pay cut"" in real terms. He added: ""In addition to ensuring that salaries catch-up with today's living costs, there also needed to be an uplift to make up for a decade and more of cuts. ""The Welsh government have failed to do that in recent years and now, as the cost-of-living soars, it is our front-line workers who are bearing the brunt.

"Steel is currently responsible for 14% of the climate-warming gases produced by UK industry The UK is being too slow to help its steelworks transition to greener ways of working, senior MPs have warned. It could jeopardise the industry's future here and make the country more reliant on imports of steel, they said. Their report follows calls from the owners of the UK's biggest steelworks in Port Talbot for a government""route map""to help the sector decarbonise. The UK government said it had several schemes which were supporting the industry's move to a low-carbon future. Steel is currently responsible for 14% of the climate-warming gases produced by UK industry. But to help build things like wind turbines and the cleaner, electric vehicles of the future, more and more will be needed. Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee carried out an inquiry into the options available for steelworks to decarbonise. These included using hydrogen instead of coal, a greater reliance on recycling scrap steel, or trapping carbon dioxide before it's emitted to the air. The MPs concluded that UK government initiatives to advance these technologies ""lacked ambition"" compared with other countries. Steel bosses said during the inquiry that unless ministers came forward with a clear strategy and funding to drive progress, the industry risked ""further contraction"". Tata Steel employs about 6,600 people in Wales Tata Steel, which runs steel plants in Port Talbot, Newport, Llanelli and Shotton, in Flintshire, has previously told BBC Wales ""revolutionary"" government policies were needed to help them decarbonise. At Port Talbot, emission reductions are being achieved throughrecycling scrap steel back into the liquid steel, with experiments also ongoing into carbon capture technologies. Coal demand not enough for new mine, expert says Welsh industry's 23 million tonne carbon problem But in order to do something really big about the site's unenviable position as Wales' biggest CO2 emitter, they have suggested a clearer signal is needed from government about which route to take. For instance, the report said Port Talbot's location, far from potential geological storage sites for captured CO2 under the North Sea, meant getting carbon capture technologies up and running there was ""more complex"". Tata Steel has been calling for ""revolutionary"" government policies to help them decarbonise Work to try and establish the area as a potential transportation hub for CO2 - from a range of local industries that could be sent by boats to be buried at sea - is under consideration. The committee has asked the UK government to set out whether Port Talbot is likely to be chosen to take part in a scheme to develop a series of ""clusters"" for advancing carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS). If not, the MPs want ministers to spell out how they will support the deployment of alternative green technologies at the site. Last year, a Swedish project delivered the world's first shipment of so-called ""green steel"" - made using hydrogen instead of coal. A really simple guide to climate change What does net zero mean? Catrin Ellis Jones, of Vattenfall - one of the firms involved - recently toldBBC Radio Cymruit would be ""incredible"" to see something similar take off in south Wales. Dr Chris Williams, of Industry Wales, said industries, including the steel sector, were ""delaying decision-making"" on decarbonisation as they waited for ""clear policies"" from the UK government in areas such as energy costs, hydrogen supply and carbon capture infrastructure. He said there was a ""real risk"" firms would decide to leave south Wales for ""parts of the world that are clearer in what their policy plans are"". But companies including Tata told the EAC committee that ""uncertainty surrounding the abundance and affordability of future hydrogen supplies"" limited their confidence in investing in this way of working at the moment. High electricity prices were also hampering moves to put more of a focus on melting down scrap steel in electric arc furnaces. The committee called on the government to say whether it would offer a specific deal for steelworks to help with energy costs. ""As technologies advance in other countries, a way must be found to decarbonise the [steel] sector forNet Zero,externalBritain,"" said committee chairman Philip Dunne MP. ""The government must set clear demand signals and invest properly in research and development so that the industry can adopt alternative methods to manufacturing steel that is not such a carbon intensive process."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the government was ""working closely with the sector... in a way that supports competitiveness, jobs and clean growth"". ""Our ongoing support for the sector's low-carbon transition includes the Â£315 millionIndustrial Energy Transformation Fund,external, Â£1bn to support the deployment of carbon capture, and Â£240 million to drive UK hydrogen production,"" it said.

"RWE's gas power station in Pembrokeshire is one of the top emitters in the UK ""Genuine courage"" is needed to tackle climate change in Wales, which produces a fifth of the UK's industrial emissions, an economist has said. Thousands of Welsh jobs rely on Tata's steelworks in Port Talbot and RWE's gas power station in Pembrokeshire, the UK's top two emitters. Prof Calvin Jones said it was ""good news"" that a big difference can be made from a small number of industries. But he said people should accept not every industry will survive. The Cardiff University academic said: ""As a teenager in the valleys, we were absolutely clear that it was unconscionable that pits should close. ""The inability to have a plan B is writ large across the shuttered shops of Maerdy, and what I don't want is for the same thing to happen in Neyland, or Port Talbot, or Broughton."" What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Prince Charles: I understand climate activists' anger Thunberg: Scotland not world leader on climate change The Welsh government said net-zero targets may be different for each organisation, and it is working with each to help them reach their goals. Wales is among several nations who have pledgednet-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The UK will host the UN climate change conference, COP26, in Glasgow at the end of this month. RWE has committed to making its Pembrokeshire operation carbon neutral by 2040, replacing natural gas burning with offshore wind and schemes to store energy when there is no wind. But environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth Cymru said the climate emergency meant the plan for Welsh industry was ""decades too late"" to prevent catastrophic warming. Tata Steel, in Port Talbot, is one of the UK's top two emitters of climate-warming gases - the other is also in Wales BBC Wales analysis of official emissions data from 2019 shows major Welsh industries pumped out the equivalent of more than 23.5 million tonnes of climate-warming gases, 93% of which came from just 25 sites. The Welsh economy is more reliant on carbon-intensive industries than the other home nations. With just 4.73% of the UK population, companies in Wales produced 18.8% of all UK carbon emissions from major industries. RWE's gas-fired power station in Pembroke Dock, Valero's nearby oil refinery and the South Hook LNG terminal in Milford Haven produce a combined total of 7.9 million tonnes of climate-warming gases annually - a third of all carbon emissions from major industries in Wales. The UK's highest-emitting power station at Pembroke Dock pumped out more than 4.7 million tonnes of climate-warming gases in 2019. Operator RWE said it is also one of the most efficient gas-powered machines in Europe and is the ""best option"" if the UK is forced to burn fossil fuels to keep the lights on. Fleeing as Greek island burns Young people 'feel hopeless' on climate change Battle against 'historic' California wildfire Greta Thunberg calls out fashion brands on climate toll But the plant manager, Richard Little, said every year the plant shut down for longer periods as more wind power came online. He said the same trend happened right up to the closure of RWE'scoal-fired power station at Aberthawin 2019. RWE said it had ""huge ambitions"" to be a part of the UK's push to build40 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity, but said it was also looking into alternative measures such as battery storage, for periods of low wind. Mr Little said: ""RWE now directs more than 90% of its capital investment into renewables, hydrogen and battery storage. ""Our strategy is to build as fast as we can while we maintain plants such as Pembroke here in support of that bridge to renewable future."" Bleddyn Lake, of Friends of the Earth Cymru, said Wales was ""decades too late"" to prevent global warming Bleddyn Lake, of Friends of the Earth Cymru, has called on industry to match the public sector's goal to be net-zero by 2030 and said ""they need to up their game"". ""Science tells us that we absolutely need to act decisively by 2030, so the time frames they are looking at are way too far into the future."" Mr Little said shortening the timescale was technically feasible, ""but the sheer scale of what we need to build, 40 gigawatts, is like building the entire energy infrastructure of the UK again in floating wind in the next nine years"". He said stumbling blocks remained, including over planning permissions for offshore wind and a deal with the UK government on how it can get a return on the billions of pounds of investment needed. ""We are working closely with the UK government to try and generate a framework that can allow businesses such as ours to invest at the fastest possible rate,"" Mr Little added. A Welsh government spokesperson said carbon capture and storage technology, currently under development, may be more applicable to the small number of large, high-emitting sites in Wales. ""Due to economies of scale, large firms may generally be able to adopt new low-carbon technologies and new low-carbon processes quicker and at lower cost,"" the spokesperson said. ""There may also be challenges if low-carbon technologies take longer to be developed and rolled out in these key, high-emitting industries."" Prof Jones said Welsh ministers had limited influence on ""the big players in the carbon economy"" because they all had headquarters outside Wales. ""We could decide to twist our industrial policy to a certain direction to make it supportive of a transformation in these high-carbon industries,"" he added. ""And they may still close because global conditions might mean that investment in Wales is just simply irrational.""

"Nearly eight thousand steelworkers, including many from Wales, lost an average of Â£82,600. A financial regulator has been accused of failing members of the British Steel Pension Scheme and causing them serious financial harm. A report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee found the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) did not protect members from unscrupulous financial advisers. Nearly 8,000 steelworkers, including many from Wales, lost an average of Â£82,600. The FCA said it would consider the report. New pension rules in 2015 allowed members to transfer out of the scheme. British Steel pension savers could be compensated Â£118k pension scandal firm's grant to be revealed Steel pensions targeted by 'vultures' The report said the FCA failed to take preventative action to protect them against unsuitable advice. Many have not been compensated fully and the report urges the FCA to speed that process up. The report is also critical of the regulator's approach to enforcement, with only one fine issued so far. The organisation, it said, was too focused on gathering evidence and issuing letters to firms, rather than enforcing against non-compliance. Many steelworkers have not been compensated. Blaenau Gwent MP Nick Smith, who is lead member on the committee's inquiry said: ""Steelworker pensioners came to me four years ago telling me they had been ripped off. ""This report shows how badly they were treated and where the FCA failed to report them in their hour of need. ""The FCA failed to get a grip on this scandal at the outset, was slow to respond and not nearly enough has been done to hold those responsible to account."" The committee is now asking the FCA what it has done to prevent something similar happening in the future. It has also asked for a progress update on the FCA's 30 active enforcement cases. A spokesman for the FCA said: ""The circumstances around British Steel Pension Scheme transfers were exceptional, and we know that many members lost out due to poor advice. We will carefully consider the recommendations of the report and respond to the committee. ""We've proposed a scheme which should see advice firms pay over Â£70m of compensation to steelworkers. That's in addition to over Â£70m which has already been paid out, and people affected don't have to wait for the scheme to be in place to make a complaint.

"The EU has launched fresh legal action against the UK over its enforcement of post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland. It has accused the UK of failing to apply customs and tax rules it agreed as part of its 2019 exit agreement. The arrangements have led to a bitter diplomatic row - with the UK now arguing they disrupt trade too much. The UK government said the latest claims were ""disappointing"" and legal action was ""in nobody's interest"". The latest legal claims come in addition to aseparate challengeto theNorthern Ireland Protocol Bill,external, which would allow the UK to scrap some of the border arrangements without the EU's say-so. The bill passed its final stages in the House of Commons earlier this week, but faces a potentially rough ride in the Lords later this year. The EU, opposition parties and some Tory MPs argue the bill goes against the deal the UK signed and breaches international law. EU takes new legal action over Brexit deal changes Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? Northern Ireland Protocol Bill passes Commons The border arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland. However, they have become highly unpopular among unionists in Northern Ireland, with the UK government now arguing they are too disruptive. The European Commission has now launched four additional legal actions over the protocol, with the UK given an initial two months to reply to the complaints. They relate to an alleged failure to provide the EU with data about exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and implement agreed EU customs, VAT and alcohol excise rules. They come in addition to previous claims by the commission, alleging the UK had failed to properly share trade data and set up border inspection posts. In a statement, the commission said its latest actions were required to ""secure compliance"" with the border arrangements that the UK had agreed to. It added that in a ""spirit of constructive cooperation,"" it had held off from the legal actions for over a year whilst talks with the UK over changing the protocol were ongoing. But it added that UK's ""unwillingness to engage in meaningful discussion since last February"", as well as the bill to scrap parts of the protocol, ""go directly against this spirit"". A UK government spokesperson said: ""It is disappointing that the EU has chosen to bring forward further legal action, particularly on goods leaving Northern Ireland for Great Britain which self-evidently present no risk to the EU single market. ""A legal dispute is in nobody's interest and will not fix the problems facing the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. The EU is left no worse off as a result of the proposals we have made in the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill. ""We will review the EU's arguments and respond in due course."" There are a few reasons why the European Commission has decided to launch these four further claims now. Talks on how to fix problems with the protocol have stalled; UK legislation to override parts of the treaty has cleared the Commons; and Liz Truss, who introduced that bill, is - polls suggest - the current favourite to move into Downing Street. In other words, why hold back when a negotiated solution, for now, looks very unlikely. ""If the UK takes steps towards adopting the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, the EU isn't going to sit back and do nothing,"" one diplomat told me. EU officials also want to push the UK, by whatever means it can, to take another look at its own proposals to fixing the protocol. But it is the passage of the bill, rather than the legal action, that remains the more immediate and key thing to watch. Sources here tell me that if it becomes law, and the UK does start unilaterally changing parts of the treaty, then Brussels could turn to trade sanctions. It will be one for the new prime minister's in-tray this autumn. The legal steps could eventually lead to the UK being fined under a dispute process overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the EU's top court. However, the dispute process can take months to complete - and cases at the ECJ can take years to be heard. What do to about relations with the EU over Northern Ireland is one of the big incoming challenges for the next Tory leader and UK prime minister, who will take office in early September. Liz Truss, who as foreign secretary was responsible for introducing the protocol bill, has blamed EU ""intransigence"" for the current stand-off. Her rival for the top job, former chancellor Rishi Sunak, has said the protocol poses challenges to the ""the stability of the situation"" in Northern Ireland. In late 2021, it was reported he had urged Boris Johnson and his former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost not to ""blow up "" talks with the EU about the protocol. At the time the Treasury declined to comment.

"Ukraine is exporting over five million tonnes of grain a month - much more than in the summer of 2023, when Russia pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal. Russia stopped giving safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine in July of that year, and as a result, the country's grain exports slumped. Ukraine exported5.2 million tonnes of grain and maize,externalin March, 5.8 million tonnes in February and 5.3 million tonnes in January. Before Russia's invasion in 2022,the country was sending about 6.5 million tonnes abroad every month,external. After Russia pulled of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (or ""grain deal""), it said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target. Few cargo ships dared to go to Ukrainian ports, and monthly grain exports fell tojust over 2 million tonnes in July, August and September 2023,external. Ukraine is exporting abut five million tonnes of grain a month to 42 countries However, Ukraine has since established new export routes. Between the end of the grain deal in July 2023 and the end of February 2024, it shippedabout 20 million tonnes of grain to 42 countries,external, according to the country's vice prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov. This is despite30 Russian attacks on Ukrainian grain ports and storage facilities,externalsince the deal ended. Ukraine reports deadly drone attack on port area Before Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was the world'sseventh largest exporter of wheat, fourth largest exporter of barley, and the biggest exporter of sunflower seeds,external(used for sunflower oil and feed). When the war started, Ukraine's exports slumped andworld prices for grain soared,external. This particularly affected people in the world's poorest countries. The more grain that Ukraine has been able to supply to global markets,the lower prices have gone,external. Foodstuffs are a major earner for Ukraine. In 2021, the year before Russia's invasion, it made$27.8bn (Â£23.8bn) from exports,external. Under the grain deal, cargo ships travelled to and from Ukrainian ports along a 357-mile (574km) corridor across the Black Sea to the Bosphorus Strait. After that deal ended, Ukraine established a new ""temporary export corridor"" in August 2023, which hugs the western coastline. This is a relatively safe route for cargo ships because the waters there aretoo shallow for Russian submarines to operate,external. It also passes through the territorial waters of Romania and Bulgaria, two Nato countries. Under the EU's""solidarity lanes"" scheme,external, Ukraine is also sending grain by land and barge to ports on the River Danube, or to the Romanian port of Constanta, to be loaded onto cargo ships which then travel through the Black Sea. More Ukrainian grain is also being exported to Europe to be sold on arrival, or to be shipped onwards from other European ports. Ukrainian armed forces have carried out repeated attacks on Russian naval ships and bases in the Black Sea, using aerial drones, sea drones and long-range missiles. Ukraine's navy claims it hashit or disabled a third of all the ships in Russia's Black Sea fleet,externalsince the war began. This has meant Russiais now putting fewer ships near the Ukrainian coast to blockade it,external. Ukraine says it hit Russian landing ships in Crimea Ukraine hits HQ of Russia's symbolic Black Sea navy To help Ukraine's economy after the Russian invasion, the EU scrapped tariffs on imports from the country. However, countries in eastern Europe complained that this meant Ukrainian grain was flooding their markets, lowering wholesale prices and hitting the incomes of their farmers. Some dealers had decided to sell the grain in these countries rather than ship it overseas from other European ports. Polish farmers have been blocking the border with Ukraine According to the EU's agriculture commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski,4.1 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain entered Poland between April 2022 and March 2023,external, and 3.4 million tonnes of that stayed in the country. In May 2022, the European Commission introduced a ban on Ukrainian grain sales in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, only allowing grain meant for transit to enter those countries. It lifted the restrictions in September 2023, saying the problem had been solved. However, Poland has since imposed its own ban on Ukrainian grain imports, andPolish farmers have been blockading border crossings with Ukraine. In March 2024,the European Commission proposed a cap on duty-free imports of some Ukrainian produce, including oats, eggs, poultry and sugar. However it confirmed that all other Ukrainian imports into the EU - including wheat and barley - would remain free of duties until at least June 2025. It is also proposing toincrease tariffs on imports of Russian and Belorusian grain,externalto reduce surpluses in eastern European countries.

"The Azovstal steel mill was virtually destroyed in the siege Russia is looting $600m (Â£500m) worth of steel from plants and ports in Ukraine, according to the boss of Ukraine's largest steel firm Metinvest. The firm owns the Azovstal plant that became the last holdout of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians during the devastation of the city of Mariupol. Chief executive Yuriy Ryzhenkov said steel was being transferred to Russia and sold on, some of which had been bound for customers in the UK. The Kremlin has not commented. Metinvest is headquartered in Mariupol, a centre for trade and manufacturing, which afteralmost three months of relentless assault, fell to Russia in May. Mr Ryzhenkov said 300 employees and 200 employees' relatives were killed in the assault on the Azovstal plant, which together with its sister plant Ilyich accounted for 40% of all Ukraine steel production. Russia declares victory at Mariupol steelworks Mariupol: 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruins Thousands of tonnes of steel had been paid for by European customers, including some in the UK. He said that public sources and the company's own informants reported the steel was being transferred to Russia and sold in internal markets or to countries in Africa and Asia. ""What they're doing is basically looting. They're stealing not only our products, but also some of those products already belong to the European customers. So basically, they're not only stealing from us, they're stealing from the Europeans as well,"" Mr Ryzhenkov told the BBC. He said the company was documenting as much of the theft as possible and was preparing to take future legal action. ""At some point in time, the Russians will be facing not only the international courts, but also the criminal courts. And we will be going after them with anything we have."" The BBC has approached the Russian Ministry of Defence for comment, but it has not responded to the accusations. Prof Marko Milanovich, an expert on international law at the University of Reading, says there are a number of options to pursue a case, but prospects for success are less certain. ""Whichever legal options Metinvest chooses, it's a very difficult process and whilst looting is unfortunately quite common in conflict, suing the looting state and obtaining compensation is very, very rare indeed,"" he told the BBC. ""However, they might want symbolic satisfaction more than the money, and labelling Russia as a law breaker would be a big deal."" Last month, the BBC's Reality Check teamtracked where Russia is taking grain stolen from Ukraine, following mounting evidence that Russian forces in occupied areas have been stealing produce from local farmers and shipping it out of the country. Mr Ryzhenkov hopes one day the Azovstal steelworks will once again be under Ukrainian control Like many Ukrainian companies, Metinvest has become a part-military, part-humanitarian organisation. Mr Ryzhenkov said his steel workers had become as important as soldiers to the Ukrainian war effort. ""Our company is making bulletproof vests, we provide steel for underground bunkers, we provide steel for armoured vehicles. That's why the people working in the steel mills are as important to Ukrainian victory as the fighters in the frontline."" Although the Azovstal plant was virtually destroyed in the Russian siege, he said he was confident the day would come when it would be a Ukrainian-owned facility again. ""I'm positive. The way I see it Russia has already lost this war and it's just a matter of time when they realise it. The Russians don't need Mariupol, they don't need Donbas. They either need all of Ukraine or nothing, which means that even if they stop now, Ukraine will take it back. It's just a matter of time."" But wouldn't that require a major military offensive by stretched Ukrainian forces? ""Was there a big offensive when Germany reunited with East Germany? There are several ways in which Ukraine can take it back. One of the ways is a big military offensive, another way is that Russia will just have to get out because of some internal things in Russia. Or finally, there is a third way that in some point in history will just be reunited."" Mr Ryzhenkov said the siege of Azovstal would be remembered as one of the defining moments of this war. ""It is a tragedy for the Ukrainian steel industry. It is a tragedy for the people of Mariupol. But at the same time it will be remembered as an act of heroism for the military that were protecting the mill for so many weeks. It will be remembered as a symbol of the strengths of a brilliant people. That's how I imagine it will be remembered.""

"Ukraine and Russia agree deal to resume grain exports through Ukraine's Black Sea ports Russia's blockade of the ports reduced global grain supplies and increased prices Food prices on commodity markets fell after news of the deal emerged The deal was signed in Turkey, whose government brokered the deal alongside the UN UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres calls it an ""agreement for the world"" and a ""beacon of hope"" He also tells the BBC it's probably the most important thing he's done as head of UN Ukraine ruled out signing a direct deal with Russia - both sides signed ""mirror"" deals Edited by Owen Amos We're pausing our live coverage now, so here's a recap of today's main developments:  Today's live page was written by Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Marita Moloney and Laura Gozzi. It was edited by Owen Amos and Nathan Williams. This video can not be played The agreement - to unblock vital exports of
grain from Ukraine - was signed in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia,
Turkey and the UN secretary general. Richard KagoeReporting from Nairobi Kenyans
continue to reel from the impact of the Russiaâs war on Ukraine.  Like many
other countries in the continent, about one third of wheat imported into the
East African nation comes from Russia and Ukraine.  Prices of wheat flour have
been on the rise and this affected the prices of bread and chapati, a popular
flatbread.  The majority of Kenyans cannot afford chapatis which go for 20 shillings
($0.17) a piece.  The government recently introduced a subsidy to bring down the
price of maize flour, used to make Kenyaâs staple food, ugali.  News of the deal
about resuming grain exports through the Black Sea will be a relief to
many consumers who have been struggling with soaring food prices. Ugali is a Kenyan staple The strategic Snake Island on the Black Sea was recaptured by Ukrainian forces at the end of June Ukraine's infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov - who signed the UN-led deal to unblock grain exports - said the agreement had only been possible thanks to Ukrainian military successes. ""I believe we signed the agreement on our terms because we fully control our water area. ""There is no defeat. No-one is surrendering anything,"" Kubrakov said. Kubrakov citedthe recapture of Snake Island- an island located near several key Ukrainian ports

in the Black Sea - as an ""important moment"" in the military resistance against Russian aggression. As we've been reporting, the grain deal has been welcomed around the world, with the UN secretary general calling it a ""beacon of hope"". But there's caution, too - and a Ukrainian commodities analyst, Elena
Neroba, has told the BBC that she is ""doubtful"" about the deal. Neroba said it's unclear whether the deal covers only the
80 vessels currently in Ukrainian ports - which have a capacity to carry one
million tonnes of grain - or whether it includes the 20 million tonnes
currently held in silos across across the country. Neroba also pointed out the blockade has caused Ukrainian farmers to lose income - which will limit their capactiy to reinvest in farming new crops. That means Ukrainian farms will not be able
to plant next season's crops, causing the price of grain to remain high globally. Nick ThorpeReporting from Romania The Ukrainian cargo ship, Valerii Platanov, docks in Sulina Close
to the mouth of the River Danube at Sulina, 122 ships at anchor ride the Black
Sea surf. Most
are cargo ships, all empty, waiting to go upriver to the Ukrainian Danube ports
of Reni and Izmail, to pick up grain. Since the start of the
Russian blockade of the Ukrainian coast, Romania - and in particular the Chilia and central Sulina arms of the Danube - have played a
growing role in getting Ukrainian exports to the world market. Traveling up the
Chilia arm from Tulcea, we pass many cargo ships at anchor, close to the
Ukrainian shore, waiting their turns at the docks. The Danube here is only seven metres deep. That means barges with a capacity of 1,600 tonnes only load to
1,300. From Reni, itâs a 270 km journey, 36 hours non-stop, up the Danube to Cernavoda and down the canal to Constanta. Their loads are then transferred to deep-seagoing ships. All five of Ukraineâs western neighbours have become transit countries for Ukrainian grain, seeds, vegetable oil, fertilisers and other products. Romanian traders treat news of the grain deal in Istanbul with cautious optimism. By late September, one told me, if the Istanbul agreement holds, cargo vessels could start again from Odesa. Anne SoyReporting from Nairobi The grain export deal signed between Ukraine and Russia will
come as a big relief to the Horn of Africa - a region thatâs facing serious food
shortages caused by drought, and exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, a rare
locust invasion,and the war in Ukraine.   The region relies heavily on imports of grains that make up
their staple diet from Ukraine and Russia.   âFor a country like Somalia where more than 95% of its wheat
comes from Ukraine, imagine the difference that will make,â said Samantha
Power, the US development agencyâs administrator who is visiting the Horn of
Africa.   She said releasing the grains from Ukraine is âan extremely
important piece of a puzzleâ - but also called for more countries to support
efforts to alleviate the suffering of peope affected by drought in the region.   âThere was a food crisis before this invasion,â she said as she announced $225million in aid for Kenya.  About four million Kenyans are on the brink of starvation
following several seasons of failed rains.   The World Food Programme estimates that about 50 million
people could face acute food insecurity in the region - particularly in Somalia,
Djibouti, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda, as well as Kenya. A picuture from February 2021 showing a local farmer walking in a swarm of desert locusts in Meru, Kenya Boris Johnson met President Zelensky in Kyiv in February UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have spoken this afternoon following the UN-brokered deal to get grain out of silos in the Black Sea. Downing Street said Johnson welcomed the deal, and stressed the need for it to be implemented ""in full"". The spokeswoman also said the prime minister ""stressed the UK's ongoing determination to support the Ukrainian people"" and said that ""resolve will not waver, no matter who becomes the next UK prime minister"". She added that Zelensky thanked Johnson for his staunch support for Ukraine, as well as military support being provided by the UK which is making ""a real difference"" in the conflict. It comes after Johnson made a second trip to Kyiv last month where heoutlined the UK's training programme for Ukrainian troops. Today's agreement means ""jobs, salaries and taxes to the budget"", according to a spokesman from President Zelensky's office. Andriy Sybiha, a deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, says: ""During the war, stability on the economic front is an integral part of our victory. Today we have made a very important step in this direction."" The cost of defending Russia's invasion, and the effect of the war on economic output, has had a devastating impact on Ukraine's finances. In April, President Zelensky said the country neededmore than $7bn (Â£5.8bn) in aid every month. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says the implementation of the agreements signed in Istanbul could start in the ""coming days"". ""I'm talking not only about beginning the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, but clearly also work in this direction on the export of agricultural products and fertilisers from Russian ports,"" he says. He also tells the Rossiya-24 state TV channel that Russia will not ""take advantage"" of the re-opening of Ukrainian ports. Wael HusseinReporting from Cairo, Egypt Unsubsidised food prices have gone up by 50% since the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. Since then, the country has been struggling to diversify its sources of
buying wheat, adding India to the list of exporters. In late June 2022, the countryâs grain buyer, the General Authority for
Supply Commodities (GASC), bought 815,000 tonnes of wheat, taking advantage of
a recent price slump. The purchase was the largest single acquisition of such goods since 2012
and comprised of 350,000 tonnes of French wheat, 240,000 tonnes of Romanian
wheat, and 50,000 tonnes of Bulgarian wheat, the GASC said. Bread made from wheat is considered a main staple here as around 70
million Egyptians use subsidised bread every day. The authorities
were also thinking of mixing potato with flour to produce bread - but there are
concerns it won't taste as good. Like the EU, the UK has also sounded a note of caution - with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss saying the onus is on Russia to honour its promises. ""Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine has meant some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world are at risk of having nothing to eat,"" she said. ""It is vital that Ukrainian grain reaches international food markets, and we applaud Turkey and the UN Secretary General for their efforts to broker this agreement. The UK and our allies have been pushing hard to reach this point. Now this agreement must be implemented, and we will be watching to ensure Russia's actions match its words.""  The EU has cautiously welcomed today's deal, after it was signed in Turkey. In a tweet, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: ""Today's Istanbul agreement is a step in the right direction. We call for its swift implementation.""  Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates and reaction. Nduka OrjinmoReporting from Abuja, Nigeria Roadside vendors displays bread for sale at Ketu in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, earlier this year This will come as good news to millions in Nigeria - just a
day after bread disappeared from the shelves as the countryâs bakers' association began a four-day strike to protest at high production costs. Nigeria is the fourth largest importer of wheat in the
world, spending more than $2bn in 2020 to buy the grains. While most of its supply came from Russia, the spike in
global wheat prices led to a rise in prices of items such as pasta, noodles
and bread, some by 50%. Though it will not automatically lead to a cessation of the
four-day strike by the bakersâ association - as there is still the matter of a
15% levy on wheat imports they want the government to remove, among other
things - people can expect some price stability for staple food, amid high
inflation. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent It's not just Ukrainian grain that's important to ease this pressure on
global food supplies - it's also Russian produce and Russian fertiliser. Neither of those are under any kind of international sanctions. But because of the reluctance on the part of international
shipping companie to do business with Russia, Moscow has had all sorts of
problems finding vessels to do its own exports through the Black Sea. The parallel deal that was reached today will address those Russian
concerns about its ability to export as well. These two deals had
to be reached simultaneously because nothing was going to happen unless both
deals were struck. Orla GuerinReporting from Istanbul TheSecretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres,told me the deal to
resume exports of grain from Ukraine is vital for the war-torn nation, and for
many in the developing world who are at risk of famine. He said it wasprobably
the most important thing he has done in his time heading the UN. Guterres emphatically denied Russia was being rewarded under the agreement,
though it too will benefit - Moscow will be helped to get tonnes of its food and
fertiliser to world markets. These items are not covered by sanctions, but
Russia has faced problems exporting them since it invaded its neighbour in
February. He said: It is vital for Ukraine. It is not vital for the Russian Federation. Russia benefits more from the export of fuel. Thatâs where the big business is.""  I asked if it was difficult to negotiate with Russia, as it continues to kill women and children in Ukraine. ""Of course itâs not easy,"" Guterres replied, ""but there is a sense of duty that the Secretary General of the United Nations must have in relation to the whole world."" He admitted that the UN had no means of punishing Russia if it breaches the deal, but he said that would ""an absolutely unacceptable scandal and the whole international community would react in a very strong way."" The four-wary agreement â between Russia, Ukraine, the UN and Turkey - is a considerable diplomatic victory in a brutal war, now in its sixth month. But the UN Secretary General sees little prospect of broader peace talks. ""I'm very worried with the fact that at the present moment, I see no conditions for a peace process. This is clear, not even for a global ceasefire. I donât think we are close to that."" Imogen FoulkesReporting from Geneva United Nations aid agencies will heave a huge sigh of relief
at the deal to unblock Ukraineâs ports. The World Food Programme buys grain
from Ukraine to deliver to countries facing starvation. Last year Ukrainian
grain fed 400 million people. The WFP has had to cut rations to Sudan and
Niger, and has warned that the world ""faces a hunger crisis of catastrophic
proportions"" if the Black Sea ports are not unblocked. The International
Committee of the Red Cross says rising food, fuel, and fertiliser prices linked
to the war in Ukraine have combined with successive drought and conflict in the
Horn of Africa to threaten an ""irreversible humanitarian crisis with an
unimaginable human cost"". New grain supplies, more generous aid deliveries and
a reduction in food prices could save many lives. Today UN officials are
quietly optimistic; they view the port agreement as a kind of mini ceasefire
which might even lead to wider deals. But first the agreement has to be
officially signed, then it has to actually work, and even getting the
necessary cargo ships into the Black Sea could take several weeks. This video can not be played The agreement - to unblock vital exports of
grain from Ukraine - has just been signed in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia,
Turkey and the UN secretary general. The deal signed by Russia, Ukraine, the UN and Turkey is a ""beacon
of hope"" in the war, the UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. The deal, which representatives from all parties have just signed in
Istanbul, means Russia agrees to a truce to allow grain exports. Turkey will inspect ships to ensure they are not carrying weapons. It's considered a diplomatic victory in the war, which is now entering
its sixth month. But Guterres added
the deal ""did not come easy... it has been a long road"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.5454965e-14

"Twitter spent $33m (Â£27m) on Elon Musk's proposed deal to buy the firm between April and June 2022. It also said its number of monthly daily users had risen to 237m - but it reported a net loss of $270m, which was worse than expected. Mr Musk has since changed his mind about the purchase, and acourt date is now set for Octoberbecause Twitter wants to force through the sale. There is a $1bn termination fee potentially at stake. Twitter declined to discuss itslatest financial results,external, citing the ""pending acquisition"" as the reason. The report covers the period from April to June 2022. Twitter has doubled-down on its position on the amount of spam and fake accounts on the platform - the reason Elon Musk had given for terminating the deal. ""We have performed an internal review of a sample of accounts and estimate that the average of false or spam accounts during the second quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5% of our [monthly active users] during the quarter,"" it said - although it added that the figure was an estimate. In 2021, Twitter's revenue was $5bn (Â£4.2bn), but in the last 12 months its share price has fallen by 45%. Analyst Mike Proulx from the firm Forrester said Twitter was in ""purgatory"". ""Twitter now has an acquirer who no longer wants it, a CEO and board who wants to get rid of it, and an employee base which is caught in the middle of it all,"" he said. ""The real victim from all this drama is Twitter itself."" On Thursday Snap, which owns Snapchat,reported revenue of $1.11bn for the three months to the end of June,which missed Wall Street expectations. Its shares slumped by more than 25% after the news. It said some of its advertisers had cut their spending, faced with rising costs. It also said it had been affected by a change made by Apple last year, which meant iPhone and iPad users could opt out of being tracked by apps. This has affected the personalisation of ads - a very valuable service to tech firms - because they can no longer see their users' other online activities and tailor advertising accordingly.

"Claire Foy received more than 1,000 emails from Jason Penrose in a month, the court heard Actor Claire Foy's ""delusional"" stalker has been ordered to stay away from her for five years after sending her thousands of emails. Ms Foy, 38, who starred in Netflix's The Crown, was targeted by Jason Penrose, 39, in November and December. Penrose also knocked on the Wolf Hall actor's door on one occasion. A full stalking protection order (SPO) was granted at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. Penrose, who gave his address as Highgate Mental Health Centre, was accompanied by NHS workers during the hearing. At the hearing, District Judge Michael Oliver said: ""I am sure based on the evidence Mr Penrose has carried out acts associated with stalking."" Claire Foy faced 'significant risk' from stalker He went on: ""Thousands of emails were sent to Ms Foy and on one occasion he attended her address."" Judge Oliver added: ""I am satisfied this order is necessary, this was sustained and repeated conduct due to a delusional belief Mr Penrose had about Ms Foy."" He said the actor was ""entitled to protection from further acts of stalking"". It was heard that Penrose has been ""deemed fit for release"" from the mental health centre. Police can apply at the magistrates' court for a civil SPO to block alleged stalkers from contacting or approaching their alleged victims while a criminal investigation into their behaviour continues. Claire Foy won numerous awards for her role as the Queen in The Crown Penrose sent an email to Ms Foy's agent saying he was a film director and producer and wanted her to appear in his next film. Ms Foy told her agent she did not know who he was and, from 2 November to mid-December, he sent more than 1,000 emails, contacted her sister and went to the actor's home, the court heard. Judge Oliver also said that after an interim SPO was granted in February Penrose sent a letter and parcel later that month, breaching the restrictions. The five-year order prohibits Penrose from directly or indirectly contacting Ms Foy. There is also an exclusion zone covering all but five districts in the London borough of Camden.

"A strike by more than 40,000 rail workers will go ahead next Wednesday after no breakthrough in talks, the RMT trade union has said. The walkout by staff at Network Rail and 14 train operating companies is part of a continuing row over pay, jobs, and terms and conditions. The strike will affect theWomen's Euro 2022semi-final in Milton Keynes. It follows a similar strike in June that saw rail services severely disrupted across three days. The fresh walkout on 27 July will coincide with a strike at Avanti West Coast, which serves the Birmingham line, the day before the Commonwealth Games begin in the city. Transport for London (TfL) said it expected disruption across lines and stations that share infrastructure with Network Rail. The strikes look set to kick off a week of pain for travellers, with knock-on effects expected into Thursday 28 July and a separate walkout by train drivers at eight operators on Saturday 30 July. When are the next train strikes? RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said its members were ""more determined than ever to secure a decent pay rise, job security and good working conditions"". He said Network Rail - the government-owned agency that maintains tracks and operates big stations - had not improved its pay offer. ""In fact Network Rail have upped the ante, threatening to impose compulsory redundancies and unsafe 50% cuts to maintenance work if we did not withdraw our planned strike action,"" he claimed. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said that despite its ""best efforts to find a breakthrough, I'm afraid there will be more disruption for passengers next week"" and accused the RMT of political campaigning. He added: ""It is frustrating to yet again ask our passengers to change their plans and only make essential journeys."" Thousands of workers walked out on three days in June, causing severe disruption to millions of passengers. As well as the two further days of action scheduled in July, the RMT is planning to strike again on 18 and 20 August if differences haven't been resolved. The dispute centres around whether workers, including guards, signallers, catering staff and cleaners, will receive pay rises to keep up with the sharply rising cost of living. But the railway workers' union has also highlighted proposed changes to pension schemes, working practices, and what it says is insufficient general funding for the transport system. During the pandemic many workers adapted to working from home for at least part of their working week, reducing demand for rail services. The rail industry says working practices need to be updated to save money in the light of these new habits. Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's lead negotiator, said the RMT had walked away from ""ongoing and constructive talks"". ""A two-year, 8% deal with a no-compulsory-redundancy guarantee and other benefits and extras was on the table and they have walked away without giving their members a voice or a choice,"" he said. Network Rail's pay deal would be funded through productivity gains with a 4% pay rise in the first year backdated to January and a further 4% in the second year if modernisation reforms targets are met. A Department for Transport spokesperson said it was now ""clearer than ever that the RMT has no interest in engaging in constructive discussions"". ""The rail industry has to modernise and be brought into the 21st century for the benefit of passengers and staff. We're extremely disappointed to see that instead of staying at the table, RMT executives have chosen to walk away once more,"" the DfT spokesperson said. The RMT's Mick Lynch said the government needed to ""stop interfering"" and that RMT would ""continue to negotiate in good faith but we will not be bullied or cajoled by anyone"".

"Helen and Lee Kuchczynski have bought their first home after winning Â£3.6m on the EuroMillions A couple who won Â£3.6m on the lottery said their first purchase was a Â£17 backscratcher. Lee Kuchczynski, 52, a HGV driver from Kendal, was at work when wife Helen, 58, rang to tell him they had won on the EuroMillions draw on 12 July. Asked about his first purchase, he said: ""I bought a new backscratcher because I snapped my other so I bought one worth Â£17 instead of Â£8."" Since then the couple have also splashed out on a new home and a car. Helen said she was at home with their 21-year-old daughter when she got an email to tell her of the win, but initially she thought the message might have been a scam. But after calling the National Lottery to check, she passed on the good news to her husband. Mr Kuchczynski said: ""She goes 'are you sat down?'. ""Well, obviously, I'm driving, so I pulled into a layby and she says 'we've won the lottery'."" After passing on the news, Mrs Kuchczynski, a financial administrator for a charity, still logged on to her laptop and started work. She said: ""I needed to do the girls' wages and I had to do that, so I just had to blank out what was going on and get on with it."" The couple said they hoped the win would not change them The couple, who put weekly lucky dips on the EuroMillions, matched five numbers and one lucky star to win Â£3,665,079.10. The numbers were,external14, 18, 24, 25 and 50, with lucky stars 06 and 11. Mr Kuchczynski said: ""Hopefully as people we won't change, but we can just look after ourselves and look after the people we love."" On Thursday the couple, who have been married for 24 years, celebrated Mrs Kuchczynski's birthday by buying a new house and an Audi RS4 Avant car. They said they never believed they would become homeowners after renting all their lives, and could not wait to move. Mrs Kuchczynski said she was planning a shopping spree but would still be on the hunt for bargains. Her husband said: ""I might drag her out of Matalan and we'll go to Marks & Spencer.""

"The EU has launched fresh legal action against the UK over its enforcement of post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland. It has accused the UK of failing to apply customs and tax rules it agreed as part of its 2019 exit agreement. The arrangements have led to a bitter diplomatic row - with the UK now arguing they disrupt trade too much. The UK government said the latest claims were ""disappointing"" and legal action was ""in nobody's interest"". The latest legal claims come in addition to aseparate challengeto theNorthern Ireland Protocol Bill,external, which would allow the UK to scrap some of the border arrangements without the EU's say-so. The bill passed its final stages in the House of Commons earlier this week, but faces a potentially rough ride in the Lords later this year. The EU, opposition parties and some Tory MPs argue the bill goes against the deal the UK signed and breaches international law. EU takes new legal action over Brexit deal changes Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? Northern Ireland Protocol Bill passes Commons The border arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, were designed to avoid checks at the UK's border with the Republic of Ireland. However, they have become highly unpopular among unionists in Northern Ireland, with the UK government now arguing they are too disruptive. The European Commission has now launched four additional legal actions over the protocol, with the UK given an initial two months to reply to the complaints. They relate to an alleged failure to provide the EU with data about exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, and implement agreed EU customs, VAT and alcohol excise rules. They come in addition to previous claims by the commission, alleging the UK had failed to properly share trade data and set up border inspection posts. In a statement, the commission said its latest actions were required to ""secure compliance"" with the border arrangements that the UK had agreed to. It added that in a ""spirit of constructive cooperation,"" it had held off from the legal actions for over a year whilst talks with the UK over changing the protocol were ongoing. But it added that UK's ""unwillingness to engage in meaningful discussion since last February"", as well as the bill to scrap parts of the protocol, ""go directly against this spirit"". A UK government spokesperson said: ""It is disappointing that the EU has chosen to bring forward further legal action, particularly on goods leaving Northern Ireland for Great Britain which self-evidently present no risk to the EU single market. ""A legal dispute is in nobody's interest and will not fix the problems facing the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. The EU is left no worse off as a result of the proposals we have made in the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill. ""We will review the EU's arguments and respond in due course."" There are a few reasons why the European Commission has decided to launch these four further claims now. Talks on how to fix problems with the protocol have stalled; UK legislation to override parts of the treaty has cleared the Commons; and Liz Truss, who introduced that bill, is - polls suggest - the current favourite to move into Downing Street. In other words, why hold back when a negotiated solution, for now, looks very unlikely. ""If the UK takes steps towards adopting the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, the EU isn't going to sit back and do nothing,"" one diplomat told me. EU officials also want to push the UK, by whatever means it can, to take another look at its own proposals to fixing the protocol. But it is the passage of the bill, rather than the legal action, that remains the more immediate and key thing to watch. Sources here tell me that if it becomes law, and the UK does start unilaterally changing parts of the treaty, then Brussels could turn to trade sanctions. It will be one for the new prime minister's in-tray this autumn. The legal steps could eventually lead to the UK being fined under a dispute process overseen by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the EU's top court. However, the dispute process can take months to complete - and cases at the ECJ can take years to be heard. What do to about relations with the EU over Northern Ireland is one of the big incoming challenges for the next Tory leader and UK prime minister, who will take office in early September. Liz Truss, who as foreign secretary was responsible for introducing the protocol bill, has blamed EU ""intransigence"" for the current stand-off. Her rival for the top job, former chancellor Rishi Sunak, has said the protocol poses challenges to the ""the stability of the situation"" in Northern Ireland. In late 2021, it was reported he had urged Boris Johnson and his former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost not to ""blow up "" talks with the EU about the protocol. At the time the Treasury declined to comment.

"Ricky Martin, pictured at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year A Puerto Rico judge has lifted a restraining order taken out against Ricky Martin by a family member who had claimed the singer harassed him. The man withdrew a domestic violence complaint he filed earlier this month in which he alleged Martin refused to accept the end of their relationship. Martin had denied the man's claims. Reacting to the judge's decision on Thursday, Martin said he had been the ""victim of a lie"" and that it was now ""time for me to heal"". A judicial spokesperson said the order has been ""archived"", in other words it is now closed. Martin posted a comment from his legal team online, alongside the caption ""truth prevails"", which read: ""Just as we had anticipated, the temporary protection order was not extended by the Court. ""The accuser confirmed to the court that his decision to dismiss the matter was his alone, without any outside influence or pressure, and the accuser confirmed he was satisfied with his legal representation in the matter."" They went on to call the accuser a ""troubled individual"" who ""made false allegations with absolutely nothing to substantiate them"". Allow Twitter content?

At a virtual hearing on Thursday, the man's lawyer requested Judge Raiza Cajigas close the case, Martin's lawyer Joaquin Monserrate also told the Reuters news agency. ""The judge asked the pertinent questions - if anyone had threatened him, if anyone had offered him anything in exchange - and (his lawyer) said no, that it was a voluntary decision,"" said Monserrate said. The judge issued the restraining order on 2 July after the 21-year-old man filed a domestic violence complaint. The man claimed he feared for his safety because Martin would not accept his decision to end a seven-month romantic relationship. The singer has denied any kind of sexual or romantic relationship took place. The restraining order was granted ex parte, which means neither Martin nor his team were in court to respond to the allegations. In a video shared with the media by his publicist, the 50-year-old pop star commented he had been left ""very hurt"" by the allegation. ""It's been almost four decades since I've been working as an artist, under the public eye, and I've never had to deal with something so hurtful like I've lived through these last few weeks,"" he said. ""I was victim of a lie. Unfortunately, the attack came from a family member â¦ I only wish him the best, for him to find the light."" He added: ""A lie can cause so much harm. It harmed me, my husband, my kids, my parents, my family. I couldn't defend myself because there was a legal process I had to follow where I had to be silent until I'd be able to speak to a judge. ""Today was the day. Now, it's time for me to heal. I'm very hurt. I will find peace, the necessary silence to see the light again at the end of the tunnel, like I've always been able to."" In a prior Facebook post, Eric Martin defended his famous brother and suggested the accuser has had mental health issues. Martin is best known for hits such as Livin' La Vida Loca, She Bangs and Nobody Wants to Be Lonely. He came out as gay in 2010, a decade after he shot to fame. As an actor, he has starred in The Assassination of Gianni Versace and is due to appear on the forthcoming comedy series Mrs American Pie alongside Carol Burnett, Kristen Wiig, Josh Lucas and Allison Janney.

In 2021, Twitter's revenue was $5bn (Â£4.2bn), but in the last 12 months its share price has fallen by 45%. Analyst Mike Proulx from the firm Forrester said Twitter was in ""purgatory"". ""Twitter now has an acquirer who no longer wants it, a CEO and board who wants to get rid of it, and an employee base which is caught in the middle of it all,"" he said. ""The real victim from all this drama is Twitter itself."" On Thursday Snap, which owns Snapchat,reported revenue of $1.11bn for the three months to the end of June,which missed Wall Street expectations. Its shares slumped by more than 25% after the news. It said some of its advertisers had cut their spending, faced with rising costs. It also said it had been affected by a change made by Apple last year, which meant iPhone and iPad users could opt out of being tracked by apps. This has affected the personalisation of ads - a very valuable service to tech firms - because they can no longer see their users' other online activities and tailor advertising accordingly. Twitter said its ad revenue had increased by just 2%, to $1.08bn. Meta and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are both due to report their earnings next week.

"Ricky Martin, pictured at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year A Puerto Rico judge has lifted a restraining order taken out against Ricky Martin by a family member who had claimed the singer harassed him. The man withdrew a domestic violence complaint he filed earlier this month in which he alleged Martin refused to accept the end of their relationship. Martin had denied the man's claims. Reacting to the judge's decision on Thursday, Martin said he had been the ""victim of a lie"" and that it was now ""time for me to heal"". A judicial spokesperson said the order has been ""archived"", in other words it is now closed. Martin posted a comment from his legal team online, alongside the caption ""truth prevails"", which read: ""Just as we had anticipated, the temporary protection order was not extended by the Court. ""The accuser confirmed to the court that his decision to dismiss the matter was his alone, without any outside influence or pressure, and the accuser confirmed he was satisfied with his legal representation in the matter."" They went on to call the accuser a ""troubled individual"" who ""made false allegations with absolutely nothing to substantiate them"". Allow Twitter content?

At a virtual hearing on Thursday, the man's lawyer requested Judge Raiza Cajigas close the case, Martin's lawyer Joaquin Monserrate also told the Reuters news agency. ""The judge asked the pertinent questions - if anyone had threatened him, if anyone had offered him anything in exchange - and (his lawyer) said no, that it was a voluntary decision,"" said Monserrate said. The judge issued the restraining order on 2 July after the 21-year-old man filed a domestic violence complaint. The man claimed he feared for his safety because Martin would not accept his decision to end a seven-month romantic relationship. The singer has denied any kind of sexual or romantic relationship took place. The restraining order was granted ex parte, which means neither Martin nor his team were in court to respond to the allegations. In a video shared with the media by his publicist, the 50-year-old pop star commented he had been left ""very hurt"" by the allegation. ""It's been almost four decades since I've been working as an artist, under the public eye, and I've never had to deal with something so hurtful like I've lived through these last few weeks,"" he said. ""I was victim of a lie. Unfortunately, the attack came from a family member â¦ I only wish him the best, for him to find the light."" He added: ""A lie can cause so much harm. It harmed me, my husband, my kids, my parents, my family. I couldn't defend myself because there was a legal process I had to follow where I had to be silent until I'd be able to speak to a judge. ""Today was the day. Now, it's time for me to heal. I'm very hurt. I will find peace, the necessary silence to see the light again at the end of the tunnel, like I've always been able to."" In a prior Facebook post, Eric Martin defended his famous brother and suggested the accuser has had mental health issues. Martin is best known for hits such as Livin' La Vida Loca, She Bangs and Nobody Wants to Be Lonely. He came out as gay in 2010, a decade after he shot to fame. As an actor, he has starred in The Assassination of Gianni Versace and is due to appear on the forthcoming comedy series Mrs American Pie alongside Carol Burnett, Kristen Wiig, Josh Lucas and Allison Janney.

"Long NHS waiting times appear to be pushing people into paying thousands of pounds for private treatment. There were 69,000 self-funded treatments in the UK in the final three months of last year - a 39% rise on the same period before the pandemic. Experts said it was a sign of how desperate people had become. The BBC has seen evidence of people taking out loans and resorting to crowdfunding to pay for private treatment. The figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) do not include those who have private insurance - instead they are the people paying the full cost of treatment themselves, leaving them liable for huge bills. The numbers paying for care topped 250,000 last year. For common operations like hip and knee replacements, the costs can top Â£15,000. Patient groups warned there was a risk of a two-tier system being created, with the poorest losing out because they were the least likely to be able to afford to pay for treatment. Katie was told she would have to wait up to two years for her operation Katie Hopper, 19, had been struggling with knee problems for a number of years, but it got so bad this year she ended up effectively stuck in bed and unable to work. She was suffering with dislocations, nerve pain and muscle spasms, which were preventing her working as an apprentice engineer or playing basketball, at which she competed at a high level. ""I was pretty much bedbound. I was feeling very isolated and very lonely. My mental health was definitely suffering,"" she said. Katie was told it could be up to two years before she would get the treatment she needed on the NHS. ""I couldn't wait that long. I would have lost my job. It is a very active job and I couldn't do it."" In the end, she took out a loan to pay for the treatment to be done privately in April at Spire Southampton Hospital. It cost more than Â£7,000 with the follow-up physiotherapy she needed, but she was operated on within two weeks. She is now back working and has even started playing basketball again. ""It has put me under financial pressure, but it was worth it 100%. You can earn money, but you can't earn back time."" There are now more than 6.6 million people waiting for hospital treatment in England - one in nine of the population - and ministers have warned it could be 2024 before the numbers start coming down. More than a third of them have been waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks. Similar problems are being seen in other parts of the UK. The PHIN data showed there were big variations in how much the levels of self-funded treatment had risen. Comparing the last three months of 2021 with the same period in 2019, Wales and Scotland showed the biggest jumps at 90% and 84%. Northern Ireland rose by 34% in comparison - although some providers have not reported into PHIN yet so when more data is added the figure could be higher still. In England, the East Midlands was the region that saw the biggest increase, up by 75%. Overall the data shows clear drops in people self-funding when the pandemic hit. But before the pandemic the numbers were steady - with about 50,000 people paying for their own treatment every three months. From April, about 70,000 people were self-funding every three months. Some of this is likely to be the system catching up, given the drop in treatments during 2020. But patient groups said it was also a clear sign of desperation, and another illustration of just how bad waiting lists had got in the NHS. Brenda Pugh developed severe osteoarthritis in late 2019 and was told she needed a double hip replacement. She got one on the NHS, but had to go private for the other. She was only able to do this after a person heard about her case when they saw her interviewed by the BBC last year. She had the Â£11,000 operation in February and said it ""absolutely changed my life"". But Ms Pugh, who is in her early 60s, said there were thousands of people in her position who were still suffering because they were unable to get treatment. ""It's not right. We've all paid our National Insurance contributions, we've all paid our dues and to not be able to get the treatment is justâ¦ immoral is probably quite a strong word but I'll use it."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said waits for treatment were one of the most common concerns flagged by patients, and warned the situation risked ""widening health inequalities"". Chief executive Louise Ansari said for most people going private ""simply isn't an option"", especially with the cost-of-living crisis. ""People on the lowest incomes are the most likely to wait the longest for NHS treatment. This leads to a worse impact on their physical health, mental health and ability to work and care for loved ones."" Jonathon Holmes, of the King's Fund health think tank, said the figures were ""worrying"". ""The risk is we're left with a two-tier system where some people have to wait too long for care and others feel forced to bust the bank to get the care they need."" Mr Tim Mitchell from the Royal College of Surgeons of England told the BBC Today Programme that surgeons were working extremely hard to address the NHS backlog. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said there was a clear plan to tackle the Covid backlog, with new surgical hubs and community diagnostic clinics being set up. ""Good progress is being made on cutting longest waiting times, with the number of patients waiting over two years for treatment falling by more than 80% since February,"" he added.

"Ukraine and Russia agree deal to resume grain exports through Ukraine's Black Sea ports Russia's blockade of the ports reduced global grain supplies and increased prices Food prices on commodity markets fell after news of the deal emerged The deal was signed in Turkey, whose government brokered the deal alongside the UN UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres calls it an ""agreement for the world"" and a ""beacon of hope"" He also tells the BBC it's probably the most important thing he's done as head of UN Ukraine ruled out signing a direct deal with Russia - both sides signed ""mirror"" deals Edited by Owen Amos We're pausing our live coverage now, so here's a recap of today's main developments:  Today's live page was written by Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Marita Moloney and Laura Gozzi. It was edited by Owen Amos and Nathan Williams. This video can not be played The agreement - to unblock vital exports of
grain from Ukraine - was signed in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia,
Turkey and the UN secretary general. Richard KagoeReporting from Nairobi Kenyans
continue to reel from the impact of the Russiaâs war on Ukraine.  Like many
other countries in the continent, about one third of wheat imported into the
East African nation comes from Russia and Ukraine.  Prices of wheat flour have
been on the rise and this affected the prices of bread and chapati, a popular
flatbread.  The majority of Kenyans cannot afford chapatis which go for 20 shillings
($0.17) a piece.  The government recently introduced a subsidy to bring down the
price of maize flour, used to make Kenyaâs staple food, ugali.  News of the deal
about resuming grain exports through the Black Sea will be a relief to
many consumers who have been struggling with soaring food prices. Ugali is a Kenyan staple The strategic Snake Island on the Black Sea was recaptured by Ukrainian forces at the end of June Ukraine's infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov - who signed the UN-led deal to unblock grain exports - said the agreement had only been possible thanks to Ukrainian military successes. ""I believe we signed the agreement on our terms because we fully control our water area. ""There is no defeat. No-one is surrendering anything,"" Kubrakov said. Kubrakov citedthe recapture of Snake Island- an island located near several key Ukrainian ports

in the Black Sea - as an ""important moment"" in the military resistance against Russian aggression. As we've been reporting, the grain deal has been welcomed around the world, with the UN secretary general calling it a ""beacon of hope"". But there's caution, too - and a Ukrainian commodities analyst, Elena
Neroba, has told the BBC that she is ""doubtful"" about the deal. Neroba said it's unclear whether the deal covers only the
80 vessels currently in Ukrainian ports - which have a capacity to carry one
million tonnes of grain - or whether it includes the 20 million tonnes
currently held in silos across across the country. Neroba also pointed out the blockade has caused Ukrainian farmers to lose income - which will limit their capactiy to reinvest in farming new crops. That means Ukrainian farms will not be able
to plant next season's crops, causing the price of grain to remain high globally. Nick ThorpeReporting from Romania The Ukrainian cargo ship, Valerii Platanov, docks in Sulina Close
to the mouth of the River Danube at Sulina, 122 ships at anchor ride the Black
Sea surf. Most
are cargo ships, all empty, waiting to go upriver to the Ukrainian Danube ports
of Reni and Izmail, to pick up grain. Since the start of the
Russian blockade of the Ukrainian coast, Romania - and in particular the Chilia and central Sulina arms of the Danube - have played a
growing role in getting Ukrainian exports to the world market. Traveling up the
Chilia arm from Tulcea, we pass many cargo ships at anchor, close to the
Ukrainian shore, waiting their turns at the docks. The Danube here is only seven metres deep. That means barges with a capacity of 1,600 tonnes only load to
1,300. From Reni, itâs a 270 km journey, 36 hours non-stop, up the Danube to Cernavoda and down the canal to Constanta. Their loads are then transferred to deep-seagoing ships. All five of Ukraineâs western neighbours have become transit countries for Ukrainian grain, seeds, vegetable oil, fertilisers and other products. Romanian traders treat news of the grain deal in Istanbul with cautious optimism. By late September, one told me, if the Istanbul agreement holds, cargo vessels could start again from Odesa. Anne SoyReporting from Nairobi The grain export deal signed between Ukraine and Russia will
come as a big relief to the Horn of Africa - a region thatâs facing serious food
shortages caused by drought, and exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, a rare
locust invasion,and the war in Ukraine.   The region relies heavily on imports of grains that make up
their staple diet from Ukraine and Russia.   âFor a country like Somalia where more than 95% of its wheat
comes from Ukraine, imagine the difference that will make,â said Samantha
Power, the US development agencyâs administrator who is visiting the Horn of
Africa.   She said releasing the grains from Ukraine is âan extremely
important piece of a puzzleâ - but also called for more countries to support
efforts to alleviate the suffering of peope affected by drought in the region.   âThere was a food crisis before this invasion,â she said as she announced $225million in aid for Kenya.  About four million Kenyans are on the brink of starvation
following several seasons of failed rains.   The World Food Programme estimates that about 50 million
people could face acute food insecurity in the region - particularly in Somalia,
Djibouti, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda, as well as Kenya. A picuture from February 2021 showing a local farmer walking in a swarm of desert locusts in Meru, Kenya Boris Johnson met President Zelensky in Kyiv in February UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have spoken this afternoon following the UN-brokered deal to get grain out of silos in the Black Sea. Downing Street said Johnson welcomed the deal, and stressed the need for it to be implemented ""in full"". The spokeswoman also said the prime minister ""stressed the UK's ongoing determination to support the Ukrainian people"" and said that ""resolve will not waver, no matter who becomes the next UK prime minister"". She added that Zelensky thanked Johnson for his staunch support for Ukraine, as well as military support being provided by the UK which is making ""a real difference"" in the conflict. It comes after Johnson made a second trip to Kyiv last month where heoutlined the UK's training programme for Ukrainian troops. Today's agreement means ""jobs, salaries and taxes to the budget"", according to a spokesman from President Zelensky's office. Andriy Sybiha, a deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, says: ""During the war, stability on the economic front is an integral part of our victory. Today we have made a very important step in this direction."" The cost of defending Russia's invasion, and the effect of the war on economic output, has had a devastating impact on Ukraine's finances. In April, President Zelensky said the country neededmore than $7bn (Â£5.8bn) in aid every month. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says the implementation of the agreements signed in Istanbul could start in the ""coming days"". ""I'm talking not only about beginning the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, but clearly also work in this direction on the export of agricultural products and fertilisers from Russian ports,"" he says. He also tells the Rossiya-24 state TV channel that Russia will not ""take advantage"" of the re-opening of Ukrainian ports. Wael HusseinReporting from Cairo, Egypt Unsubsidised food prices have gone up by 50% since the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. Since then, the country has been struggling to diversify its sources of
buying wheat, adding India to the list of exporters. In late June 2022, the countryâs grain buyer, the General Authority for
Supply Commodities (GASC), bought 815,000 tonnes of wheat, taking advantage of
a recent price slump. The purchase was the largest single acquisition of such goods since 2012
and comprised of 350,000 tonnes of French wheat, 240,000 tonnes of Romanian
wheat, and 50,000 tonnes of Bulgarian wheat, the GASC said. Bread made from wheat is considered a main staple here as around 70
million Egyptians use subsidised bread every day. The authorities
were also thinking of mixing potato with flour to produce bread - but there are
concerns it won't taste as good. Like the EU, the UK has also sounded a note of caution - with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss saying the onus is on Russia to honour its promises. ""Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine has meant some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world are at risk of having nothing to eat,"" she said. ""It is vital that Ukrainian grain reaches international food markets, and we applaud Turkey and the UN Secretary General for their efforts to broker this agreement. The UK and our allies have been pushing hard to reach this point. Now this agreement must be implemented, and we will be watching to ensure Russia's actions match its words.""  The EU has cautiously welcomed today's deal, after it was signed in Turkey. In a tweet, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: ""Today's Istanbul agreement is a step in the right direction. We call for its swift implementation.""  Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates and reaction. Nduka OrjinmoReporting from Abuja, Nigeria Roadside vendors displays bread for sale at Ketu in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, earlier this year This will come as good news to millions in Nigeria - just a
day after bread disappeared from the shelves as the countryâs bakers' association began a four-day strike to protest at high production costs. Nigeria is the fourth largest importer of wheat in the
world, spending more than $2bn in 2020 to buy the grains. While most of its supply came from Russia, the spike in
global wheat prices led to a rise in prices of items such as pasta, noodles
and bread, some by 50%. Though it will not automatically lead to a cessation of the
four-day strike by the bakersâ association - as there is still the matter of a
15% levy on wheat imports they want the government to remove, among other
things - people can expect some price stability for staple food, amid high
inflation. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent It's not just Ukrainian grain that's important to ease this pressure on
global food supplies - it's also Russian produce and Russian fertiliser. Neither of those are under any kind of international sanctions. But because of the reluctance on the part of international
shipping companie to do business with Russia, Moscow has had all sorts of
problems finding vessels to do its own exports through the Black Sea. The parallel deal that was reached today will address those Russian
concerns about its ability to export as well. These two deals had
to be reached simultaneously because nothing was going to happen unless both
deals were struck. Orla GuerinReporting from Istanbul TheSecretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres,told me the deal to
resume exports of grain from Ukraine is vital for the war-torn nation, and for
many in the developing world who are at risk of famine. He said it wasprobably
the most important thing he has done in his time heading the UN. Guterres emphatically denied Russia was being rewarded under the agreement,
though it too will benefit - Moscow will be helped to get tonnes of its food and
fertiliser to world markets. These items are not covered by sanctions, but
Russia has faced problems exporting them since it invaded its neighbour in
February. He said: It is vital for Ukraine. It is not vital for the Russian Federation. Russia benefits more from the export of fuel. Thatâs where the big business is.""  I asked if it was difficult to negotiate with Russia, as it continues to kill women and children in Ukraine. ""Of course itâs not easy,"" Guterres replied, ""but there is a sense of duty that the Secretary General of the United Nations must have in relation to the whole world."" He admitted that the UN had no means of punishing Russia if it breaches the deal, but he said that would ""an absolutely unacceptable scandal and the whole international community would react in a very strong way."" The four-wary agreement â between Russia, Ukraine, the UN and Turkey - is a considerable diplomatic victory in a brutal war, now in its sixth month. But the UN Secretary General sees little prospect of broader peace talks. ""I'm very worried with the fact that at the present moment, I see no conditions for a peace process. This is clear, not even for a global ceasefire. I donât think we are close to that."" Imogen FoulkesReporting from Geneva United Nations aid agencies will heave a huge sigh of relief
at the deal to unblock Ukraineâs ports. The World Food Programme buys grain
from Ukraine to deliver to countries facing starvation. Last year Ukrainian
grain fed 400 million people. The WFP has had to cut rations to Sudan and
Niger, and has warned that the world ""faces a hunger crisis of catastrophic
proportions"" if the Black Sea ports are not unblocked. The International
Committee of the Red Cross says rising food, fuel, and fertiliser prices linked
to the war in Ukraine have combined with successive drought and conflict in the
Horn of Africa to threaten an ""irreversible humanitarian crisis with an
unimaginable human cost"". New grain supplies, more generous aid deliveries and
a reduction in food prices could save many lives. Today UN officials are
quietly optimistic; they view the port agreement as a kind of mini ceasefire
which might even lead to wider deals. But first the agreement has to be
officially signed, then it has to actually work, and even getting the
necessary cargo ships into the Black Sea could take several weeks. This video can not be played The agreement - to unblock vital exports of
grain from Ukraine - has just been signed in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia,
Turkey and the UN secretary general. The deal signed by Russia, Ukraine, the UN and Turkey is a ""beacon
of hope"" in the war, the UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. The deal, which representatives from all parties have just signed in
Istanbul, means Russia agrees to a truce to allow grain exports. Turkey will inspect ships to ensure they are not carrying weapons. It's considered a diplomatic victory in the war, which is now entering
its sixth month. But Guterres added
the deal ""did not come easy... it has been a long road"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.29871145
"This video can not be played Aerial video shows scale of queues leading up to Dover The Port of Dover has declared a ""critical incident"" due to six-hour queues leading to the ferry terminal. Chief executive Doug Bannister said the port had been ""badly let down"" by French border controls. French authorities said an ""unforeseeable technical incident"" in the Channel Tunnel meant French border police were delayed into Dover. However Eurotunnel rejected this, saying it was ""categorically not the reason for the difficulties"". A spokesman added: ""The critical incident in Dover started overnight.  The minor technical incident at the Channel Tunnel occurred at 07:00 BST, well after the critical incident."" French border resources have now increased, the port said, and ""traffic is slowly beginning to move"". Dover's MP Natalie Elphicke claimed French border officers ""didn't turn up for work"", causing traffic to queue for miles. Holidaymakers are being delayed at French border checks in Dover However in a statement this afternoon, the prefect for the Haut-de-France region,Â Georges-Francois Leclerc, said it was not correct to say that the French had failed to mobilise sufficient border police for the predicted rush. ""The increase in traffic for this weekend was fully anticipated and a suitable deployment was prepared,"" the statement said. ""The plan was to have all the police booths manned at Dover by 08:30 BST. ""An unforeseeable technical incident in the tunnel meant that police had to push back their full deployment by an hour."" The port has warned that it would ""take some time to clear the backlog."" Live updates: Travellers warned of six-hour delays at Dover A UK government spokesperson said they were ""working closely with French authorities, the Port of Dover, Kent Resilience Forum and police to ease disruptionÂ and provide on the ground support"". People are being advised to bring provisions as they face a six-hour delay The leader of Dover District Council, Trevor Bartlett, said: ""Alongside the delays for tens of thousands of tourists, the local community is the biggest loser."" He added: ""Serious questions need to be asked about how the emergency services would be able to respond to a major incident in Dover when it is completely gridlocked, and how this situation has been allowed to develop yet again?"" This video can not be played Watch: 'We arrived in Dover at 7.30 and been in traffic since' Eurotunnel is not affected, but it will not have capacity to take any passengers from Dover. With most schools in England and Wales breaking up for summer this week, the RAC said an estimated 18.8 million leisure trips were planned in the UK between Friday and Monday. That is the most since the company began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014. Francesco Caputo and his three children, aged 12, 11 and 7, were travelling from Southampton to Italy, via Dover, to see family. Speaking this morning he said: ""Everything has gone pear shaped."" The family left Southampton with the advice to arrive two hours before the ferry. ""The ferry we were meant to catch was 07:50 BST. We arrived two hours before, 1.7 miles from the ferry terminal, but we're not even there now. ""I've tried to keep the children busy, so far so good. They've been rather patient."" One traveller posted on Twitter: ""I'm booked onto 8am ferry from Dover and it's total gridlock. Moved 50 metres per hour. At this rate it'll be 34 hours before I get to the port."" Another person attempting to make the Channel crossing said they had been ""waiting five hours and still not in the port"". Ferry operator P&O Ferries has advised passengers to arrive prepared with snacks and water, adding: ""Please be aware that there is heavy traffic at border control in the port of Dover. ""If you are booked to travel today please allow at least six hours to clear all security checks."" The Port of Dover says it is working with the government over the ""logjam"" The UK government blamed French authorities for the delays at Dover, with Europe minister Graham Stewart saying some disruption was inevitable, but the issue laid with French authorities. Ms Elphicke added there had been ""weeks of preparation"" for an anticipated busy week, by the port, the Department for Transport and Kent Resilience Forum, and ""much work with French counterparts too"". She said: ""Despite all this, French border officers didn't turn up for work at the passport controls as needed."" In a statement the Port of Dover said: ""The port is working to do all it can with ferry operators and local partners to assist with clearing the queues caused by inadequate French border capacity. ""We urge French colleagues to adequately resource the border, not just to relieve the current situation, but for the rest of the weekend and indeed the rest of the summer to keep our community clear, to get families on their holidays and to keep essential trade moving.""

"Sebastian Kalinowski, 15, came from Poland to stay with his mother in October 2020 A mother and her partner have been found guilty of the murder of her 15-year-old son. Agnieszka Kalinowska, 35, and Andrzej Latoszewski, 38, tortured Sebastian Kalinowski for months before he died in Huddersfield in August. Sebastian was beaten with a bed slat, whipped with an extension cable and stabbed with a needle, jurors heard. The couple had denied murder but were found guilty after a six-week trial at Leeds Crown Court. Sebastian died in hospital on 13 August of an infection caused by ""untreated complications of multiple rib fractures"", after weeks of what prosecutors described as ""cruel assaults and abuse"". Agnieszka Kalinowska and Andrzej Latoszewski are due to be sentenced in October The teenager arrived in the UK from Poland in October 2020 to live with his mother and her long-term partner, the court heard. However, the arrangement quickly turned sour, with one family friend telling jurors they believed the couple came to view him as a ""hindrance"". Over the following months Sebastian was repeatedly beaten by the couple and subjected to cruel and humiliating punishments. In text messages between the partners, they described their own actions as ""torture"". Footage from a CCTV system installed by Latoszewski to spy on Sebastian captured the abuse. In one 30-minute clip played to the jury he could be seen hitting the boy more than 100 times, pausing at one stage to wipe the sweat from his face, while Kalinowska watched TV and ate toast. On the day before Sebastian's death, Latoszewski was seen on CCTV forcing food and drink into the boy's mouth and stabbing him with a needle in the groin and thigh. Prosecutors said he was ""apparently laughing whilst he did so"" before Kalinowska took over stabbing her son. How killer couple were caught by their own CCTV Agnieszka Kalinowska and Andrzej Latoszewski were convicted after a trial at Leeds Crown Court Sebastian was also verbally abused by the couple and ordered to address Latozsewski as Mr or Sir. On the day the boy died Latoszewski waited more than two hours after finding him unconscious before calling for an ambulance. He later claimed Sebastian had drowned in the bath and that his injuries had been the result of a fall from a tree or a fight. The jury took just three hours and 39 minutes before returning unanimous verdicts against both defendants. After the verdicts were delivered Kalinowska began crying in the dock. Daniel Lee from the Crown Prosecution Service said it was ""impossible to contemplate the agony and fear this young boy experienced, inflicted in his own home, byÂ his supposed care-givers"". Sebastian was due to start his final year at school when he was killed Adjourning sentencing until October at the earliest, Mrs Justice Lambert paid tribute to the jury's ""truly extraordinary"" dedication. She told them: ""You have had to endure quite horrifying footage of Sebastian suffering great pain over a long period of time and then his death. ""You have gone beyond the call of duty. Therefore, I take this step of discharging you from all jury service in the future."" Det Ch Insp Tony Nicholson, who led the investigation, said the jury had sat through ""very harrowing evidence in what has been a lengthy and difficult court process"". ""Detectives and partners in the CPS firmly believe that the charge of murder truly reflected the physical abuse Latoszewski and Kalinowska inflicted on Sebastian, and we are pleased they have been found guilty of this offence,"" he said. ""We await their sentencing and our thoughts are with Sebastian's relatives in Poland."" Sebastian's headteacher Andrew Fell, of North Huddersfield Trust School (NHTS), said the teenager would ""be remembered for his charming smile, his sharp sense of humour and his kindness"". He said: ""Sebastian was happy at NHTS. ""His spoken English improved significantly, helping him blossom from an initially shy student into one with much more confidence and a strong circle of friends."" Tracy Brabin, mayor of West Yorkshire, welcomed the verdict and said it was a ""deeply upsetting and truly shocking"" case of abuse. ""I will never understand how someone could treat any child, let alone their own, with such abhorrent cruelty and contempt,"" she added. Helen Westerman, from the NSPCC, said Sebastian's mother and her partner were the ""very people who should have been nurturing him"". ""People will be asking how any child in our society could suffer such an appalling campaign of abuse without anyone intervening. ""That is why it is so important that no stone is left unturned in the review looking into the circumstances around his death,"" she said. A spokesperson for Kirklees Safeguarding Children Partnership said a review of the case had been commissioned, adding that ""the outcome will be published in as timely a manner as possible"".

"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news. Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. But are we now heading into a summer of misery? We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead. The UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed. Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security. Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season. Why are so many flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe. Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday. They were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid Â£1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional Â£340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. Jess Baker and her family had their EasyJet flight cancelled from Iceland to Luton ""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"". ""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says. Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time. Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kayerecently told the Financial Times,externalit could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"". Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"". And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says. Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down. The strikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay. Passengers have been advised not to travel on trainsunless necessary during the strikes. Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have. Zahid Fayyaz is having to change his travel plans to get to Glastonbury Festival He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them Â£240 and an extra day off work. ""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says. Railway workers to strike over three days in June When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Unions branded selfish by No 10 over rail strikes Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"". Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.  Glastonbury22-26 Third TestHeadingley 23-27 Ed SheeranWembley 25 Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes. The walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement. That's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for. John Kuehne, a Yes fan from Florida, faces rail disruption during his trip to the UK He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June. But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient."" Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit Â£100 for the first time. He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"". ""What they do in the next two weeks will affect the lives of thousands of people who just want the wonderful experience of modern British mass transit.""

"Boris Johnson sought to change part of the deal in talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The UK's Brexit divorce bill from leaving the EU could rise to Â£42.5bn, potentially adding billions to payments, the government says. Treasury minister Simon Clarke said inflation meant the bill could be up to Â£7.5bn higher than initially estimated. The UK struck a deal to pay the EU for outstanding spending commitments after leaving the bloc in January 2020. The Liberal Democrats said the ""terrible deal"" was costing UK taxpayers billions. Originally, the government estimated the bill, which covers spending commitments made during the UK's membership of the EU, would be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. A ministerial statement,published on Thursday this week as Parliament broke up for summer,external, says ""the latest estimate of Â£42.5bn shows an increase against the original range"". Does the UK still owe the EU money? What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? No 10 rejects EU's estimate of divorce bill Mr Clarke's statement says the increase is ""primarily due to the most recent valuation of the UK's obligation under Article 142 for EU pensions"". He cited assumptions about inflation - in other words rising prices over time - as one of the main drivers of the increase. ""However, given this is a multi-decade liability, the variables used in this forecast will continue to fluctuate up and down,"" Mr Clarke said. Global economic turmoil has sent inflation soaring to 40-year highs this year, drastically increasing the cost of food and fuel. The Brexit divorce bill - agreed to by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government - covered pension contributions for EU staff, as well as funding for three of its research programmes. Meanwhile, the EU will pay back money the UK committed to the European Investment Bank (just over Â£3bn) and the European Central Bank (about Â£50m), among other things. In July 2021,Mr Johnson's government rejected an EU estimateof a Â£40.8bn total bill. Downing Street insisted the bill stood between Â£35-39bn, andthe Treasury put the latest overall net estimate of the financial settlement at Â£37.3bn,external. This video can not be played Pre-recorded bongs from Big Ben played out as the UK left the European Union ""This Conservative government's terrible deal, backed by [Conservative leadership contenders] Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, is costing British taxpayers billions of pounds,"" Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said. ""This is the price of years of Conservative chaos and neglect."" She urged Conservative ministers to ""come clean about how much more their bad deal will cost the country in future"". A Treasury spokesman said: ""The unprecedented recent rise in inflation and changes in discount rates have increased our pensions liability, which is the biggest reason for the increased estimate. ""The true cost of the settlement is confirmed when payments are made, based on the value at the time. The Treasury continues to monitor and verify these payments in line with the negotiated agreement."" The financial deal was negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement for the UK's departure from the EU. Her successor Mr Johnson sought to renegotiate parts of the agreement but did not change the financial aspect, despite at one point suggesting withholding the money and using it as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with the EU. The withdrawal agreement - along with the financial settlement - became law in January 2020.

"Kim Lloyd is struggling to make ends meet Student nurse Kim Lloyd is down to her last pound. It is not much to show for a week where she's done 37.5 hours unpaid on a ward placement and 24 hours of paid work. Her situation is not unique - with students' unions warning of people struggling to stay in education and pay rent, transport and food bills. The Welsh government said it was committed to helping all students and ""provides the most generous living costs grants in the UK"". ""Over the last two years there's been times I've wanted to quitâ¦ but I've carried on going because it's something I really want to do,"" said Kim, 33, from Welshpool. University students 'priced out' of graduation 'I had to choose between heating or my teeth' ""Hopefully I'll be able to get through the next year and qualify and be in a good job at the end of it but it's very difficult. ""It just makes me feel sad for other students because if I'm in this situation, I dread to think what other students are going through."" Kim, 33, is a trainee nurse at Bangor University, and is on a placement on a ward at Wrexham's Maelor Hospital. Kim is on placement at Wrexham Maelor Hospital as she pursues her ambition of becoming a nurse When she is on placement, there is a limit to the amount of paid work she can do - no more than two 12-hour shifts. But even that can affect her studies. ""It can impact on my [university] work and time management of meeting all my deadlinesâ¦ and making sure my work's not suffering. ""My grades matter to me, but then I need money to be able to survive and live. It's just a vicious circle,"" she added. Cost of living: Cake firm's Â£43k butter bill How to cope with rising bills Her income is a mixture of student loans and paid work - and it's eaten up by rent, diesel and food every month. Kim said: ""Roughly, I aim to bring in around Â£1,000 a month, and it's not quite enough. ""I can't physically do any more shifts than what I'm doing. ""It depends what I've got going out to how much I am left over with, but this week I am down to my last pound. She said the situation leaves her asking ""why am I bothering?"", but although life is ""tough going"", she wants to succeed and start her new career. Kim describes her fridge as ""quite empty,"" with a small carton of milk, half a tub of butter, and a few ""not-so-good-looking vegetables"". ""I don't buy brands. Bread, I buy a loaf and I freeze it and I kind of try and budget my loaf of bread. ""I actually have a little planner on my fridge saying I can only have three slices of bread one week. The cheapest stuff I can get, I will buy,"" she said. Cara Walters said everyone she has spoken to is concerned about next year Kim is worried about how she is ""going to survive"" the final year of her degree which starts in September, but her concerns are not unique. Cara Walters will be a second year student at Swansea University in the autumn. A summer job will help with fuel costs, but she is aware of the financial burden on her parents who have another daughter in school. Cara said: ""Everyone is worrying about next year. ""Definitely there will have to be cutbacks on socialising. I've had to look for a cheaper house to live because the rent on where I was living was getting so expensive."" She thinks the government could increase grants to help students. Nyah Lowe is seeing more and more students struggling Bangor University Students' Union president Nyah Lowe said: ""We're hearing an increasing number of students really struggling to pay their rent, pay food bills, and just generally living costs. ""We've had multiple cases of students saying that they want to drop out of university because they don't have the financial funds to support them."" She believes Covid has had a big effect: ""We're seeing huge amounts of social anxiety with our students and it's making it hard for them to reach out to us for support."" According to the National Union of Students, who surveyed 567 students in Wales, 92% were concerned about their ability to manage financially. Their survey found 89% of respondents said financial worries had had an impact on their mental health. The students' union is concerned some will be hit worse than others. Why are things so hard for so many people? 'Fuel costs make it too expensive to work' Student nurses or teachers who have to pay rising fuel costs to travel to placements, as well as mature students with children or dependents, could be under the most pressure. Ms Lowe wants the Welsh government to support these people and recognise ""students doesn't just mean students under the age of 18"". Sue Chingombe-Smith said she has noticed less people around campus and puts it down to the cost of living Mother-of-three Sue Chingombe-Smith, 44, from Anglesey, is studying for a PhD in mental health sciences at Bangor University. She noticed a big change recently and said: ""I can't afford to come to the library as often as I used to do over the years. ""I have to make maybe one trip per week, because of the fuel costs."" Sue and her husband have bills to pay, as well as three children under 18. She has taken on a job as a mental health support worker to bring in more money. ""The job itself is physically and mentally draining and at the end of the day I'm too tired to study,"" she said. Originally from Zimbabwe, she said education is a highly-prized ""life-changing process"" for people from Africa. She fears others following in her footsteps won't be able to afford to carry on learning, and said she knows of one person who has had suicidal thoughts at the prospect of having to drop out. A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""Living costs should never be a barrier to studying at university, which is why Wales provides the most generous living costs grants in the UK. ""We have made a further Â£15m available for the Discretionary Assistance Fund which can provide financial support for those experiencing extreme financial pressures. This will enable us to extend the additional support we have put in place via the fund until the end of March 2023, ensuring those who need it can access emergency support for their immediate living costs. ""We remain committed to widening access to higher education, ensuring it is available to all who can benefit throughout their lives.""

Ms Lowe wants the Welsh government to support these people and recognise ""students doesn't just mean students under the age of 18"". Sue Chingombe-Smith said she has noticed less people around campus and puts it down to the cost of living Mother-of-three Sue Chingombe-Smith, 44, from Anglesey, is studying for a PhD in mental health sciences at Bangor University. She noticed a big change recently and said: ""I can't afford to come to the library as often as I used to do over the years. ""I have to make maybe one trip per week, because of the fuel costs."" Sue and her husband have bills to pay, as well as three children under 18. She has taken on a job as a mental health support worker to bring in more money. ""The job itself is physically and mentally draining and at the end of the day I'm too tired to study,"" she said. Originally from Zimbabwe, she said education is a highly-prized ""life-changing process"" for people from Africa. She fears others following in her footsteps won't be able to afford to carry on learning, and said she knows of one person who has had suicidal thoughts at the prospect of having to drop out. A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""Living costs should never be a barrier to studying at university, which is why Wales provides the most generous living costs grants in the UK. ""We have made a further Â£15m available for the Discretionary Assistance Fund which can provide financial support for those experiencing extreme financial pressures. This will enable us to extend the additional support we have put in place via the fund until the end of March 2023, ensuring those who need it can access emergency support for their immediate living costs.

"Sebastian Kalinowski, 15, came from Poland to stay with his mother in October 2020 A mother and her partner have been found guilty of the murder of her 15-year-old son. Agnieszka Kalinowska, 35, and Andrzej Latoszewski, 38, tortured Sebastian Kalinowski for months before he died in Huddersfield in August. Sebastian was beaten with a bed slat, whipped with an extension cable and stabbed with a needle, jurors heard. The couple had denied murder but were found guilty after a six-week trial at Leeds Crown Court. Sebastian died in hospital on 13 August of an infection caused by ""untreated complications of multiple rib fractures"", after weeks of what prosecutors described as ""cruel assaults and abuse"". Agnieszka Kalinowska and Andrzej Latoszewski are due to be sentenced in October The teenager arrived in the UK from Poland in October 2020 to live with his mother and her long-term partner, the court heard. However, the arrangement quickly turned sour, with one family friend telling jurors they believed the couple came to view him as a ""hindrance"". Over the following months Sebastian was repeatedly beaten by the couple and subjected to cruel and humiliating punishments. In text messages between the partners, they described their own actions as ""torture"". Footage from a CCTV system installed by Latoszewski to spy on Sebastian captured the abuse. In one 30-minute clip played to the jury he could be seen hitting the boy more than 100 times, pausing at one stage to wipe the sweat from his face, while Kalinowska watched TV and ate toast. On the day before Sebastian's death, Latoszewski was seen on CCTV forcing food and drink into the boy's mouth and stabbing him with a needle in the groin and thigh. Prosecutors said he was ""apparently laughing whilst he did so"" before Kalinowska took over stabbing her son. How killer couple were caught by their own CCTV Agnieszka Kalinowska and Andrzej Latoszewski were convicted after a trial at Leeds Crown Court Sebastian was also verbally abused by the couple and ordered to address Latozsewski as Mr or Sir. On the day the boy died Latoszewski waited more than two hours after finding him unconscious before calling for an ambulance. He later claimed Sebastian had drowned in the bath and that his injuries had been the result of a fall from a tree or a fight. The jury took just three hours and 39 minutes before returning unanimous verdicts against both defendants. After the verdicts were delivered Kalinowska began crying in the dock. Daniel Lee from the Crown Prosecution Service said it was ""impossible to contemplate the agony and fear this young boy experienced, inflicted in his own home, byÂ his supposed care-givers"". Sebastian was due to start his final year at school when he was killed Adjourning sentencing until October at the earliest, Mrs Justice Lambert paid tribute to the jury's ""truly extraordinary"" dedication. She told them: ""You have had to endure quite horrifying footage of Sebastian suffering great pain over a long period of time and then his death. ""You have gone beyond the call of duty. Therefore, I take this step of discharging you from all jury service in the future."" Det Ch Insp Tony Nicholson, who led the investigation, said the jury had sat through ""very harrowing evidence in what has been a lengthy and difficult court process"". ""Detectives and partners in the CPS firmly believe that the charge of murder truly reflected the physical abuse Latoszewski and Kalinowska inflicted on Sebastian, and we are pleased they have been found guilty of this offence,"" he said. ""We await their sentencing and our thoughts are with Sebastian's relatives in Poland."" Sebastian's headteacher Andrew Fell, of North Huddersfield Trust School (NHTS), said the teenager would ""be remembered for his charming smile, his sharp sense of humour and his kindness"". He said: ""Sebastian was happy at NHTS. ""His spoken English improved significantly, helping him blossom from an initially shy student into one with much more confidence and a strong circle of friends."" Tracy Brabin, mayor of West Yorkshire, welcomed the verdict and said it was a ""deeply upsetting and truly shocking"" case of abuse. ""I will never understand how someone could treat any child, let alone their own, with such abhorrent cruelty and contempt,"" she added. Helen Westerman, from the NSPCC, said Sebastian's mother and her partner were the ""very people who should have been nurturing him"". ""People will be asking how any child in our society could suffer such an appalling campaign of abuse without anyone intervening. ""That is why it is so important that no stone is left unturned in the review looking into the circumstances around his death,"" she said. A spokesperson for Kirklees Safeguarding Children Partnership said a review of the case had been commissioned, adding that ""the outcome will be published in as timely a manner as possible"".

"Long NHS waiting times appear to be pushing people into paying thousands of pounds for private treatment. There were 69,000 self-funded treatments in the UK in the final three months of last year - a 39% rise on the same period before the pandemic. Experts said it was a sign of how desperate people had become. The BBC has seen evidence of people taking out loans and resorting to crowdfunding to pay for private treatment. The figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) do not include those who have private insurance - instead they are the people paying the full cost of treatment themselves, leaving them liable for huge bills. The numbers paying for care topped 250,000 last year. For common operations like hip and knee replacements, the costs can top Â£15,000. Patient groups warned there was a risk of a two-tier system being created, with the poorest losing out because they were the least likely to be able to afford to pay for treatment. Katie was told she would have to wait up to two years for her operation Katie Hopper, 19, had been struggling with knee problems for a number of years, but it got so bad this year she ended up effectively stuck in bed and unable to work. She was suffering with dislocations, nerve pain and muscle spasms, which were preventing her working as an apprentice engineer or playing basketball, at which she competed at a high level. ""I was pretty much bedbound. I was feeling very isolated and very lonely. My mental health was definitely suffering,"" she said. Katie was told it could be up to two years before she would get the treatment she needed on the NHS. ""I couldn't wait that long. I would have lost my job. It is a very active job and I couldn't do it."" In the end, she took out a loan to pay for the treatment to be done privately in April at Spire Southampton Hospital. It cost more than Â£7,000 with the follow-up physiotherapy she needed, but she was operated on within two weeks. She is now back working and has even started playing basketball again. ""It has put me under financial pressure, but it was worth it 100%. You can earn money, but you can't earn back time."" There are now more than 6.6 million people waiting for hospital treatment in England - one in nine of the population - and ministers have warned it could be 2024 before the numbers start coming down. More than a third of them have been waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks. Similar problems are being seen in other parts of the UK. The PHIN data showed there were big variations in how much the levels of self-funded treatment had risen. Comparing the last three months of 2021 with the same period in 2019, Wales and Scotland showed the biggest jumps at 90% and 84%. Northern Ireland rose by 34% in comparison - although some providers have not reported into PHIN yet so when more data is added the figure could be higher still. In England, the East Midlands was the region that saw the biggest increase, up by 75%. Overall the data shows clear drops in people self-funding when the pandemic hit. But before the pandemic the numbers were steady - with about 50,000 people paying for their own treatment every three months. From April, about 70,000 people were self-funding every three months. Some of this is likely to be the system catching up, given the drop in treatments during 2020. But patient groups said it was also a clear sign of desperation, and another illustration of just how bad waiting lists had got in the NHS. Brenda Pugh developed severe osteoarthritis in late 2019 and was told she needed a double hip replacement. She got one on the NHS, but had to go private for the other. She was only able to do this after a person heard about her case when they saw her interviewed by the BBC last year. She had the Â£11,000 operation in February and said it ""absolutely changed my life"". But Ms Pugh, who is in her early 60s, said there were thousands of people in her position who were still suffering because they were unable to get treatment. ""It's not right. We've all paid our National Insurance contributions, we've all paid our dues and to not be able to get the treatment is justâ¦ immoral is probably quite a strong word but I'll use it."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said waits for treatment were one of the most common concerns flagged by patients, and warned the situation risked ""widening health inequalities"". Chief executive Louise Ansari said for most people going private ""simply isn't an option"", especially with the cost-of-living crisis. ""People on the lowest incomes are the most likely to wait the longest for NHS treatment. This leads to a worse impact on their physical health, mental health and ability to work and care for loved ones."" Jonathon Holmes, of the King's Fund health think tank, said the figures were ""worrying"". ""The risk is we're left with a two-tier system where some people have to wait too long for care and others feel forced to bust the bank to get the care they need."" Mr Tim Mitchell from the Royal College of Surgeons of England told the BBC Today Programme that surgeons were working extremely hard to address the NHS backlog. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said there was a clear plan to tackle the Covid backlog, with new surgical hubs and community diagnostic clinics being set up. ""Good progress is being made on cutting longest waiting times, with the number of patients waiting over two years for treatment falling by more than 80% since February,"" he added.

"Kim Lloyd is struggling to make ends meet Student nurse Kim Lloyd is down to her last pound. It is not much to show for a week where she's done 37.5 hours unpaid on a ward placement and 24 hours of paid work. Her situation is not unique - with students' unions warning of people struggling to stay in education and pay rent, transport and food bills. The Welsh government said it was committed to helping all students and ""provides the most generous living costs grants in the UK"". ""Over the last two years there's been times I've wanted to quitâ¦ but I've carried on going because it's something I really want to do,"" said Kim, 33, from Welshpool. University students 'priced out' of graduation 'I had to choose between heating or my teeth' ""Hopefully I'll be able to get through the next year and qualify and be in a good job at the end of it but it's very difficult. ""It just makes me feel sad for other students because if I'm in this situation, I dread to think what other students are going through."" Kim, 33, is a trainee nurse at Bangor University, and is on a placement on a ward at Wrexham's Maelor Hospital. Kim is on placement at Wrexham Maelor Hospital as she pursues her ambition of becoming a nurse When she is on placement, there is a limit to the amount of paid work she can do - no more than two 12-hour shifts. But even that can affect her studies. ""It can impact on my [university] work and time management of meeting all my deadlinesâ¦ and making sure my work's not suffering. ""My grades matter to me, but then I need money to be able to survive and live. It's just a vicious circle,"" she added. Cost of living: Cake firm's Â£43k butter bill How to cope with rising bills Her income is a mixture of student loans and paid work - and it's eaten up by rent, diesel and food every month. Kim said: ""Roughly, I aim to bring in around Â£1,000 a month, and it's not quite enough. ""I can't physically do any more shifts than what I'm doing. ""It depends what I've got going out to how much I am left over with, but this week I am down to my last pound. She said the situation leaves her asking ""why am I bothering?"", but although life is ""tough going"", she wants to succeed and start her new career. Kim describes her fridge as ""quite empty,"" with a small carton of milk, half a tub of butter, and a few ""not-so-good-looking vegetables"". ""I don't buy brands. Bread, I buy a loaf and I freeze it and I kind of try and budget my loaf of bread. ""I actually have a little planner on my fridge saying I can only have three slices of bread one week. The cheapest stuff I can get, I will buy,"" she said. Cara Walters said everyone she has spoken to is concerned about next year Kim is worried about how she is ""going to survive"" the final year of her degree which starts in September, but her concerns are not unique. Cara Walters will be a second year student at Swansea University in the autumn. A summer job will help with fuel costs, but she is aware of the financial burden on her parents who have another daughter in school. Cara said: ""Everyone is worrying about next year. ""Definitely there will have to be cutbacks on socialising. I've had to look for a cheaper house to live because the rent on where I was living was getting so expensive."" She thinks the government could increase grants to help students. Nyah Lowe is seeing more and more students struggling Bangor University Students' Union president Nyah Lowe said: ""We're hearing an increasing number of students really struggling to pay their rent, pay food bills, and just generally living costs. ""We've had multiple cases of students saying that they want to drop out of university because they don't have the financial funds to support them."" She believes Covid has had a big effect: ""We're seeing huge amounts of social anxiety with our students and it's making it hard for them to reach out to us for support."" According to the National Union of Students, who surveyed 567 students in Wales, 92% were concerned about their ability to manage financially. Their survey found 89% of respondents said financial worries had had an impact on their mental health. The students' union is concerned some will be hit worse than others. Why are things so hard for so many people? 'Fuel costs make it too expensive to work' Student nurses or teachers who have to pay rising fuel costs to travel to placements, as well as mature students with children or dependents, could be under the most pressure.

"Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine Families are cutting back on fuel and clothing as rising prices make them question what they can afford, new figures suggest. Petrol and diesel sales fell by 4.3% in June as prices at the pumps hit new records, monthly retail data shows. Clothing sales dropped by 4.7%, as UK inflation reached new highs. Retailers told the Office for National Statistics the figures indicated people were cutting back on spending due to concerns over what they could afford. Prices in the UK are currently risingat their fastest rate for more than 40 years. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9.4% in June, with the increasing cost of petrol and food putting pressure on households' finances. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Although overall retail sales remain above their pre-pandemic levels, ""the broader trend is one of decline"", said Heather Bovill at the ONS. ""Clothing purchases dipped along with household goods, with retailers suggesting consumers cutting back on spending due to higher prices and concerns around affordability,"" she said. ""Fuel sales fell back considerably with retailers reporting the record high prices at the pump hitting sales,"" the deputy director for surveys and economic indicators added. It comes as a new survey by the ONS found around nine-in-10 adults continued to report a rise in their living costs over the past month. Around half (46%) of adults who pay energy bills found it difficult to afford them, up from 43% in the previous period, while 46% of adults said they would not be able to save any money in the next 12 months. The data was collected in early July. Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by a number of countries to reduce their dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, the ONS said, the largest monthly rise on record. Diesel prices also soared by 12.7p per litre. It led to the average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel wereleading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Food sales were the only area to see a boost in June, with volumes rising by 3.1% largely driven by the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday celebrations. ""After a fall in May, food sales picked up due to the Jubilee celebrations, but this was the only sector to report an increase,"" Ms Bovill said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research firm Capital Economics, said the jump in food sales ""was surely due to people stocking up on sausages rolls, cakes and alcohol for jubilee street parties"". But he added that the extra bank holiday ""also appears to have meant people spent less time shopping for other items"", such as clothing and household goods. Silvia Rindone, UK and Ireland retail leader at the accountancy firm EY, said: ""Despite the long Jubilee bank holiday weekend at the start of June, today's ONS retail sales data shows that consumers are feeling the pinch from the rising cost-of-living and are becoming more cautious about where and when they are spending."" Ms Rindone said retailers with robust plans to manage cost inflation are best placed to cope. She added that companies need to ensure they address people's concerns over what they can afford, such as by offering value for money or ""own label"" options. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Keeping women safe is now ""at the heart"" of the world's largest dating app, Tinder, it claims. The technology company is launching a partnership with campaign group No More, aiming to end domestic violence. ""Our safety work is never done,"" Tinder's first female chief executive, Renate Nyborg, tells BBC News. But charity End Violence Against Women says it is only a ""small step"" in addressing the disproportionate amount of abuse women experienced online. Tinder has faced scrutiny over abusive interactions on the service, with concerns dating apps are attracting sexual predators. Ms Nyborg, 36, says one of the ways she is addressing those concerns is hiring more women across the company, having increased the number working in the Tinder product team by 30% since taking up the chief executive role, in September 2021. ""I think there is a difference between knowing something is important and feeling it,"" she tells BBC News. ""Like any woman, I can count all of the experiences that I've had that I maybe didn't want to have - from the way that you're being addressed, to the way you're treated at work, to the way things can happen when you're actively dating. ""I think every woman that I speak to has had many experiences like this - and I do think it helps to have some strength in numbers."" Renate Nyborg is the first female CEO of Tinder. End Violence Against Women coalition director Andrea Simon says it is essential dating apps such as Tinder take proactive action to address abuse. ""Dating apps are a really popular way for people to meet each other,"" she says, ""but there is also a really worrying side to the way perpetrators are exploiting this to meet potential victims, resulting in a reported increase in rapes of women using dating apps. ""Tinder's new safety features are a small step to encourage reporting of harassment but do not go far enough to address abuse like rape threats. ""Tech companies like Tinder ultimately profit from a business model that ignores the abuse facilitated by its services. ""It's critical they are held to account for ensuring users' safety."" It is hoped Tinder's partnership with No More will address some of these concerns. The aim is to produce an in-app programme to educate members in safe, competent dating. No More will also provide training to Tinder staff. Ms Nyborg says: ""We believe that positive relationships start with the first swipe. ""The way that you interact with someone, literally from the very first message, may set the tone for the relationships that you have."" No More global executive director Pamela Zaballa tells BBC News: ""I think it is very important for Tinder to make sure that they're educating their users, not only warning them about bad behaviours. ""We are seeing this confliction between digital and in real life, so we need to make sure that anybody who is dating online is safe - and that starts with education. ""We understand the challenges that women have - that's the crux of what we do - but I think safety in general should be a top priority for Tinder and not just women but anyone using the app."" Dating apps have no legal duty of care towards their users. Campaign groups have been calling on the government to address the violence women and girls face, in the Online Safety Bill. But the legislation is now on pause until the autumn, when the government expects to elect a new prime minister. Tinder has launched a number of safety services in the past year. Abusive and harmful messages are now automatically detected, with senders asked""Are you sure?""and recipients ""Does this bother you?"" ""We've seen an increase of 50% in people reporting things that they may not like,"" Ms Nyborg tells BBC News. ""Are you sure?"", meanwhile, has helped reduce inappropriate messages by 10%, data from Match Group - which owns Tinder, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish - shows. ""We've always invested fundamentally in our trust and safety tools and technologies,"" Ms Nyborg says. ""But since I became CEO, we've started making trust and safety, the heart of some of our marketing campaigns."" In the US, Tinder's in-app safety centre offersbackground checkson matches, through a partnership with non-profit organisation Garbo.

"Keeping women safe is now ""at the heart"" of the world's largest dating app, Tinder, it claims. The technology company is launching a partnership with campaign group No More, aiming to end domestic violence. ""Our safety work is never done,"" Tinder's first female chief executive, Renate Nyborg, tells BBC News. But charity End Violence Against Women says it is only a ""small step"" in addressing the disproportionate amount of abuse women experienced online. Tinder has faced scrutiny over abusive interactions on the service, with concerns dating apps are attracting sexual predators. Ms Nyborg, 36, says one of the ways she is addressing those concerns is hiring more women across the company, having increased the number working in the Tinder product team by 30% since taking up the chief executive role, in September 2021. ""I think there is a difference between knowing something is important and feeling it,"" she tells BBC News. ""Like any woman, I can count all of the experiences that I've had that I maybe didn't want to have - from the way that you're being addressed, to the way you're treated at work, to the way things can happen when you're actively dating. ""I think every woman that I speak to has had many experiences like this - and I do think it helps to have some strength in numbers."" Renate Nyborg is the first female CEO of Tinder. End Violence Against Women coalition director Andrea Simon says it is essential dating apps such as Tinder take proactive action to address abuse. ""Dating apps are a really popular way for people to meet each other,"" she says, ""but there is also a really worrying side to the way perpetrators are exploiting this to meet potential victims, resulting in a reported increase in rapes of women using dating apps. ""Tinder's new safety features are a small step to encourage reporting of harassment but do not go far enough to address abuse like rape threats. ""Tech companies like Tinder ultimately profit from a business model that ignores the abuse facilitated by its services. ""It's critical they are held to account for ensuring users' safety."" It is hoped Tinder's partnership with No More will address some of these concerns. The aim is to produce an in-app programme to educate members in safe, competent dating. No More will also provide training to Tinder staff. Ms Nyborg says: ""We believe that positive relationships start with the first swipe. ""The way that you interact with someone, literally from the very first message, may set the tone for the relationships that you have."" No More global executive director Pamela Zaballa tells BBC News: ""I think it is very important for Tinder to make sure that they're educating their users, not only warning them about bad behaviours. ""We are seeing this confliction between digital and in real life, so we need to make sure that anybody who is dating online is safe - and that starts with education. ""We understand the challenges that women have - that's the crux of what we do - but I think safety in general should be a top priority for Tinder and not just women but anyone using the app."" Dating apps have no legal duty of care towards their users. Campaign groups have been calling on the government to address the violence women and girls face, in the Online Safety Bill. But the legislation is now on pause until the autumn, when the government expects to elect a new prime minister. Tinder has launched a number of safety services in the past year. Abusive and harmful messages are now automatically detected, with senders asked""Are you sure?""and recipients ""Does this bother you?"" ""We've seen an increase of 50% in people reporting things that they may not like,"" Ms Nyborg tells BBC News. ""Are you sure?"", meanwhile, has helped reduce inappropriate messages by 10%, data from Match Group - which owns Tinder, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish - shows. ""We've always invested fundamentally in our trust and safety tools and technologies,"" Ms Nyborg says. ""But since I became CEO, we've started making trust and safety, the heart of some of our marketing campaigns."" In the US, Tinder's in-app safety centre offersbackground checkson matches, through a partnership with non-profit organisation Garbo. And the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network has developed a way of reporting former abusers in a match list. Members can also use apanic button and, in countries where the law allows, ID verification. ""We've been incredibly impressed with the uptake of verification,"" Ms Nyborg says.

"Michael O'Leary has said he disagrees with Brexit but respects the decision to leave the EU Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has urged the UK government to take a more ""practical, common sense"" approach to post-Brexit policy, to allow more workers from Europe to fill vacancies. Mr O'Leary said he could hire people from continental Europe for jobs that he cannot fill with British workers, but is unable to get visas for them. Facilitating such visas would help ease disruption to air travel, he said. The government said it wanted firms to invest in workers from the UK. Mr O'Leary said: ""I can hire thousands of people in Portugal, in Italy, France, Germany at exactly the same wages that I'm paying in the UK and I just can't hire them in the UK at the moment. ""And we have this bizarre situation at the moment that in the UK I can get visas to bring Moroccans to come in and work as cabin crew. But I can't get visas for Portuguese or Italians or Slovakian youngsters. We just need a bit of more common sense and a practical approach to how we implement Brexit,"" he told BBC Radio 4. Emirates to cap Heathrow summer ticket sales Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Don't expect great summer experience, warns airport boss Ex-airline worker: It would be like going back to an ex He said enabling such visas would help ease the disruption currently being felt at some airports, and ease skill shortages in other areas. ""There are not enough people in the UK willing to do these jobsâ¦ particularly during peak periods of the summer and airports in particular. Airport handling staff and airport security staff are really struggling to recruit, particularly in the southeast, at airports like Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester."" Mr O'Leary has made clear his disagreement with Brexit but says he respects the decision to leave the EU. A government spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU enabled us to introduce a points-based immigration system and we want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK's domestic workforce, such as training, wage increases and better career options, instead of relying on labour from abroad."" Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and Easyjet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. Ryanair's chief claims that reflects the ""strong balance sheet"" the airline had going into Covid, which allowed the company to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of the pandemic so that they were able to resume operations swiftly when restrictions were lifted. There have been delays and long queues at airports in the last few months Mr O'Leary believes relaxing restriction on movement of EU workers across industries facing skills shortages would keep costs lower and so keep prices down for consumers. ""People want good service, they want low prices. And we need a competitive economy for that. It is simply not acceptable to turn around to the vast majority of the British people and say, with nobody to pick or to harvest the food, 'please pay 20% higher food prices.'"" Critics say that allowing for a wider pool of workers, however, keeps wages down. And the Department for Transport has previously noted that there has been disruption in many countries due to staff shortages. ""It is not obvious that reaching for the lever marked 'more immigration' will solve the problem,"" it said. The Ryanair boss concedes that some travellers are likely to face more disruption over the summer but says that should settle down after the peak period. ""I think everybody would be able to staff up and gear up on time as long as we don't have any adverse Covid developments.""

"Ricky Martin, pictured at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year A Puerto Rico judge has lifted a restraining order taken out against Ricky Martin by a family member who had claimed the singer harassed him. The man withdrew a domestic violence complaint he filed earlier this month in which he alleged Martin refused to accept the end of their relationship. Martin had denied the man's claims. Reacting to the judge's decision on Thursday, Martin said he had been the ""victim of a lie"" and that it was now ""time for me to heal"". A judicial spokesperson said the order has been ""archived"", in other words it is now closed. Martin posted a comment from his legal team online, alongside the caption ""truth prevails"", which read: ""Just as we had anticipated, the temporary protection order was not extended by the Court. ""The accuser confirmed to the court that his decision to dismiss the matter was his alone, without any outside influence or pressure, and the accuser confirmed he was satisfied with his legal representation in the matter."" They went on to call the accuser a ""troubled individual"" who ""made false allegations with absolutely nothing to substantiate them"". Allow Twitter content?

At a virtual hearing on Thursday, the man's lawyer requested Judge Raiza Cajigas close the case, Martin's lawyer Joaquin Monserrate also told the Reuters news agency. ""The judge asked the pertinent questions - if anyone had threatened him, if anyone had offered him anything in exchange - and (his lawyer) said no, that it was a voluntary decision,"" said Monserrate said. The judge issued the restraining order on 2 July after the 21-year-old man filed a domestic violence complaint. The man claimed he feared for his safety because Martin would not accept his decision to end a seven-month romantic relationship. The singer has denied any kind of sexual or romantic relationship took place. The restraining order was granted ex parte, which means neither Martin nor his team were in court to respond to the allegations. In a video shared with the media by his publicist, the 50-year-old pop star commented he had been left ""very hurt"" by the allegation. ""It's been almost four decades since I've been working as an artist, under the public eye, and I've never had to deal with something so hurtful like I've lived through these last few weeks,"" he said. ""I was victim of a lie. Unfortunately, the attack came from a family member â¦ I only wish him the best, for him to find the light."" He added: ""A lie can cause so much harm. It harmed me, my husband, my kids, my parents, my family. I couldn't defend myself because there was a legal process I had to follow where I had to be silent until I'd be able to speak to a judge. ""Today was the day. Now, it's time for me to heal. I'm very hurt. I will find peace, the necessary silence to see the light again at the end of the tunnel, like I've always been able to."" In a prior Facebook post, Eric Martin defended his famous brother and suggested the accuser has had mental health issues. Martin is best known for hits such as Livin' La Vida Loca, She Bangs and Nobody Wants to Be Lonely. He came out as gay in 2010, a decade after he shot to fame. As an actor, he has starred in The Assassination of Gianni Versace and is due to appear on the forthcoming comedy series Mrs American Pie alongside Carol Burnett, Kristen Wiig, Josh Lucas and Allison Janney.

"This video can not be played Aerial video shows scale of queues leading up to Dover The Port of Dover has declared a ""critical incident"" due to six-hour queues leading to the ferry terminal. Chief executive Doug Bannister said the port had been ""badly let down"" by French border controls. French authorities said an ""unforeseeable technical incident"" in the Channel Tunnel meant French border police were delayed into Dover. However Eurotunnel rejected this, saying it was ""categorically not the reason for the difficulties"". A spokesman added: ""The critical incident in Dover started overnight.  The minor technical incident at the Channel Tunnel occurred at 07:00 BST, well after the critical incident."" French border resources have now increased, the port said, and ""traffic is slowly beginning to move"". Dover's MP Natalie Elphicke claimed French border officers ""didn't turn up for work"", causing traffic to queue for miles. Holidaymakers are being delayed at French border checks in Dover However in a statement this afternoon, the prefect for the Haut-de-France region,Â Georges-Francois Leclerc, said it was not correct to say that the French had failed to mobilise sufficient border police for the predicted rush. ""The increase in traffic for this weekend was fully anticipated and a suitable deployment was prepared,"" the statement said. ""The plan was to have all the police booths manned at Dover by 08:30 BST. ""An unforeseeable technical incident in the tunnel meant that police had to push back their full deployment by an hour."" The port has warned that it would ""take some time to clear the backlog."" Live updates: Travellers warned of six-hour delays at Dover A UK government spokesperson said they were ""working closely with French authorities, the Port of Dover, Kent Resilience Forum and police to ease disruptionÂ and provide on the ground support"". People are being advised to bring provisions as they face a six-hour delay The leader of Dover District Council, Trevor Bartlett, said: ""Alongside the delays for tens of thousands of tourists, the local community is the biggest loser."" He added: ""Serious questions need to be asked about how the emergency services would be able to respond to a major incident in Dover when it is completely gridlocked, and how this situation has been allowed to develop yet again?"" This video can not be played Watch: 'We arrived in Dover at 7.30 and been in traffic since' Eurotunnel is not affected, but it will not have capacity to take any passengers from Dover. With most schools in England and Wales breaking up for summer this week, the RAC said an estimated 18.8 million leisure trips were planned in the UK between Friday and Monday. That is the most since the company began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014. Francesco Caputo and his three children, aged 12, 11 and 7, were travelling from Southampton to Italy, via Dover, to see family. Speaking this morning he said: ""Everything has gone pear shaped."" The family left Southampton with the advice to arrive two hours before the ferry. ""The ferry we were meant to catch was 07:50 BST. We arrived two hours before, 1.7 miles from the ferry terminal, but we're not even there now. ""I've tried to keep the children busy, so far so good. They've been rather patient."" One traveller posted on Twitter: ""I'm booked onto 8am ferry from Dover and it's total gridlock. Moved 50 metres per hour. At this rate it'll be 34 hours before I get to the port."" Another person attempting to make the Channel crossing said they had been ""waiting five hours and still not in the port"". Ferry operator P&O Ferries has advised passengers to arrive prepared with snacks and water, adding: ""Please be aware that there is heavy traffic at border control in the port of Dover. ""If you are booked to travel today please allow at least six hours to clear all security checks."" The Port of Dover says it is working with the government over the ""logjam"" The UK government blamed French authorities for the delays at Dover, with Europe minister Graham Stewart saying some disruption was inevitable, but the issue laid with French authorities. Ms Elphicke added there had been ""weeks of preparation"" for an anticipated busy week, by the port, the Department for Transport and Kent Resilience Forum, and ""much work with French counterparts too"". She said: ""Despite all this, French border officers didn't turn up for work at the passport controls as needed."" In a statement the Port of Dover said: ""The port is working to do all it can with ferry operators and local partners to assist with clearing the queues caused by inadequate French border capacity. ""We urge French colleagues to adequately resource the border, not just to relieve the current situation, but for the rest of the weekend and indeed the rest of the summer to keep our community clear, to get families on their holidays and to keep essential trade moving."" The port also called on the UK government to continue working with France to make sure this happened. Has your journey been affected by the delays in Dover?

"Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine Families are cutting back on fuel and clothing as rising prices make them question what they can afford, new figures suggest. Petrol and diesel sales fell by 4.3% in June as prices at the pumps hit new records, monthly retail data shows. Clothing sales dropped by 4.7%, as UK inflation reached new highs. Retailers told the Office for National Statistics the figures indicated people were cutting back on spending due to concerns over what they could afford. Prices in the UK are currently risingat their fastest rate for more than 40 years. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9.4% in June, with the increasing cost of petrol and food putting pressure on households' finances. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Although overall retail sales remain above their pre-pandemic levels, ""the broader trend is one of decline"", said Heather Bovill at the ONS. ""Clothing purchases dipped along with household goods, with retailers suggesting consumers cutting back on spending due to higher prices and concerns around affordability,"" she said. ""Fuel sales fell back considerably with retailers reporting the record high prices at the pump hitting sales,"" the deputy director for surveys and economic indicators added. It comes as a new survey by the ONS found around nine-in-10 adults continued to report a rise in their living costs over the past month. Around half (46%) of adults who pay energy bills found it difficult to afford them, up from 43% in the previous period, while 46% of adults said they would not be able to save any money in the next 12 months. The data was collected in early July. Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by a number of countries to reduce their dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, the ONS said, the largest monthly rise on record. Diesel prices also soared by 12.7p per litre. It led to the average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel wereleading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Food sales were the only area to see a boost in June, with volumes rising by 3.1% largely driven by the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday celebrations. ""After a fall in May, food sales picked up due to the Jubilee celebrations, but this was the only sector to report an increase,"" Ms Bovill said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research firm Capital Economics, said the jump in food sales ""was surely due to people stocking up on sausages rolls, cakes and alcohol for jubilee street parties"". But he added that the extra bank holiday ""also appears to have meant people spent less time shopping for other items"", such as clothing and household goods. Silvia Rindone, UK and Ireland retail leader at the accountancy firm EY, said: ""Despite the long Jubilee bank holiday weekend at the start of June, today's ONS retail sales data shows that consumers are feeling the pinch from the rising cost-of-living and are becoming more cautious about where and when they are spending."" Ms Rindone said retailers with robust plans to manage cost inflation are best placed to cope. She added that companies need to ensure they address people's concerns over what they can afford, such as by offering value for money or ""own label"" options. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Ukraine and Russia agree deal to resume grain exports through Ukraine's Black Sea ports Russia's blockade of the ports reduced global grain supplies and increased prices Food prices on commodity markets fell after news of the deal emerged The deal was signed in Turkey, whose government brokered the deal alongside the UN UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres calls it an ""agreement for the world"" and a ""beacon of hope"" He also tells the BBC it's probably the most important thing he's done as head of UN Ukraine ruled out signing a direct deal with Russia - both sides signed ""mirror"" deals Edited by Owen Amos We're pausing our live coverage now, so here's a recap of today's main developments:  Today's live page was written by Aoife Walsh, Catherine Evans, Marita Moloney and Laura Gozzi. It was edited by Owen Amos and Nathan Williams. This video can not be played The agreement - to unblock vital exports of
grain from Ukraine - was signed in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia,
Turkey and the UN secretary general. Richard KagoeReporting from Nairobi Kenyans
continue to reel from the impact of the Russiaâs war on Ukraine.  Like many
other countries in the continent, about one third of wheat imported into the
East African nation comes from Russia and Ukraine.  Prices of wheat flour have
been on the rise and this affected the prices of bread and chapati, a popular
flatbread.  The majority of Kenyans cannot afford chapatis which go for 20 shillings
($0.17) a piece.  The government recently introduced a subsidy to bring down the
price of maize flour, used to make Kenyaâs staple food, ugali.  News of the deal
about resuming grain exports through the Black Sea will be a relief to
many consumers who have been struggling with soaring food prices. Ugali is a Kenyan staple The strategic Snake Island on the Black Sea was recaptured by Ukrainian forces at the end of June Ukraine's infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov - who signed the UN-led deal to unblock grain exports - said the agreement had only been possible thanks to Ukrainian military successes. ""I believe we signed the agreement on our terms because we fully control our water area. ""There is no defeat. No-one is surrendering anything,"" Kubrakov said. Kubrakov citedthe recapture of Snake Island- an island located near several key Ukrainian ports

in the Black Sea - as an ""important moment"" in the military resistance against Russian aggression. As we've been reporting, the grain deal has been welcomed around the world, with the UN secretary general calling it a ""beacon of hope"". But there's caution, too - and a Ukrainian commodities analyst, Elena
Neroba, has told the BBC that she is ""doubtful"" about the deal. Neroba said it's unclear whether the deal covers only the
80 vessels currently in Ukrainian ports - which have a capacity to carry one
million tonnes of grain - or whether it includes the 20 million tonnes
currently held in silos across across the country. Neroba also pointed out the blockade has caused Ukrainian farmers to lose income - which will limit their capactiy to reinvest in farming new crops. That means Ukrainian farms will not be able
to plant next season's crops, causing the price of grain to remain high globally. Nick ThorpeReporting from Romania The Ukrainian cargo ship, Valerii Platanov, docks in Sulina Close
to the mouth of the River Danube at Sulina, 122 ships at anchor ride the Black
Sea surf. Most
are cargo ships, all empty, waiting to go upriver to the Ukrainian Danube ports
of Reni and Izmail, to pick up grain. Since the start of the
Russian blockade of the Ukrainian coast, Romania - and in particular the Chilia and central Sulina arms of the Danube - have played a
growing role in getting Ukrainian exports to the world market. Traveling up the
Chilia arm from Tulcea, we pass many cargo ships at anchor, close to the
Ukrainian shore, waiting their turns at the docks. The Danube here is only seven metres deep. That means barges with a capacity of 1,600 tonnes only load to
1,300. From Reni, itâs a 270 km journey, 36 hours non-stop, up the Danube to Cernavoda and down the canal to Constanta. Their loads are then transferred to deep-seagoing ships. All five of Ukraineâs western neighbours have become transit countries for Ukrainian grain, seeds, vegetable oil, fertilisers and other products. Romanian traders treat news of the grain deal in Istanbul with cautious optimism. By late September, one told me, if the Istanbul agreement holds, cargo vessels could start again from Odesa. Anne SoyReporting from Nairobi The grain export deal signed between Ukraine and Russia will
come as a big relief to the Horn of Africa - a region thatâs facing serious food
shortages caused by drought, and exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, a rare
locust invasion,and the war in Ukraine.   The region relies heavily on imports of grains that make up
their staple diet from Ukraine and Russia.   âFor a country like Somalia where more than 95% of its wheat
comes from Ukraine, imagine the difference that will make,â said Samantha
Power, the US development agencyâs administrator who is visiting the Horn of
Africa.   She said releasing the grains from Ukraine is âan extremely
important piece of a puzzleâ - but also called for more countries to support
efforts to alleviate the suffering of peope affected by drought in the region.   âThere was a food crisis before this invasion,â she said as she announced $225million in aid for Kenya.  About four million Kenyans are on the brink of starvation
following several seasons of failed rains.   The World Food Programme estimates that about 50 million
people could face acute food insecurity in the region - particularly in Somalia,
Djibouti, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Uganda, as well as Kenya. A picuture from February 2021 showing a local farmer walking in a swarm of desert locusts in Meru, Kenya Boris Johnson met President Zelensky in Kyiv in February UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have spoken this afternoon following the UN-brokered deal to get grain out of silos in the Black Sea. Downing Street said Johnson welcomed the deal, and stressed the need for it to be implemented ""in full"". The spokeswoman also said the prime minister ""stressed the UK's ongoing determination to support the Ukrainian people"" and said that ""resolve will not waver, no matter who becomes the next UK prime minister"". She added that Zelensky thanked Johnson for his staunch support for Ukraine, as well as military support being provided by the UK which is making ""a real difference"" in the conflict. It comes after Johnson made a second trip to Kyiv last month where heoutlined the UK's training programme for Ukrainian troops. Today's agreement means ""jobs, salaries and taxes to the budget"", according to a spokesman from President Zelensky's office. Andriy Sybiha, a deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, says: ""During the war, stability on the economic front is an integral part of our victory. Today we have made a very important step in this direction."" The cost of defending Russia's invasion, and the effect of the war on economic output, has had a devastating impact on Ukraine's finances. In April, President Zelensky said the country neededmore than $7bn (Â£5.8bn) in aid every month. Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says the implementation of the agreements signed in Istanbul could start in the ""coming days"". ""I'm talking not only about beginning the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports, but clearly also work in this direction on the export of agricultural products and fertilisers from Russian ports,"" he says. He also tells the Rossiya-24 state TV channel that Russia will not ""take advantage"" of the re-opening of Ukrainian ports. Wael HusseinReporting from Cairo, Egypt Unsubsidised food prices have gone up by 50% since the Russian invasion
of Ukraine. Since then, the country has been struggling to diversify its sources of
buying wheat, adding India to the list of exporters. In late June 2022, the countryâs grain buyer, the General Authority for
Supply Commodities (GASC), bought 815,000 tonnes of wheat, taking advantage of
a recent price slump. The purchase was the largest single acquisition of such goods since 2012
and comprised of 350,000 tonnes of French wheat, 240,000 tonnes of Romanian
wheat, and 50,000 tonnes of Bulgarian wheat, the GASC said. Bread made from wheat is considered a main staple here as around 70
million Egyptians use subsidised bread every day. The authorities
were also thinking of mixing potato with flour to produce bread - but there are
concerns it won't taste as good. Like the EU, the UK has also sounded a note of caution - with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss saying the onus is on Russia to honour its promises. ""Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine has meant some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world are at risk of having nothing to eat,"" she said. ""It is vital that Ukrainian grain reaches international food markets, and we applaud Turkey and the UN Secretary General for their efforts to broker this agreement. The UK and our allies have been pushing hard to reach this point. Now this agreement must be implemented, and we will be watching to ensure Russia's actions match its words.""  The EU has cautiously welcomed today's deal, after it was signed in Turkey. In a tweet, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said: ""Today's Istanbul agreement is a step in the right direction. We call for its swift implementation.""  Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates and reaction. Nduka OrjinmoReporting from Abuja, Nigeria Roadside vendors displays bread for sale at Ketu in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, earlier this year This will come as good news to millions in Nigeria - just a
day after bread disappeared from the shelves as the countryâs bakers' association began a four-day strike to protest at high production costs. Nigeria is the fourth largest importer of wheat in the
world, spending more than $2bn in 2020 to buy the grains. While most of its supply came from Russia, the spike in
global wheat prices led to a rise in prices of items such as pasta, noodles
and bread, some by 50%. Though it will not automatically lead to a cessation of the
four-day strike by the bakersâ association - as there is still the matter of a
15% levy on wheat imports they want the government to remove, among other
things - people can expect some price stability for staple food, amid high
inflation. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent It's not just Ukrainian grain that's important to ease this pressure on
global food supplies - it's also Russian produce and Russian fertiliser. Neither of those are under any kind of international sanctions. But because of the reluctance on the part of international
shipping companie to do business with Russia, Moscow has had all sorts of
problems finding vessels to do its own exports through the Black Sea. The parallel deal that was reached today will address those Russian
concerns about its ability to export as well. These two deals had
to be reached simultaneously because nothing was going to happen unless both
deals were struck. Orla GuerinReporting from Istanbul TheSecretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres,told me the deal to
resume exports of grain from Ukraine is vital for the war-torn nation, and for
many in the developing world who are at risk of famine. He said it wasprobably
the most important thing he has done in his time heading the UN. Guterres emphatically denied Russia was being rewarded under the agreement,
though it too will benefit - Moscow will be helped to get tonnes of its food and
fertiliser to world markets. These items are not covered by sanctions, but
Russia has faced problems exporting them since it invaded its neighbour in
February. He said: It is vital for Ukraine. It is not vital for the Russian Federation. Russia benefits more from the export of fuel. Thatâs where the big business is.""  I asked if it was difficult to negotiate with Russia, as it continues to kill women and children in Ukraine. ""Of course itâs not easy,"" Guterres replied, ""but there is a sense of duty that the Secretary General of the United Nations must have in relation to the whole world."" He admitted that the UN had no means of punishing Russia if it breaches the deal, but he said that would ""an absolutely unacceptable scandal and the whole international community would react in a very strong way."" The four-wary agreement â between Russia, Ukraine, the UN and Turkey - is a considerable diplomatic victory in a brutal war, now in its sixth month. But the UN Secretary General sees little prospect of broader peace talks. ""I'm very worried with the fact that at the present moment, I see no conditions for a peace process. This is clear, not even for a global ceasefire. I donât think we are close to that."" Imogen FoulkesReporting from Geneva United Nations aid agencies will heave a huge sigh of relief
at the deal to unblock Ukraineâs ports. The World Food Programme buys grain
from Ukraine to deliver to countries facing starvation. Last year Ukrainian
grain fed 400 million people. The WFP has had to cut rations to Sudan and
Niger, and has warned that the world ""faces a hunger crisis of catastrophic
proportions"" if the Black Sea ports are not unblocked. The International
Committee of the Red Cross says rising food, fuel, and fertiliser prices linked
to the war in Ukraine have combined with successive drought and conflict in the
Horn of Africa to threaten an ""irreversible humanitarian crisis with an
unimaginable human cost"". New grain supplies, more generous aid deliveries and
a reduction in food prices could save many lives. Today UN officials are
quietly optimistic; they view the port agreement as a kind of mini ceasefire
which might even lead to wider deals. But first the agreement has to be
officially signed, then it has to actually work, and even getting the
necessary cargo ships into the Black Sea could take several weeks. This video can not be played The agreement - to unblock vital exports of
grain from Ukraine - has just been signed in Istanbul by Ukraine, Russia,
Turkey and the UN secretary general. The deal signed by Russia, Ukraine, the UN and Turkey is a ""beacon
of hope"" in the war, the UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. The deal, which representatives from all parties have just signed in
Istanbul, means Russia agrees to a truce to allow grain exports. Turkey will inspect ships to ensure they are not carrying weapons. It's considered a diplomatic victory in the war, which is now entering
its sixth month. But Guterres added
the deal ""did not come easy... it has been a long road"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.2875626e-14

"Uphill challenge - Laura cycling six weeks after surgery Exercise got Laura Butcher through her bowel cancer diagnosis.

She was diagnosed on 23 July last year, but her treatment didn't start until November - one of hundreds who miss the 62-day target every month.

Macmillan Cancer Support said action was needed to get Wales back on track to meet ambitions for 80% to start treatment within the 62-day target time. ""For far too long, and well before this pandemic began, there has been a trend of consistent under-performance on meeting cancer treatment targets in Wales and this worsening trend shows how vitally important it is to put things right,"" said Richard Pugh, head of partnerships for the charity in Wales.

Health minister Eluned Morgan has asked for an explanation and said one reason was that treating people waiting the longest for cancer treatment could have a knock-on further down the list. But she acknowledged that ""it's not good"" and wanted to make inroads very shortly. ""I have made it absolutely clear that this is a priority that I am expecting to see some change,"" she told BBC Wales. The Welsh government said 1,646 people started cancer treatment in May, 15% more than in the previous month, while 11,800 people had been told they hadn't got cancer. Laura said: ""There is still a mindset that this is 'an old man's disease' and I was diagnosed at 39. ""Nobody likes to talk about poo - it's a taboo subject and I've got people talking about it. And that's all I care about. I don't want anyone else going through the same thing as I went through."" Waiting times record, with two years of increases Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed Women's health: Plan to stop 'sexist' NHS care Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Laura with a dedication to the late campaigner and podcaster Dame Deborah James - and showing off 'Etna' - the nickname for her stoma In the past month she's been involved in a new scheme being run by Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board offering prehab and rehab sessions to patients with suspected or confirmed bowel cancer, as well as those with oesophogeal and stomach tumours. Patients attend three sessions a week in the run-up to their surgery or alongside treatment, focusing on exercise, mindfulness and wider emotional and wellbeing support. The goal is to reduce their recovery time in hospital, improving both their own prospects, and freeing up vital beds in hospitals. Rhidian Jones, consultant anaesthetist at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and leader of the prehab programme, said people who are fitter have fewer complications. ""If you have a complication in hospital your length of stay is trebled,"" he said. ""So on average our colorectal cancer patients stay in hospital about six to seven days - if you have a major complication that goes up to three weeks. ""So you can see the massive potential benefit it can have on patient flow through the hospital. It not only benefits the cancer patients, it also benefits our elective work - there's more beds available to do elective knee and hip replacements."" It's an important ambition, given the figures also reveal yet another rise in the numbers waiting for planned care, with record numbers again waiting. Patients who take longer to recover impact on the flow through the hospital, meaning beds aren't available for patients to be admitted when they arrive at A&E. The figures show 66.4% of patients were dealt with within four hours. This is marginally worse than the previous month. There were slight improvements at the hospitals with the worst figures - Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor in north east Wales. There were also almost 10,300 patients waiting 12 hours or more in Wales in June. On average, patients are waiting three hours and two minutes in emergency care before being admitted, discharged or transferred. That's the third longest time on record. Likewise it means more ambulances wait outside hospitals for patients to be seen inside - with the response to immediate life-threatening calls the second worst on record. Only 50.8% of these ""red"" calls had a response within eight minutes. The target is 65%. Welsh Conservatives described the figures as ""grim reading,"" while the Liberal Democrats said the Welsh government needed a ""better handle"" on the crisis. ""What we need to see is real investment in primary health services in local communities, including our GPs to prevent these build-ups at emergency departments,"" said Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth added: ""Money to recruit more staff is only answering part of the problem - our NHS needs more than a sticking plaster to overcome the challenges it faces"". But the Welsh government responded by saying there continued to be a rising demand for emergency care, while ""pressures are being intensified due to challenges with patient flow through the hospital system, as well as staffing constraints including a rise in Covid sickness"". The Welsh NHS Confederation said the health service was ""creaking under these consistently high levels of pressure"" and that money to recruit more ambulance staff was only addressing part of the problem. ""Unless we can improve patient flow and speed up hospital discharge by alleviating the pressure on and creating capacity in social care, we'll continue to see a large number of patients waiting longer than we'd like them to,"" said assistant director Nesta Lloyd-Jones. Overall, the figures for May show more than 722,000 ""patient pathways"" were waiting for hospital treatment, another record high. As one patient may be on more than one ""pathway"" to treatment, if they have different conditions, the number of patients affected will be lower. For the first time, the official figures - for March - put a number on these, so we can estimate that it is likely that more than 560,000 actual patients are waiting for treatment. The Welsh government said there had been progress on reducing the very longest waits. The numbers waiting more than two years for treatment to start has dropped by nearly 3,000 to 65,053, a second monthly drop after a spike during the pandemic. But the number of ""patient pathways"" with waits of more than a year has grown to more than 176,300 - its highest figure since March last year. ""Despite the increase in demand, huge numbers of patients were seen in May with the highest number of inpatient and day case treatments carried out (24,167) since the start of the pandemic,"" said a spokesperson.

"Keeping women safe is now ""at the heart"" of the world's largest dating app, Tinder, it claims. The technology company is launching a partnership with campaign group No More, aiming to end domestic violence. ""Our safety work is never done,"" Tinder's first female chief executive, Renate Nyborg, tells BBC News. But charity End Violence Against Women says it is only a ""small step"" in addressing the disproportionate amount of abuse women experienced online. Tinder has faced scrutiny over abusive interactions on the service, with concerns dating apps are attracting sexual predators. Ms Nyborg, 36, says one of the ways she is addressing those concerns is hiring more women across the company, having increased the number working in the Tinder product team by 30% since taking up the chief executive role, in September 2021. ""I think there is a difference between knowing something is important and feeling it,"" she tells BBC News. ""Like any woman, I can count all of the experiences that I've had that I maybe didn't want to have - from the way that you're being addressed, to the way you're treated at work, to the way things can happen when you're actively dating. ""I think every woman that I speak to has had many experiences like this - and I do think it helps to have some strength in numbers."" Renate Nyborg is the first female CEO of Tinder. End Violence Against Women coalition director Andrea Simon says it is essential dating apps such as Tinder take proactive action to address abuse. ""Dating apps are a really popular way for people to meet each other,"" she says, ""but there is also a really worrying side to the way perpetrators are exploiting this to meet potential victims, resulting in a reported increase in rapes of women using dating apps. ""Tinder's new safety features are a small step to encourage reporting of harassment but do not go far enough to address abuse like rape threats. ""Tech companies like Tinder ultimately profit from a business model that ignores the abuse facilitated by its services. ""It's critical they are held to account for ensuring users' safety."" It is hoped Tinder's partnership with No More will address some of these concerns. The aim is to produce an in-app programme to educate members in safe, competent dating. No More will also provide training to Tinder staff. Ms Nyborg says: ""We believe that positive relationships start with the first swipe. ""The way that you interact with someone, literally from the very first message, may set the tone for the relationships that you have."" No More global executive director Pamela Zaballa tells BBC News: ""I think it is very important for Tinder to make sure that they're educating their users, not only warning them about bad behaviours. ""We are seeing this confliction between digital and in real life, so we need to make sure that anybody who is dating online is safe - and that starts with education. ""We understand the challenges that women have - that's the crux of what we do - but I think safety in general should be a top priority for Tinder and not just women but anyone using the app."" Dating apps have no legal duty of care towards their users. Campaign groups have been calling on the government to address the violence women and girls face, in the Online Safety Bill. But the legislation is now on pause until the autumn, when the government expects to elect a new prime minister. Tinder has launched a number of safety services in the past year. Abusive and harmful messages are now automatically detected, with senders asked""Are you sure?""and recipients ""Does this bother you?"" ""We've seen an increase of 50% in people reporting things that they may not like,"" Ms Nyborg tells BBC News. ""Are you sure?"", meanwhile, has helped reduce inappropriate messages by 10%, data from Match Group - which owns Tinder, Match.com, Meetic, OkCupid, Hinge, and Plenty of Fish - shows. ""We've always invested fundamentally in our trust and safety tools and technologies,"" Ms Nyborg says. ""But since I became CEO, we've started making trust and safety, the heart of some of our marketing campaigns."" In the US, Tinder's in-app safety centre offersbackground checkson matches, through a partnership with non-profit organisation Garbo. And the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network has developed a way of reporting former abusers in a match list. Members can also use apanic button and, in countries where the law allows, ID verification. ""We've been incredibly impressed with the uptake of verification,"" Ms Nyborg says. ""In the months that it's been live, we've seen that almost half of our members will self-select, to verify themselves - the great thing about this is, it's a safety feature."" But Derrian Douglas, 24, from New Jersey, who met her boyfriend on Tinder, says the safety features could be better signposted. ""By saying, 'Hey, we're going to make it really safe for you guys,' people might stay in touch a lot longer and they might feel more comfortable going out and meeting people they normally never would,"" she says. ""I would always let my family know or my friends know where I was going. ""I'd say, 'If I don't reach out to you in a few hours, you know, come find me,' because I think that at the end of the day, you hear a lot of scary stories about dates gone wrong."" Lizzie Atkinson, 27, from Middlesbrough also met her partner on the app. ""I never really considered the in-app safety features of Tinder because I thought the responsibility was on myself to do that,"" she says. ""I would always have my own safety back-ups - things in place to protect myself - like telling my friends, 'I'm going on a date - here's my location.'"" Dimpho Thepa, 24, who has been verbally abused using Tinder in her home city, Johannesburg, agrees. ""You're trying to take measures as a woman to protect yourself,"" she tells BBC News. ""Before I go on a date, I have to tell at least two friends and I'll have to have a code word. ""I also have to have a live location on WhatsApp - it's a whole lot of admin.""

And research for BBC Three documentaryDating's Dangerous Secretsshows: 37% of dating-app users have reported someone for inappropriate behaviour 63% have felt uncomfortable on a date initiated via a dating app 33% have experienced harassment or abuse on such dates A lot of young women worry about meeting people in real life, dating coach and matchmaker Alexis Germany says, ""especially when they're getting invited to 'Netflix and chill' and things like that"".. She advises: On a first date, meet in a public space Do not let anyone call round to collect you Never give out personally identifying information such as your address Let someone know where you are going Turn on your-location services on your phone Ms Nyborg, meanwhile, is keen to reiterate how important safety is for Tinder to stay competitive and relevant.

"This video can not be played Thousands of Welsh jobs depend on the Port Talbot steelworks The owner of the UK's biggest steelworks has warned its sites could be shut without subsidies for reducing carbon emissions, reports claim. Tata Group wants to reach a deal for the UK government to provide Â£1.5bn towards this,the Financial Times says,external. The UK's biggest steelworks, in Port Talbot, employs 4,000 people. The UK government said steel ""plays a critical role"" in the UK economy and Tata was ""a valued steel producer and significant employer"". It comes as Tata's former head of strategy, Nirmalya Kumar, told BBC Wales the Port Talbot plant had not been profitable for 15 years and his answer would be to ""close it down"". Call to help steel firms decarbonise Industry's 23 million tonne carbon problem Speaking to the FT, Tata Group chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said: ""A transition to a greener steel plant is the intention that we haveâ.â.â.âBut this is only possible with financial help from the government. ""We have been in discussions over the last two years and we should come to an agreement within 12 months. Without this, we will have to look at closures of sites."" The report says Tata wants to close two blast furnaces at Port Talbot and build two electric arc furnaces, that will be less carbon intensive. However, the FT adds this process will cost about Â£3bn, with Tata seeking Â£1.5bn from the UK government. Thousands of Welsh jobs are linked to Port Talbot steelworks Mr Kumar said when he left Tata in 2016 the losses had ""skyrocketed to Â£1m a day"". ""It's not a problem that has happened in the last year, it has been a problem for the last 15 years,"" he said. The current professor of marketing at Singapore Management University said he believed the site needed government support for a profitable future. ""As a dispassionate business person the answer is to close it down,"" he explained. ""The other perspective is we can continue and there is a path to profitability if it is converted into a more efficient process. Having said that we can't justify the investment as a business person unless the government participates."" This video can not be played What do people in Port Talbot think about the possible closure of the steelworks? Union Unite said it had ""grave concerns"" about the situation, with national officer Tony Brady saying: ""The words of Mr Chandrasekaran will hang heavy over the steel towns of Wales this morning, and in particular at Port Talbot. ""The steel industry is central to the economy of Wales and as a critical foundation industry must be maintained at all costs."" Steel is currently responsible for 14% of the climate-warming gases produced by UK industry A spokesman for the Community union said: ""This intervention from Tata is shocking, and has been made without any consultation with the trade unions. ""For months we've been in discussions with the company, but we should be clear there is no agreement on the decarbonisation roadmap."" The spokesman said its experts had been exploring low carbon options that will protect steelmaking in the UK, adding: ""That process is unfinished, but Tata's comments make a mockery of the company's commitments to an open and transparent dialogue with the unions."" Tata Steel employs about 6,600 people in Wales Responding to the news, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said the steelworks in Port Talbot made the ""best steel money can buy"". Mr Kinnock described the plant in Port Talbot as being ""a huge part of the pride in our community"", where thousands are employed ""in good relatively well paid jobs"". He told BBC Radio Wales that ""we have to do whatever it takes"" to keep steelmaking in the town, and added: ""If we don't have a partnership, an industrial partnership on strategy between government and industry. You are not going to be able to make any of the changes not just in the steel industry but across the board. ""There isn't a single country in the world where the government isn't partnering with industry to make this stuff happen, so I think the steel workers in my constituency are going to be waking up this morning with yet another worrying story. ""We've been in this constant state of flux in the steel industry."" Regulator accused of failing steel pension members Poo converts CO2 to useful chemicals In total, Tata employs 8,000 people across the UK, with half of these in Port Talbot, and thousands more indirectly through the supply chain. Like all industrial groups that emit carbon dioxide, it has been asked to cut these, and executives have been in discussion with the UK government. Charlotte Childs from the GMB union told the FT: ""This is deeply worrying news. ""UK steel is a critical part of the nation's industrial infrastructure and central to our national securityâ.â.â. It's essential the government act quickly and show they are serious about this vital industry."" A UK government spokesman said: ""Steel plays a critical role in all areas of the UK economy and Tata is a valued steel producer and significant employer in the UK. ""Our ongoing support for the sector's low-carbon transition includes the Â£289m Industrial Energy Transformation Fund and more than Â£1bn to help with energy efficiency, decarbonisation, low-carbon infrastructure and for research and development."" The Welsh government said a ""successful, low carbon future"" for Welsh steel was ""entirely possible"". It called the industry ""a crucial cornerstone to our economy"", adding: ""We have repeatedly called on UK ministers to urgently bring forward a package of support to secure steel-making at Port Talbot.""

"Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine Families are cutting back on fuel and clothing as rising prices make them question what they can afford, new figures suggest. Petrol and diesel sales fell by 4.3% in June as prices at the pumps hit new records, monthly retail data shows. Clothing sales dropped by 4.7%, as UK inflation reached new highs. Retailers told the Office for National Statistics the figures indicated people were cutting back on spending due to concerns over what they could afford. Prices in the UK are currently risingat their fastest rate for more than 40 years. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9.4% in June, with the increasing cost of petrol and food putting pressure on households' finances. Why are prices rising so quickly? Pay falls at fastest rate on record as prices soar Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Although overall retail sales remain above their pre-pandemic levels, ""the broader trend is one of decline"", said Heather Bovill at the ONS. ""Clothing purchases dipped along with household goods, with retailers suggesting consumers cutting back on spending due to higher prices and concerns around affordability,"" she said. ""Fuel sales fell back considerably with retailers reporting the record high prices at the pump hitting sales,"" the deputy director for surveys and economic indicators added. It comes as a new survey by the ONS found around nine-in-10 adults continued to report a rise in their living costs over the past month. Around half (46%) of adults who pay energy bills found it difficult to afford them, up from 43% in the previous period, while 46% of adults said they would not be able to save any money in the next 12 months. The data was collected in early July. Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves by a number of countries to reduce their dependence on Russian oil. Average petrol prices rose by 18.1p per litre in June, the ONS said, the largest monthly rise on record. Diesel prices also soared by 12.7p per litre. It led to the average family car costing more than Â£100 to fill up, according to the RAC. However, the AA said this week that lower wholesale costs of fuel wereleading to cheaper prices at the pumps, though they still remain much higher than last year. Food sales were the only area to see a boost in June, with volumes rising by 3.1% largely driven by the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday celebrations. ""After a fall in May, food sales picked up due to the Jubilee celebrations, but this was the only sector to report an increase,"" Ms Bovill said. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research firm Capital Economics, said the jump in food sales ""was surely due to people stocking up on sausages rolls, cakes and alcohol for jubilee street parties"". But he added that the extra bank holiday ""also appears to have meant people spent less time shopping for other items"", such as clothing and household goods. Silvia Rindone, UK and Ireland retail leader at the accountancy firm EY, said: ""Despite the long Jubilee bank holiday weekend at the start of June, today's ONS retail sales data shows that consumers are feeling the pinch from the rising cost-of-living and are becoming more cautious about where and when they are spending."" Ms Rindone said retailers with robust plans to manage cost inflation are best placed to cope. She added that companies need to ensure they address people's concerns over what they can afford, such as by offering value for money or ""own label"" options. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Education unions have accused the government of risking a ""full-blown funding crisis"" for schools with their latest offer on teachers' pay. The Department for Education has announced a rise of 5% for teachers and more for early-career salaries. Five unions representing the majority of teachers said the plans would put pressure on stretched school budgets and exacerbate staffing shortages. The government has described the offer as the most generous for years. The proposal would see all teachers who have been in the profession more than five years receive a 5% rise in the next academic year. Those in the first five years of their career would get between 5% and 8%, while new starters outside of London would get 8.9%. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9.4% in the 12 months to June from 9.1% in May, according to the latest figures. Millions of workers get below-inflation pay rises Should public sector workers get bigger pay rises? A joint statement criticising the plans has been released by the Association for School and College Leaders (ASCL), the NAHT school leaders' union, the NEU and NASUWT teaching unions, and Community, the union for education professionals. It said that inflation meant the rise represented a real-terms cut to the salaries of most teachers and would worsen staff shortages already affecting the ""vast majority"" of schools. It is also expected that schools will not receive additional money to fund the rise, and will have to cover it out of their existing budgets. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that, even with the rise, the real value of teachers' will have fallen by 12% since 2010. Announcing the proposals on Tuesday, the government said they aimed to ""strike a careful balance between recognising the vital importance of public sector workers, whilst delivering value for the taxpayer and managing the broader economic context"". It added that ""double-digit pay awards for public sector workers would lead to sustained higher levels of inflation"" and that ""this would have a far bigger impact on people's real incomes in the long run"". It also said the next financial year would see the core schools budget rise by Â£1.5bn, on top of an increase of Â£4bn that went into this year's budget. Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said the government was ""being dishonest with the profession and with the public by offering the illusion of a pay award whilst in reality they are refusing to provide the means for schools to deliver it"". Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said: ""This is no way to ensure that children receive the quality of education they deserve. It is a reckless gamble with the future of the country."" The NEU and ASCL have both said they will be consulting with their members over industrial action in the autumn.

"Kim Lloyd is struggling to make ends meet Student nurse Kim Lloyd is down to her last pound. It is not much to show for a week where she's done 37.5 hours unpaid on a ward placement and 24 hours of paid work. Her situation is not unique - with students' unions warning of people struggling to stay in education and pay rent, transport and food bills. The Welsh government said it was committed to helping all students and ""provides the most generous living costs grants in the UK"". ""Over the last two years there's been times I've wanted to quitâ¦ but I've carried on going because it's something I really want to do,"" said Kim, 33, from Welshpool. University students 'priced out' of graduation 'I had to choose between heating or my teeth' ""Hopefully I'll be able to get through the next year and qualify and be in a good job at the end of it but it's very difficult. ""It just makes me feel sad for other students because if I'm in this situation, I dread to think what other students are going through."" Kim, 33, is a trainee nurse at Bangor University, and is on a placement on a ward at Wrexham's Maelor Hospital. Kim is on placement at Wrexham Maelor Hospital as she pursues her ambition of becoming a nurse When she is on placement, there is a limit to the amount of paid work she can do - no more than two 12-hour shifts. But even that can affect her studies. ""It can impact on my [university] work and time management of meeting all my deadlinesâ¦ and making sure my work's not suffering. ""My grades matter to me, but then I need money to be able to survive and live. It's just a vicious circle,"" she added. Cost of living: Cake firm's Â£43k butter bill How to cope with rising bills Her income is a mixture of student loans and paid work - and it's eaten up by rent, diesel and food every month. Kim said: ""Roughly, I aim to bring in around Â£1,000 a month, and it's not quite enough. ""I can't physically do any more shifts than what I'm doing. ""It depends what I've got going out to how much I am left over with, but this week I am down to my last pound. She said the situation leaves her asking ""why am I bothering?"", but although life is ""tough going"", she wants to succeed and start her new career. Kim describes her fridge as ""quite empty,"" with a small carton of milk, half a tub of butter, and a few ""not-so-good-looking vegetables"". ""I don't buy brands. Bread, I buy a loaf and I freeze it and I kind of try and budget my loaf of bread. ""I actually have a little planner on my fridge saying I can only have three slices of bread one week. The cheapest stuff I can get, I will buy,"" she said. Cara Walters said everyone she has spoken to is concerned about next year Kim is worried about how she is ""going to survive"" the final year of her degree which starts in September, but her concerns are not unique. Cara Walters will be a second year student at Swansea University in the autumn. A summer job will help with fuel costs, but she is aware of the financial burden on her parents who have another daughter in school. Cara said: ""Everyone is worrying about next year. ""Definitely there will have to be cutbacks on socialising. I've had to look for a cheaper house to live because the rent on where I was living was getting so expensive."" She thinks the government could increase grants to help students. Nyah Lowe is seeing more and more students struggling Bangor University Students' Union president Nyah Lowe said: ""We're hearing an increasing number of students really struggling to pay their rent, pay food bills, and just generally living costs. ""We've had multiple cases of students saying that they want to drop out of university because they don't have the financial funds to support them."" She believes Covid has had a big effect: ""We're seeing huge amounts of social anxiety with our students and it's making it hard for them to reach out to us for support."" According to the National Union of Students, who surveyed 567 students in Wales, 92% were concerned about their ability to manage financially. Their survey found 89% of respondents said financial worries had had an impact on their mental health. The students' union is concerned some will be hit worse than others. Why are things so hard for so many people? 'Fuel costs make it too expensive to work' Student nurses or teachers who have to pay rising fuel costs to travel to placements, as well as mature students with children or dependents, could be under the most pressure. Ms Lowe wants the Welsh government to support these people and recognise ""students doesn't just mean students under the age of 18"". Sue Chingombe-Smith said she has noticed less people around campus and puts it down to the cost of living Mother-of-three Sue Chingombe-Smith, 44, from Anglesey, is studying for a PhD in mental health sciences at Bangor University. She noticed a big change recently and said: ""I can't afford to come to the library as often as I used to do over the years. ""I have to make maybe one trip per week, because of the fuel costs."" Sue and her husband have bills to pay, as well as three children under 18. She has taken on a job as a mental health support worker to bring in more money. ""The job itself is physically and mentally draining and at the end of the day I'm too tired to study,"" she said. Originally from Zimbabwe, she said education is a highly-prized ""life-changing process"" for people from Africa. She fears others following in her footsteps won't be able to afford to carry on learning, and said she knows of one person who has had suicidal thoughts at the prospect of having to drop out. A Welsh government spokeswoman said: ""Living costs should never be a barrier to studying at university, which is why Wales provides the most generous living costs grants in the UK. ""We have made a further Â£15m available for the Discretionary Assistance Fund which can provide financial support for those experiencing extreme financial pressures. This will enable us to extend the additional support we have put in place via the fund until the end of March 2023, ensuring those who need it can access emergency support for their immediate living costs. ""We remain committed to widening access to higher education, ensuring it is available to all who can benefit throughout their lives.""

"Long NHS waiting times appear to be pushing people into paying thousands of pounds for private treatment. There were 69,000 self-funded treatments in the UK in the final three months of last year - a 39% rise on the same period before the pandemic. Experts said it was a sign of how desperate people had become. The BBC has seen evidence of people taking out loans and resorting to crowdfunding to pay for private treatment. The figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) do not include those who have private insurance - instead they are the people paying the full cost of treatment themselves, leaving them liable for huge bills. The numbers paying for care topped 250,000 last year. For common operations like hip and knee replacements, the costs can top Â£15,000. Patient groups warned there was a risk of a two-tier system being created, with the poorest losing out because they were the least likely to be able to afford to pay for treatment. Katie was told she would have to wait up to two years for her operation Katie Hopper, 19, had been struggling with knee problems for a number of years, but it got so bad this year she ended up effectively stuck in bed and unable to work. She was suffering with dislocations, nerve pain and muscle spasms, which were preventing her working as an apprentice engineer or playing basketball, at which she competed at a high level. ""I was pretty much bedbound. I was feeling very isolated and very lonely. My mental health was definitely suffering,"" she said. Katie was told it could be up to two years before she would get the treatment she needed on the NHS. ""I couldn't wait that long. I would have lost my job. It is a very active job and I couldn't do it."" In the end, she took out a loan to pay for the treatment to be done privately in April at Spire Southampton Hospital. It cost more than Â£7,000 with the follow-up physiotherapy she needed, but she was operated on within two weeks. She is now back working and has even started playing basketball again. ""It has put me under financial pressure, but it was worth it 100%. You can earn money, but you can't earn back time."" There are now more than 6.6 million people waiting for hospital treatment in England - one in nine of the population - and ministers have warned it could be 2024 before the numbers start coming down. More than a third of them have been waiting more than the target time of 18 weeks. Similar problems are being seen in other parts of the UK. The PHIN data showed there were big variations in how much the levels of self-funded treatment had risen. Comparing the last three months of 2021 with the same period in 2019, Wales and Scotland showed the biggest jumps at 90% and 84%. Northern Ireland rose by 34% in comparison - although some providers have not reported into PHIN yet so when more data is added the figure could be higher still. In England, the East Midlands was the region that saw the biggest increase, up by 75%. Overall the data shows clear drops in people self-funding when the pandemic hit. But before the pandemic the numbers were steady - with about 50,000 people paying for their own treatment every three months. From April, about 70,000 people were self-funding every three months. Some of this is likely to be the system catching up, given the drop in treatments during 2020. But patient groups said it was also a clear sign of desperation, and another illustration of just how bad waiting lists had got in the NHS. Brenda Pugh developed severe osteoarthritis in late 2019 and was told she needed a double hip replacement. She got one on the NHS, but had to go private for the other. She was only able to do this after a person heard about her case when they saw her interviewed by the BBC last year. She had the Â£11,000 operation in February and said it ""absolutely changed my life"". But Ms Pugh, who is in her early 60s, said there were thousands of people in her position who were still suffering because they were unable to get treatment. ""It's not right. We've all paid our National Insurance contributions, we've all paid our dues and to not be able to get the treatment is justâ¦ immoral is probably quite a strong word but I'll use it."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said waits for treatment were one of the most common concerns flagged by patients, and warned the situation risked ""widening health inequalities"". Chief executive Louise Ansari said for most people going private ""simply isn't an option"", especially with the cost-of-living crisis. ""People on the lowest incomes are the most likely to wait the longest for NHS treatment. This leads to a worse impact on their physical health, mental health and ability to work and care for loved ones."" Jonathon Holmes, of the King's Fund health think tank, said the figures were ""worrying"". ""The risk is we're left with a two-tier system where some people have to wait too long for care and others feel forced to bust the bank to get the care they need."" Mr Tim Mitchell from the Royal College of Surgeons of England told the BBC Today Programme that surgeons were working extremely hard to address the NHS backlog. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said there was a clear plan to tackle the Covid backlog, with new surgical hubs and community diagnostic clinics being set up. ""Good progress is being made on cutting longest waiting times, with the number of patients waiting over two years for treatment falling by more than 80% since February,"" he added.

"This video can not be played David Strang says addicts need ""treatment, care and support"" The head of Scotland's drug deaths taskforce has called for an overhaul of addiction services and reform of drugs laws to halt overdose deaths. David Strang made the comments asthe Scottish government-established group published its final report.,external Its ""Changing Lives"" report makes 20 recommendations and 139 action points that it says will help turn around Scotland's record drug death numbers. In 2020,1,339 people died as a result of a drug overdose. That was more than three times the rate of the rest of the UK and the highest in Europe. Mr Strang - a former chief inspector of prisons and ex-chief constable of Lothian and Borders Police - echoed earlier calls for a ""public health approach"" to the crisis. He said: ""We've had the Misuse of Drugs Act for 50 years and we've tried locking people up for possession of drugs and we just know that that is not the solution. ""This is an issue of addiction, which needs treatment, care and support, and compassion - not stigmatisation, discrimination and criminalisation."" The drug deaths taskforce was set up in 2019 as Scotland recorded more than 1,000 deaths a year for the first time. Drug deaths chief resigned over 'rushed job' Former police chief to head drugs death taskforce Since then, it has distributed around Â£14m in funding to projects aimed at driving down deaths. These include the rollout of overdose prevention drug Naloxone to police and other emergency services, as well as the development of new treatment standards. The Scottish government said it ""welcomed"" the publication of the final report and it would consider its recommendations in detail. The group's recommendations include: Fully implementing new Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) standards - relating to opiod replacement drugs like methadone - across Scotland within two years Developing an extensive Naloxone network Better outreach after non-fatal overdoses The group also recommends more data sharing between services and policy makers, putting more emphasis on families and those with experience of drug use. It also calls for the UK government to reform the Misuse of Drugs Act to allow for drug injecting facilities. But Mr Strang said the task force is ""not going as far"" as recommending authorities decriminalise drug possession. He said: ""If the problem is people's addiction, then you are not going to solve that by punishing them. That won't act as a deterrent. ""People need treatment, care and support."" He added: ""Often, the recovery communities pick up the pieces at the margins. But we are saying they should be much closer to the heart of delivery of services and treatment. ""Often people who have been on that journey and that was a very powerful help for them."" A Home Office spokeswoman said that any death due to drug misuse was a tragedy. She added: ""Ourrecently published 10-year drugs strategy,externalwill support people through treatment and recovery, as well as an even tougher response to criminal supply chains and the demand that fuels these illegal markets."" Kevin was addicted to a cocktail of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and street Valium If it wasn't for Naloxone, Kevin wouldn't be here today. The 49-year-old was revived nine times by support workers in 2021 after being found unresponsive in Glasgow city centre. He'd taken cocktails of drugs that included heroin, cocaine and street Valium. Kevin said: ""Some of them were uppers. Some were down. The smack was just to keep me level. The cocaine, I liked the rush. The street Valium I took because they made me forget everything. ""It was horrible getting revived. You come out of it feeling strung out and rotten, so you're just automatically away to get another one [bag of heroin]. ""I've since learned that that could be the reason I was overdosing all the time. Although, you've been brought out of it, the drugs are still in your system, so as soon as you go get something else, you're collapsing again."" Eventually, Kevin accepted help from the Simon Community and now volunteers with the charity. He has been sober for nine months and is taken opioid replacement Buvidal. ""The Simon Community is wrap around care,"" he said. ""It gave me a purpose, it gave me a reason to want to get straight, to keep going, to get my house, to get my life stable, to help somebody else. ""Naloxone kept me breathing, the support made me want to live."" Mr Strang was appointed chief of the taskforce in Januaryfollowing the resignation of Prof Catriona Matheson, who said she was not prepared to do a ""rushed job"" on the final report. Prof Matheson told the BBC the latest report was ""miles away"" from a prioritised, actionable and evidence-based plan which the taskforce was recruited to provide. She added: ""It endorses why I was right to resign rather than be forced to try to deliver a report with no teeth and little constructive direction for those who are now being told to deliver change at local level. ""Those at risk, are still at risk, and deserve better."" Quarterly figures from Police Scotland suggest 2021 may have seen a reduction in drug-related death. However, the official statistics from National Records for Scotland will be released next Thursday. Mr Strang said any reduction would ""not take the number of drug deaths below three a day"". He added: ""If we are serious about reducing those shocking statistics of the number of people who die from drug overdoses, then we need to implement this report and make the changes that are needed."" Last month, a Public Health Scotland report revealedaddiction services are still missing key targets for treatmentdespite increased investment. It came after a watchdog called formore transparency in how extra money was being spent by services tackling drug deaths. In January, the previous head of the taskforce, Professor Catriona Matheson, told BBC Scotland she resigned asshe was not prepared to do a ""rush job"" by publishing its final report six months early. Drugs Policy Minister Angela Constance said many of the taskforce's recommendations had already been implemented, but there were areas where the Scottish government wanted to go ""far further"". She said the Scottish government had announced Â£1.1m of new investment into public health surveillance projects to improve understanding of harms. Ms Constance added: ""With the backing of an additional Â£250m over the course of this parliament, we are focussed on delivery and change on the ground, to provide meaningful improvement in people's lives."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross criticised the SNP's plans for another independence referendum, which he said used time and resources that should be spent on lives lost to drugs. He added his party'sRight to Recovery billwould be a game changer in the fight against drug deaths - and that Ms Constance could back it to go through Parliament now. Similarly, Scottish Labour's drug policy spokesperson Claire Baker added there was ""no time to waste"" and urged the Scottish government to use ""every lever at their disposal"" to tackle shortcomings raised in the taskforce's report. Scottish Liberal Democrat drugs emergency spokesperson Ben Lawrie said the Scottish government had been careless over the drugs crisis and his party would continue to push for radical forms.

"Sir Keir Starmer has said he ""really hated"" being subject to a criminal investigation into whether he broke coronavirus rules. An inquiry was launched after the Labour leader was filmed drinking beer in a colleague's office in April 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place. But, earlier this month Durham Police cleared him of breaching the rules. Sir Keir said the probe had been like a ""burden"" and he was ""massively pleased"" by the police decision. When the investigation was launched, the Labour leader promised to step down if he was fined by the police. Starmer cleared by police over Durham event Keir Starmer's search for a vision goes on Keir Starmer's Durham drink - what were the rules? The police inquiry came after months during which Sir Keir had attacked Prime Minister Boris Johnson for breaking coronavirus rules. Speaking to Sky News' Beth Rigby, Sir Keir said he knew ""in his gut"" that he would have to resign if found guilty but wanted to talk it through with his wife before making the announcement. ""Everything I've ever done, been a lawyer, I've worked in Northern Ireland, I've been director of public prosecutions, been an MP, leader of the Labour Party, I put all of that on the line.

""I don't think I am boring,"" he said, but added: ""I'm not going to pretend that I think that politics is a branch of the entertainment business, it's not."" ""Running the country is a very serious issue and you need serious politicians to do it."" He added that voters were not saying: ""We need a few more one-liners.""

""If you're in government... then you have to resolve these issues, you have to make sure that the negotiations complete successfully. ""You can't have a cabinet meeting and then go out onto the picket line.

"Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has said that in December 2021 he flew back from an overseas government trip to stop a Covid lockdown which was ""hours"" away from being announced. The ex-chancellor told LBC a lockdown would have damaged businesses and he successfully fought hard to stop one. At the time, the Omicron variant was spreading rapidly and new restrictions had been introduced. Ministershad saidthey couldn't rule out a Christmas lockdown. Speaking to LBC radio's Andrew Marr, Mr Sunak said he had feared the country was ""sleepwalking into another national lockdown"" and that a press conference had been scheduled to announce new restrictions. Mr Sunak argued this proved he was ""prepared to push hard and fight for the things I believe in, even when that is difficult"". What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Truss says Tory economic policy choked off growth Why newspapers matter in race to be next PM On 8 December 2021, the government implemented its 'plan B' measures which included making face masks compulsory in most public places and asking people to work from home. Rising Omicron cases had led to fears that Christmas get-togethers would be cancelled, as they had been the previous year. On 16 December,it was reportedthat Mr Sunak cut short a trip in the US for talks with businesses concerned about the impact of the Omicron variant. The BBC was told that civil servants had produced three options for future Covid measures - ranging in severity. In the event, no lockdown was announced in England meaning families could see each other over Christmas. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland introduced tighter rules. Analysis by political correspondent David Wallace Lockhart Rishi Sunak outlined quite a dramatic sequence of events - flying back to the UK to prevent a lockdown in England with just hours to spare. What he didn't mention was that he was on the receiving end of quite a bit of criticism at that point for being in California when the Omicron variant was surging. But he did come back from overseas early, and tonight he stressed that he fought ""very hard"" to stop this potential lockdown. A number of government sources have told me that he was far from a lone voice around the cabinet table when it came to opposing this step. But, with the economy as the focus of the debate to be the next prime minister, Mr Sunak is keen to stress that he backed keeping businesses open. The alternative may well have been further taxpayer support. During the interview, Mr Sunak also said he was best placed to defeat Labour arguing that ""all the evidence we have today"" showed his opponent Liz Truss would not win the next general election. He also said her tax plans would lead to higher inflation and that most people appreciated that money borrowed during the pandemic had to be paid back. Mr Sunak has previously promised to cut personal taxes once inflation is more manageable. He said his life ""would be easier"" if he could promise to do ""lovely things"" but added ""that wouldn't be leadership and it would damage trust"". ""Promising a bunch of things I don't think are right or deliverable would be wrong."" Mr Sunak said it was important to restore ""trust"" and promised he would appoint a new independent ethics adviser as one of his first acts as prime minister. The post is currently empty, afterLord Geidt resignedaccusing Boris Johnson of putting him in an ""impossible and odious"" position. Asked if he would bring back Lord Geidt, Mr Sunak said he ""probably"" would because he thought he did a good job. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss has defended her plans as ""affordable"" and said putting up taxes was ""choking off growth"". This video can not be played Liz Truss on her former Treasury role: ""I controlled public spending effectively."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, she said: ""We have had a consensus of the Treasury, of economists, with the Financial Times, with other outlets, peddling a particular type of economic policy for 20 years. It hasn't delivered growth."" Later in the day she told reporters she was Labour's worst nightmare and would ""challenge their orthodoxy"". Tax has become the key battleground between the two candidates who are vying for votes from the roughly 160,000 Conservative Party members who will pick the next leader, and prime minister. A YouGov poll has suggested Ms Truss is currently leading Mr Sunak by 24 points among Conservative voters. Ballot papers will be sent out to members at the beginning of August and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Hustings are due to take place throughout July and August, with the two candidates participating in a BBC TV debate on Monday. The winner of the contest will take over from Boris Johnson, who was forced to announce his own resignation earlier this month.

"Michael O'Leary has said he disagrees with Brexit but respects the decision to leave the EU Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has urged the UK government to take a more ""practical, common sense"" approach to post-Brexit policy, to allow more workers from Europe to fill vacancies. Mr O'Leary said he could hire people from continental Europe for jobs that he cannot fill with British workers, but is unable to get visas for them. Facilitating such visas would help ease disruption to air travel, he said. The government said it wanted firms to invest in workers from the UK. Mr O'Leary said: ""I can hire thousands of people in Portugal, in Italy, France, Germany at exactly the same wages that I'm paying in the UK and I just can't hire them in the UK at the moment. ""And we have this bizarre situation at the moment that in the UK I can get visas to bring Moroccans to come in and work as cabin crew. But I can't get visas for Portuguese or Italians or Slovakian youngsters. We just need a bit of more common sense and a practical approach to how we implement Brexit,"" he told BBC Radio 4. Emirates to cap Heathrow summer ticket sales Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Don't expect great summer experience, warns airport boss Ex-airline worker: It would be like going back to an ex He said enabling such visas would help ease the disruption currently being felt at some airports, and ease skill shortages in other areas. ""There are not enough people in the UK willing to do these jobsâ¦ particularly during peak periods of the summer and airports in particular. Airport handling staff and airport security staff are really struggling to recruit, particularly in the southeast, at airports like Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester."" Mr O'Leary has made clear his disagreement with Brexit but says he respects the decision to leave the EU. A government spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU enabled us to introduce a points-based immigration system and we want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK's domestic workforce, such as training, wage increases and better career options, instead of relying on labour from abroad."" Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and Easyjet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. Ryanair's chief claims that reflects the ""strong balance sheet"" the airline had going into Covid, which allowed the company to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of the pandemic so that they were able to resume operations swiftly when restrictions were lifted. There have been delays and long queues at airports in the last few months Mr O'Leary believes relaxing restriction on movement of EU workers across industries facing skills shortages would keep costs lower and so keep prices down for consumers. ""People want good service, they want low prices. And we need a competitive economy for that. It is simply not acceptable to turn around to the vast majority of the British people and say, with nobody to pick or to harvest the food, 'please pay 20% higher food prices.'"" Critics say that allowing for a wider pool of workers, however, keeps wages down. And the Department for Transport has previously noted that there has been disruption in many countries due to staff shortages. ""It is not obvious that reaching for the lever marked 'more immigration' will solve the problem,"" it said. The Ryanair boss concedes that some travellers are likely to face more disruption over the summer but says that should settle down after the peak period. ""I think everybody would be able to staff up and gear up on time as long as we don't have any adverse Covid developments.""

"Zainab Deen died with her two-year-old son The stories of four ""forgotten"" victims of the Grenfell tragedy have been heard. The official public inquiry into the 2017 disaster has heard the last submissions from lawyers on behalf of the 72 people who died. Zainab Deen, her son Jeremiah, Denis Murphy and Mohammad Alhajali perished on the 14th floor. The inquiry is due to resume on 7 November with closing statements from lawyers, before a report is published. London Fire Brigade (LFB) told eight residents to wait in flat 113 on the 14th floor, the inquiry was told. Four were escorted to safety at 02:30 BST, but the remaining four died after firefighters received confused instructions on their whereabouts, the inquiry heard. Seventy-two people died in the blaze at the tower block on 14 June 2017 ""The forgotten four"", as Allison Munroe QC called them, were single mother Ms Deen, 32, her son Jeremiah, their Irish neighbour Mr Murphy, 56, and Syrian refugee Mr Alhajali, 23. Three of the victims died from the effects of smoke inhalation over the course of a few hours. Mr Alhajali, a civil engineering student, survived the longest but fell from a window as he tried to escape at about 04:00. His body was found face-up and covered in debris on Grenfell Walk. Tributes were paid to each resident. Jeremiah was trapped with his mother on the 14th floor Ms Deen, originally from Sierra Leone in west Africa, was described by friend Francis Dean as ""like champagne, very bubbly"", and her son as ""a very clever and happy child"". She had escaped ""an unhappy and tormented"" marriage and homelessness, and was proud of securing a tenancy in the tower to start a new life with her son. Ms Deen had been due to start a waitressing job on 19 June, and Mr Dean said she had been ""dancing for joy at the prospect"". The inquiry heard that during an hour-long 999 call on the night of the fire, Ms Deen pleaded with emergency services to save her son, before telling them he had died. She succumbed to the smoke while still on the line. Denis Murphy was the 57th person to be identified as a victim of the blaze Mr Murphy had lived in the tower for over three decades, was from a ""large and loving Irish family"" and was described by friends as ""integral to the Grenfell community"" because he was always helping other residents. The Hammersmith-born resident loved Chelsea FC, and was like an uncle to many of the children in the North Kensington block, the inquiry heard. Mr Alhajali, from Damascus, had also been taken to wait in flat 113 with his brother Omar, who was among those escorted to safety and who desperately implored firefighters to return. His parents and two sisters had stayed in Syria, and the Grenfell Tower Inquiry heard that he had ""dreamed one day he would be able to bring his family together in one place where they would be able to settle and live their best life"". Mohammad Alhajali came to London as a refugee having fled his home country of Syria The inquiry's lead counsel Richard Millett QC said: ""There can be nobody who ever had a heart who, hearing those presentations, could remain unmoved and unthinking. ""My team and I can only admire the dignified bearing of those left behind - the grieving families who still travel the hard road. ""They have endured many months of detailed and often dry evidence with patience, and they have now heard graphic and unsparing accounts in modest and silent reflection. ""Their dignity and their courage in the face of the ineffable horror is its own tribute - a light shining out in the darkness."" He said the panel had more than 300,000 documents to consider over the coming months, until the inquiry resumed for final statements. Closing the hearing, the chair Sir Martin Moore-Bick said ""many mistakes were made and many witnesses have acknowledged that they or the organisations they represented failed in one way or another to meet the standards to be expected of them"". But he said it was ""important to direct criticism at those who truly bear responsibility"". ""We need to complete as quickly as possible but if our report is to carry weight and the recommendations to have real force, it must be comprehensive, well reasoned and persuasive,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Watch: Tense scenes in Sri Lanka - BBC reporter on the ground Security forces in Sri Lanka raided the main anti-government protest camp in the capital early on Friday, arresting protesters and dismantling tents. Hundreds of troops and police commandos moved on the protesters outside the presidential offices in Colombo, hours before they were due to leave the area. A BBC video journalist was beaten by the army and one soldier snatched his phone and deleted videos. Nine people, including two who are injured, have been arrested by police. Police described the incident as a ""special operation to take [back] control of the presidential secretariat"". When asked about the attack on the BBC journalist, one police spokesman said he was unaware of the incident. It comes as Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as president on Thursday, after ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week. Mr Wickremesinghe - the former prime minister - is seen as deeply unpopular with the public and has vowed tough action against demonstrators. Separately on Friday, Dinesh Gunawardena - a senior politician considered to be a long-time Rajapaksa loyalist - took the oath as new prime minister, stepping into Mr Wickremesinghe's former shoes. Sri Lanka has seen months of mass unrest over an economic crisis and many blame the former government for mishandling the nation's finances. Protestors and security forces stood off against each other Protests had remained peaceful after Mr Wickremesinghe had been sworn into office on Thursday. Despite deep distrust, many demonstrators had said they would give him a chance to lead the country out of its economic crisis. In remarks after his inauguration, he said any attempt to topple the government or occupy government buildings was not ""not democracy, it is against the law"". On Friday morning, security forces moved in on the protest camp and reclaimed the building from demonstrators, who had earlier pledged to hand the building back. The raid took place in the early hours of Friday, at around 01:00 local time (19:30 GMT Thursday). Security forces later completely sealed off a section of the road leading to the site. Tensions between the two groups continued to simmer in the afternoon as about 100 protesters stood off against security forces lined up in rows near the presidential offices. By Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo When we heard that troops might be raiding the anti-government protest site in Colombo after midnight, we went to the spot just in front of the Sri Lankan president's office. Soon, hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and police commandos with riot gear descended from two directions, their faces covered. When activists raised objections to their presence, the security personnel marched on and became aggressive. The protesters were pushed back. Within seconds, we saw soldiers shouting, dismantling and destroying makeshift tents and other items on the pavement. Troops also moved into the president's office, which was stormed by huge crowds last week. Activists had earlier said they would hand over the building on Friday afternoon. As we followed the soldiers, we could see they were clearing everything in their way. The protesters were pushed up to the designated protest site less than 100m away and steel barricades were set up to stop the activists. When we were returning from the area, a man in civilian clothes, surrounded by troops, shouted at my colleague and said he wanted to delete the videos from his phone. Within seconds, the man punched my colleague and snatched his phone. Although I explained to them we were journalists and simply doing our job, they wouldn't listen. My colleague was attacked further and we raised strong objections. The microphone of another BBC colleague was taken and thrown away. The phone was returned after the videos were deleted from the device. Another army officer intervened and let us go. My colleague was shaken, but was able to walk back to the hotel, a few hundred metres away. The BBC tried to get a response from the military and police on the attack, but no-one answered our calls. A state of emergency declared last week is still in place. The government's violence against protesters has already been criticised by civil and legal groups. ""Unnecessary use of brute force will not help this country and its international image,"" said the nation's Bar Association leader, Saliya Peiris, in a statement. Members of Sri Lankan security outside the Presidential Secretariat on Friday The British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Sarah Hulton, also expressed concerns about the reports from the protest site. ""We have made clear the importance of the right to peaceful protest,"" she tweeted. Protesters and people on new president Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? Can Sri Lanka's new president bring unity? Sri Lanka has been wracked with protests for months, because the country is effectively bankrupt and facing acute shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The country is in a state of emergency, which gives police and military the power to arrest and detain people without warrants. It also allows for the detention of people without proof or the presumption of innocence and severely restricts fundamental rights, such as the freedom of movement and expression. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time and later became president, fled the country after mass unrest. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka, but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

"On Friday 21 July 1972, 19 Irish Republican Army (IRA) bombs exploded across Belfast in little over an hour on a warm afternoon. Nine people were killed and 130 others were seriously injured in what became known as Bloody Friday, another horrific day inthe Troubles. As the timed devices went off around the city starting shortly after 14:00 BST, flying glass and debris from the blasts caused extensive injuries to people caught in the open and fireballs caused horrific burns. Security forces in the city were stretched to their limits with the subsequent chaos in the streets and hoax warnings about further bombs. The scale of the attack was huge stretching from Botanic Avenue in the south of the city to Great Victoria Street in the city centre, the ferry terminus and Queen Elizabeth Bridge up to Salisbury Avenue in north Belfast,. The nine people who were killed died in two of the 19 bombs. This video can not be played Nine people died and 130 were injured when 19 bombs exploded across Belfast. A car was driven into the rear of the Oxford Street bus station in the city centre, killing six people. An explosion in a hijacked vehicle at shops on the Cavehill Road killed another three people. Smoke rises over Oxford Bus Station in Belfast on Bloody Friday Of the nine people who died, seven were civilians and two were soldiers. Among the injured were 77 women and girls, and 53 men and boys. The victims came from both sides of the community. Bloody Friday victims' families deserve truth -  son Bloody Friday-nursing the aftermath The IRA had placed more bombs which were defused possibly saving more lives. In the aftermath, the IRA attempted to blame security forces for failing to act on warnings. Aftermath of the explosion at Smithfield bus station Stephen Cooper (19), member of the British Army William Crothers (15), civilian John Gibson (45), civilian William Irvine (18), civilian Thomas Killops (39), civilian Brigid Murray (65), civilian Margaret O'Hare (34), civilian Stephen Parker (14), civilian Philip Price (27), member of the British Army July 1972 is often called the bloodiest month, of the bloodiest year of the Troubles. By the time the first bomb in Belfast exploded on Bloody Friday, 59 people had already been killed across Northern Ireland that month. News headlines from across Northern Ireland on the day said the attack was the worst the city had seen since the Blitz in 1941, with widespread condemnation from both sides of the community. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the time, William Whitelaw, told the House of Commons the bombings were ""a wanton attack on innocent men, women and children"". In the 10 days after Bloody Friday, 18 more people were killed in Belfast. Then, at 04:00 on 31 July 1972 the Army launched Operation Motorman and moved in to clear ""no go"" areas set up by republican paramilitaries across Northern Ireland. In Londonderry more than 1,000 soldiers in armoured vehicles moved into the Bogside and Creggan. In Belfast, the Army set up watchtowers in Casement Park in the west of the city. In all, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland during the operation. Two teenagers were shot and killed by the Army during the operation in Derry. Nine people were also killed that day in an IRA bomb in Claudy, County Londonderry. In later years, the IRA leader at the time, Sean MacStiofain, said the aim of the Bloody Friday attacks had been to cause financial damage - but he refused to accept responsibility. Writing in 1996, Gerry Adams, the then Sinn FÃ©in president, stated the IRA ""made a mistake in putting out so many bombs"". He added that civilian fatalities were ""a matter of deep regret"". In 2002, on the 30th anniversary of Bloody Friday,the IRA apologised to civilian victims of its campaign of violence,external.

"Residents return to their properties in the village of Wennington, which went up in flames on Tuesday London was left with only three fire engines on the hottest-ever day this week, the capital's fire chief has said. With 1,146 incidents on Tuesday, London Fire Brigade (LFB) commissioner Andrew Roe, said crews were stretched to the greatest extent since the Blitz. Mr Roe praised the ""extraordinary courage"" of his firefighters. He visited Wennington in east London on Thursday morning, as residents returned to their damaged and destroyed homes. London Fire Brigade Commissioner Andrew Roe praised the courage of his crews ""We were left with three fire engines at one point,"" Mr Roe said. ""But to be frank we were moving vehicles all the time. ""It was the most dramatic situation I've ever faced as a firefighter. ""We were stretched but this was an absolutely exceptional set of circumstances and we threw everything at it."" Helisted major blazesneeding 12, 15 and 30 fire engines all happening at once. Eighteen homes in Wennington were wrecked by fire in the blazes on Tuesday The fire chief met Home Secretary Priti Patel in the worst-hit village, where 18 homes were wrecked by fire, to discuss how they could improve LFB's response. Mr Roe suggested London could follow the lead of other countries using helicopters and planes to douse flames from above. The priority, though, has been getting the brigade back up to full staffing by December this year, following ""skills gaps"" caused by the pandemic, he said. ""We're hammering it,"" he said. ""It's why we've brought in 150 transfers to fill the skills gaps that built up during Covid and actually I have taken the decision last week to run another transferee round so we're bringing in another 100 to close that gap. ""Obviously that gives us the resource going forward knowing that we may well face other days like this again."" Villagers consoled each other as they faced the wreckage for the first time Meanwhile, Wennington residents headed back for the first time to see their gutted homes and search for pets, after 100 firefighters battled for hours to extinguish a giant fire. One man looked delighted as he emerged from the police cordon on Thursday afternoon with his ginger cat. A group of about 15 people were the first to cross the cordon and were followed by smaller groups throughout the day. Several carried boxes and cages, some of which were stuffed with blankets, in the hope of finding pets left behind in the evacuation. A number of cats and kittens, along with a white Staffordshire bull terrier, were said to have gone missing during the blaze. Some residents returned home for the first time to find pets they had had to leave behind on Tuesday Nicola Jenkinson, who runs the local pub, said she had rushed back to Wennington on a couple of hours' sleep from a family holiday when she saw the news. ""It's just very sad,"" she said. ""We've come back to see if there's anything we can do to help residents, even if it's just bottles of water, cups of tea and a shoulder to cry on. ""Over the years we've done weddings and christenings and funerals, and of course we know everybody."" Home Secretary Ms Patel paid tribute to LFB on her visit to the area. She tweeted: ""It was a privilege to visit Wennington Fire Station this morning, where I met our brave firefighters who have worked relentlessly this week combating the devastating fires in London.""

"Sheila Seleoane moved into Lord's Court in 2014 The body of a woman lay undiscovered for two-and-a-half years in her south-east London home despite repeated calls by residents, an inquest heard. Sheila Seleoane, 58, had to be identified by dental records after she was found in the living room of her flat in Peckham in February. The inquest was told there had been numerous missed opportunities by both her landlord and the police. Housing association Peabody has apologised for what happened. Ms Seleoane was last seen alive during a GP visit in August 2019. A post-mortem found the cause of her death was unascertained due to the advanced state of decomposition of Ms Seleoane's body. However, she suffered from Crohn's disease and bowel inflammation, London Inner South Coroner's Court heard. Nobody had entered Ms Seleoane's flat for years The inquest was told residents had repeatedly contacted the housing association and police about Ms Seleoane. She had not paid rent since August 2019 but landlord Peabody cut off her gas supply in June 2020, three months after applying for universal credit to cover her rent. There were also two police visits to Lord's Court within a week in October 2020, where officers were unable to make contact with the resident. However, a miscommunication by a Met Police controller mistakenly concluded that Ms Seleoane had been seen alive and well - and this was passed on to Peabody. That controller retired from the Met last year, but would have been recommended for possible disciplinary action, Det Ch Insp Amanda Mawhinney told the inquest. Unopened post was found in a mailbox on the ground floor of the building In February, Ms Seleoane was found by officers. Det Sgt Scott Fisher said he found her lying in the recovery position in the ""extremely tidy and well-kept"" one bedroom flat. She was wearing blue pyjamas and a white top, while there was ""a brown substance around her body which must be a product of decomposition"", he said. Ashling Fox, deputy chief executive officer for Peabody, admitted they could have done more to check on Ms Seleoane's wellbeing. She said: ""There were opportunities, with hindsight, where dots could have been joined up more quickly at the time. ""In hindsight, it was clear that there had been a sudden change in behaviour. In this case, we recognise that more could have been done."" A clearly emotional Ms Fox added: ""Everyone was devastated. I don't think anyone comes to work to do a bad job."" The chief executive officer at the time of incident revealed they were trying to reach nine Peabody tenants who they have had no contact from in the last year. Flowers were left by well-wishers after her body was found Concluding the inquest, the coroner said Ms Seleoane had died from ""unknown causes"". Delivering an open verdict, Dr Julian Morris added: ""Any death is sad. To lie undetected for in all likelihood over two years, is difficult to fathom in 2022."" One Lord's Court resident, who reported maggots in her flat in late summer 2019, told the BBC she was in a state of ""shock and disappointment"" following the inquest. She said: ""There's no excuse for why Peabody didn't do something before the pandemic. ""There's a lot of things that have been missed that they didn't consider."" Another resident, who first reported a foul stench in September 2019, said Peabody did not take their concerns seriously. She said: ""It doesn't make sense to me that she had no-one. No-one noticed she was missing. ""There are still so many unanswered questions, so many gaps. More could have been done. It's not been good enough.""
