"This video can not be played Video shows a fire on the Studland peninsula in Purbeck, Dorset A huge fire which tore through a popular nature reserve and forced the evacuation of a beach was most likely caused by a barbecue, firefighters say. At its height on Friday, 90 firefighters tackled the blaze at Studland Heath in Dorset and crews remain at the scene. Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had discovered a used disposable barbecue amid the ashes. It has urged people not to risk using barbecues in the countryside. Firefighters were alerted at about 13:00 BST on Friday and had to work in dense smoke which could be seen for miles. Flames leapt across the Isle of Purbeck, forcing police to evacuate Studland beach which had been busy with holiday-makers. Crews worked throughout the night as they attempted to contain the fire. A firefighter tackles the blaze at the Studland Heath nature reserve on the Isle of Purbeck Studland Heath is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and home to all six species of native British reptiles including the rare and nationally endangered sand lizard and smooth snake; it is also home to the rare Dartford Warbler. A fire service spokeswoman said: ""We found evidence of a little camp where someone had used a disposable barbecue. We can't say 100% that was the cause but when we find evidence, we have to assume that's the most likely cause - fires don't just start on their own"". Area manager Jason Moncrief said: ""There can't be many people left in Britain who don't know the advice at the moment is do not use a disposable barbecue at these places. ""Bring a picnic, use our local cafes, restaurants and takeaways - don't bring a barbecue."" Even after the flames had been quelled the land was still smouldering On Saturday, Dorset Police issued an appeal for people to not park in the area, after reports that hundreds of cars had ignored 'no parking' signs. The restrictions were put in place to allow firefighters to deal with the ongoing incident. Some drivers had reportedly moved a water hose running along Ferry Road so they could park. ""Our fire colleagues are working in extreme conditions to tackle this blaze and they need the public to help them, not hinder them,"" a police spokesperson said. The chain ferry linking Studland to Sandbanks in Poole was used to get people off the beach Firefighters worked amid dense smoke throughout the afternoon and evening In a bid to reduce the numbers of disposable barbecues in use, several supermarket chains have stopped selling them during the UK heatwave. On Friday,Co-op announced it was the latest to join the moratoriumand said it would not sell the product while the dry spell continued. Southern and central England and parts of Wales are subject toan amber extreme heat alertuntil Sunday. The Met Office has also issued its highest alert for fire severity over the weekend, warning there is an ""exceptional"" risk of blazes spreading. As the heat continues,firefighters have strived to stress the dangersof careless behaviour when out in the countryside.

"This video can not be played Mark Jones already has 400 signatures on a petition he has organised A petition has been started calling for Wales fan zones to make a comeback in time for the 2022 World Cup. They were a feature of the 2016 Euros, allowing football fans of all ages back home to enjoy the matchday atmosphere. Now with Wales at their first World Cup in more than 60 years, supporter Mark Jones says he can't understand why so little has been put in place. ""Wales has lots of big events and concerts lately so there is no excuse,"" he said. This is the second time that Mark, 30, from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, has found himself lobbying for fan zones. In 2016 while he was a student, he started a petition whichfinally led to Cardiff council agreeing to a fan zone in the city's Bute Park, 10 days before the start of the Euros. Now despite the success of those events, he's launched his petition again, when he and friends realised no plans were in place for fan zones this time round either. Q&A: Wales at the World Cup in Qatar World Cup revives folk song turned football anthem LGBT Wales fans pledge boycott of Qatar World Cup World Cup set to start one day earlier than planned Mark, who says he's ""too skint"" to go to the World Cup in Qatar in November. said there had been a ""crazy whirlwind"" as he got his latest campaign off the ground. But so far, only one council in Wales has told the BBC it definitely has plans for fan zones. Thousands of people attended the open-air fan zones in Cardiff before big Wales games at Euro 2016 He describes his campaign as the ""kick-up the backside"" for Wales to make them an important part of national culture to bring supporters, young and old, together. ""In 2016, over 60,000 people used the fan zones so there is no excuse for them not to come back,"" Mark said. ""Wales has had lots of big events and concerts."" Mark said it has been estimated that a trip to Qatar to watch the World Cup could cost more than Â£5,000 to cover flights, accommodation, match tickets and food. There were other obstacles, including the cost of living crisis and ticket availability. ""It would be a major shot in the foot if we don't rally behind this team,"" said Mark. ""We need to grasp this - it's our chance to brand Wales on the world's biggest days and bring people together. We might not get an opportunity to present ourselves to the world like this again."" All the emotions - the fan zone in Cardiff during Wales v Belgium in 2016 Mark added: ""Imagine Wales score and you cut to Queen Street in Cardiff - and there are a couple of people walking with a carrier bag? No, let's get the fan zones back."" Fan zones are areas outside or away from a sports stadium for people to watch the game on a large screen. Some larger, licensed venues are already organising event nights for fans to watch the matches, but fan zones are free to attend and can hold a large capacity and be open to everyone. Mark has created awebsite,externalthat has all the relevant information on it  and where he has started the petition. Tomos and Rhys Loosemore watching a game in honour of their father Dai Tomos and Rhys Loosemore are lucky enough to be attending Wales' opening game against the United States. However, for the following two group matches and for all of their friends who cannot make it to Qatar, they believe fan zones back in Wales would be a ""massive"" benefit for friends and Welsh fans to enjoy games together. Although, they did think with the World Cup being hosted in November, the weather back home could be an issue. Cerys Rees and her family enjoying watching the game in the sun Cerys Rees said ""I would definitely love to see the return of the fan zones. They were such a success for the Euros and give fans a place to head to, especially when they can't travel away to Qatar. ""I live in London and so love the idea of coming home to a designated place and knowing I'll be able to watch the games with like minded fans and share the passion and excitement of it all."" Hannah Rees and Nia Scourfeild supporting Wales Hannah Rees, 27, from Swansea, thinks fan zones would be a great idea for those who want to celebrate and enjoy the atmosphere that you would usually get at stadiums which she thinks you can't replicate in other places such a pubs. ""Fan zones provide safe spaces for people to enjoy the game with friends and family. Given the cost implications for Qatar this is a far more cost effective option for young people in Wales."" Liam Callaghan says it could be a once in a lifetime opportunity for many people Liam Callaghan, from Pencoed in Bridgend county, is keen for the zones to come back. ""This is a once in a lifetime event for a lot of people. Also with it being in Qatar there won't be as many fans travelling as there were in Euro 2016. Welsh football is doing so well and brings everybody together. ""I will be looking to book days off work for each Welsh fixture and so will so many others. Let's make the most of it!"" Welsh fans enjoying the 2016 fan zones BBC Wales has contacted all of the Welsh councils about their plans. So far, one council,Wrexhamsaid it was planning two fan zones. Councillor Nigel Williams, lead member for the economy and regeneration, said: ""Wrexham has such a rich history with football as the Football Association of Wales was founded here in the Wynnstay Arms in 1876. To many, football is the beating heart of Wrexham and I know they will want to come together to celebrate and cheer on our national side. ""We're also inviting schools to get involved with primaries invited to the morning screenings at TÅ· Pawb and secondaries invited to the High Street screenings."" ""We're in the early stages of planning and will bring you more details as they're confirmed."" Cardiffcouncil says there has been no decision on the fan zones. ASwanseacouncil spokesperson said: ""We're considering all options and really want to see fans cheer on Wales in the World Cup. The November and December weather will be a key consideration in any decision."" Conwyis also looking at the possibilities but has not made a decision. Ceredigionsaid it was not considering one at the moment andPowyssaid it has had no discussions about at this stage. Fan zone goal in sight as hundreds sign petition.

"Passengers are being disrupted as rail services are hit by more strikes, with some firms running no trains at all. Some 6,500 train drivers at nine rail companies, who are members of the Aslef union, are staging their latest 24-hour walkout in a dispute over pay. There have been several rail strikes this summer, with unions calling for pay increases more in line with the rising cost of living. But rail companies said they could only fund a pay rise through reform. Avanti West Coast, Southeastern, CrossCountry, London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway are running no Saturday services at all, while other operators will have an extremely limited service. Transport for London has also advised passengers there will be no service on the entire London Overground network - which is operated by Arriva Rail London, whose drivers are part of the strike. The other operators affected by the strike are Great Western, Greater Anglia, LNER and Hull Trains. Train companies not involved in the strikes will be running services, but these are expected to be busy. London Euston and Birmingham New Street are among the stations that will be closed on Saturday. At Euston, a picket line with about 50 Aslef members has formed. People have been arriving at the station hoping to catch trains only to find the entrances closed. The disruption is expected to spill over into Sunday morning - so passengers have been told to check with their operator and consider starting their journey later in the day. Events including Coldplay's second night at Wembley Stadium and Premier League games in Manchester, London, Birmingham and Brighton will be affected by the disruption, with thousands of travelling fans having had to make other arrangements. Which lines are affected by Saturday's strike? How much are rail workers paid? Train strikes: 'I cycled 33 miles to get to a gig' Phoebe Clifford, 20, was planning to travel by train from her home in Canterbury to London for a Rex Orange County gig on Saturday with her boyfriend. However, the pair now have no way of getting there as no services are running. It means they will lose the Â£100 they spent on the concert tickets. She booked the tickets back in February as a birthday treat and had been looking forward to the gig for months. ""I can't sell my tickets because it's too late. I was looking to book a hotel in case I could go down tonight, and I can't do that either because they're all fully booked,"" she told the BBC. ""It's been an absolute nightmare."" Phoebe said she had been affected by every single train strike this year but still had sympathy for the workers and felt they deserved better pay. Karim Ullah, who owns an Indian restaurant in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, will also be impacted. One of his chefs normally travels to work from London by train but no services are running on Saturday. ""It really makes life such a misery because Saturday is one of our busiest, if not the busiest evening,"" he said. Mr Ullah is also worried about last-minute cancellations from customers who were planning to travel by train as this happened during previous strikes. Karim Ullah is worried the strikes will have an impact on footfall at his restaurant Passengers with advance, off-peak or anytime tickets affected by the strike on 13 August can use their ticket either the day before, or up to and including Tuesday, 16 August. Passengers can also change their tickets to travel on an alternate date, or get a refund if their train is cancelled or rescheduled.â¯ Season ticket holders who choose not to travel can claim compensation through the delay repay scheme. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said drivers did not want to strike but unless the deadlock was broken there was a ""big possibility"" of more walkouts. The union is also balloting drivers at Chiltern Railways, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express for strikes, with the results due later this month. Members of the RMT and TSSA unions are also striking on 18 and 20 August, while industrial action will be taken on 19 August by London Underground and London bus drivers. Mr Whelan pointed out there was also industrial action taking place in a number of other industries. ""There is a summer of solidarity coming - not a summer of discontent - where everybody is making their views known to the government,"" he said. There will be formal talks between Aslef and rail companies next week - a move welcomed by both sides in the dispute. Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, described this as ""a really good step forward"". He told the BBC: ""It is important we get round the table and we start to have meaningful discussions about how we can look at reform so that we can then offer our staff a pay increase. ""It is really important we take this opportunity and try and hopefully prevent further strikes and get some result to this situation."" Mr Whelan also told the BBC his union was always willing to talk but said if the meetings ""just go round and round in circles again, they're not going to go very far are they?"". He said the government was not allowing train companies to offer a pay rise of more than 2%. ""Let's not forget we work for companies that are making profits, we work for companies that take those profits and pay them to their shareholders,"" he said. ""The only people that are not getting a share of the revenue that's being generated are the people that work for the rail companies."" Passengers in Stoke-on-Trent on Friday were being warned to expect disruption Asked about Network Rail saying it had offered workers a pay rise of more than 5%, he said those negotiations had been with other unions and had to be looked at in the context of the cost of living crisis and the fact the offer was coming alongside redundancies. ""If you've had no pay rise for three years and someone's offering you 5% when inflation is 11%... I can quite possibly see why that's not attractive to any workers in the rail industry at all."" The union leader has joined a picket line at Willesden Junction in north-west London, where he was joined by Labour MPs Barry Gardiner and Dawn Butler. The Department for Transport said it was ""entirely false"" to claim the government was blocking negotiations. ""We have said from the outset we urge the unions and industry to agree a deal that is fair for railway staff, passengers and taxpayers,"" the department said. It said rail workers had seen above average pay increases over the past decade, with their wages increasing by around 25% from Â£35,000 in 2011 to Â£44,000 in 2021. It added that rail staff pay rises must be ""fair and in line with the wider public sector"". Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said it was positive news that Aslef had agreed to meet them next week. ""The good news is that we had informal talks with Aslef and there will be formal talks next week. That is a really good step forward,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He told the BBC companies wanted to offer a pay rise to workers but revenue had fallen since the pandemic. Mr Montgomery added that reforms were needed to terms and conditions, to save money by allowing staff to be more productive during their working hours. Train strikes: What routes are affected when?

"Passengers are being disrupted as rail services are hit by more strikes, with some firms running no trains at all. Some 6,500 train drivers at nine rail companies, who are members of the Aslef union, are staging their latest 24-hour walkout in a dispute over pay. There have been several rail strikes this summer, with unions calling for pay increases more in line with the rising cost of living. But rail companies said they could only fund a pay rise through reform. Avanti West Coast, Southeastern, CrossCountry, London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway are running no Saturday services at all, while other operators will have an extremely limited service. Transport for London has also advised passengers there will be no service on the entire London Overground network - which is operated by Arriva Rail London, whose drivers are part of the strike. The other operators affected by the strike are Great Western, Greater Anglia, LNER and Hull Trains. Train companies not involved in the strikes will be running services, but these are expected to be busy. London Euston and Birmingham New Street are among the stations that will be closed on Saturday. At Euston, a picket line with about 50 Aslef members has formed. People have been arriving at the station hoping to catch trains only to find the entrances closed. The disruption is expected to spill over into Sunday morning - so passengers have been told to check with their operator and consider starting their journey later in the day. Events including Coldplay's second night at Wembley Stadium and Premier League games in Manchester, London, Birmingham and Brighton will be affected by the disruption, with thousands of travelling fans having had to make other arrangements. Which lines are affected by Saturday's strike? How much are rail workers paid? Train strikes: 'I cycled 33 miles to get to a gig' Phoebe Clifford, 20, was planning to travel by train from her home in Canterbury to London for a Rex Orange County gig on Saturday with her boyfriend. However, the pair now have no way of getting there as no services are running. It means they will lose the Â£100 they spent on the concert tickets. She booked the tickets back in February as a birthday treat and had been looking forward to the gig for months. ""I can't sell my tickets because it's too late. I was looking to book a hotel in case I could go down tonight, and I can't do that either because they're all fully booked,"" she told the BBC. ""It's been an absolute nightmare."" Phoebe said she had been affected by every single train strike this year but still had sympathy for the workers and felt they deserved better pay. Karim Ullah, who owns an Indian restaurant in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, will also be impacted. One of his chefs normally travels to work from London by train but no services are running on Saturday. ""It really makes life such a misery because Saturday is one of our busiest, if not the busiest evening,"" he said. Mr Ullah is also worried about last-minute cancellations from customers who were planning to travel by train as this happened during previous strikes. Karim Ullah is worried the strikes will have an impact on footfall at his restaurant Passengers with advance, off-peak or anytime tickets affected by the strike on 13 August can use their ticket either the day before, or up to and including Tuesday, 16 August. Passengers can also change their tickets to travel on an alternate date, or get a refund if their train is cancelled or rescheduled.â¯ Season ticket holders who choose not to travel can claim compensation through the delay repay scheme. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said drivers did not want to strike but unless the deadlock was broken there was a ""big possibility"" of more walkouts. The union is also balloting drivers at Chiltern Railways, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express for strikes, with the results due later this month. Members of the RMT and TSSA unions are also striking on 18 and 20 August, while industrial action will be taken on 19 August by London Underground and London bus drivers. Mr Whelan pointed out there was also industrial action taking place in a number of other industries. ""There is a summer of solidarity coming - not a summer of discontent - where everybody is making their views known to the government,"" he said. There will be formal talks between Aslef and rail companies next week - a move welcomed by both sides in the dispute. Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, described this as ""a really good step forward"". He told the BBC: ""It is important we get round the table and we start to have meaningful discussions about how we can look at reform so that we can then offer our staff a pay increase. ""It is really important we take this opportunity and try and hopefully prevent further strikes and get some result to this situation."" Mr Whelan also told the BBC his union was always willing to talk but said if the meetings ""just go round and round in circles again, they're not going to go very far are they?"". He said the government was not allowing train companies to offer a pay rise of more than 2%. ""Let's not forget we work for companies that are making profits, we work for companies that take those profits and pay them to their shareholders,"" he said.

"Sir Robert Buckland has become the first cabinet minister to publicly switch his support from Rishi Sunak to Liz Truss in the Tory leadership race. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Sir Robert said Ms Truss was the ""right person to take the country forward"". The Welsh Secretary had previously backed former chancellor Mr Sunak, citing his experience and judgement. Mr Sunak won most votes among Tory MPs, but Ms Truss is now consistently tipped to win the backing of party members. The pair are currently travelling around the country taking part in a series of hustings - events in which they answer questions and put forward their proposals in front of invited party members. The votes - either postal or online - will be cast over the coming weeks and a result will be announced on 5 September. As the new Conservative Party leader, the winner will also succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister on that date. Ethics an issue under Johnson - Welsh secretary Current energy bills support not enough - Johnson In his article, Sir Robert says he had initially backed Mr Sunak because he felt that, during the parliamentary rounds where MPs decided on the final two candidates, he was ""embodying what we needed."" ""As the campaign has moved on, and as I have listened carefully to both candidates, I have thought deeply about the issues that move me and what I want to see the next prime minister doing,"" he said. ""Changing your mind on an issue like this is not an easy thing to do, but I have decided that Liz Truss is the right person to take the country forward."" Sir Robert has previously described himself as a ""strong Remainer"" and a ""One-Nation, moderate Conservative"". Before becoming secretary of state for Wales, he served as justice secretary and prisons minister. He said he had switched to Ms Truss in part because she had pledged to address his concerns about the Bill of Rights, a proposed piece of legislation intended to replace the Human Rights Act. Sir Robert said he also wanted to see the next prime minister prioritise growth, saying it would be necessary if the government was to make a ""real difference to people"". ""We need growth and investment, and we need to learn to love business again,"" he wrote. ""That is... the Conservative way of boosting household finances and getting the tax revenues we need to fund public services,"" he writes. ""[Ms Truss's] plans give us our best shot at reaching our potential with the high-growth, high-productivity economy that we need,"" he said. The state of the UK economy, along with the current levels of tax and the rate of inflation, have been central issues in the leadership campaign. Ms Truss has pledged immediate tax cuts while Mr Sunak has said they should be left until inflation has been brought under control, although he has pledged to scrap VAT on energy and cut income tax over the next parliament. Sir Robert also emphasised the need for ""party unity"" whichever candidate becomes the next Tory leader. ""We cannot expect to have the necessary strength in government if our party is torn in two by the end of the summer,"" he writes.

"Drought in Spain is exposing villages that were submerged by the building of dams and reservoirs The ongoing drought in the UK and Europe is putting electricity generation under pressure, say experts. Electricity from hydropower - which uses water to generate power - has dropped by 20% overall. And nuclear facilities, which are cooled using river water, have been restricted. There are fears that the shortfalls are a taste of what will happen in the coming winter. In the UK, high temperatures are hitting energy output from fossil, nuclear and solar sources. That is because the technology in power plants and solar panels work much less well in high temperatures. The prolonged dry spell is putting further pressure on energy supplies as Europe scrambles for alternative sources after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Millions hit by hosepipe bans as drought declared US Senate passes sweeping $700bn economic package Causes of deadly dry-lightning wildfires revealed Hydropower is an important source of energy for Europe, but the lack of water in rivers and reservoirs is now significantly reducing the ability of facilities to produce electricity. Italy gets around 1/5 of its power from hydro, but that's fallen by around 40% in the past 12 months. It's a similar story in Spain, where the amount of electricity generated is down 44%, according to data from energy researchersRystad Energy,external. ""Hydropower can be quite volatile, but 40% is absolutely extreme,"" says Fabian RÃ¸nningen, a power analyst with Rystad. The figures are not just down in one part of Europe, he explains, but all the big hydropower-producing countries are making less now. ""It's really a big impact,,"" he adds. Italy has been hit hard by drought limiting energy from hydroelectricity by 40% Norway is also experiencing challenges with hydro-electricity. It warned that it may not be able to continue to export energy to countries like the UK unless its reservoirs were refilled. Some in the hydro industry say that lack of investment in modernisation and in transmission lines are also causing problems. ""We are going to face a problem this winter. And that should be a wake-up call to have more investment in the infrastructure for the next few years,"" says Eddie Rich from the International Hydropower Association. The exceptionally hot weather is also hitting nuclear power production, especially in France. Around half of the 56 reactors in the fleet are offline, with several affected by a systemic issue with corrosion. Those reactors that are working are often cooled with water from rivers that are now running low, while temperatures are running high. ""Once the water in the rivers is very low and very hot, basically you have to stop cooling down nuclear power plants. That's because the water that's released is dangerous for fish and other species in the rivers,"" said Prof Sonia Seneviratne, from ETH Zurich. The French government is now allowing some facilities to release very warm water back into the rivers, as a temporary measure. It underlines the stresses the heat is putting on energy production. France is now making up the shortfall in electricity by importing from the UK among others. Analysts say this is putting additional pressure on the UK system - at a time when the very warm weather is hitting production from gas and nuclear facilities. It's more difficult to cool the plants in the warmer weather, explains Kathryn Porter, an energy consultant withWatt-Logic,external. ""Solar panels also experience quite a significant drop off above 25C. Everything just works less well when it's hot,"" she adds. Power output from solar farms in the UK will be hit at temperatures soar The stresses in the UK system were evident this week when the National Grid triggered a capacity market notice, a technical step indicating that the safe margins for operating the grid were reduced. Countries, including the UK and France, rely on each other's electricity markets. ""If both French and UK systems are in stress at the same time, then nobody really knows what will happen,"" Ms Porter says. She said it is a foretaste of what may happen in winter and warns that there may well be restrictions on energy use for large consumers. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"This video can not be played Video shows a fire on the Studland peninsula in Purbeck, Dorset A huge fire which tore through a popular nature reserve and forced the evacuation of a beach was most likely caused by a barbecue, firefighters say. At its height on Friday, 90 firefighters tackled the blaze at Studland Heath in Dorset and crews remain at the scene. Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had discovered a used disposable barbecue amid the ashes. It has urged people not to risk using barbecues in the countryside. Firefighters were alerted at about 13:00 BST on Friday and had to work in dense smoke which could be seen for miles.

"This video can not be played Mark Jones already has 400 signatures on a petition he has organised A petition has been started calling for Wales fan zones to make a comeback in time for the 2022 World Cup. They were a feature of the 2016 Euros, allowing football fans of all ages back home to enjoy the matchday atmosphere. Now with Wales at their first World Cup in more than 60 years, supporter Mark Jones says he can't understand why so little has been put in place. ""Wales has lots of big events and concerts lately so there is no excuse,"" he said. This is the second time that Mark, 30, from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, has found himself lobbying for fan zones. In 2016 while he was a student, he started a petition whichfinally led to Cardiff council agreeing to a fan zone in the city's Bute Park, 10 days before the start of the Euros.

""In 2016, over 60,000 people used the fan zones so there is no excuse for them not to come back,"" Mark said. ""Wales has had lots of big events and concerts."" Mark said it has been estimated that a trip to Qatar to watch the World Cup could cost more than Â£5,000 to cover flights, accommodation, match tickets and food. There were other obstacles, including the cost of living crisis and ticket availability. ""It would be a major shot in the foot if we don't rally behind this team,"" said Mark. ""We need to grasp this - it's our chance to brand Wales on the world's biggest days and bring people together. We might not get an opportunity to present ourselves to the world like this again.""

"This video can not be played Video shows a fire on the Studland peninsula in Purbeck, Dorset A huge fire which tore through a popular nature reserve and forced the evacuation of a beach was most likely caused by a barbecue, firefighters say. At its height on Friday, 90 firefighters tackled the blaze at Studland Heath in Dorset and crews remain at the scene. Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had discovered a used disposable barbecue amid the ashes. It has urged people not to risk using barbecues in the countryside. Firefighters were alerted at about 13:00 BST on Friday and had to work in dense smoke which could be seen for miles. Flames leapt across the Isle of Purbeck, forcing police to evacuate Studland beach which had been busy with holiday-makers. Crews worked throughout the night as they attempted to contain the fire. A firefighter tackles the blaze at the Studland Heath nature reserve on the Isle of Purbeck Studland Heath is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and home to all six species of native British reptiles including the rare and nationally endangered sand lizard and smooth snake; it is also home to the rare Dartford Warbler. A fire service spokeswoman said: ""We found evidence of a little camp where someone had used a disposable barbecue. We can't say 100% that was the cause but when we find evidence, we have to assume that's the most likely cause - fires don't just start on their own"". Area manager Jason Moncrief said: ""There can't be many people left in Britain who don't know the advice at the moment is do not use a disposable barbecue at these places. ""Bring a picnic, use our local cafes, restaurants and takeaways - don't bring a barbecue."" Even after the flames had been quelled the land was still smouldering On Saturday, Dorset Police issued an appeal for people to not park in the area, after reports that hundreds of cars had ignored 'no parking' signs. The restrictions were put in place to allow firefighters to deal with the ongoing incident. Some drivers had reportedly moved a water hose running along Ferry Road so they could park. ""Our fire colleagues are working in extreme conditions to tackle this blaze and they need the public to help them, not hinder them,"" a police spokesperson said. The chain ferry linking Studland to Sandbanks in Poole was used to get people off the beach Firefighters worked amid dense smoke throughout the afternoon and evening In a bid to reduce the numbers of disposable barbecues in use, several supermarket chains have stopped selling them during the UK heatwave. On Friday,Co-op announced it was the latest to join the moratoriumand said it would not sell the product while the dry spell continued. Southern and central England and parts of Wales are subject toan amber extreme heat alertuntil Sunday. The Met Office has also issued its highest alert for fire severity over the weekend, warning there is an ""exceptional"" risk of blazes spreading.

"Polly Brown - Eric Hall's mother The family of a man with schizophrenia is taking legal action against the Home Office for allegedly unlawfully deporting him to Jamaica. Eric Hall, who arrived in the UK aged 10, has convictions for theft, drugs and possession of an offensive weapon. The Home Office denies relatives' claims he was sedated before a flight and says the deportation was lawful. It says the rights of the British public are put before those of dangerous criminals. Although he was born in Jamaica, the 38-year-old moved to the UK with his family in the early 1990s and was granted indefinite leave to remain. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in his early teens, and his family and legal team say most of his past criminal behaviour - he has 28 convictions for 55 offences - was largely down to his poor mental health. They believe he has only ever been a danger to himself, rather than wider society - and that he continues to be seriously vulnerable. Critics of the Home Office policy say Eric's deportation, on grounds of his Jamaican citizenship, has echoes of theWindrush scandal. In 2018, many adult children of post-war Caribbean migrants, despite having lived and worked in the UK for decades, were told they no longer had the right to stay. The scandal led to thegovernment apologisingfor Home Office immigration mistakes against Caribbean migrants and their subsequent mistreatment. Before he was arrested in early March, Eric had been living in supported housing in east London and was being cared for by a mental health community team. His family says if he was sent a letter by the Home Office about his deportation he would not have understood its significance. Eric was taken to a detention centre where, his lawyers and family say, his mental state deteriorated considerably. He repeatedly told them he had not been served any deportation papers and did not think he was about to be flown out of the country. Jamaica: Forced Deportation Deportation flights from the UK to Jamaica are among the most controversial carried out by the Home Office. Adina Campbell has been to Jamaica to meet some of the people affected. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Eric's legal team say they were challenging his deportation but were not sent key paperwork from the Home Office which must be served legally within three days of someone's departure. Immigration lawyer, Holly Stow, also says they asked charity Medical Justice to assess Eric - their report concluded that because of his paranoid schizophrenia he should not have been detained and he was not fit to fly. The Home Office says foreign criminals, and their legal representatives, are served their removal directions in advance of flying. ""All claims raised are fully considered and determined before deportation, including where applicable via the courts."" Eric was put on a plane on 18 May. ""He's a sick boy. I live with him and I know,"" says Errol Brown Eric is too unwell to be interviewed - but in a remote farming town in the south-west of Jamaica we meet his elderly stepfather - Errol Brown. He talks to us on a hilly main road, outside a parade of boarded-up shops. ""He's sick. He's a sick boy. I live with him and I know,"" says Errol, his hands shaking before wiping tears from his eyes. He is now caring for Eric full-time at his home in St Elizabeth Parish - but says his stepson needs medication and face-to-face mental health support which isn't routinely available in Jamaica. BBC News has seen medical documents confirming Eric's paranoid schizophrenia - a condition also referenced in Home Office correspondence to him. Before his removal from the UK, Eric's family say he had been refusing to take any medication, and that on his arrival in Jamaica it appeared as if he had been heavily drugged. They say he didn't recognise his stepfather in Jamaica's capital, Kingston, and had no memory of how he got there. ""Out of the blue we heard Eric was in Kingston,"" says Errol Brown. ""He can't explain to me how he got here. I have asked many times. I know he was out of it. He would have had to have been sedated or knocked out. He didn't know where he was and he didn't have a clue who I was."" The Home Office rejects the claim Eric was drugged. ""Passengers are never sedated on removal flights and it's wrong to suggest otherwise,"" it said in a statement. ""When I used to go to school for his reports they always said good things about him,"" says Eric's mother Polly Brown Eric's mother Polly Brown, who lives and works in London, decided to take legal action because she says the Home Office was aware of her son's complex, long-term medical history. Given the severity of his mental health condition his family say he is unable to legally represent himself. Mrs Brown is now acting on her son's behalf. ""He only has his stepfather to look after him in a strange country that he left when he was 10 years old,"" she says. In her east London flat, surrounded by family photos, her mood momentarily brightens as she shares childhood memories. ""He was very loving. When I used to go to school for his reports they always said good things about him."" She describes how he was passionate about art and once painted a picture of his own face which was displayed in the school reception area. He was also a talented footballer playing for an academy outside of school. ""His manager used to call him the gazelle,"" she says. But it's not long before those fond memories vanish as her mind is then thrown back to the present. ""We all know that Jamaica now has become very violent. There are guns everywhere and there are killings every day,"" she says. ""It breaks my heart thinking about it - that he's out there and he might get killed."" Deportation flights are used to remove both foreign criminals who have finished UK jail sentences and other foreign nationals who have stayed in the country longer than legally permitted. Between April 2020 and May 2022, the Home Office carried out 130 enforced-return charter flights - at an average cost of Â£200,000 per trip. Jamaica represents about 1% of the UK government's overall enforced returns. Between 2019-21, 104 Jamaican nationals were sent back. Errol Brown fears for Eric's health. Care in Jamaica is free for people on the lowest incomes but public sector facilities are often understaffed, with medical shortages and a lack of funding. Errol can't afford to go private. ""I took him to the doctors after he landed because I was worried about medication, but our doctors out here don't deal with these kinds of things,"" he says. In the UK, the family has developed a close relationship with their local MP who is now challenging the government. Janet Daby raised a question in parliament on the day Eric was deported and supports all of the family's claims. ""In his younger days, he'd been groomedâ¦ coerced into getting involved in criminal activity. He's severely unwell."" She describes Eric's criminal activity as ""low level"" and says he has been ""demonised and shipped off to another country"". Janet Daby MP says Eric Hall has been ""demonised and shipped off to another country"" The Home Office says it helps fund charitable organisations in Jamaica so deportees can ""re-integrate back into society"" - but Eric's family says he hasn't been offered any ongoing support. On arrival in Jamaica we were only able to locate one such charity. They told us they receive funding from the Home Office but did not want to be interviewed. Eric Hall's experience in Jamaica isn't an isolated case. We've spoken to six other men, all with criminal convictions, who were flown from the UK and now live on different parts of the island. All say they've had no ongoing help and have been unable to find secure employment, training and housing. They say deportees like them are stigmatised and they worry for their safety. Some have had no choice but to live with elderly relatives, while others struggle to survive on the streets of downtown Kingston, where shootings and gang crime are rife. Jamaica's minister of legal and constitutional affairs, Marlene Malahoo Forte, says she takes ""serious issue"" with the UK's deportation policy of sending those who have little or no ties to the island and have been ""socialised in the British culture"". She says there is ""disregard or insufficient regard"" for matters of family ties. ""It's almost tantamount to the old method of punishment of transportation."" In a statement, the Home Office said: ""We are clear that foreign criminals should be deported from the UK wherever it is legal and practical to do so. Any foreign national convicted of a crime and given a prison sentence is considered for deportation at the earliest opportunity."" Downtown Kingston, Jamaica But Eric Hall's lawyers say he deserves to continue living in the UK - and they have filed a claim of unlawful detention and deportation against the Home Office. ""Eric's human rights have been breached. It's just wrong and completely unfair,"" says Holly Stow. ""There's a sense of desperation here from the Home Office to get people on a flight who shouldn't be on that flight - and shouldn't be detained in the first place."" The Home Office says it remains committed to ""removing foreign nationals with no right to be in the UK"" - but Polly Brown hopes and prays her son will return. Meanwhile Errol Brown in Jamaica says he will continue to care for Eric as best as he can while he is able. But he warns that time is against them. ""There's no future at all here. He can't survive on his own.""

"Sir Robert Buckland has become the first cabinet minister to publicly switch his support from Rishi Sunak to Liz Truss in the Tory leadership race. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Sir Robert said Ms Truss was the ""right person to take the country forward"". The Welsh Secretary had previously backed former chancellor Mr Sunak, citing his experience and judgement. Mr Sunak won most votes among Tory MPs, but Ms Truss is now consistently tipped to win the backing of party members. The pair are currently travelling around the country taking part in a series of hustings - events in which they answer questions and put forward their proposals in front of invited party members. The votes - either postal or online - will be cast over the coming weeks and a result will be announced on 5 September. As the new Conservative Party leader, the winner will also succeed Boris Johnson as prime minister on that date. Ethics an issue under Johnson - Welsh secretary Current energy bills support not enough - Johnson In his article, Sir Robert says he had initially backed Mr Sunak because he felt that, during the parliamentary rounds where MPs decided on the final two candidates, he was ""embodying what we needed."" ""As the campaign has moved on, and as I have listened carefully to both candidates, I have thought deeply about the issues that move me and what I want to see the next prime minister doing,"" he said. ""Changing your mind on an issue like this is not an easy thing to do, but I have decided that Liz Truss is the right person to take the country forward."" Sir Robert has previously described himself as a ""strong Remainer"" and a ""One-Nation, moderate Conservative"". Before becoming secretary of state for Wales, he served as justice secretary and prisons minister. He said he had switched to Ms Truss in part because she had pledged to address his concerns about the Bill of Rights, a proposed piece of legislation intended to replace the Human Rights Act. Sir Robert said he also wanted to see the next prime minister prioritise growth, saying it would be necessary if the government was to make a ""real difference to people"". ""We need growth and investment, and we need to learn to love business again,"" he wrote.

"Polly Brown - Eric Hall's mother The family of a man with schizophrenia is taking legal action against the Home Office for allegedly unlawfully deporting him to Jamaica. Eric Hall, who arrived in the UK aged 10, has convictions for theft, drugs and possession of an offensive weapon. The Home Office denies relatives' claims he was sedated before a flight and says the deportation was lawful. It says the rights of the British public are put before those of dangerous criminals. Although he was born in Jamaica, the 38-year-old moved to the UK with his family in the early 1990s and was granted indefinite leave to remain. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in his early teens, and his family and legal team say most of his past criminal behaviour - he has 28 convictions for 55 offences - was largely down to his poor mental health. They believe he has only ever been a danger to himself, rather than wider society - and that he continues to be seriously vulnerable. Critics of the Home Office policy say Eric's deportation, on grounds of his Jamaican citizenship, has echoes of theWindrush scandal. In 2018, many adult children of post-war Caribbean migrants, despite having lived and worked in the UK for decades, were told they no longer had the right to stay. The scandal led to thegovernment apologisingfor Home Office immigration mistakes against Caribbean migrants and their subsequent mistreatment. Before he was arrested in early March, Eric had been living in supported housing in east London and was being cared for by a mental health community team. His family says if he was sent a letter by the Home Office about his deportation he would not have understood its significance. Eric was taken to a detention centre where, his lawyers and family say, his mental state deteriorated considerably. He repeatedly told them he had not been served any deportation papers and did not think he was about to be flown out of the country. Jamaica: Forced Deportation Deportation flights from the UK to Jamaica are among the most controversial carried out by the Home Office. Adina Campbell has been to Jamaica to meet some of the people affected. Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) Eric's legal team say they were challenging his deportation but were not sent key paperwork from the Home Office which must be served legally within three days of someone's departure. Immigration lawyer, Holly Stow, also says they asked charity Medical Justice to assess Eric - their report concluded that because of his paranoid schizophrenia he should not have been detained and he was not fit to fly. The Home Office says foreign criminals, and their legal representatives, are served their removal directions in advance of flying. ""All claims raised are fully considered and determined before deportation, including where applicable via the courts."" Eric was put on a plane on 18 May. ""He's a sick boy. I live with him and I know,"" says Errol Brown Eric is too unwell to be interviewed - but in a remote farming town in the south-west of Jamaica we meet his elderly stepfather - Errol Brown. He talks to us on a hilly main road, outside a parade of boarded-up shops. ""He's sick. He's a sick boy. I live with him and I know,"" says Errol, his hands shaking before wiping tears from his eyes. He is now caring for Eric full-time at his home in St Elizabeth Parish - but says his stepson needs medication and face-to-face mental health support which isn't routinely available in Jamaica. BBC News has seen medical documents confirming Eric's paranoid schizophrenia - a condition also referenced in Home Office correspondence to him. Before his removal from the UK, Eric's family say he had been refusing to take any medication, and that on his arrival in Jamaica it appeared as if he had been heavily drugged. They say he didn't recognise his stepfather in Jamaica's capital, Kingston, and had no memory of how he got there. ""Out of the blue we heard Eric was in Kingston,"" says Errol Brown. ""He can't explain to me how he got here. I have asked many times. I know he was out of it. He would have had to have been sedated or knocked out. He didn't know where he was and he didn't have a clue who I was."" The Home Office rejects the claim Eric was drugged. ""Passengers are never sedated on removal flights and it's wrong to suggest otherwise,"" it said in a statement. ""When I used to go to school for his reports they always said good things about him,"" says Eric's mother Polly Brown Eric's mother Polly Brown, who lives and works in London, decided to take legal action because she says the Home Office was aware of her son's complex, long-term medical history. Given the severity of his mental health condition his family say he is unable to legally represent himself. Mrs Brown is now acting on her son's behalf. ""He only has his stepfather to look after him in a strange country that he left when he was 10 years old,"" she says. In her east London flat, surrounded by family photos, her mood momentarily brightens as she shares childhood memories. ""He was very loving. When I used to go to school for his reports they always said good things about him."" She describes how he was passionate about art and once painted a picture of his own face which was displayed in the school reception area. He was also a talented footballer playing for an academy outside of school. ""His manager used to call him the gazelle,"" she says. But it's not long before those fond memories vanish as her mind is then thrown back to the present. ""We all know that Jamaica now has become very violent. There are guns everywhere and there are killings every day,"" she says. ""It breaks my heart thinking about it - that he's out there and he might get killed."" Deportation flights are used to remove both foreign criminals who have finished UK jail sentences and other foreign nationals who have stayed in the country longer than legally permitted. Between April 2020 and May 2022, the Home Office carried out 130 enforced-return charter flights - at an average cost of Â£200,000 per trip. Jamaica represents about 1% of the UK government's overall enforced returns. Between 2019-21, 104 Jamaican nationals were sent back. Errol Brown fears for Eric's health. Care in Jamaica is free for people on the lowest incomes but public sector facilities are often understaffed, with medical shortages and a lack of funding. Errol can't afford to go private. ""I took him to the doctors after he landed because I was worried about medication, but our doctors out here don't deal with these kinds of things,"" he says. In the UK, the family has developed a close relationship with their local MP who is now challenging the government. Janet Daby raised a question in parliament on the day Eric was deported and supports all of the family's claims. ""In his younger days, he'd been groomedâ¦ coerced into getting involved in criminal activity. He's severely unwell."" She describes Eric's criminal activity as ""low level"" and says he has been ""demonised and shipped off to another country"". Janet Daby MP says Eric Hall has been ""demonised and shipped off to another country"" The Home Office says it helps fund charitable organisations in Jamaica so deportees can ""re-integrate back into society"" - but Eric's family says he hasn't been offered any ongoing support. On arrival in Jamaica we were only able to locate one such charity. They told us they receive funding from the Home Office but did not want to be interviewed. Eric Hall's experience in Jamaica isn't an isolated case. We've spoken to six other men, all with criminal convictions, who were flown from the UK and now live on different parts of the island. All say they've had no ongoing help and have been unable to find secure employment, training and housing. They say deportees like them are stigmatised and they worry for their safety. Some have had no choice but to live with elderly relatives, while others struggle to survive on the streets of downtown Kingston, where shootings and gang crime are rife. Jamaica's minister of legal and constitutional affairs, Marlene Malahoo Forte, says she takes ""serious issue"" with the UK's deportation policy of sending those who have little or no ties to the island and have been ""socialised in the British culture"". She says there is ""disregard or insufficient regard"" for matters of family ties. ""It's almost tantamount to the old method of punishment of transportation."" In a statement, the Home Office said: ""We are clear that foreign criminals should be deported from the UK wherever it is legal and practical to do so. Any foreign national convicted of a crime and given a prison sentence is considered for deportation at the earliest opportunity."" Downtown Kingston, Jamaica But Eric Hall's lawyers say he deserves to continue living in the UK - and they have filed a claim of unlawful detention and deportation against the Home Office. ""Eric's human rights have been breached. It's just wrong and completely unfair,"" says Holly Stow. ""There's a sense of desperation here from the Home Office to get people on a flight who shouldn't be on that flight - and shouldn't be detained in the first place."" The Home Office says it remains committed to ""removing foreign nationals with no right to be in the UK"" - but Polly Brown hopes and prays her son will return. Meanwhile Errol Brown in Jamaica says he will continue to care for Eric as best as he can while he is able. But he warns that time is against them. ""There's no future at all here. He can't survive on his own.""

"Passengers are being disrupted as rail services are hit by more strikes, with some firms running no trains at all. Some 6,500 train drivers at nine rail companies, who are members of the Aslef union, are staging their latest 24-hour walkout in a dispute over pay. There have been several rail strikes this summer, with unions calling for pay increases more in line with the rising cost of living. But rail companies said they could only fund a pay rise through reform. Avanti West Coast, Southeastern, CrossCountry, London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway are running no Saturday services at all, while other operators will have an extremely limited service. Transport for London has also advised passengers there will be no service on the entire London Overground network - which is operated by Arriva Rail London, whose drivers are part of the strike. The other operators affected by the strike are Great Western, Greater Anglia, LNER and Hull Trains. Train companies not involved in the strikes will be running services, but these are expected to be busy. London Euston and Birmingham New Street are among the stations that will be closed on Saturday. At Euston, a picket line with about 50 Aslef members has formed. People have been arriving at the station hoping to catch trains only to find the entrances closed. The disruption is expected to spill over into Sunday morning - so passengers have been told to check with their operator and consider starting their journey later in the day. Events including Coldplay's second night at Wembley Stadium and Premier League games in Manchester, London, Birmingham and Brighton will be affected by the disruption, with thousands of travelling fans having had to make other arrangements. Which lines are affected by Saturday's strike? How much are rail workers paid? Train strikes: 'I cycled 33 miles to get to a gig' Phoebe Clifford, 20, was planning to travel by train from her home in Canterbury to London for a Rex Orange County gig on Saturday with her boyfriend. However, the pair now have no way of getting there as no services are running. It means they will lose the Â£100 they spent on the concert tickets. She booked the tickets back in February as a birthday treat and had been looking forward to the gig for months. ""I can't sell my tickets because it's too late. I was looking to book a hotel in case I could go down tonight, and I can't do that either because they're all fully booked,"" she told the BBC. ""It's been an absolute nightmare."" Phoebe said she had been affected by every single train strike this year but still had sympathy for the workers and felt they deserved better pay. Karim Ullah, who owns an Indian restaurant in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, will also be impacted. One of his chefs normally travels to work from London by train but no services are running on Saturday. ""It really makes life such a misery because Saturday is one of our busiest, if not the busiest evening,"" he said. Mr Ullah is also worried about last-minute cancellations from customers who were planning to travel by train as this happened during previous strikes. Karim Ullah is worried the strikes will have an impact on footfall at his restaurant Passengers with advance, off-peak or anytime tickets affected by the strike on 13 August can use their ticket either the day before, or up to and including Tuesday, 16 August. Passengers can also change their tickets to travel on an alternate date, or get a refund if their train is cancelled or rescheduled.â¯ Season ticket holders who choose not to travel can claim compensation through the delay repay scheme. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said drivers did not want to strike but unless the deadlock was broken there was a ""big possibility"" of more walkouts. The union is also balloting drivers at Chiltern Railways, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express for strikes, with the results due later this month. Members of the RMT and TSSA unions are also striking on 18 and 20 August, while industrial action will be taken on 19 August by London Underground and London bus drivers. Mr Whelan pointed out there was also industrial action taking place in a number of other industries. ""There is a summer of solidarity coming - not a summer of discontent - where everybody is making their views known to the government,"" he said. There will be formal talks between Aslef and rail companies next week - a move welcomed by both sides in the dispute. Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, described this as ""a really good step forward"". He told the BBC: ""It is important we get round the table and we start to have meaningful discussions about how we can look at reform so that we can then offer our staff a pay increase. ""It is really important we take this opportunity and try and hopefully prevent further strikes and get some result to this situation."" Mr Whelan also told the BBC his union was always willing to talk but said if the meetings ""just go round and round in circles again, they're not going to go very far are they?"". He said the government was not allowing train companies to offer a pay rise of more than 2%. ""Let's not forget we work for companies that are making profits, we work for companies that take those profits and pay them to their shareholders,"" he said. ""The only people that are not getting a share of the revenue that's being generated are the people that work for the rail companies."" Passengers in Stoke-on-Trent on Friday were being warned to expect disruption Asked about Network Rail saying it had offered workers a pay rise of more than 5%, he said those negotiations had been with other unions and had to be looked at in the context of the cost of living crisis and the fact the offer was coming alongside redundancies. ""If you've had no pay rise for three years and someone's offering you 5% when inflation is 11%... I can quite possibly see why that's not attractive to any workers in the rail industry at all."" The union leader has joined a picket line at Willesden Junction in north-west London, where he was joined by Labour MPs Barry Gardiner and Dawn Butler. The Department for Transport said it was ""entirely false"" to claim the government was blocking negotiations. ""We have said from the outset we urge the unions and industry to agree a deal that is fair for railway staff, passengers and taxpayers,"" the department said. It said rail workers had seen above average pay increases over the past decade, with their wages increasing by around 25% from Â£35,000 in 2011 to Â£44,000 in 2021. It added that rail staff pay rises must be ""fair and in line with the wider public sector"". Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said it was positive news that Aslef had agreed to meet them next week. ""The good news is that we had informal talks with Aslef and there will be formal talks next week. That is a really good step forward,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He told the BBC companies wanted to offer a pay rise to workers but revenue had fallen since the pandemic. Mr Montgomery added that reforms were needed to terms and conditions, to save money by allowing staff to be more productive during their working hours. Train strikes: What routes are affected when?

"A federal judge has unsealed the warrant that authorised the FBI to search ex-US President Donald Trump's home in Florida FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Monday found documents marked top secret The warrant indicates investigators had probable cause to believe Trump violated the Espionage Act FBI agents took a cache of files, including information about the ""President of France"" In a statement, Trump says the documents seized by agents at his club were ""all declassified"" Attorney General Merrick Garland had applied for the warrant's release, citing ""substantial public interest in this matter"" Edited by Jude Sheerin President Biden's Democrats have just passed a key plank of their climate-and-healthcare agenda in Congress, but it's Trump who's dominating the news cycle. Here's a reminder of what happened on this momentous day:  This live coverage was brought to you by Brajesh Upadhyay, Matt Murphy, Max Matza and Holly Honderich. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent An egret stands near Mar-a-Lago Itâs been a week for the obliteration of precedents. First the revelation that a former presidentâs home had been searched by the FBI, made public  by Donald Trump himself. That brought three days of him and his supporters shaping that ostensibly bad news narrative into familiar themes â namely that the âpolitical witch-huntâ was continuing and that the state was still out to get him. Then, on Thursday the Department of Justice decided it had had enough of being traduced â doing something they do not do and requesting the  details of what they were looking for and what they found be published. And here we are with the most top secret of  classified documents being hauled away from a private, beachfront golf club and the FBI citing potential crimes involving the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. You might think this would put anyone on the back foot, but for the former president and his backers these are as much opportunities as they are jeopardies. They burnish his self-described position as an outsider and reinvigorate his supporters' desire for a second Trump term in which a âthird world countryâ - to quote President Trump - can be made great again. This isnât over by a long chalk. Lawn signs Defenders of Trump have been making comparisons to his old political foe, Hillary Clinton, who was found to have herself mismanaged sensitive government documents during her time as US secretary of state. She, too, was investigated under the Espionage Act for her use of a private email server. Problems first emerged for Clinton in 2014 after the state department said it was unable to transfer her emails to a congressional committee because it didn't have them. Instead of being kept on government servers, as is required under the same laws now being cited to investigate Trump, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate used a personal email that had servers at her New York home. Her lawyers transferred around 30,000 work-related emails to the state department, and deleted roughly the same number that she maintained were not work-related. Clinton claimed that none of the emails turned over were classified, but that was proven wrong by an FBI investigation. Announcing the results of the investigation in 2016, FBI Director James Comey said that 113 emails were classified, but that some had vague markings which did not make clear the sensitive nature of the documents. The FBI probe concluded in 2016 that classified information had been improperly transferred, but that it was not done deliberately. Trump capitalised politically on the controversy, leading chants at rallies of ""lock her up"". In recent days, Clinton has been having a laugh at her old adversary's expense...

power to declassify anything, so what he took with him from the White House
was declassified. Legal experts agree that a sitting president has the power to declassify any information, but they must follow a procedure. Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant US attorney general, told the BBC the process includes filling out forms and giving
certain authorisations. Also, a
president can declassify documents, but a former president cannot. ""That begs the question whether President Trump when he was
still President Trump actually declassified these documents,â said Dupree. He said the justice department will have to pore through each
document to ascertain whether these were
in fact declassified, and could there be any possible justification for Trump retaining those documents. ""Once they've completed that review, then they've got to
decide do they need to do further investigation? Do they need to go back? Do
they need to look in other places? Do they need to interview witnesses? ""And once
that process is complete, they'll make a decision as to whether or not to
charge anyone with a federal crime."" Brajesh UpadhyayBBC News, Washington Much of the analysis in the wake of the search has focused on one obscure criminal law mentioned in the unsealed warrant: Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Crucially, it states anyone convicted under that law shall ""be disqualified from holding"" federal office. This is why some are suggesting a conviction could all but end Trump's rumoured hopes of returning to the White House. ""That's a real law, and if Donald Trump violated that lawâ¦ that has real penalties, including the fact that he may never be able to serve in federal office ever again,"" presidential historian Michael Beschloss told MSNBC. Some legal experts, however, insisted that the law was unlikely to apply or survive any kind of appeal, as the only constitutional restrictions on presidential eligibility are citizenship, residence and age. Read more: Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? In a statement on Truth Social, his online platform, Trump earlier on Friday suggested FBI agents could have planted information during their search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump's insinuation came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly defended the integrity of federal agents. Trump also denied a report in the Washington Post that agents had been seeking classified documents related to nuclear weapons. ""Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax... two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,"" wrote Trump, adding: ""Same sleazy people involved."" ""Why wouldnât the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyerâs, or others, present. Made them wait outside in the heat, wouldnât let them get even close - said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT.' Planting information anyone?"" he added. Trump was in New York at the time of the search. His Florida-based lawyers were present, but the FBI barred them from entering the areas being searched. Agents also reportedly asked that CCTV cameras at Mar-a-Lago be switched off during the morning raid, but the Trump Organization refused to comply. A lawyer for Trump said on Thursday they may disclose video and photos of the search. The Trump Organization former CFO appeared in court on Friday Trump suffered another legal setback on Friday when a New York judge ruled that a criminal case against his company - the Trump Organization - and its longtime chief financial officer can proceed. Former CFO Allen Weisselberg appeared in court to hear the judge's response to his February request to dismiss all 15 charges against the company and himself. Prosecutors allege that the defendants are guilty of criminal fraud and tax evasion. They say the alleged scheme allowed Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes of some $1.8m (Â£1.5m) in off-the-books income. Jury selection is set for 24 October. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Reaction from Democratic members of Congress has been muted so far as they've just been voting a major bill through the House. But some have been piling on via social media. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted: ""Nothing to see here folks, just a former President of the United States being investigated for the violation of the Espionage Act."" Eric Swalwell of California urged Trump supporters to break from the former president, telling them that he ""stole Top Secret documents"" and ""put a target on the backs of cops"". ""If youâve been aboard the Trump Train the last 7 years, youâve been given an unexpected stop. Time to get off. Wherever you think this is going, itâs not,"" he added. Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has in the past faced national security scrutiny after federal agents reportedly warned him he was being targeted by a woman who was allegedly a Chinese spy. It was the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) that sounded the alarm about classified files at Mar-a-Lago, triggering the chain of events that led to Monday's FBI search of the club. In recent days Trump has been saying that his predecessor, Barack Obama, took 33m pages of documents, ""much of them classified"", to Chicago at the end of his presidency. Not so, says the National Archives. In a statement on Friday, the National Archives said that it had obtained âexclusive legal and physical custodyâ of Obamaâs records when he left office in 2017. It said that about 30 million pages of unclassified records were transferred to a National Archives facility in the Chicago area and that they continue to be maintained âexclusively"" by the National Archives. Katty KayUS special correspondent More questions than answers right now on what this means for Trump's future. First of all, why was he keeping classified documents, including one set marked top secret and only meant to be viewed in a secure government facility? What did he want to do with them? Trump claims they were all declassified. Clearly the Department of Justice disagrees. On the politics: the fact Trump is being investigated under the Espionage Act sounds dramatic, but will it cause any of his supporters to think twice about his fitness for office? Seems unlikely. Millions of Americans are now convinced the federal government is unfairly targeting Trump. On the law: legal scholars are in uncharted waters and will have to examine the implications of this. The big question being, if found guilty, would it make Trump ineligible for a re-election bid? Early reaction to this week's drama suggests a clear split between those who are galvanised to support the president and those who are reminded how exhausted they were during the Trump presidency. As we've been reporting, among the files seized by FBI agents during their raid on Mar-a-Lago were items cryptically marked ""Info re: President of France"". It is unclear what the files may refer to and French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to comment on the seizure. But officials at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace told CBS News they ""have no comment on a judicial American procedure"". Joshua NevettBBC Politics An anti-Trump protester outside Trump Tower He has been out of office for more than a year-and-a-half, but legal issues stemming from his time in office still pose some risk for Trump. The FBI raid on his Florida home on Monday has focused attention on his handling of official papers while president. Two criminal investigations are ongoing: one into possible election interference; another into potential financial crimes. A US congressional inquiry may recommend criminal charges over Trump's activities surrounding the riot at the Capitol in Washington last year. As he contemplates a 2024 presidential run, read more about the legal cases that could threaten everything. How big are Donald Trump's legal problems? Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee slammed the FBI on Friday At a news conference in Washington earlier on Friday, Trump's Republican allies slammed the DoJ inquiry and raised concerns about the tactics employed by federal agents. âBecause many other options were available to them, we are very concerned about the method that was used in raiding Mar-a-Lago and the nine hours that transpired while they were in the presidentâs home,"" said ranking House of Representatives Intelligence Committee member Mike Turner of Ohio. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said the Republicans plan to investigate the president ""and his administrationâs weaponisation of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Bidenâs political opponents"". To launch such a committee-level inquiry, Republicans would need to win control of the House in November's mid-term elections. ""President Trump has been targeted from day one of his presidency by the FBI,"" added congressman Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma. There are three levels of classification in the US government. The lowest -""confidential"" - is reserved for information that could damage US national security. This is followed by the ""secret"" classification, which could cause ""serious"" damage if revealed. The third classification level, ""top secret"", is reserved for information that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to US security. Apart from these three classifications,  there are additional control measures for the most highly sensitive documents - Special Access Programmes (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The SCI designation is listed in the warrant inventory, but it's not clear if any files were recovered from Mar-a-Lago under the SAP level of classification. Sources close to the inquiry told the New York Times that investigators had been looking for SAP material, which the newspaper describes as ""a designation that is typically reserved for extremely sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or for closely held technologies and capabilities"". On Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that federal agents had been searching for material ""relating to nuclear weapons"", but did not say that such files had been recovered from the Florida estate. Now that the documents have been officially unsealed, we can take a closer look at what they say. Beyond the standard forms, the warrant authorises agents to search Trump's huge Mar-a-Lago estate - but specifically any areas used by FPOTUS (Former President of the United States) and not those of other guests. The next page, however, lists exactly what agents were sent to look for: ""evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"". It cites three United States laws: Also unsealed was a receipt of what the agents took. Among more than two dozen entries, it lists items including classified and top secret documents, a grant of clemency forTrump's former adviser Roger Stone, and unknown information about the President of France. Trump waves to New Yorkers as he heads to his deposition This wasn't the only legal headache for Trump this week. On Wednesday, he had to answer questions from New York prosecutors investigating whether he illegally inflated the value of his assets in order to get favorable loans and tax breaks. He had unsuccessfully sued to block the interview, which is known in the US as a deposition. The former president refused to answer questions for the entire morning and most of the afternoon, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the past, Trump has attacked other public officials who have mishandled government documents, most notably his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton after it was revealed she kept her government emails on a private server. Trump has also repeatedly criticised any suspect who invokes the Fifth Amendment right, calling it âdisgracefulâ. See this clip:  This video can not be played Donald Trump on people pleading the Fifth Amendment: 'Disgraceful' The court document lays out that Trump is being investigated for violating a federal law known as the Espionage Act. The warrant says agents are authorised to seize evidence that uncovers efforts by Trump to unlawfully retain sensitive information that could aid US adversaries or destroy or conceal US government documents. Hereâs what the warrant says FBI agents were looking for:  A spokesman for Donald Trump has told the BBC's US partner CBS News that ""the Biden administration is in obvious damage control after their botched raid"". ""They seized the Presidentâs picture books, a 'handwritten note,' and declassified documents,"" said Taylor Budowich. ""This raid of President Trumpâs home was not just unprecedented, but unnecessary - and now they are leaking lies and innuendos to try to explain away the weaponization of government against their dominant political opponent. This is outrageous.""  A receipt for the items seized by FBI agents in the warrant is three pages long. The inventory includes the clemency letter granting legal amnesty to Trump ally Roger Stone, a leatherbound box of documents and one document titled ""info re: President of France"". Also listed are documents labeled Top Secret (TP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Some items on the list include ""miscellaneous secret documents"". The warrant is signed at the bottom by Trump lawyer Christina Bobb, who was present at Mar-a-Lago for the raid. A US Secret Service agent outside Mar-a-Lago one day after the raid The warrant says that agents are to search the ""45 Office"" - which refers to Trump being America's 45th president - as well as ""all storage rooms"" and all rooms used by Trump and his staff in which boxes could be stored. The warrant specifically excludes certain areas from being searched, including private guest suites or other facilities being rented or occupied by golf club members or guests.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"A federal judge has unsealed the warrant that authorised the FBI to search ex-US President Donald Trump's home in Florida FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Monday found documents marked top secret The warrant indicates investigators had probable cause to believe Trump violated the Espionage Act FBI agents took a cache of files, including information about the ""President of France"" In a statement, Trump says the documents seized by agents at his club were ""all declassified"" Attorney General Merrick Garland had applied for the warrant's release, citing ""substantial public interest in this matter"" Edited by Jude Sheerin President Biden's Democrats have just passed a key plank of their climate-and-healthcare agenda in Congress, but it's Trump who's dominating the news cycle. Here's a reminder of what happened on this momentous day:  This live coverage was brought to you by Brajesh Upadhyay, Matt Murphy, Max Matza and Holly Honderich. Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent An egret stands near Mar-a-Lago Itâs been a week for the obliteration of precedents. First the revelation that a former presidentâs home had been searched by the FBI, made public  by Donald Trump himself. That brought three days of him and his supporters shaping that ostensibly bad news narrative into familiar themes â namely that the âpolitical witch-huntâ was continuing and that the state was still out to get him. Then, on Thursday the Department of Justice decided it had had enough of being traduced â doing something they do not do and requesting the  details of what they were looking for and what they found be published. And here we are with the most top secret of  classified documents being hauled away from a private, beachfront golf club and the FBI citing potential crimes involving the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. You might think this would put anyone on the back foot, but for the former president and his backers these are as much opportunities as they are jeopardies. They burnish his self-described position as an outsider and reinvigorate his supporters' desire for a second Trump term in which a âthird world countryâ - to quote President Trump - can be made great again. This isnât over by a long chalk. Lawn signs Defenders of Trump have been making comparisons to his old political foe, Hillary Clinton, who was found to have herself mismanaged sensitive government documents during her time as US secretary of state. She, too, was investigated under the Espionage Act for her use of a private email server. Problems first emerged for Clinton in 2014 after the state department said it was unable to transfer her emails to a congressional committee because it didn't have them. Instead of being kept on government servers, as is required under the same laws now being cited to investigate Trump, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate used a personal email that had servers at her New York home. Her lawyers transferred around 30,000 work-related emails to the state department, and deleted roughly the same number that she maintained were not work-related. Clinton claimed that none of the emails turned over were classified, but that was proven wrong by an FBI investigation. Announcing the results of the investigation in 2016, FBI Director James Comey said that 113 emails were classified, but that some had vague markings which did not make clear the sensitive nature of the documents. The FBI probe concluded in 2016 that classified information had been improperly transferred, but that it was not done deliberately. Trump capitalised politically on the controversy, leading chants at rallies of ""lock her up"". In recent days, Clinton has been having a laugh at her old adversary's expense...

power to declassify anything, so what he took with him from the White House
was declassified. Legal experts agree that a sitting president has the power to declassify any information, but they must follow a procedure. Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant US attorney general, told the BBC the process includes filling out forms and giving
certain authorisations. Also, a
president can declassify documents, but a former president cannot. ""That begs the question whether President Trump when he was
still President Trump actually declassified these documents,â said Dupree. He said the justice department will have to pore through each
document to ascertain whether these were
in fact declassified, and could there be any possible justification for Trump retaining those documents. ""Once they've completed that review, then they've got to
decide do they need to do further investigation? Do they need to go back? Do
they need to look in other places? Do they need to interview witnesses? ""And once
that process is complete, they'll make a decision as to whether or not to
charge anyone with a federal crime."" Brajesh UpadhyayBBC News, Washington Much of the analysis in the wake of the search has focused on one obscure criminal law mentioned in the unsealed warrant: Section 2071 of Title 18 of the United States Code. Crucially, it states anyone convicted under that law shall ""be disqualified from holding"" federal office. This is why some are suggesting a conviction could all but end Trump's rumoured hopes of returning to the White House. ""That's a real law, and if Donald Trump violated that lawâ¦ that has real penalties, including the fact that he may never be able to serve in federal office ever again,"" presidential historian Michael Beschloss told MSNBC. Some legal experts, however, insisted that the law was unlikely to apply or survive any kind of appeal, as the only constitutional restrictions on presidential eligibility are citizenship, residence and age. Read more: Could Trump investigation stop him running in 2024? In a statement on Truth Social, his online platform, Trump earlier on Friday suggested FBI agents could have planted information during their search of Mar-a-Lago. Trump's insinuation came a day after Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly defended the integrity of federal agents. Trump also denied a report in the Washington Post that agents had been seeking classified documents related to nuclear weapons. ""Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax... two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,"" wrote Trump, adding: ""Same sleazy people involved."" ""Why wouldnât the FBI allow the inspection of areas at Mar-a-Lago with our lawyerâs, or others, present. Made them wait outside in the heat, wouldnât let them get even close - said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT.' Planting information anyone?"" he added. Trump was in New York at the time of the search. His Florida-based lawyers were present, but the FBI barred them from entering the areas being searched. Agents also reportedly asked that CCTV cameras at Mar-a-Lago be switched off during the morning raid, but the Trump Organization refused to comply. A lawyer for Trump said on Thursday they may disclose video and photos of the search. The Trump Organization former CFO appeared in court on Friday Trump suffered another legal setback on Friday when a New York judge ruled that a criminal case against his company - the Trump Organization - and its longtime chief financial officer can proceed. Former CFO Allen Weisselberg appeared in court to hear the judge's response to his February request to dismiss all 15 charges against the company and himself. Prosecutors allege that the defendants are guilty of criminal fraud and tax evasion. They say the alleged scheme allowed Weisselberg to avoid paying taxes of some $1.8m (Â£1.5m) in off-the-books income. Jury selection is set for 24 October. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Reaction from Democratic members of Congress has been muted so far as they've just been voting a major bill through the House. But some have been piling on via social media. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted: ""Nothing to see here folks, just a former President of the United States being investigated for the violation of the Espionage Act."" Eric Swalwell of California urged Trump supporters to break from the former president, telling them that he ""stole Top Secret documents"" and ""put a target on the backs of cops"". ""If youâve been aboard the Trump Train the last 7 years, youâve been given an unexpected stop. Time to get off. Wherever you think this is going, itâs not,"" he added. Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, has in the past faced national security scrutiny after federal agents reportedly warned him he was being targeted by a woman who was allegedly a Chinese spy. It was the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) that sounded the alarm about classified files at Mar-a-Lago, triggering the chain of events that led to Monday's FBI search of the club. In recent days Trump has been saying that his predecessor, Barack Obama, took 33m pages of documents, ""much of them classified"", to Chicago at the end of his presidency. Not so, says the National Archives. In a statement on Friday, the National Archives said that it had obtained âexclusive legal and physical custodyâ of Obamaâs records when he left office in 2017. It said that about 30 million pages of unclassified records were transferred to a National Archives facility in the Chicago area and that they continue to be maintained âexclusively"" by the National Archives. Katty KayUS special correspondent More questions than answers right now on what this means for Trump's future. First of all, why was he keeping classified documents, including one set marked top secret and only meant to be viewed in a secure government facility? What did he want to do with them? Trump claims they were all declassified. Clearly the Department of Justice disagrees. On the politics: the fact Trump is being investigated under the Espionage Act sounds dramatic, but will it cause any of his supporters to think twice about his fitness for office? Seems unlikely. Millions of Americans are now convinced the federal government is unfairly targeting Trump. On the law: legal scholars are in uncharted waters and will have to examine the implications of this. The big question being, if found guilty, would it make Trump ineligible for a re-election bid? Early reaction to this week's drama suggests a clear split between those who are galvanised to support the president and those who are reminded how exhausted they were during the Trump presidency. As we've been reporting, among the files seized by FBI agents during their raid on Mar-a-Lago were items cryptically marked ""Info re: President of France"". It is unclear what the files may refer to and French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to comment on the seizure. But officials at the ÃlysÃ©e Palace told CBS News they ""have no comment on a judicial American procedure"". Joshua NevettBBC Politics An anti-Trump protester outside Trump Tower He has been out of office for more than a year-and-a-half, but legal issues stemming from his time in office still pose some risk for Trump. The FBI raid on his Florida home on Monday has focused attention on his handling of official papers while president. Two criminal investigations are ongoing: one into possible election interference; another into potential financial crimes. A US congressional inquiry may recommend criminal charges over Trump's activities surrounding the riot at the Capitol in Washington last year. As he contemplates a 2024 presidential run, read more about the legal cases that could threaten everything. How big are Donald Trump's legal problems? Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee slammed the FBI on Friday At a news conference in Washington earlier on Friday, Trump's Republican allies slammed the DoJ inquiry and raised concerns about the tactics employed by federal agents. âBecause many other options were available to them, we are very concerned about the method that was used in raiding Mar-a-Lago and the nine hours that transpired while they were in the presidentâs home,"" said ranking House of Representatives Intelligence Committee member Mike Turner of Ohio. New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said the Republicans plan to investigate the president ""and his administrationâs weaponisation of the Department of Justice and FBI against Joe Bidenâs political opponents"". To launch such a committee-level inquiry, Republicans would need to win control of the House in November's mid-term elections. ""President Trump has been targeted from day one of his presidency by the FBI,"" added congressman Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma. There are three levels of classification in the US government. The lowest -""confidential"" - is reserved for information that could damage US national security. This is followed by the ""secret"" classification, which could cause ""serious"" damage if revealed. The third classification level, ""top secret"", is reserved for information that could cause ""exceptionally grave"" damage to US security. Apart from these three classifications,  there are additional control measures for the most highly sensitive documents - Special Access Programmes (SAP) and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). The SCI designation is listed in the warrant inventory, but it's not clear if any files were recovered from Mar-a-Lago under the SAP level of classification. Sources close to the inquiry told the New York Times that investigators had been looking for SAP material, which the newspaper describes as ""a designation that is typically reserved for extremely sensitive operations carried out by the United States abroad or for closely held technologies and capabilities"". On Thursday night, the Washington Post reported that federal agents had been searching for material ""relating to nuclear weapons"", but did not say that such files had been recovered from the Florida estate. Now that the documents have been officially unsealed, we can take a closer look at what they say. Beyond the standard forms, the warrant authorises agents to search Trump's huge Mar-a-Lago estate - but specifically any areas used by FPOTUS (Former President of the United States) and not those of other guests. The next page, however, lists exactly what agents were sent to look for: ""evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed"". It cites three United States laws: Also unsealed was a receipt of what the agents took. Among more than two dozen entries, it lists items including classified and top secret documents, a grant of clemency forTrump's former adviser Roger Stone, and unknown information about the President of France. Trump waves to New Yorkers as he heads to his deposition This wasn't the only legal headache for Trump this week. On Wednesday, he had to answer questions from New York prosecutors investigating whether he illegally inflated the value of his assets in order to get favorable loans and tax breaks. He had unsuccessfully sued to block the interview, which is known in the US as a deposition. The former president refused to answer questions for the entire morning and most of the afternoon, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. In the past, Trump has attacked other public officials who have mishandled government documents, most notably his 2016 presidential opponent Hillary Clinton after it was revealed she kept her government emails on a private server.

"Passengers are being disrupted as rail services are hit by more strikes, with some firms running no trains at all. Some 6,500 train drivers at nine rail companies, who are members of the Aslef union, are staging their latest 24-hour walkout in a dispute over pay. There have been several rail strikes this summer, with unions calling for pay increases more in line with the rising cost of living. But rail companies said they could only fund a pay rise through reform. Avanti West Coast, Southeastern, CrossCountry, London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway are running no Saturday services at all, while other operators will have an extremely limited service. Transport for London has also advised passengers there will be no service on the entire London Overground network - which is operated by Arriva Rail London, whose drivers are part of the strike. The other operators affected by the strike are Great Western, Greater Anglia, LNER and Hull Trains. Train companies not involved in the strikes will be running services, but these are expected to be busy. London Euston and Birmingham New Street are among the stations that will be closed on Saturday. At Euston, a picket line with about 50 Aslef members has formed. People have been arriving at the station hoping to catch trains only to find the entrances closed. The disruption is expected to spill over into Sunday morning - so passengers have been told to check with their operator and consider starting their journey later in the day. Events including Coldplay's second night at Wembley Stadium and Premier League games in Manchester, London, Birmingham and Brighton will be affected by the disruption, with thousands of travelling fans having had to make other arrangements. Which lines are affected by Saturday's strike? How much are rail workers paid? Train strikes: 'I cycled 33 miles to get to a gig' Phoebe Clifford, 20, was planning to travel by train from her home in Canterbury to London for a Rex Orange County gig on Saturday with her boyfriend. However, the pair now have no way of getting there as no services are running. It means they will lose the Â£100 they spent on the concert tickets. She booked the tickets back in February as a birthday treat and had been looking forward to the gig for months. ""I can't sell my tickets because it's too late. I was looking to book a hotel in case I could go down tonight, and I can't do that either because they're all fully booked,"" she told the BBC. ""It's been an absolute nightmare."" Phoebe said she had been affected by every single train strike this year but still had sympathy for the workers and felt they deserved better pay. Karim Ullah, who owns an Indian restaurant in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, will also be impacted. One of his chefs normally travels to work from London by train but no services are running on Saturday. ""It really makes life such a misery because Saturday is one of our busiest, if not the busiest evening,"" he said. Mr Ullah is also worried about last-minute cancellations from customers who were planning to travel by train as this happened during previous strikes. Karim Ullah is worried the strikes will have an impact on footfall at his restaurant Passengers with advance, off-peak or anytime tickets affected by the strike on 13 August can use their ticket either the day before, or up to and including Tuesday, 16 August. Passengers can also change their tickets to travel on an alternate date, or get a refund if their train is cancelled or rescheduled.â¯ Season ticket holders who choose not to travel can claim compensation through the delay repay scheme. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said drivers did not want to strike but unless the deadlock was broken there was a ""big possibility"" of more walkouts. The union is also balloting drivers at Chiltern Railways, Northern Trains and TransPennine Express for strikes, with the results due later this month. Members of the RMT and TSSA unions are also striking on 18 and 20 August, while industrial action will be taken on 19 August by London Underground and London bus drivers. Mr Whelan pointed out there was also industrial action taking place in a number of other industries. ""There is a summer of solidarity coming - not a summer of discontent - where everybody is making their views known to the government,"" he said. There will be formal talks between Aslef and rail companies next week - a move welcomed by both sides in the dispute. Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, described this as ""a really good step forward"". He told the BBC: ""It is important we get round the table and we start to have meaningful discussions about how we can look at reform so that we can then offer our staff a pay increase. ""It is really important we take this opportunity and try and hopefully prevent further strikes and get some result to this situation."" Mr Whelan also told the BBC his union was always willing to talk but said if the meetings ""just go round and round in circles again, they're not going to go very far are they?"". He said the government was not allowing train companies to offer a pay rise of more than 2%. ""Let's not forget we work for companies that are making profits, we work for companies that take those profits and pay them to their shareholders,"" he said. ""The only people that are not getting a share of the revenue that's being generated are the people that work for the rail companies."" Passengers in Stoke-on-Trent on Friday were being warned to expect disruption Asked about Network Rail saying it had offered workers a pay rise of more than 5%, he said those negotiations had been with other unions and had to be looked at in the context of the cost of living crisis and the fact the offer was coming alongside redundancies. ""If you've had no pay rise for three years and someone's offering you 5% when inflation is 11%... I can quite possibly see why that's not attractive to any workers in the rail industry at all."" The union leader has joined a picket line at Willesden Junction in north-west London, where he was joined by Labour MPs Barry Gardiner and Dawn Butler. The Department for Transport said it was ""entirely false"" to claim the government was blocking negotiations. ""We have said from the outset we urge the unions and industry to agree a deal that is fair for railway staff, passengers and taxpayers,"" the department said. It said rail workers had seen above average pay increases over the past decade, with their wages increasing by around 25% from Â£35,000 in 2011 to Â£44,000 in 2021. It added that rail staff pay rises must be ""fair and in line with the wider public sector"". Steve Montgomery, chairman of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said it was positive news that Aslef had agreed to meet them next week. ""The good news is that we had informal talks with Aslef and there will be formal talks next week. That is a really good step forward,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He told the BBC companies wanted to offer a pay rise to workers but revenue had fallen since the pandemic. Mr Montgomery added that reforms were needed to terms and conditions, to save money by allowing staff to be more productive during their working hours. Train strikes: What routes are affected when?
