"The transport secretary has called for the boss of P&O to resign after the sacking of nearly 800 staff without notice. Grant Shapps hascalled Peter Hebblethwaite's actions outrageous, and said that the government would force the company to U-turn. However, Mr Shapps later told the Commons the government was ""not in a position"" to take court action against the company and any action would be down to trade unions and the workers themselves. Mr Hebblethwaite admitted to a committee of MPs last week that he had not consulted his employees in advance, or their representatives, and admitted that this was against the law. ""There's absolutely no doubt that we were required to consult with the unions - we chose not to do that,"" he told MPs. He said that the sacked employees would be compensated ""in full"", with a package worth Â£36.5m - 40 employees would get more than Â£100,000 and nobody would be paid less than Â£15,000. Not consulting on cuts broke law, P&O boss admits Boris Johnson said last week during Prime Minister's Questions that the company had also broken the law by failing to give the government 45 days' notice of its actions. However, lawyers suggested the prime minister was mistaken. Doubt over PM claim that P&O sackings may be illegal Changes to the law made in in 2018 stated that if the ship on which the employees were working was registered in another country, the management had to inform the authorities in the country where it was registered - not the country where it was operating. P&O has ships registered in Cyprus, the Bahamas and Bermuda. In a letter to the government,external, Mr Hebblethwaite said: ""The very clear statutory obligation in this case was... to notify the competent authority of the state where the vessel is registered"" and said that had been done on 17 March. Mr Hebblethwaite re-stated this point in person to MPs on the House of Commons Transport Committee, although he did not explain how the company had complied with it. Cypriot authorities need to be given at least 45 days' notice to make more than 100 redundancies. In Bermuda and the Bahamas, 30 days' notice is required. Lawyers have also questioned whether P&O did in fact give the necessary notice to these authorities. Under UK law, employers planning to make 20 or more staff redundant within any 90-day period, must first consult staff and speak to trade union representatives. If this doesn't happen, employees are entitled to take their employer to a tribunal. Rosemary Connolly, an employment solicitor, says it appears P&O set aside the consultation phase and moved to terminate workers, as the process of consultation ""ordinarily takes quite a lot of time"". ""If consultation is going to be meaningful it needs to be a proper exchange,"" she says. She believes that P&O staff who have been sacked, might be able to argue that their dismissal was unfair and make a claim. Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? Kate Palmer, HR advice director at Peninsula, agrees. ""There has been no meaningful consultation at all. It should be two-way process where the employees have the opportunity to put forward alternatives to that enforced termination and none of that has happened. So is it a fair process? No, based on that alone."" Ms Connolly says a problem in such cases is that any action by the workers is ""very much after the horse has bolted"". Staff would have to wait months on average for an outcome. She points out staff would have no jobs potentially during the claim period and would have to pay legal costs even if they win their case, although unions might help with those. P&O workers in Dover protest against their sacking Staff are also being asked to sign forms that will prevent them taking legal action if they accept compensation from P&O. However, the fact that P&O's owners, DP World, are based in Dubai, should not affect employees making a case for wrongful dismissal, according to Ms Connolly. She says that under UK employment law, workers' rights are based on the ""jurisdiction from which you work"" - in other words, because they work in the UK, they are covered by UK law. If this wasn't the case, she says, companies could just register themselves abroad and employment law could be ignored. P&O says that the decision was taken ""as a last resort and only after full consideration of all other options"" because the company could not have survived otherwise. Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs that the company needed to move to ""a competitive operating model that is recognised throughout the world and our competitors also use"". Union representatives told the committee that Irish Ferries had also previously moved to hiring cheaper foreign staff, but that the unions still had good agreements with Stena and DFDS. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC News that ""Irish Ferries already went down this route"" and warned that the company ""will have to change their operating model"".

"Catherine was all smiles despite the torrential rain that accompanied the royal visit to Sybil Strachan Primary School The Duchess of Cambridge told children to ""cherish"" their friends during a visit to a primary school in the Bahamas. Catherine spoke of the challenges pupils faced in being apart from classmates and teachers when schools shut for two years during the pandemic. She said the friendships made at school were ""special"" and urged the youngsters to ""cherish... and take time for them"". Her remarks came on the last day of William and Catherine's Caribbean tour. The royal tour has seen activists calling for the monarchy to pay reparations for the slave trade and Prince William tell of his ""sorrow"" over slaveryin a speech in Jamaica. The duke and duchess sheltered from torrential rain under umbrellas as they arrived in Nassau on Friday. They jokingly apologised for bringing typical British weather to the Bahamas as hundreds of people gathered to see the royal couple in the capital. The deluge did little to dampen the carnival atmosphere as the couple watched a traditional Bahamian Junkanoo parade featuring performers in elaborate costumes. The duke and duchess watched performers in elaborate costumes in the Junkanoo carnival The duke and duchess sheltered under umbrellas as they watched the parade in the capital Nassau Earlier, William and Catherine praised the efforts of key workers during the pandemic, with the duchess speaking to medics at the Princess Margaret Hospital about the importance of mental and physical health. The duke met members of the Bahamas Red Cross who had dealt with the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian in 2019 before being deployed to Covid-19 hubs. In a bid to lighten the mood, he said: ""We don't want any more disasters for you, let's hope the Bahamas Red Cross has a boring few years!"" This video can not be played Watch: The Duchess of Cambridge tells Bahamian schoolchildren, ""I see all of you as the stars of this country"" On their first engagement of the day at Sybil Strachan primary school, the royal couple joined an assembly, where students presented them with a portrait of the Queen. In a speech, Catherine told pupils the pandemic had ""taken you away from your classrooms and your friends and learning from home has had its challenges"". ""That is why it is so wonderful that after nearly two years away, you have recently returned to school and been reunited with your teachers and friends again,"" she said. Palace staff must be wondering how the defining image of the Cambridges' trip to the Caribbean was not the explosion of joy and pleasure that greeted the couple in Trench Town, in the Jamaican capital of Kingston. But instead, what looked to many as some sort of white-saviour parody, with Catherine and William fleetingly making contact with the outstretched fingers of Jamaican children, pushing through a wire fence. It was a bad misstep for a couple who are surprisingly media-savvy. And it was not the only one on this curiously disorganised trip. The first engagement in Belize was hurriedly cancelled following a protest by some residents. Another smaller protest popped up on the day they arrived in Jamaica. It is worth noting that many things went well. Prince William's speeches were thoughtful and well-received. And at their various events, the Cambridges thanked those who so often go un-thanked and unrewarded for their efforts, drawing attention to stubbornly unfashionable causes and issues.

The duchess, who has carried out extensive work on early learning and child development, added: ""The connections, the relationships and friendships that you make during school are so special. ""So please look after them, cherish them and take time for them. And be kind, understanding and loving to yourself and others."" She also praised the ""spectacular natural environment"" of the Bahamas and said she hoped the couple's three children, Prince George, eight, Princess Charlotte, six, and Prince Louis, three, might experience its ""clear waters and beautiful beaches before too long"". William and Catherine met students at Sybil Strachan Primary School in Nassau on the final day of their tour William and Catherine were given a painting of the Queen during the school visit The duke and duchess arrived in the Bahamas from Jamaica on Thursday, and were greeted by Prime Minister Philip Davis, who conveyed his best wishes to the Queen, ""and congratulations on her Platinum Jubilee"". He added: ""I do not think we will see the same again,"" to which William nodded. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge posed for a photograph with the Prime Minister of the Bahamas Philip Davis and his wife Ann-Marie Davis The Cambridges' week-long tour to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne has seen them visit Belize and Jamaica before their final stop in the Bahamas. In Belize, the royal couple got involved in some traditional dancing, visited a chocolate farm and learned about efforts to conserve Belize's barrier reef. In Jamaica, they visited the neighbourhood where reggae legend Bob Marley lived and played football with England forward Raheem Sterling, who was born on the island.

In Jamaica, there have been calls for the Queen to be removed as head of state. Their trip comes four months afterBarbados became a republic. During a speech at a dinner in Jamaica, William described slavery as abhorrent, saying it ""should never have happened"" and ""forever stains our history"".

"Protests have been held in east London over the student's treatment The governing body of an east London school where a black pupil was strip-searched has publicly apologised for the incident. Asafeguarding report,externalfound the search of the 15-year-old girl, known as Child Q, was unjustified and racism was ""likely"" to have been a factor. In a statement the governing board said the school ""was not aware that a strip-search was taking place"". Child Q is suing the Met Police and the school in Hackney over the incident. The governing body said: ""The incident involving Child Q is harrowing, and we understand and share the sadness and anger that is being felt by the community. ""While the school was not aware that a strip search was taking place, we wholly accept that the child should not have been left in the situation that she was. ""For this, we have offered a full and formal apology to Child Q and her family, and continue to work with them to provide what support we can."" Lawyers acting on behalf of Child Q have asked for the school not to be named in the media.

No other adult was present, her parents were not contacted, and no drugs were found. The girl's intimate body parts were exposed and she was made to take off her sanitary towel, according to the review. Scotland Yard has admitted the actions of the two officers were""regrettable"" and it ""should never have happened"". On Monday, policing minister Kit Malthouse said the governmentwas taking the matter ""extremely seriously"". In the statement, the school's governing board said ""changes were made immediately after the incident, and continued to be made"". Since the incident, the school has changed the leadership of its governing board. However, research by the BBC shows the chair of governors was still in place six months after the search occurred. The make-up of the board has also changed. The governing board said it would not comment on the employment status of anyone involved.

"A P&O Ferries ship is being held in Northern Ireland because it is ""unfit to sail"", nine days after the company sacked 800 workers without notice. The European Causeway had been held in Larne over ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"", the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said. P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service. Protests at UK ports are calling on customers to boycott the company. They gathered in Dover, Hull and Liverpool, chanting slogans such as ""don't go P&O"" and ""seize the ship"". Protestors from the RMT Union are attempting to block access to the Pride of Rotterdam in Hull docks. Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress tweeted a video it said showed P&O dockers in Rotterdam refusing to load freight onto a ferry set for Hull in solidarity with sacked workers. Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? Calls grow for P&O boss to quit Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after the firm replaced their members with workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be Â£5.50, less than the UK minimum wage. As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of Â£8.91 does not apply. At the Dover protest, RMT union national secretary Darren Procter said: ""Bringing a crew on board a vessel they're not familiar with to sail across the busiest shipping lane in the world, carrying passengers, is going to be a dangerous act."" He said the MCA should detain every other P&O Ferries vessel around the UK on the basis they are not fit to sail. RMT union members have been protesting at Dover, calling on customers to boycott the ferry company The European Causeway sails between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland. P&O Ferries toldcustomers on Twitter,externalthat its services on this route were suspended, adding: ""It is no longer possible for us to arrange travel via an alternative operator on this route. ""For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves."" There were no passengers or freight aboard the European Causeway when it was impounded in Larne, the MCA confirmed. It said the vessel would remain under detention until all issues were resolved by P&O Ferries. Seamus Leheny, of freight industry body Logistics UK, said rival ferry operator Stena had increased capacity through Belfast by 50% but the situation was still causing difficulties for businesses. ""It's not sustainable to have so much freight coming through Belfast... we want that Larne service back up and running as soon as possible,"" he added. On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's calls for the boss of P&O Ferries to resign. Peter Hebblethwaiteadmitted to MPs that he broke the lawby not consulting workers ahead of the job cuts - but said he would do the same again if he had to. This video can not be played âP&O Ferries werenât just jobs they were our homesâ Mr Shappswrote on social media,externalthat the European Causeway's detention followed an instruction from him to the MCA to inspect ""all P&O vessels"" before they entered back into service. ""I will not compromise the safety of these vessels, and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training,"" he added. Labour's Louise Haigh called for the sacked workers to be reinstated and for Mr Hebblethwaite to be ""barred"" as a director. ""The shameful misconduct of P&O Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK's key shipping routes,"" the shadow transport secretarywrote on Twitter,external. P&O Ferries said in a statement that an MCA inspection had deemed the European Causeway ""not sufficiently ready for entry into operation"". ""We shall review the findings, make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service."" Meanwhile P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais remain cancelled. The firm said it would organise an alternative carrier for passengers. Saturday evening's service from Rotterdam to Hull is also suspended, the firm said - but the evening service from Hull to Rotterdam is expected to sail on time.

"The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is expected to go ahead as planned after hours of meetings following a missile attack near the track in Jeddah. The drivers spent four hours after practice on Friday discussing whether the race should be run. But eventually at 2.30am local time on Saturday, after further reassurances from bosses, they agreed to race. After an extraordinary series of events, team bosses emerged from the meetings to say: ""We will be racing."" Feature: Why is Saudi Araba's involvement in sport controversial? Saudis must 'do more' on human rights - Hamilton How to follow the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Full practice results Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the attack on an oil depot about nine miles from the track, according to the Associated Press. Second practice was delayed by 15 minutes after the attack as team bosses and drivers were called to a meeting with F1 president Stefano Domenicali. The drivers went into a meeting with Domenicali and managing director Ross Brawn about an hour after the end of practice and that meeting did not end for another four hours, as various senior figures came and went. BBC Sport has learned that a significant number of drivers had concerns about the safety of the event following the attack. But eventually they were convinced to go ahead and race after being given further information by bosses. Part of this information involved the possible consequences of not racing, such as how easily teams and drivers would be able to leave the country if the race did not happen. The first signs of the attack came as smoke had billowed across the track during the first practice session in the afternoon. Before second practice, Domenicali called teams and drivers to a meeting and told them the weekend would proceed as planned and that security for the grand prix has been a priority for the authorities. He said he would keep them updated through the weekend and met them again just over an hour after practice finished to share further information. But the drivers continued to be concerned about the potential risks of racing so close to a missile strike on a high-profile Saudi facility. The grand prix is also closely associated with the Saudi royal family. All the drivers' post-practice media sessions were cancelled. F1 said after practice had finished but before the drivers went into their marathon meeting: ""Formula 1 has been in close contact with the relevant authorities following the situation that took place today. ""The authorities have confirmed that the event can continue as planned and we will remain in close contact with them and all the teams and closely monitor the situation."" Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of F1's governing body the FIA, said: ""They are targeting the infrastructure, not the civilians, and, of course, not the track. We've checked the facts and we've got assurances from the highest level that this is a secure place. Let's go on racing."" There was a similar attack a week before the race, while F1 was at the opening event of the season in Bahrain. Once second practice started,Ferrari's Charles Leclercset the fastest time by 0.14 seconds from Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But the Monegasque, winner of the first race of the season in Bahrain last weekend, later hit the wall at Turn Four and damaged his car's steering. Verstappen's best time was set on the harder medium tyres while Leclerc's was on the soft, because traffic and other interruptions prevented the Dutchman completing his run on the softs. However, Verstappen was 0.2secs down on Leclerc's fastest time before he had to abort what would have been his best lap on the soft tyres. Ferrari's Carlos Sainz was third fastest, also with a fastest time on the mediums, after he too hit the wall, this time on the exit of Turn 13 and without damaging his car. Red Bull's Sergio Perez was fourth fastest, ahead of the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. The pair were just over 0.1secs apart and Hamilton was 0.4secs off the pace. The Mercedes cars were again suffering badly from aerodynamic bouncing - or ""porpoising"" - as their main limitation. As a result, Hamilton and Russell were 0.4secs off the pace by the time they reached Turn 13, the halfway point of the track, because of the bouncing affecting confidence through the high-speed swerves of the first sector. After that, they did not lose significant time to the fastest cars. The Ferrari drivers' incidents meant they were unable to go out again in the final part of the session to do their race-simulation runs on high fuel. Behind the Mercedes, Lando Norris was seventh for McLaren, after a more encouraging showing for the team following their dismal start to the season in Bahrain, when the McLaren was the third slowest car. Esteban Ocon's Alpine was eighth fastest, ahead of Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas and Yuki Tsunoda's Alpha Tauri.

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009 and they have two children Rishi Sunak is coming under attack from political rivals over his wife's stake in an Indian multinational operating in Russia. Labour said the chancellor has ""very serious questions to answer"" over Akshata Murty's shares in Infosys, a firm co-founded by her father. Mr Sunak has said he has ""nothing to do"" with the company. He has encouraged UK firms to sever ties with Russia to punish Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street told reporters on Friday that Ms Murty's stake in Infosys was a ""personal issue for the chancellor"". Software giant Infosys is one of India's biggest companies, with a presence in about 50 countries around the world. Sunak denies link to firm operating in Russia Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia The Western brands unable to leave Russia It was co-founded by Ms Murty's billionaire father Narayana, who retired in 2014, but retains a small stake in it along with other members of his family. Ms Murty's 0.9% shareholding in Infosys is thought to be worth more than Â£400m. A spokesperson for Mr Sunak has said neither she nor any members of her family ""have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company"". In 2016, Infosys set up an engineering centre in Moscow to support its customer, Ansaldo Energia, which was developing gas turbines to sell to Russian power plants, and other clients. After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, many global IT giants, including Oracle and SAP, suspended operations in the Russian Federation, and expressed solidarity with the Ukrainian people. Infosys is among those who continue to operate there, saying it has a ""small team of employees based out of Russia that services some of our global clients, locally"". ""We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,"" it added in a statement. ""Infosys supports and advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine,"" the company said, and had committed $1m to ""relief efforts for the victims of war from Ukraine"". The UK has restricted its trade with Russia via sanctions in the wake of its invasion last month - a move not replicated by India. Mr Sunak has said he would support UK firms that voluntarily cut ties with Russia in a bid to inflict ""economic pain"" on President Vladimir Putin. He has also urged British investors to ""think very carefully"" about whether investments could support Mr Putin, and he believed there was ""no argument for new investment in the Russian economy"". Pressed on Infosys's presence in Russia on Thursday, Mr Sunak told Sky News he had ""nothing to do"" with the company. Narayana Murthy founded Infosys in 1981 and the firm now has a presence in a number of countries But on Friday, Labour's shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said Mr Sunak had ""very serious questions to answer on this matter"". ""It is really quite shocking that these allegations have now emerged that Rishi Sunak's family itself is benefiting from business in Russia,"" she told BBC News. ""The chancellor has explicitly called on business to divest from Russia in order to inflict economic pain and ensure that the sanctions are as deeply felt as possible,"" she added. Asked whether Mr Sunak should ask his wife to sell her shares, Ms Haigh replied: ""Given that he's called on business to stop doing business in Russia, of course he should be ensuring that his own family follows that advice as well."" This video can not be played Louise Haigh: Rishi Sunak has ""very serious questions to answer"". Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said Mr Sunak ""needs to come clean and declare any potential conflicts of interest"". ""Openness and full transparency are key given the risks posed by financial connections to Russia,"" she added. ""The public deserves full transparency on this issue. It cannot be one rule for the chancellor and another for everyone else."" Infosys hashad connections in the past,externalto Alfa Bank, one of Russia's biggest financial institutions, which was added to the UK's sanctions list on Thursday, having already been sanctioned by the US and EU.

"Kharkiv has been pounded for weeks - now that Russian firepower may be deployed further east Is the Russian military having to change its plans? Perhaps even reduce the scale of Moscow's ambitions in Ukraine? It's probably too early to tell, but there's definitely a shift in emphasis. A top Russian general - Sergey Rudskoy - says the ""first stage"" of what President Vladimir Putin calls Russia's ""special military operation"" has been mostly accomplished and that Russian forces will now concentrate on ""the complete liberation of the Donbas"". This is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond the ""line of contact"" that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east of the country from the Russian-backed separatist ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk. The pace of Russia's advance in other areas of Ukraine remains glacial. Its forces have been pushed back from positions around the capital, Kyiv, and are said to have started digging defensive positions to avoid losing more or prepare for some kind of pause. Next stop Kyiv - the battle on the capital's outskirts Defiant troops tell Russians: 'Go home while you're still alive' It's probably way too early to conclude that Russia has given up on capturing Kyiv, but Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. On Friday, they said Russia had lost another general - the seventh - and that morale was at rock bottom in some units. They believe General Rudskoy's announcement implies that Moscow knows that its ambitious pre-war strategy has failed. ""Russia is recognising that it can't pursue its operations on multiple axes simultaneously,"" one official said. As many as 10 new Russian battalion tactical groups are being generated, officials say, and are heading for the Donbas. Even before the war began last month, they voiced the fear that Russia would make a concerted effort to encircle and envelop Ukraine's best fighting units which make up the Joint Forces Operation (JFO), stationed along the line of contact. A renewed push now could see Russian troops pushing out into so-far unconquered areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, possibly aiming to link up with forces moving south from Kharkiv and Izyum. And if Russia can succeed in finally pacifying the port of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, then other forces could move north and complete the encirclement of the JFO. Some of these objectives still seem out of reach. Mariupol's defenders are putting up a ferocious fight, preventing Russia from fully achieving another of its pre-war ambitions - a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas. But if Moscow has concluded that it makes more sense to concentrate, for the time being, on achieving one objective at a time, it's likely to concentrate its firepower, especially from the air. The Ukrainian military, disciplined and motivated as it is, will need all the help it can get to withstand the pressure. ""I hope that's where the Western supply of arms will make a significant contribution to Ukrainian forces,"" one Western official said. If the coming days do see a shift of focus to the Donbas, that doesn't yet mean that Moscow has abandoned its wider ambitions. ""We don't see a re-evaluation of the invasion as a whole,"" a senior US defence official said.

"After Viktoriia Roshchyna was released from detention, a hostage-style video began to circulate on pro-Russian Telegram channels Ukrainians are being arbitrarily detained and subjected to enforced disappearances in Russian-controlled areas, the UN has told the BBC. At least 36 cases of civilian detentions were verified by the UN, with families often denied any information about the fate of those being held. Ukrainians say they fear an escalating campaign of kidnappings and intimidation, as Russia struggles to assert control over towns it captures. Viktoriia Roshchyna, a journalist, was working in occupied areas in the east of the country when she was taken by unidentified men on 15 March. Her employer, Hromadske media, said she ""was probably detained by the FSB"", Russia's internal intelligence service, based on witness accounts of her being taken in the city of Berdyansk. She was released six days later when a hostage-style video - apparently recorded under duress - began to circulate on pro-Russian Telegram outlets. In it Ms Roshchyna said Russia had not taken her captive and thanked Moscow's forces for ""saving her life"". Svetlana Zalizetskaya, a journalist in the occupied city of Melitopol, accused Russian forces of taking her 75-year old father hostage as punishment for her refusal to co-operate with the new administration.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Ms Zalizetskaya, the director of local news agency RIA Melitopol, wrote on Facebook that her father had been detained after her meeting with the Russian-installed leader of the city, where she refused to end her criticism of the invasion. She said that she received a phone call from his captors, in which her father informed her that he was being held ""in some basement"" and said that he ""didn't know what they wanted from him"". His captors demanded that Ms Zalizetskaya, who has pledged to ""tell the world of atrocities"" committed by Moscow's forces in Melitopol, surrender herself. Ukraine's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said four journalists had also been detained and were later released in Melitopol. The head of the Ukrainian NUJ, Sergiy Tomilenko, said the detentions were part of ""a wave of information cleansing"" which is aimed towards the ""intimidation of journalists and public figures"". Mykhailo Kumko, a retired local newspaper publisher, is one of the journalists detained in Melitopol A spokesperson for the UN's Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UNOHR), whose monitoring mission in Ukraine has been documenting the abductions, told the BBC that those being targeted ""are mostly representatives of local communities, journalists and people who were vocal about their pro-Ukrainian positions"". But they said they were not able to assess whether those being detained form part of ""targeted lists reportedly drawn up by Russian security officials"". In February, US officials sent a letter to the UN warning that Russia had drawn up a ""kill list"" of Ukrainians to be attacked or detained following the invasion of the country. Some sources have suggested that a hack of a Ukrainian digital services app in January may have helped Russia identify targets, while the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has speculated that a hack of the Ukrainian national car insurance registry may have allowed security services to identify the locations of targets. A number of officials in occupied parts of Ukraine have been detained by Russian forces in recent weeks. In the southern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was abducted from a city crisis centre by Russian troops earlier this month. Discussing his detention with local media, Mr Fedorov alleged that other detainees at the holding centre he was taken to were being tortured. ""They didn't touch me physically but trust me, seven armed men were enough to make their position clear,"" Mr Fedorov said. ""In the next cell someone was being tortured - there were screams which generated plenty of psychological pressure."" ""They try to accuse them of sabotage and squeeze their fingers in the door to make them say which army they're from, but they're just local residents."" Ivan Fedorov met with President Volodymyr Zelensky after his release Alleged abductions have occurred in several other cities, including Nova Kakhovka in the north, where the secretary of the city council has disappeared, and in Bucha, where the local council told the BBC that six employees were detained and later released after a Russian raid. Ukrainian MP Alyona Shkrum said she believed the detentions were likely to increase as Russia faces a lack of co-operation and increased resistance in occupied regions. ""I'm sure Putin thought it will be just as it was in Crimea, they come they take over the administrative buildings and the mayor will say 'lets co-operate, I will be your mayor now, what difference does it make',"" she told the BBC. ""It didn't happen at all here... nobody, even from sort of pro-Russian parties agreed to do what Russian soldiers wanted them to do"". Russian forces have faced opposition in occupied cities like Kherson Ms Shkrum, a pro-Western MP, told the BBC that she was warned by the Ukrainian security services that she was likely on a Russian hit-list and was warned to avoid her apartment in Kyiv. ""Pretty much there are two lists,"" she said. ""A list of people to be killed as members of parliament, they are mostly people who [Russia] feel they cannot co-operate with. And a list of people to be taken hostage and taken to Moscow and forced to vote on something."" ""I also have sanctions against me in Russia, so I presume I am on the list to be killed or captured,"" Ms Shkrum added. The abductions have not been limited to public figures, with some civilians and ex-members of the armed forces also detained. Mattia Nelles, a Ukrainian political analyst, told the BBC that his uncle, a former medic with the Ukrainian army who fought in the Donbas from 2016-2018, had been targeted by Russian soldiers in the eastern city of Svatove. ""Security forces of the Russian Federation have come to his house and searched for him,"" Mr Nelles said. ""Luckily he was not at his house but neighbours confirmed that he is wanted."" Mr Nelles said it was unclear which element of Russia's forces are behind the wave of detentions, but in his uncle's case he said the troops were ""a mix of army personnel and some other security forces. We can only speculate whether it's FSB, they didn't wear insignia"". He fears that the campaign of arrests will escalate in the coming days. He observed that in southern areas, such as Kherson, so far the ""amount of arrests seem relatively low"" and some of the lists appear to be ""drawn up on the go"" as Russian forces identify those resisting occupation. ""Locals fear we are seeing the beginning of a more sustained campaign,"" he warned.

"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands. That had dropped to around 17% by August 2022,according to EU figures.,external In 2021, the UK got just 4% of its gas supply from Russian. It now imports none. EU states areincreasingly looking to ship in liquefied natural gas,external(LNG) in tankers from producers such as the US and Qatar. Your device may not support this visualisation The shift towards LNG imports by European countries has been very significant, replacing supplies from Russia. However, ""there aren't enough LNG terminals in Europe"", says energy advisor Kate Dourian. ""This will be a problem for Germany, particularly."" There are several new LNG terminals planned and some already under construction across Europe as countries try to boost their capacity. Clarification 21 October: A previous version of this story contained a graphic with the title: 'The UK has much less gas storage than some other European countries'. The aim was to show how much gas the UK had in storage at that time. It was not intended to show the UK's total capacity for gas storage. How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas?

"Smoke as heavy as a winter fog hung over the last mile or so of the road into Irpin, just a 20-minute drive north-west of Kyiv. Trees and undergrowth in the pine forest on either side were burning, set alight by shelling. The road was almost empty. When our BBC team was last able to come here, about three weeks ago, the city was badly damaged. Now it is in ruins. Irpin sits in an arc of towns that also includes Bucha and Hostomel, where the most important fighting for the future of Kyiv is taking place. If it is important for Kyiv, it is important for the rest of the country. The capital remains the biggest prize. It seems clear now that a central part of Russia's strategy when President Putin ordered the invasion was a decisive thrust into Kyiv, to replace the troublesome Zelensky government with one that would do as it was told. The failure of that strategy is, without a doubt, a victory for Ukraine. President Zelensky's presence in the capital is as well. While the government is here, and functioning, and while Kyiv remains accessible, President Putin has a constant reminder that the start of his ""special military operation"" - it is not called a war by the Kremlin - was badly bungled. Ukraine is winning another battle decisively - the war of the Twittersphere. From skilfully crafted video messages delivered by President Zelensky and world-famous Ukrainians, such as the boxing Klitschko brothers, to local journalists who suddenly have hundreds of thousands of followers, they dominate social media. It is a clever strategy, partly managed and partly spontaneous. The information battlefield is a vital part of modern war. 'Shame on you': How President Zelensky uses speeches to get what he needs But getting to the truth of what is happening in a war means being very cautious about declarations of victory or defeat by anyone. For journalists, that requires using your own eyes and ears, which is why our BBC team - and many other colleagues - have made trips to front line areas to try to base our reporting on first-hand knowledge. A month into the war, it's harder to get to the crucial front line at Irpin. In the first days, journalists were able to drive in that direction. They were waved through roadblocks, and images went round the world of thousands of displaced civilians crossing the ruins of a road bridge blown by Ukrainian engineers to slow the Russians down if they made it to the Irpin River. People cross the destroyed bridge as they evacuate Irpin during heavy shelling and bombing on March 5, 2022 But as governments and military commands organise themselves in wars after the confusion of the first few days, it is always more difficult to move around. So, when the opportunity came to revisit the area it was important to take it. It is never an easy decision to go into harm's way. Commander Oleg, the leader of the unit that was going to take us in, delivered a stern briefing at their base in Kyiv. His pistol was on the desk in front of him and his Kalashnikov assault rifle was propped up against a chair. The unit was part of the volunteer territorial defence. Oleg, a thick-set man in his 40s, said he had been a factory manager before the invasion. He said that shelling north west of Kyiv was constant. If we were lucky there might be a lull. If we were not whatever happened was our responsibility, and there were basements and cellars we would have to reach in a hurry. When displaced people were leaving Irpin, the road into the city was crowded with buses and ambulances picking them up and taking them into Kyiv. Many went straight to the railway station to head west, further from the Russians or to cross the border to become refugees in Poland, Romania and beyond. In Irpin I could see clearly that the last few weeks of bombardment had damaged almost every building. The ruined bridge was now the route into the battlefield for groups of Ukrainian troops, heavily laden with weapons and ammunition, who were pushing forward on foot. A few civilians were still emerging from the rubble of their town, people who had tried to hang on. A man called Pavlo, who walked painfully slowly with a stick, said he was getting out because a shell had destroyed his house. A soldier was helping him, carrying a few of things Pavlo had salvaged packed into a plastic supermarket shopping bag.  I asked the old man how he was. ""I'm bad,"" he said. ""Children are dying, everyone is dying. I didn't think I would make it to the bridge."" A man and a woman were leaving with nine dogs. The animals were terrified, and Slava was dragging them on a lead. She said they had been cut off, but now had to move. Saving Slava's dogs They were the exceptions. Otherwise, it was a military area, swept up by the fighting. Vehicles picked up the Ukrainian soldiers to ferry them deeper into the battleground. The sound of Russian heavy artillery rumbled constantly around the flat, boggy terrain. Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, all now in ruins, used to be desirable places to live, an easy drive into the city, criss-crossed by waterways, with plenty of forest to walk dogs. It turns out that what was good for the residents is also good for Ukrainian defenders. As one of the generals commanding the defence of Kyiv told me early in the war, the topography helps them. Spring is in the air, ice and snow have melted; mud and water are a nightmare for tanks. Forests are good places to conceal guns and build defensive positions. In a cellar Commander Oleg, who had delivered the stern warning in Kyiv, was more relaxed closer to the fight. The underground space, chosen because it had a thick concrete roof, was in a half-built house. It still had power. The lights on racks of battery chargers for walkie-talkies glowed in the gloom. Weapons were stacked in corners. Ammunition comes in metal containers painted army green, which are opened like giant cans of corn beef. Like his men, Oleg said the Russians had been pushed back. He explained that they were hitting Russian supply lines. Putin's men still had a toehold on the ground in Irpin, but the way they made their presence felt was with heavy artillery. Former British soldier Shane Matthews is fighting with Oleg's unit Shane Matthews, a former British soldier who travelled here from the UK with a Ukrainian friend, was part of Oleg's unit. Shane did not believe Nato should intervene, unlike every Ukrainian from the president down, because of the risks of a wider war. He had seen many civilians, including a family of four whose car was hit by an artillery shell. So little was left of them, he said, that their remains would barely have filled a bin bag. First-hand reporting helps, but it is still hard to penetrate the fog of war, especially in a place that is being shelled more or less constantly. As far as I could see, the claims made by the Ukrainian military that it is holding territory and even taking some of it back are true. What is also true is that Russia is using its formidable firepower and could still direct it at Kyiv. Even if most of their artillery is kept too far back to hit the city centre - a key Ukrainian objective - the Russians have destructive long range conventional missiles. So far, apart from isolated but deadly attacks, nothing nearly as bad has happened in Kyiv. Everyone in the city knows that could change very fast. In the city this week, more volunteers were being redeployed from quieter sectors to the battered north-western suburbs. It was quiet, a bit tense, as they waited for buses that would take them to the front line. Katrine, one of the few women in uniform, cuddled her 18-month-old son Nikita. It was going to be a brief reunion as she too was off to Irpin. Katrine said she had been a sniper since 2015 in the long war against Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Now she was back. ""I'm ready to kill,"" she said, kissing her boy, ""to protect his future"". Katrine the sniper cuddles her son before heading off to fight The war has changed everything for Ukraine, and for Russia. The world now feels more dangerous. Whatever happens on the battlefields of Ukraine, it is clear after a month that the Russian invasion is the biggest threat to international peace and security since the end of the Cold War. Its consequences are already being felt beyond the borders of Ukraine, in the shape of European security, the politics of the Nato alliance and the growing pressure on economies and food supplies. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned this week that disruption to Ukraine and Russia's agricultural exports could increase world hunger. Outside their headquarters, the younger volunteers were checking their phones as they waited for the buses. They were born when Europe was hopeful, in the 1990s. Plenty of older men, some in their 60s were there too. Two of them said they were fishing buddies. They  grew up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. Now the old drumbeat of the Cold War, the risk of confrontation between the big powers that was so familiar when Europe was divided by an iron curtain, is back for a new generation.

"Sir Philip Pullman said he had been ""pressed by people both in and out of the Society"" to retract his comments Author Sir Philip Pullman has resigned as president of the Society of Authors in the wake of a controversy over his support for an author who was accused of racial and ableist stereotyping. Last year, the His Dark Materials writer backed Kate Clanchy after her memoir attracted criticism. The society, a trade union for authors, distanced itself from his comments. He has now said he ""would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained president"". Sir Philip took up the post in 2013 but divisions arose last August when he described Clanchy's Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me as ""humane, warm, decent, generous, and welcoming"". And in response to a tweet he wrongly thought to be about Clanchy, he said people who don't read a book before they condemn it would ""find a comfortable home in Isis or the Taliban"". The society said his comments were ""not in the name of the Society of Authors"" and asked its members to ""be mindful of privilege and of the impact of what they create, do and say"". Sir Philip latertweeted an apology,external, saying criticism of Clanchy was ""reasonable and balanced"" and the ""experiences and imaginations"" of people of colour ""deserve every kind of respect"". Inhis resignation letter,external, which has just been published, he said: ""Recent events have made it apparent that when a difference of opinion arises, there is no easy way to resolve it within the constitution or the established practices of the Society. ""When it became clear that statements of mine were being regarded as if they represented the views of the Society as a whole (although they did nothing of the sort, and weren't intended to), and that I was being pressed by people both in and out of the Society to retract them and apologise, I realised that I would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained President. ""That being the case, with great regret and after long consideration I chose to stand down."" The society's chief executive Nicola Solomon said: ""We were very sorry when Philip told us in February that he intended to resign, and regret that his personal views have come under so much scrutiny because of his presidency of the SoA.

"Sir Philip Pullman said he had been ""pressed by people both in and out of the Society"" to retract his comments Author Sir Philip Pullman has resigned as president of the Society of Authors in the wake of a controversy over his support for an author who was accused of racial and ableist stereotyping. Last year, the His Dark Materials writer backed Kate Clanchy after her memoir attracted criticism. The society, a trade union for authors, distanced itself from his comments. He has now said he ""would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained president"". Sir Philip took up the post in 2013 but divisions arose last August when he described Clanchy's Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me as ""humane, warm, decent, generous, and welcoming"". And in response to a tweet he wrongly thought to be about Clanchy, he said people who don't read a book before they condemn it would ""find a comfortable home in Isis or the Taliban"". The society said his comments were ""not in the name of the Society of Authors"" and asked its members to ""be mindful of privilege and of the impact of what they create, do and say"". Sir Philip latertweeted an apology,external, saying criticism of Clanchy was ""reasonable and balanced"" and the ""experiences and imaginations"" of people of colour ""deserve every kind of respect"". Inhis resignation letter,external, which has just been published, he said: ""Recent events have made it apparent that when a difference of opinion arises, there is no easy way to resolve it within the constitution or the established practices of the Society. ""When it became clear that statements of mine were being regarded as if they represented the views of the Society as a whole (although they did nothing of the sort, and weren't intended to), and that I was being pressed by people both in and out of the Society to retract them and apologise, I realised that I would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained President. ""That being the case, with great regret and after long consideration I chose to stand down."" The society's chief executive Nicola Solomon said: ""We were very sorry when Philip told us in February that he intended to resign, and regret that his personal views have come under so much scrutiny because of his presidency of the SoA. ""Social media has changed the way we all communicate, organisations as well as individuals. ""We are in the process of reviewing the constitution to reflect the times in which we live, including the roles of the management committee, chair and president.""

"Face masks will no longer be legally required in Welsh shops Wales is to press ahead with scrapping self-isolation rules and the legal requirement to wear a mask in shops, buses and trains on Monday. In response to rising cases, driven by a sub-type of Omicron, the Welsh government said it would keep some, but not all, of its remaining Covid rules. Companies will still be expected to asses the risk of Covid in their workplaces and take precautions. But face coverings will only be legally required in health and social care. The decision has sparked concern among some experts and Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price, over the possibility of new variants in the future. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Self-isolation 'should continue' after laws lifted Wales agrees to end last Covid border rules All of Wales' coronavirus regulations weredue to expire on 28 March. The Welsh government had planned to let them lapse but earlier this week ministerssaid they were thinking again. This video can not be played Face coverings will only be legally required in health and social care settings Georgina Pattinson, who runs Conwy Collectibles on Conwy High Street, said: ""We've got a very small shop and I feel we need to protect ourselves so we shall continue to use these masks, probably all year, until we feel the Covid has passed. ""Because at the moment, just chatting to people, there are very many people just walking around today who say, 'Oh, I've just got over the Covid' or 'My son's got the Covid' and you do feel a little bit vulnerable."" Robert Hedge said he might wear a mask if there were a lot of people Pensioner Robert Hedge lives in Penmaenmawr, Conwy county, and relies on public transport.Â ""It's up to the individual. If they feel safer wearing a mask, then good luck to them,"" he said. ""I'm not overly bothered.Â ""I might (wear a mask). It depends how I feel if there's a lot of people."" Valerie Jones may still wear one because she has family members with underlying health conditions Valerie Jones, from Llandudno Junction, was enjoying today's Seed Fair in Conwy.Â ""I will still be wearing a mask because I have family members with underlying health conditions so I feel to keep them safe I will carry on in supermarkets and on transport."" Michelle Davison will keep the screens up in Conwy Art and Soap Bar Michelle Davison, who runs her shop Conwy Art and Soap Bar, said: ""I think it's welcomed from the point of view of people feeling a little bit freer. ""But from our point of view we are still going to keep our screens up because we are aware that it (Covid) hasn't gone."" Virologist Prof Richard Stanton said he would be surprised to see restrictions disappearing, saying ""England set the tone"" by getting rid of them and the Welsh government has a ""fine line to walk"". He cautionedon BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We are seeing a rise in cases as restrictions are starting to lift and this increase is spilling over to hospital increases at a time when the NHS is already stretched"". Prof Stanton, of Cardiff University, said the concern was that people would ""think it's over"" and with the likelihood of new variants emerging, these could spread more rapidly with no restrictions.

Alex Osbourne of Disability Wales is also ""very concerned"" about the prospect of masks no longer being a legal requirement as well as self-isolation rules disappearing. The 31-year-old from Caerphilly has multiple sclerosis and believes those who have needed to shield have ""been forgotten"". Alex Osbourne is worried about the implications of changes She said: ""People at risk may have no choice but to come into contact with some people who are Covid-positive, and at the same time masks are going. ""People really want to start going out and feeling positive. It's quite a shock."" Ms Osbourne urged people to keep washing hands, and if they have a cough or cold, be mindful of who they are meeting. What remains of the law will be extended for at least a further three weeks, with another review due on 14 April. PCR tests for the general public will no longer be available from Monday, although the Welsh government plans to keeplateral flow tests free for people with symptoms until June. This video can not be played Lateral Flow Tests will remain free in Wales amid a ""rapid increase"" in cases First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We have seen an unwelcome rise in coronavirus cases across Wales, mirroring the position in most of the UK. ""We have carefully considered the very latest scientific and medical evidence and we need to keep some legal protections in place for a little while longer, to help keep Wales safe."" In a press conference he said his cabinet's decision to scrap the remaining restrictions was ""finely balanced"". He said Wales cannot ""go on forever relying on the force of the law"" to keep the country safe from coronavirus. ""We have tried to find that spot where we recognise and respond to the growing numbers, but keep us on the basic journey where we are living with coronavirus, but not on the emergency basis that we needed for the last two years.""

He said levels in intensive care ""have remained broadly stable for the last 10 days. ""We are seeing more cases, but not more serious cases."" Wales' mask law will be amended from Monday so face coverings will no longer be legally required to be worn in shops and on public transport. The Welsh government still recommends people use them and they will be legally mandated in health and social care. Guidance will be issued recommending people self-isolate if they get Covid, but from Monday they will not be required by law to do so. For two years we've relied upon data to guide our actions. So with rates rising, is it any wonder some feel apprehensive that regulations surrounding mask wearing are to go - that guidance alone won't have the same impact? But the picture is different today. High vaccination rates and the dominance of a less virulent strain mean the harm to those testing positive is reduced. Of course, incidental cases in hospitals - where patients are primarily being treated for something else - still pose infection-control challenges for the NHS. And as we move to a period where health and social care staff continue to be tested - unlike the rest of us - the pressure of staff absences could continue. Face masks have been a common sight in shops for the past two years Payments of Â£500 for self-isolation will remain available until June. However, companies will still need to carry out risk assessments on their premises and put in place ""reasonable measures"" to guard against coronavirus. The move will leave Scotland the only UK nation with masks legally required in shops after ministers decided to keep the regulationsinto April. Welsh Conservatives welcomed the end to self-isolation and masks in shops and on public transport, but accused Labour of being ""anti-business"". Tory health spokesman Russell George said: ""At a time when the government should be doing all it can to boost jobs and productivity, is it right that businesses should continue to have fill out paperwork with little value? We need to trust businesses to do what is right to keep their staff and customers safe."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said his party was ""surprised and a little bit concerned"" by the Welsh government's changes to Covid regulations. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""We shouldn't interpret this as as moving away from the position where we still have to be conscious of the possibility that it could be further waves which could cause further problems that could be more more severe. ""Unless we have the surveillance in there, at least, then we're not going to be able to track those and be able to respond quickly enough."" The weekly swab survey by the Office for National Statistics has shown a rise in infections in the past couple of weeks. It suggested that 125,400 people in Wales had Covid in the week ending 12 March - up on the previous week's estimate of 97,900. PCR Covid results have diminished in importance in recent months but have also shown an increase. On Thursday, Wales' case rate stood at 424.2 per 100,000 people over seven days, up from about 156 at the end of February. Earlier this week, Health Minister Eluned Morgan said most people would experience mild symptoms from BA.2, the Omicron sub-type, but it is still expected to drive an increase in cases and hospital admissions.

"The project will help put modern floods and droughts in their proper context Thousands of weather enthusiasts are celebrating the rescue of a unique trove of UK rainfall data. The volunteer army stepped up during the first Covid lockdown to transfer handwritten rain gauge totals on to computers. This digitisation effort has given the UK Met Office a much clearer idea of when our islands were sodden or parched going back almost 200 years. And that's extremely useful for understanding climate change. ""What our 16,000 volunteers did in the first weeks of lockdown will really help us recognise long-term trends,"" said the Rainfall Rescue project scientist and Reading University professor Ed Hawkins,who's now analysed the new dataset,external. ""But almost more important is what we learn about extremes. We want to know about the big floods, the big droughts - how likely they are, how frequently they might happen. This will allow us to put modern extremes in their proper context,"" he told BBC News. Help needed to rescue UK's old rainfall records Same time, same place, whatever the weather English lakes' hidden flood history The Rainfall Rescue project was launched in those first few days after the government issued its pandemic stay-at-home order in March 2020. People were asked to while away their time by helping to recover a series of pre-1960 weather records known as the ""10 Year Rainfall Sheets"". These were 65,000 scanned pieces of paper in theUK Met Office archives,externalthat contained the scribbled monthly and decadal rainfall totals at thousands of weather stations across the country. Dr Ross says the digitisation project was a herculean task Converting all the data into a modern electronic form, able to be analysed by computer, was expected to take a long time, especially since the ornate handwriting on many sheets demanded human eyes do the job rather than an automated character-recognition system. But the British public raced through the information in just 16 days. ""Across those 66,000 sheets, we had 5.4 million individual rainfall observations. They were keyed into the computer four times for quality control purposes. So that actually makes over 20 million individual observations being keyed,"" explained Met Office archivist Dr Catherine Ross. ""Add in other data, such as the names of the places where the rainfall was recorded and who the observers were - we're up to 100 million keystrokes."" The British public love nothing better than to talk about the weather A vast effort, but one that will now pay big dividends. Consider the task of planning for the consequences of too little or too much water. How do we satisfy our need for water resources, for domestic supply and industrial use, and also ensure we have the necessary infrastructure to protect our homes from flooding? The ""weather memory"" recovered from the decadal sheets will underpin future decision-making. Some nuggets of information to emerge from the project include: The UK now has a dense grid of rainfall readings stretching back to 1836. Previously, it was only to 1862 Before the project, just 19 rain gauges had informed the 1862 picture. Today, the number is more than 700 There is now a new driest year on record. This is 1855, with just 786.5mm of rain. It takes over from 1887 There is now higher confidence that the wettest month on record was October 1903, with 220mm of rainfall The driest month for the UK is February 1932 with 9.5mm. Again, this record now has higher confidence The project has better mapped big drought periods in the 1880s and 1890s; and in the 1840s and 1850s Observations being taken at a rain gauge at Seathwaite in the Lake District on 14 July 1899 Much of the rescued data comes from a period prior to the Met Office's foundation in 1854 - a lot of it gathered by keen amateurs. These were individuals working in schools, in hospitals, at reservoirs and iron & steelworks, in lighthouses and at a chocolate factory. There's even royal data from Sandringham House. Its 10-year sheet from 1900-1909 has written on it: ""For His Majesty the King."" Social gatherings in London didn't keep Lady Bayning from her weather observations Consider one Lady Bayning. She recorded rainfall in Norfolk between 1835 and 1887, and would take her rain gauge with her to London for the social season. A good number of sheets had incomplete information, perhaps a missing location for the rain gauge. ""We had to track down a Reverend Iliff from Sunderland,"" recalled Jacqui Huntley, one of eight dedicated Rainfall Rescue volunteers (known as ""The Collective"") who set themselves the task of validating the recovered data. ""The poor man had so much bad luck. First, his rain gauge was stolen. He then had his arm broken and could only take readings for a few months, and then they put a road through his garden. We had to find his precise street to know where exactly he had his rain gauge."" Dr Mark McCarthy is head of the Met Office's National Climate Information Centre. He said: ""I'm always humbled to think about these individuals who were collecting weather records long before the Met Office existed or indeed any sort of systematic observing of our climate was under way. ""They saw fit to collect their records for whatever reason, and 150, 200 years later they've produced real gems for science.""

"The number of electric vehicle charging points will reach 300,000 by 2030 under government plans but motoring groups say the roll out is not fast enough. Under the plans, operators will have to ensure drivers can compare prices and pay by contactless card. But the RAC said the chargepoint target ""might sound impressive"", but it is concerned the number is ""not going to be sufficient"" for growing demand. The UK currently has 30,000 public electric vehicle charging points. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the number of chargepoints by the end of the decade would be the equivalent to almost five times the number of fuel pumps on UK roads today. It said the Â£500m scheme would include Â£450m to boost public charging stations and on-street charging for people without driveways. According to Melanie Shufflebotham, chief operations officer of Zap-Map, an EV charging app, 80% of electric vehicle owners have off-street parking. She went on to say that currently London is the area most ""well-served"" with on-street overnight charging, due to how built up it is, but that other areas of the country have better access to rapid or ultra-rapid charging. About a third of all chargers are currently in London. The funds were previously announced as part of the government's Â£1.6bn Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy, but the government has now given details about how the money will be spent. New standards and legislation will mean operators will have to provide real-time data for customers to check the status of chargepoints and apps for customers to find the nearest available one. They will also be required to have a 99% reliability rate at rapid chargepoints. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We're powering ahead with plans to help British people go electric, with our expanding charging network making journeys easier right across the country."" What does net zero mean? Are we ready for EVs? Simple guide to climate change Car industry calls for electric charge watchdog However, Sir John Armitt, chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, which advises the government on major infrastructure, said in a report there was a gap emerging between the government's aspirations on net zero policy and actions taken to reach it. ""We need to turbo-charge the roll out of electric vehicle charging points, accelerating the installation of both rapid and on-street charging facilities so that the 2030 date for the end of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars remains viable, he said. RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said it was ""pleasing"" to see the government set ""ambitious reliability targets on the chargepoints themselves"" as many current and would-be electric car drivers ""worry that charging units will be out of order when they arrive"". He also warned that the installation timescale of 300,000 chargepoints needed be quicker with drivers looking to switch to electric ""en masse"" ahead of the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The AA said action was needed on the lack of charging points in rural areas. Edmund King, AA president, said: ""As we advance quickly to the 2030 deadline for new zero-emission vehicles, it is vital that we get our charging infrastructure in order. While great progress has been made, there is still much to do to convince drivers on the number, and importantly reliability, of charge posts. ""To bring confidence and power to potential electric car drivers we need more, and more reliable and accessible charge points as soon as possible."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the increased number of electric vehicles will eventually lead to road pricing or tolls in place of fuel duty. Mr Shapps also acknowledged that electric cars are ""still a little bit more expensive"" to buy than petrol or diesel vehicles. However, he said that people should invest in electric cars as a way of easing cost of living pressures, by saving on fuel. Alongside the expansion of the UK's charging network, the government also has plans for at least 6,000 chargepoints across English motorways by 2035 though an existing Â£950m Rapid Charging fund. Over the decade between 2011 and 2021 the total number of charge points in the UK jumped from about 1,500 to more than 48,000 both public and private, according to industry figures. The Society of Motoring Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said electrified vehicles made up more than one in every four cars produced in the UK last month, at nearly 16,000 units. Overall, UK vehicle production slumped in February, from 105,000 units in 2021 to 61,000 units for the same month this year, due to continued global shortages in computer chips used in car production.

"Sir Philip Pullman said he had been ""pressed by people both in and out of the Society"" to retract his comments Author Sir Philip Pullman has resigned as president of the Society of Authors in the wake of a controversy over his support for an author who was accused of racial and ableist stereotyping. Last year, the His Dark Materials writer backed Kate Clanchy after her memoir attracted criticism. The society, a trade union for authors, distanced itself from his comments. He has now said he ""would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained president"". Sir Philip took up the post in 2013 but divisions arose last August when he described Clanchy's Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me as ""humane, warm, decent, generous, and welcoming"". And in response to a tweet he wrongly thought to be about Clanchy, he said people who don't read a book before they condemn it would ""find a comfortable home in Isis or the Taliban"". The society said his comments were ""not in the name of the Society of Authors"" and asked its members to ""be mindful of privilege and of the impact of what they create, do and say"". Sir Philip latertweeted an apology,external, saying criticism of Clanchy was ""reasonable and balanced"" and the ""experiences and imaginations"" of people of colour ""deserve every kind of respect"". Inhis resignation letter,external, which has just been published, he said: ""Recent events have made it apparent that when a difference of opinion arises, there is no easy way to resolve it within the constitution or the established practices of the Society. ""When it became clear that statements of mine were being regarded as if they represented the views of the Society as a whole (although they did nothing of the sort, and weren't intended to), and that I was being pressed by people both in and out of the Society to retract them and apologise, I realised that I would not be free to express my personal opinions as long as I remained President. ""That being the case, with great regret and after long consideration I chose to stand down."" The society's chief executive Nicola Solomon said: ""We were very sorry when Philip told us in February that he intended to resign, and regret that his personal views have come under so much scrutiny because of his presidency of the SoA. ""Social media has changed the way we all communicate, organisations as well as individuals. ""We are in the process of reviewing the constitution to reflect the times in which we live, including the roles of the management committee, chair and president."" In January,Pan Macmillan and Clanchy parted company ""by mutual consent"",external, with the publisher saying it would not publish Clanchy's new titles nor any updated editions from her, and would revert the rights and cease distribution, following criticism of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me Author to rewrite book over stereotype row Sir Philip Pullman calls for boycott of new 50p Author Philip Pullman receives knighthood Lessons in writing from Philip Pullman Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"US President Joe Biden met with G7 leaders in Brussels on Thursday, including Germany's Olaf Scholz and the UK's Boris Johnson After the disinterested, often EU-antagonistic Trump-years, the US is back with bells on when it comes to involvement in European security. That's more or less beenthe message of President Joe Biden during his late-week dash to G7, EU and Nato summitsin Brussels on Thursday, with a fly-by to Poland on Friday. The president's visit was borne out of the shadows of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And its aim was two-fold: Symbolic: a determined show of Western unity in the face the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine, and on so-called liberal values, like democracy and human rights Practical: in terms of security - both energy security and defence Biden says he's offering the EU access to US natural gas and hydrogen supplies, as the bloc tries to wean itself off a heavy reliance on Russian energy. This will take time to organise. The US president also made headlines during his European trip, announcing any chemical attack launched by Russia in Ukraine would be met ""in kind"" by Nato. Though he declined to go into detail. Washington had so far shown huge reluctance to get too involved in Ukraine for fear of provoking a wider war with nuclear power Russia. Eastern Europeans have expressed frustration in past weeks at the point-blank refusal by the White House to contemplate imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, for instance. Those same countries now welcome what they view as a change in Biden's tone. Though what he means in practice about a ""proportionate"" response should the Kremlin use weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, has been left - possibly intentionally - vague. What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine? Five challenges for Biden in Europe But while this new US interest and intervention has been welcomed by Europe's leaders, Brussels still suffers from an acute case of post-Trump wariness. It's too simplistic to suggest the EU is now resolutely pivoting away from reliance on Russian energy and business ties, towards Washington instead. France demands the EU avoid becoming dependent on any one country outside the bloc, including the US. Donald Trump being re-elected president in 2024 is seen here as a very real possibility. France's Emmanuel Macron (right) does not want the EU to be dependent on any outside country, including the US Instead, President Emmanuel Macron favours what he calls strategic sovereignty for the EU: where the bloc boosts its own energy and food production, technological advances and defence capabilities. The latter would be designed, Mr Macron is at pains to emphasise, to complement rather than rival Nato. Frankly, even if the EU wanted to trump the alliance in terms of defence, it's beyond the realms of the realistic. As is the idea that, five weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, intra-EU unity would still be 100% watertight. The 27 member countries have competing priorities. Central and Eastern European countries that now fear for their own security have been nicknamed the ""sanctionistas"". They favour far tougher, swifter sanctions against Moscow. Penalties introduced so far by the West have failed miserably to force Russia's Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and secure a realistic ceasefire in Ukraine, they argue. Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz (left) has rejected Eastern European demands for tougher measures on Russia Germany leads the more cautious EU members. Sanctions against Russia should have minimal repercussions in the countries imposing them, its Chancellor Olaf Scholz said this week. He's ruled out an Eastern European demand for an immediate ban on Russian oil, for instance. The EU relies on Russia for a third of its crude oil supplies. Losing that would send Germany and the rest of the EU plummeting into a recession, says Chancellor Scholz. You probably remember Berlin trumpeting a new era at the start of Russia's onslaught in Ukraine. With promises to build up the German army and to end the country's decades-long dependence on Russian energy and close business ties. But many in Brussels are now questioning Germany's resolve. The more brutal the Kremlin's assault becomes in Ukraine, the tougher the choices facing western leaders as to how far they're willing to intervene. And the harder it will be for President Biden to maintain the united front he came to Europe to emphasise. A big test for EU and transatlantic unity comes next week when Brussels hosts the EU-China summit. Coached by the US President, his counter-part in the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, promises to make it ""absolutely clear"" to Beijing that it will face ""severe consequences"" if China helps Russia get round economic sanctions or sends military support. Will Germany drags it heels as to what form ""severe consequences"" might take? Berlin had pledged unwavering solidarity with Ukraine. That said, China is Germany's third most important trading partner.

"The UK's largest dairy has warned milk supplies could be under threat unless its farmers are paid more. The managing director of Arla Foods said costs are increasing at rates never seen before and that farmers can no longer cover their expenses. ""Because of the recent crisis, feed, fuel and fertiliser have rocketed and therefore cashflow on the farm is negative,"" said Ash Amirahmadi. He added farmers are producing less milk as a result of the higher costs. ""UK dairy farmers have been producing more for about the last seven to eight years but it's now going the other way,"" Mr Amirahmadi told the BBC. ""In February, they produced 2% less and in March it's 4%."" With cost increases of some 36%, he warned farmers are facing some hard decisions and that they need confidence to carry on producing. And that means securing a higher price from Arla's customers - the supermarkets. ""The most important thing now is that we put our arm around the farmersâ¦and pay our farmers more to cover their costs to make sure the milk is flowing, "" said Mr Amirahmadi. Arla Foods is the fifth biggest dairy company in the world and the largest supplier of fresh milk and cream in the UK. The co-operative has 2,100 dairy farmers in the UK and 8,950 across Europe. David Christensen is an Arla dairy farmer based in Oxfordshire David Christensen, an Arla dairy farmer based in Oxfordshire, said he had ""never experienced conditions like this in 30 years"" of working in the industry. His fertiliser bill has jumped from Â£350 to Â£900 a tonne and his fuel has more than doubled - cost increases he won't be able to absorb after the summer. ""There's no doubt, if the economics don't stack up one of the options is to scale back production...milk prices need to go up. It's no longer sustainable,"" he said. The boss of Arla said the price of milk in the shops is 7% lower now than it was 10 years ago. But the price consumers pay is different to the prices which farmers receive to produce it. For farmers the break even price is key. This includes any extra income and government subsidies. Over the years, the industry has kept costs down by becoming more efficient and many supermarkets have direct contracts with farmers based on their own cost of production models to try to give them a fairer deal. But industry sources have said even these so-called aligned contracts are failing to keep up with sky rocketing costs. Mr Amirahmadi's comments come as his business unveiled a five-year plan to grow and future proof the business at the same time it faces pressure from surges in inflation. Arla believes increasing global demand for dairy is an opportunity for farmers in the UK. The prices paid to farmers abroad are now 15% higher than the prices paid to farmers here. It's already trialling the export of fresh British milk for processing at its European sites which is then sold on international markets. The dairy giant is the first producer to consider doing this at scale. ""The good news here for farmers and actually the British dairy industry is that the opportunities of export give farmers more options and therefore it means that the whole of the UK dairy industry should get a lift as a result of those markets,"" Mr Amirahmadi said. As for the UK, he believes the dynamics need to change. He said for too many years the liquid milk market has been failing to deliver for farmers. ""Over the next five years we will have to make some tough decisions about where our milk goes to ensure farmers can cover their costs and continue to invest in reducing their on-farm emissions,"" he added. ""The profitability of some of our milk contracts will need to increase significantly when up for renewal in order to compete with more attractive business opportunities that are opening up.""

"Ukraine is ""not alone"" in its fight against Russia's invasion, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He said the UK would not stand by while Vladimir Putin ""vents his fury on Ukraine"" and would work to ramp up defensive weaponry for the country. Speaking in Brussels, he warned that, if the Russian president used chemical weapons, the consequences would be ""catastrophic for him"". Earlier, the UK announced sanctions on 65 more Russian groups and individuals. Mr Johnson later told BBC Newsnight that Russia did not want peace, and instead wanted to intensify its attack on Ukraine. Leaders from Nato, the EU and the G7 have been holding emergency meetings in Brussels to discuss the conflict. Speaking at a news conference following the Nato summit, Mr Johnson defended the level of the UK's support for Ukraine, saying the government planned to send 6,000 more missiles to the country as well as an extra Â£25m in aid to help Ukraine pay the salaries of its armed forces. The PM said kit would be provided to Ukraine to defend against ""its bullying neighbour"". Mr Johnson also promised a new deployment of UK troops to Bulgaria, on top of doubling troops both in Poland and in Estonia. It follows Nato's earlier announcement that new battle groups would be created in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. ""The message Putin can take is: Ukraine is not alone. We stand with the people of Kyiv, Mariupol, Lviv and Donetsk,"" Mr Johnson said. ""As President Zelensky himself has said, the people of Ukraine must prevail and Putin must fail - and he will."" Let's hit Putin's gold, says PM amid new sanctions Defiant troops to Russians: 'Go home while you're alive' Western leaders meet to discuss Ukraine support Mr Johnson added that Western nations were looking to ""steadily ratchet up"" the amount of military gear they are sending Ukraine, but that it was proving ""difficult"" to meet the country's request for warplanes and tanks. In a virtual appearance at the summit earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's asked Nato for ""1% of all your planes, 1% of all your tanks"". Mr Johnson said: ""What President Zelensky wants is to try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city. To that end he does need armour, as he sees it."" ""We are looking at what we can do to help. But logistically it looks very difficult both with armour and with jets."" Mr Johnson added that no Western power was looking to put ""boots on the ground"" or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian president wanted more from Nato, saying allies felt ""agony"" about their ""inability to do more given the constraints we face"". In a statement reported by Russia's Ria news agency, Russia's foreign ministry said Nato's decision to continue supporting Ukraine showed the military alliance wanted the conflict to continue. This video can not be played Watch: Zelensky calls on people to 'support freedom' one month after Russia invaded Ukraine The UK government has already given Â£400m in humanitarian and economic aid to Ukraine and its neighbouring nations since Russia's invasion last month. The PM said ministers had sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and entities so far in the toughest sanctions the UK had ever imposed. The Wagner Group, a private military firm thought to function as an arms-length unit of the Russian military, was among the 65 entities hit by the latest sanctions announced by the UK earlier. Also targeted were Gazprombank, the country's third-largest bank and one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas, and the state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot. The stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Polina Kovaleva, who is thought to own a London property worth an estimated Â£4m, was also targeted by the measures. Earlier, Mr Johnson called on the West to consider measures to prevent Russia using its gold reserves to prop up its currency, the rouble. He told the news conference the Kremlin was ""trying to get around the sanctions on their gold"" and the UK and others were trying to ensure there was ""no leakage or no sale of bullion into markets around the world"".

He said that, while one could be sympathetic to ordinary Russians, the way Mr Putin was leading Russia was ""utterly catastrophic"" and his invasion of Ukraine was ""inhuman and barbaric"". Mr Johnson dismissed talk about the use of nuclear weapons as a ""distraction"" from what was happening in Ukraine - where he said Russia's use of conventional weapons against ""innocent people"" had been ""absolutely barbaric"". He warned that any use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be ""disastrous for Putin"". ""There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that the consequences would be very, very severe. ""You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that. And I think that he understands that."" This video can not be played Watch what Boris Johnson says about the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight Mr Johnson said Ukraine can win the war with Russia - not necessarily on the battlefield, but by making an occupation impossible. ""There's a sense in which Putin has already failed, or lost, because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is - and, far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation, he's solidified it... He can't subjugate Ukraine."" The prime minister added that he was ""not optimistic"" the Russian president truly wanted peace, and that he had instead decided to ""double down"" in his assault on Ukraine which he said was a ""tragic mistake."" Mr Johnson sparked anger at the weekend afterappearing to make a comparison between Britons voting to leave the European Union and Ukrainiansfighting for the freedom from Russia. But when asked about this the prime minister said that had not been the analogy he was making and his words had been ""wildly misconstrued"". Elsewhere, US President Joe Biden warned any use of chemical weapons by Mr Putin would be met with a ""response in kind"", the nature of which ""would depend on the nature of the use"". Mr Biden said the Russian President had ""miscalculated"" in his decision to invade Ukraine, and had banked on ""Nato being split"". ""Nato has never, never been more united. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of (what) he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine.""

"The project will help put modern floods and droughts in their proper context Thousands of weather enthusiasts are celebrating the rescue of a unique trove of UK rainfall data. The volunteer army stepped up during the first Covid lockdown to transfer handwritten rain gauge totals on to computers. This digitisation effort has given the UK Met Office a much clearer idea of when our islands were sodden or parched going back almost 200 years. And that's extremely useful for understanding climate change. ""What our 16,000 volunteers did in the first weeks of lockdown will really help us recognise long-term trends,"" said the Rainfall Rescue project scientist and Reading University professor Ed Hawkins,who's now analysed the new dataset,external. ""But almost more important is what we learn about extremes. We want to know about the big floods, the big droughts - how likely they are, how frequently they might happen. This will allow us to put modern extremes in their proper context,"" he told BBC News. Help needed to rescue UK's old rainfall records Same time, same place, whatever the weather English lakes' hidden flood history The Rainfall Rescue project was launched in those first few days after the government issued its pandemic stay-at-home order in March 2020. People were asked to while away their time by helping to recover a series of pre-1960 weather records known as the ""10 Year Rainfall Sheets"". These were 65,000 scanned pieces of paper in theUK Met Office archives,externalthat contained the scribbled monthly and decadal rainfall totals at thousands of weather stations across the country. Dr Ross says the digitisation project was a herculean task Converting all the data into a modern electronic form, able to be analysed by computer, was expected to take a long time, especially since the ornate handwriting on many sheets demanded human eyes do the job rather than an automated character-recognition system. But the British public raced through the information in just 16 days. ""Across those 66,000 sheets, we had 5.4 million individual rainfall observations. They were keyed into the computer four times for quality control purposes. So that actually makes over 20 million individual observations being keyed,"" explained Met Office archivist Dr Catherine Ross. ""Add in other data, such as the names of the places where the rainfall was recorded and who the observers were - we're up to 100 million keystrokes."" The British public love nothing better than to talk about the weather A vast effort, but one that will now pay big dividends. Consider the task of planning for the consequences of too little or too much water. How do we satisfy our need for water resources, for domestic supply and industrial use, and also ensure we have the necessary infrastructure to protect our homes from flooding? The ""weather memory"" recovered from the decadal sheets will underpin future decision-making. Some nuggets of information to emerge from the project include: The UK now has a dense grid of rainfall readings stretching back to 1836. Previously, it was only to 1862 Before the project, just 19 rain gauges had informed the 1862 picture. Today, the number is more than 700 There is now a new driest year on record.

"The project will help put modern floods and droughts in their proper context Thousands of weather enthusiasts are celebrating the rescue of a unique trove of UK rainfall data. The volunteer army stepped up during the first Covid lockdown to transfer handwritten rain gauge totals on to computers. This digitisation effort has given the UK Met Office a much clearer idea of when our islands were sodden or parched going back almost 200 years. And that's extremely useful for understanding climate change. ""What our 16,000 volunteers did in the first weeks of lockdown will really help us recognise long-term trends,"" said the Rainfall Rescue project scientist and Reading University professor Ed Hawkins,who's now analysed the new dataset,external. ""But almost more important is what we learn about extremes. We want to know about the big floods, the big droughts - how likely they are, how frequently they might happen. This will allow us to put modern extremes in their proper context,"" he told BBC News. Help needed to rescue UK's old rainfall records Same time, same place, whatever the weather English lakes' hidden flood history The Rainfall Rescue project was launched in those first few days after the government issued its pandemic stay-at-home order in March 2020. People were asked to while away their time by helping to recover a series of pre-1960 weather records known as the ""10 Year Rainfall Sheets"". These were 65,000 scanned pieces of paper in theUK Met Office archives,externalthat contained the scribbled monthly and decadal rainfall totals at thousands of weather stations across the country. Dr Ross says the digitisation project was a herculean task Converting all the data into a modern electronic form, able to be analysed by computer, was expected to take a long time, especially since the ornate handwriting on many sheets demanded human eyes do the job rather than an automated character-recognition system. But the British public raced through the information in just 16 days. ""Across those 66,000 sheets, we had 5.4 million individual rainfall observations. They were keyed into the computer four times for quality control purposes. So that actually makes over 20 million individual observations being keyed,"" explained Met Office archivist Dr Catherine Ross. ""Add in other data, such as the names of the places where the rainfall was recorded and who the observers were - we're up to 100 million keystrokes."" The British public love nothing better than to talk about the weather A vast effort, but one that will now pay big dividends. Consider the task of planning for the consequences of too little or too much water. How do we satisfy our need for water resources, for domestic supply and industrial use, and also ensure we have the necessary infrastructure to protect our homes from flooding? The ""weather memory"" recovered from the decadal sheets will underpin future decision-making. Some nuggets of information to emerge from the project include: The UK now has a dense grid of rainfall readings stretching back to 1836. Previously, it was only to 1862 Before the project, just 19 rain gauges had informed the 1862 picture. Today, the number is more than 700 There is now a new driest year on record. This is 1855, with just 786.5mm of rain. It takes over from 1887 There is now higher confidence that the wettest month on record was October 1903, with 220mm of rainfall The driest month for the UK is February 1932 with 9.5mm.

"The number of electric vehicle charging points will reach 300,000 by 2030 under government plans but motoring groups say the roll out is not fast enough. Under the plans, operators will have to ensure drivers can compare prices and pay by contactless card. But the RAC said the chargepoint target ""might sound impressive"", but it is concerned the number is ""not going to be sufficient"" for growing demand. The UK currently has 30,000 public electric vehicle charging points. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the number of chargepoints by the end of the decade would be the equivalent to almost five times the number of fuel pumps on UK roads today. It said the Â£500m scheme would include Â£450m to boost public charging stations and on-street charging for people without driveways. According to Melanie Shufflebotham, chief operations officer of Zap-Map, an EV charging app, 80% of electric vehicle owners have off-street parking. She went on to say that currently London is the area most ""well-served"" with on-street overnight charging, due to how built up it is, but that other areas of the country have better access to rapid or ultra-rapid charging. About a third of all chargers are currently in London. The funds were previously announced as part of the government's Â£1.6bn Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy, but the government has now given details about how the money will be spent. New standards and legislation will mean operators will have to provide real-time data for customers to check the status of chargepoints and apps for customers to find the nearest available one. They will also be required to have a 99% reliability rate at rapid chargepoints. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We're powering ahead with plans to help British people go electric, with our expanding charging network making journeys easier right across the country."" What does net zero mean? Are we ready for EVs? Simple guide to climate change Car industry calls for electric charge watchdog However, Sir John Armitt, chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, which advises the government on major infrastructure, said in a report there was a gap emerging between the government's aspirations on net zero policy and actions taken to reach it. ""We need to turbo-charge the roll out of electric vehicle charging points, accelerating the installation of both rapid and on-street charging facilities so that the 2030 date for the end of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars remains viable, he said. RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said it was ""pleasing"" to see the government set ""ambitious reliability targets on the chargepoints themselves"" as many current and would-be electric car drivers ""worry that charging units will be out of order when they arrive"". He also warned that the installation timescale of 300,000 chargepoints needed be quicker with drivers looking to switch to electric ""en masse"" ahead of the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. The AA said action was needed on the lack of charging points in rural areas. Edmund King, AA president, said: ""As we advance quickly to the 2030 deadline for new zero-emission vehicles, it is vital that we get our charging infrastructure in order. While great progress has been made, there is still much to do to convince drivers on the number, and importantly reliability, of charge posts. ""To bring confidence and power to potential electric car drivers we need more, and more reliable and accessible charge points as soon as possible."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the increased number of electric vehicles will eventually lead to road pricing or tolls in place of fuel duty. Mr Shapps also acknowledged that electric cars are ""still a little bit more expensive"" to buy than petrol or diesel vehicles. However, he said that people should invest in electric cars as a way of easing cost of living pressures, by saving on fuel. Alongside the expansion of the UK's charging network, the government also has plans for at least 6,000 chargepoints across English motorways by 2035 though an existing Â£950m Rapid Charging fund. Over the decade between 2011 and 2021 the total number of charge points in the UK jumped from about 1,500 to more than 48,000 both public and private, according to industry figures. The Society of Motoring Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said electrified vehicles made up more than one in every four cars produced in the UK last month, at nearly 16,000 units. Overall, UK vehicle production slumped in February, from 105,000 units in 2021 to 61,000 units for the same month this year, due to continued global shortages in computer chips used in car production.

"Passengers board the train in Lviv during the first days of the war in Ukraine Ten million people have fled their homes in Ukraine because of the Russian invasion. Most head west to the relative safety of cities like Lviv - and many continue onwards to neighbouring countries. Our correspondent Fergal Keane met some of those who took the 91/92 train between Kyiv and Lviv - the ""Rescue Express"" The air raid alarm in the station tower has just started: no bombs are falling, but nerves are fraying. The guard tells us to shelter with the refugees in the tunnel under the platform. There are several thousand people here, in a long queue. We wait among the anxious and exhausted, the families calming scared children, the elderly woman wrapped in a blanket and pulling a suitcase. She looks as if she cannot possibly walk another step. But she will trudge forward when the all-clear is given. This is not a place of options. Go forward, or run the risk of the war catching up with you. Then a horn blares. A searchlight appears down the track to the east, a looming brilliance that grows larger as it approaches. Another horn sounds, followed by a conductor's whistle cutting through the clamour of the air raid sirens. A murmur ripples through the crowd. The all-clear is declared, and they can board a train to Poland. After nearly a month reporting on refugees, I have taken to calling this extraordinary evacuation the ""Rescue Express"". Millions of Ukrainians have taken trains from as far south as Odessa on the Black Sea, from Kharkiv close to the Russian border in the north-east, from the Donbas and from Kyiv, and numerous smaller stations in between. It has come at great human cost: 33 railway staff have been killed. Tracks and stations have been bombed. The head conductor on Train 91/92 between Lviv and Kyiv is Ievgen Propokenko, a 40-year veteran of the railways. He comes from Kharkiv, which is now under Russian siege, and where his daughter and son-in-law also work to keep the Rescue Express going. The railways, he explains, run in the family. Ievgen Propokenko, head conductor on board the ""Rescue Express"" knows that his train could come under fire ""It is terrifying. My native city is being bombed,"" says Ievgen. ""I can feel it and see it, but I cannot believe it."" He knows that his own train runs the risk of being attacked. One of the conductor's duties is to check that train windows are covered, so its lights don't present an obvious target for Russian aircraft. ""We can see the war in the faces of the people who come onboard. It is our job. It is what we have to do."" Also onboard is his younger colleague, Oleksandr Shevchenko, 31, the spokesman for the railways who is heading to an awards ceremony. The Prime Minister will be handing out awards to railway staff at the station in Kyiv. This service is heading east back towards the conflict, and has only a few passengers. Sitting in a compartment before departure I met Petro Rocharan, a 25-year-old investment banker, who has volunteered to join a battalion defending the capital. Petro is a scout. He has had just three weeks' military training and he is frank about his feelings. ""I am rather scared honestly. I know Kyiv has been through a lot so far. Including the streets where I am going, where some of my friends are living, and I am just not sure if I am ready to see those buildings destroyed,"" he explains. Petro speaks of different waves of feeling: from fear to excitement and back to fear again. The lights of the train could make it a target in these dangerous times The train pulls into Kyiv just after dawn, and Petro heads off in search of his battalion. New shifts of drivers, conductors and stewards start to arrive at the station. So do the buses carrying families from the embattled cities of Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kramatorsk and the suburbs of Kyiv itself. Oleg Kryvospytska, 59, comes from Troyeschchyna in the northern suburbs of Kyiv and has brought his wife, Olena, his 29-year-old daughter Olga, and his granddaughters, aged six and 12. But Oleg will not be travelling with them. He must stay behind and care for an elderly relative who is unable to travel. Olena says that they will take the train to Lviv and stay for a few days before deciding where to go in Europe. ""I have no words for this,"" she says. ""This is something terrifying that I can't believe is happening. I'm currently taking sedatives every day to keep me calm, but even that isn't helping."" Oleg is a tall, strongly-built man and his wife Olena leans into him as the time approaches to board the train. They embrace, and sway gently from side to side. It is a portrait of fortitude and loss, rooted in the 30 years of their life together. Oleg does not speak or cry. For the children's sake, he smiles. Oleg says goodbye to his family, but is careful not to shed any tears Even as he walks alongside the departing train and can see Olena weeping, he keeps smiling and waving. The little girls shout: ""We love you, we love you."" His daughter Olga calls out: ""Wait for us."" He will. Of course. However long it takes. The train picks up speed. The horn blares and the carriages roll west, through the suburbs, away from the front line and out into the great immensity of Europe's second-largest country. It passes wheat fields ready for spring planting, through small and large towns, further and further from the war zone. It is after 22:00 when the Rescue Express pulls into Lviv. Olga and Olena and the children are in the first carriage and it is dark on the platform. A conductor appears with a flash lamp and lights their way. The weary travellers gather their bags and walk towards the lights of the station. In a day or two they will board another train, to Poland, peace and exile.

"After Viktoriia Roshchyna was released from detention, a hostage-style video began to circulate on pro-Russian Telegram channels Ukrainians are being arbitrarily detained and subjected to enforced disappearances in Russian-controlled areas, the UN has told the BBC. At least 36 cases of civilian detentions were verified by the UN, with families often denied any information about the fate of those being held. Ukrainians say they fear an escalating campaign of kidnappings and intimidation, as Russia struggles to assert control over towns it captures. Viktoriia Roshchyna, a journalist, was working in occupied areas in the east of the country when she was taken by unidentified men on 15 March. Her employer, Hromadske media, said she ""was probably detained by the FSB"", Russia's internal intelligence service, based on witness accounts of her being taken in the city of Berdyansk. She was released six days later when a hostage-style video - apparently recorded under duress - began to circulate on pro-Russian Telegram outlets. In it Ms Roshchyna said Russia had not taken her captive and thanked Moscow's forces for ""saving her life"". Svetlana Zalizetskaya, a journalist in the occupied city of Melitopol, accused Russian forces of taking her 75-year old father hostage as punishment for her refusal to co-operate with the new administration.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Ms Zalizetskaya, the director of local news agency RIA Melitopol, wrote on Facebook that her father had been detained after her meeting with the Russian-installed leader of the city, where she refused to end her criticism of the invasion. She said that she received a phone call from his captors, in which her father informed her that he was being held ""in some basement"" and said that he ""didn't know what they wanted from him"". His captors demanded that Ms Zalizetskaya, who has pledged to ""tell the world of atrocities"" committed by Moscow's forces in Melitopol, surrender herself. Ukraine's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said four journalists had also been detained and were later released in Melitopol. The head of the Ukrainian NUJ, Sergiy Tomilenko, said the detentions were part of ""a wave of information cleansing"" which is aimed towards the ""intimidation of journalists and public figures"". Mykhailo Kumko, a retired local newspaper publisher, is one of the journalists detained in Melitopol A spokesperson for the UN's Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UNOHR), whose monitoring mission in Ukraine has been documenting the abductions, told the BBC that those being targeted ""are mostly representatives of local communities, journalists and people who were vocal about their pro-Ukrainian positions"". But they said they were not able to assess whether those being detained form part of ""targeted lists reportedly drawn up by Russian security officials"". In February, US officials sent a letter to the UN warning that Russia had drawn up a ""kill list"" of Ukrainians to be attacked or detained following the invasion of the country. Some sources have suggested that a hack of a Ukrainian digital services app in January may have helped Russia identify targets, while the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has speculated that a hack of the Ukrainian national car insurance registry may have allowed security services to identify the locations of targets. A number of officials in occupied parts of Ukraine have been detained by Russian forces in recent weeks. In the southern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was abducted from a city crisis centre by Russian troops earlier this month. Discussing his detention with local media, Mr Fedorov alleged that other detainees at the holding centre he was taken to were being tortured. ""They didn't touch me physically but trust me, seven armed men were enough to make their position clear,"" Mr Fedorov said. ""In the next cell someone was being tortured - there were screams which generated plenty of psychological pressure."" ""They try to accuse them of sabotage and squeeze their fingers in the door to make them say which army they're from, but they're just local residents."" Ivan Fedorov met with President Volodymyr Zelensky after his release Alleged abductions have occurred in several other cities, including Nova Kakhovka in the north, where the secretary of the city council has disappeared, and in Bucha, where the local council told the BBC that six employees were detained and later released after a Russian raid. Ukrainian MP Alyona Shkrum said she believed the detentions were likely to increase as Russia faces a lack of co-operation and increased resistance in occupied regions. ""I'm sure Putin thought it will be just as it was in Crimea, they come they take over the administrative buildings and the mayor will say 'lets co-operate, I will be your mayor now, what difference does it make',"" she told the BBC. ""It didn't happen at all here... nobody, even from sort of pro-Russian parties agreed to do what Russian soldiers wanted them to do"". Russian forces have faced opposition in occupied cities like Kherson Ms Shkrum, a pro-Western MP, told the BBC that she was warned by the Ukrainian security services that she was likely on a Russian hit-list and was warned to avoid her apartment in Kyiv. ""Pretty much there are two lists,"" she said. ""A list of people to be killed as members of parliament, they are mostly people who [Russia] feel they cannot co-operate with. And a list of people to be taken hostage and taken to Moscow and forced to vote on something."" ""I also have sanctions against me in Russia, so I presume I am on the list to be killed or captured,"" Ms Shkrum added. The abductions have not been limited to public figures, with some civilians and ex-members of the armed forces also detained. Mattia Nelles, a Ukrainian political analyst, told the BBC that his uncle, a former medic with the Ukrainian army who fought in the Donbas from 2016-2018, had been targeted by Russian soldiers in the eastern city of Svatove. ""Security forces of the Russian Federation have come to his house and searched for him,"" Mr Nelles said. ""Luckily he was not at his house but neighbours confirmed that he is wanted."" Mr Nelles said it was unclear which element of Russia's forces are behind the wave of detentions, but in his uncle's case he said the troops were ""a mix of army personnel and some other security forces. We can only speculate whether it's FSB, they didn't wear insignia"". He fears that the campaign of arrests will escalate in the coming days. He observed that in southern areas, such as Kherson, so far the ""amount of arrests seem relatively low"" and some of the lists appear to be ""drawn up on the go"" as Russian forces identify those resisting occupation. ""Locals fear we are seeing the beginning of a more sustained campaign,"" he warned.

"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

"After Viktoriia Roshchyna was released from detention, a hostage-style video began to circulate on pro-Russian Telegram channels Ukrainians are being arbitrarily detained and subjected to enforced disappearances in Russian-controlled areas, the UN has told the BBC. At least 36 cases of civilian detentions were verified by the UN, with families often denied any information about the fate of those being held. Ukrainians say they fear an escalating campaign of kidnappings and intimidation, as Russia struggles to assert control over towns it captures. Viktoriia Roshchyna, a journalist, was working in occupied areas in the east of the country when she was taken by unidentified men on 15 March. Her employer, Hromadske media, said she ""was probably detained by the FSB"", Russia's internal intelligence service, based on witness accounts of her being taken in the city of Berdyansk. She was released six days later when a hostage-style video - apparently recorded under duress - began to circulate on pro-Russian Telegram outlets. In it Ms Roshchyna said Russia had not taken her captive and thanked Moscow's forces for ""saving her life"". Svetlana Zalizetskaya, a journalist in the occupied city of Melitopol, accused Russian forces of taking her 75-year old father hostage as punishment for her refusal to co-operate with the new administration.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Ms Zalizetskaya, the director of local news agency RIA Melitopol, wrote on Facebook that her father had been detained after her meeting with the Russian-installed leader of the city, where she refused to end her criticism of the invasion. She said that she received a phone call from his captors, in which her father informed her that he was being held ""in some basement"" and said that he ""didn't know what they wanted from him"". His captors demanded that Ms Zalizetskaya, who has pledged to ""tell the world of atrocities"" committed by Moscow's forces in Melitopol, surrender herself. Ukraine's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said four journalists had also been detained and were later released in Melitopol. The head of the Ukrainian NUJ, Sergiy Tomilenko, said the detentions were part of ""a wave of information cleansing"" which is aimed towards the ""intimidation of journalists and public figures"". Mykhailo Kumko, a retired local newspaper publisher, is one of the journalists detained in Melitopol A spokesperson for the UN's Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (UNOHR), whose monitoring mission in Ukraine has been documenting the abductions, told the BBC that those being targeted ""are mostly representatives of local communities, journalists and people who were vocal about their pro-Ukrainian positions"". But they said they were not able to assess whether those being detained form part of ""targeted lists reportedly drawn up by Russian security officials"". In February, US officials sent a letter to the UN warning that Russia had drawn up a ""kill list"" of Ukrainians to be attacked or detained following the invasion of the country. Some sources have suggested that a hack of a Ukrainian digital services app in January may have helped Russia identify targets, while the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has speculated that a hack of the Ukrainian national car insurance registry may have allowed security services to identify the locations of targets. A number of officials in occupied parts of Ukraine have been detained by Russian forces in recent weeks. In the southern city of Melitopol, Mayor Ivan Fedorov was abducted from a city crisis centre by Russian troops earlier this month. Discussing his detention with local media, Mr Fedorov alleged that other detainees at the holding centre he was taken to were being tortured. ""They didn't touch me physically but trust me, seven armed men were enough to make their position clear,"" Mr Fedorov said. ""In the next cell someone was being tortured - there were screams which generated plenty of psychological pressure."" ""They try to accuse them of sabotage and squeeze their fingers in the door to make them say which army they're from, but they're just local residents."" Ivan Fedorov met with President Volodymyr Zelensky after his release Alleged abductions have occurred in several other cities, including Nova Kakhovka in the north, where the secretary of the city council has disappeared, and in Bucha, where the local council told the BBC that six employees were detained and later released after a Russian raid. Ukrainian MP Alyona Shkrum said she believed the detentions were likely to increase as Russia faces a lack of co-operation and increased resistance in occupied regions. ""I'm sure Putin thought it will be just as it was in Crimea, they come they take over the administrative buildings and the mayor will say 'lets co-operate, I will be your mayor now, what difference does it make',"" she told the BBC. ""It didn't happen at all here... nobody, even from sort of pro-Russian parties agreed to do what Russian soldiers wanted them to do"". Russian forces have faced opposition in occupied cities like Kherson Ms Shkrum, a pro-Western MP, told the BBC that she was warned by the Ukrainian security services that she was likely on a Russian hit-list and was warned to avoid her apartment in Kyiv. ""Pretty much there are two lists,"" she said. ""A list of people to be killed as members of parliament, they are mostly people who [Russia] feel they cannot co-operate with. And a list of people to be taken hostage and taken to Moscow and forced to vote on something."" ""I also have sanctions against me in Russia, so I presume I am on the list to be killed or captured,"" Ms Shkrum added. The abductions have not been limited to public figures, with some civilians and ex-members of the armed forces also detained. Mattia Nelles, a Ukrainian political analyst, told the BBC that his uncle, a former medic with the Ukrainian army who fought in the Donbas from 2016-2018, had been targeted by Russian soldiers in the eastern city of Svatove. ""Security forces of the Russian Federation have come to his house and searched for him,"" Mr Nelles said. ""Luckily he was not at his house but neighbours confirmed that he is wanted."" Mr Nelles said it was unclear which element of Russia's forces are behind the wave of detentions, but in his uncle's case he said the troops were ""a mix of army personnel and some other security forces. We can only speculate whether it's FSB, they didn't wear insignia"". He fears that the campaign of arrests will escalate in the coming days. He observed that in southern areas, such as Kherson, so far the ""amount of arrests seem relatively low"" and some of the lists appear to be ""drawn up on the go"" as Russian forces identify those resisting occupation. ""Locals fear we are seeing the beginning of a more sustained campaign,"" he warned.

"The Solomon Islands has seen rioting and political unrest in recent months Solomon Islands has confirmed it is drafting a security deal with China - a move that's triggered alarm in neighbouring Australia and other Western allies in the Indo-Pacific. Leaked papers indicate a Chinese military base could potentially be set up on the island to Australia's north. That's sparked concern from Australia, long the chief defence partner and biggest aid donor to the tiny island. Both Australia and New Zealand said it had raised concerns with Honiara. Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she respected the Pacific island's right to make sovereign decisions but: ""We would be particularly concerned by any actions that undermine the stability and security of our region, including the establishment of a permanent presence such as a military base."" New Zealand said it was also concerned as the plan threatened to ""destabilise the current institutions and arrangements that have long underpinned the Pacific region's security."" Australia's Solomons deal shuts out Huawei Australia ups Pacific role to counter China US to reopen Solomon Islands embassy The Solomon Islands did not confirm the details of the leaked draft agreement, or if it was the finalised version. But on Friday it said it was ""expanding"" security arrangements with more countries and ""diversifying the country's security partnership including with China"". The details of the leaked plans have particularly concerned Australia, which is just 2000km (1,400 miles) south of the Solomon Islands. The papers set out a framework which could allow Beijing to deploy forces to ""protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands"". The tiny Pacific nation could also ""request China to send police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces"", according to the document. There is also provision for China to ""make ship visits, to carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands"". Security analysts say the plans reveal China's clear intention in the region for the first time. ""It shows in black and white what China is asking for and in some ways has done Australia a favour,"" said Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific Islands analyst at Australia's Lowy Institute thinktank. ""We are at the start of a long process before we would see any sort of boots on the ground or form of military presence in the Solomon Islands... but it is worrying to see just what China's intent is,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. On Friday, Honiara emphasised that any strategic partnership with China would include a ""development dimension"". It was working to ""sign off and implement"" several deals with China including trade expansion and a civil aviation services agreement. But it added it also welcomed police training and equipment offered by its ""two major partners China and Australia."" Australia has been increasingly concerned about China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, and has tried ramping up aid spending to curtail that in recent years. In 2018, it launched the 'Pacific Step Up' policy to re-engage with its ""Pacific family."" It also set up a multi-billion dollar infrastructure fund widely seen as a counter to China's loans and spending in the region. Despite this, Honiara has drawn closer to China, establishing formal diplomatic ties in 2019 and ditching its links with Taiwan. On Friday, former Australian PM Kevin Rudd called the plan ""one of the most significant security developments we have seen in decades"" and a defence failure by the current Australian government in its ""own territorial waters"". Following riots on the Solomon Islands last year year,Australia sent troops to the islandand re-established a previous long-term policing mission. China also offered training for the island's police. In February, the US said it also planned to re-open its embassy in the Solomon Islands amid concerns about China's plans in the region. The US, UK and Australia all signed a landmark defence treaty last year, nicknamed Aukus, to strengthen Western allies' presence in the Indo-Pacific.

"The government is considering plans to lower people's energy bills based on how close they are to onshore wind turbines, the BBC has been told. It's an idea the energy company Octopus offers some customers in Yorkshire and Caerphilly. But the government is considering expanding this across the country. There are currently strict planning rules about where onshore wind farms can be built in England, which inhibit the development of wind farms. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is in favour of loosening regulations to make it easier to approve plans for more onshore wind. Cabinet split over onshore wind expansion plan The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis It's expected the government will outline its energy supply strategy next week - which will include plans for accelerating renewable energy in the UK. One plan under consideration is reviewing planning laws in England, that were tightened in 2015, to make it easier to approve more onshore wind farms. The business secretary supports the idea, and Downing Street sources have said the government has ""got to be open"" to more onshore wind. It is understood Michael Gove - who is in charge of planning in England - is also supportive. But the BBC has been told othercabinet ministers strongly oppose the plans, and onshore wind farms have been controversial with Conservative activists in the past. A government source said that - if the idea is approved - ""as with any development, local consent is absolutely critical. We would always want to bring the public with us."" Electricity and gas bills for a typical household will go up by Â£693 a year in April, a 54% increase. In October, customers in England, Scotland and Wales will receive a Â£200 rebate on their energy bills. They will have to repay this at Â£40 a year for five years, starting in April 2023. But the OBR on Wednesday forecast that energy bills will rise by 40% again in October, if wholesale gas prices remain at the same level they are now. In his Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said that VAT would be cut from 5% to 0% on energy efficiency products such as solar panels, insulation and heat pumps. What help with bills is there? The BBC understands one option under consideration is introducing a scheme to make energy bills cheaper depending on how close people live to an onshore wind farm. It's understood this would apply to new developments. Currently, a similar scheme is run by the energy company Octopus. Their customers get 20% off electricity bills when their local turbine is spinning, and 50% off when it's picking up speed. There are two local wind turbines using this model so far - one in Market Weighton in Yorkshire and one in Caerphilly in Wales. Can the energy crisis help the climate? Ukraine war 'puts Wylfa nuclear back on agenda' The BBC has been told that the government is ""very interested"" in this model and are considering expanding it across the country to provide an incentive for onshore wind farms to be approved in people's local areas. A government source said: ""Ministers would want to ensure communities are able to directly benefit from hosting renewable energy infrastructure. There are a range of different options under discussion."" The energy strategy expected next week is likely to focus on plans to accelerate the rollout of more renewable and nuclear energy in the UK - as well as the government's ambitions to loosen regulations around extracting North Sea oil and gas while the government moves away from Russian gas and transitions towards more renewable energy. Labour MP Darren Jones, who is chair of the Commons select committee which focuses on business and energy, called on the government for more action on energy. ""For colleagues in Parliament who have concerns about onshore wind turbines, which is a much better option than fracking, maybe they can demand that government brings forward the delayed updates to the energy efficiency voucher scheme to help families insulate their homes and reduce energy demand in the first place.""

"Rishi Sunak married Akshata Murty in 2009 and they have two children Rishi Sunak has denied any connection with a multinational firm part-owned by his wife that has continued to operate in Russia during the war in Ukraine. The chancellor said he had ""nothing to do"" with Infosys, in which his wife Akshata Murty holds shares. He has urged UK firms to pull out of Russia to inflict ""economic pain"" on President Vladimir Putin. Mr Sunak's spokesperson said Ms Murty had no role in Infosys's operational decisions. The software giant was co-founded by Ms Murty's father Narayana, an Indian billionaire who retired from the company in 2014. Founded in 1981, the firm has since expanded into a number of countries and operates an office in Moscow. Itsmost recent annual report,externallists Ms Murty as holding 0.9% of the company's shares - reportedly worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Let's hit Putin's gold, says PM amid new sanctions Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia Profile: Rishi Sunak India has not followed Western countries, including the UK, in restricting trade with Russia via sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Mr Sunak said the government would ""fully support"" UK firms that pull out of Russia voluntarily. After meeting a group of leading British companies, the chancellor said he welcomed the ""consensus on the need to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his regime"". ""While I recognise that it may be challenging to wind down existing investments, I believe there is no argument for new investment in the Russian economy,"" he added. ""I am urging asset owners and managers to think very carefully about any investments that would in any sense support Putin and his regime."" Pressed on Infosys's presence in Russia on Thursday, Mr Sunak told Sky News: ""I'm an elected politician, and I'm here to talk to you about what I'm responsible for. My wife is not."" He added that companies' operations were ""up to them"". ""We've put in place significant sanctions and all the companies we're responsible for are following those, as they rightly should,"" said the chancellor. Narayana Murthy co-founded Infosys, often seen as the poster child of India's technology boom. A spokesperson for the chancellor said Ms Murty was ""one of thousands of minority shareholders in the company"". ""It is a public company and neither her nor any member of her family have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company,"" they added. Infosys said it had a ""small team of employees based out of Russia"" that ""services some of our global clients, locally"". ""We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,"" it added. ""Infosys supports and advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine"". Infosys hashad connections in the past to Alfa Bank,external, one of Russia's biggest financial institutions, which was added to the UK's sanctions list on Thursday, having already been sanctioned by the US and EU. In 2004, Mr Putin visited Infosys' headquarters in Bangalore, where he was given a guided tour by Narayana Murthy. Mr Sunak met his future spouse while studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. They married in 2009 and have two children.
