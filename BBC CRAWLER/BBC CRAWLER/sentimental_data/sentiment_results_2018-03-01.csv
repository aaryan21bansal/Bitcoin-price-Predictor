"This video can not be played Donald Tusk joked that his journey was 'not frictionless' Donald Tusk has said Theresa May needs to come up with ""a better idea"" than the EU's controversial plan to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. The PM has rejected keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's customs area saying this would split the UK in two. But the European Council president said one of the ""possible negative consequences"" of the kind of Brexit Mrs May wants would be a hard border. The two met in No 10 ahead of a big Brexit speech on Friday by Mrs May. Mrs May, who chaired a meeting of the cabinet before her talks with Mr Tusk, has already pledged not to accept the draft withdrawal treaty published on Wednesday by the EU. Katya Adler: Real crisis or par for course? Brexit: 'No deal' would hurt UK car industry Toyota to build new Auris in UK She reiterated this position to Mr Tusk during what Downing Street said was a ""positive and constructive meeting"". The prime minister wants to resolve the Northern Ireland question ""through the overall relationship between the UK and the EU"", Downing Street said. An EU source said the main focus had been the nature of the UK and EU's future relationship and that all the EU's remaining members supported its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The UK and the EU agree on wanting to avoid a return to a physical border - with border posts and checks - in Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested new IT systems could be introduced to avoid the need for physical border checks but has yet to spell out how this would work in practice. But the draft EU treaty also includes the option of a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Both the EU and the Irish government say it is up to the UK to come up with concrete alternatives to what they describe as a ""backstop"" option. This video can not be played Tony Blair tells Today people are ""sacrificing peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit"" Mrs May says the EU proposal would ""threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK"" by creating a border down the Irish Sea. In a speech in Brussels before travelling to London Mr Tusk said he was ""absolutely sure that all the essential elements of the draft"" would be accepted by the 27 remaining EU members. And he said Mrs May's decision to rule out membership of the single market and customs union had been acknowledged ""without enthusiasm and without satisfaction"". The PM has said she wants a deal which will allow trade to be ""as frictionless as possible"". But Mr Tusk warned: ""There can be no frictionless trade outside of the customs union and the single market. Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit by nature."" Mr Barnier has also been addressing the issue in a speech at the business conference in Brussels. As a result of the UK's stated negotiation red lines, he said, the only option remaining was a free trade agreement in the vein of the deals the EU already has with other third countries. He dismissed hopes of a ""mutual recognition"" arrangement on trade standards, saying this was impossible because of the UK's refusal to accept European Court of Justice oversight. And in a message to other EU leaders, he said the ""economic benefits of staying together"" were ""far bigger"" than any negative knock-on impact from Brexit. Mr Barnier also said Northern Ireland was a ""sensitive"" issue and that the problem was down to the UK's decision to leave the single market and customs union. The EU will look at UK proposals ""in a very constructive way"", he said, adding: ""Any vision of the future must take into account the fact that the EU cannot and will not compromise on its founding principles."" Irish senator Neale Richmond, European affairs spokesman for the Fine Gael party that leads the government, said Britain has provided ""zero detail"" on its proposed alternatives to keeping Northern Ireland in a customs area with the EU to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. This video can not be played May: I'll make opposition to plans 'crystal clear' to EU Veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash told the BBC's Newsnight there were ""technical ways"" of managing the Irish border and accused the EU of trying to create a ""constitutional crisis"" for the UK. Cabinet ministers have suggested Friday's speech by Mrs May will give the EU the clarity that it has been seeking about what kind of trade relationship the UK wants after its departure on 29 March 2019. In an apparent concession to the EU ahead of the speech, the government said EU nationals coming to the UK during a transition period after Brexit, expected to last two years, would be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major Kuenssberg: A Brexit warning from one PM to another UK's transition offer to EU nationals' Mrs May has said her long-term goal is a ""bespoke economic partnership"", underpinned by a comprehensive free trade agreement guaranteeing tariff-free access to EU markets for British goods and services.

Earlier former prime minister Tony Blair urged the EU to put forward new ideas to address ""genuine underlying grievances beneath the Brexit vote, especially around immigration"" - saying this could lead voters to change their minds on leaving. In a new report, the Commons Business Committee warned failure to reach any kind of deal would be damaging for the car industry and only close alignment with the EU would ensure its survival. But on Tuesday the industry received a vote of confidencewhen Toyota saidit would build the next generation of its Auris hatchback at its Burnaston plant in Derbyshire, safeguarding more than 3,000 jobs.

"This video can not be played Theresa May's full Brexit speech where she said: ""We chose to leave, we have a responsibility to help find a solution"" Theresa May has warned that ""no-one will get everything they want"" out of Brexit negotiations but she is confident a deal can be done. Setting out UK hopes for a future EU economic partnership, Mrs May warned both sides had to accept ""hard facts"". Single market access would be ""less than it is now"" and the UK would have to pay into some EU agencies. But she would not threaten to walk out of talks and in a message to the EU said: ""Let's get on with it."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but it wants a transition period lasting around two years after to smooth the way for business. Reality Check: What were the key lines in the speech? Laura Kuenssberg analysis: Were the facts hard enough? In full: May's big Brexit speech Analysis: May gets down to business on Brexit UK's transition offer to EU nationals Mrs May said she was confidentremaining differences over a draft EU legal agreementcould be resolved, allowing trade talks to get under way. She said life would be different for the UK outside the EU's single market: ""In certain ways, our access to each other's markets will be less than it is now."" The UK could not expect to ""enjoy all the benefits without all of the obligations"" of membership. Another ""hard fact"" would be that the UK would still continue to be affected by EU law and some decisions of the European Court of Justice - such as the ECJ rules on whether EU agreements are legal - but she stressed that the ""jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end"". The UK may choose to remain ""in step"" with EU regulations in areas like state aid and competition, in order to get ""good access"" to markets, she said. The hard fact for the EU was that the UK would want its own bespoke trade deal, not an ""off-the-shelf model"". BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said ""the real test will be whether this speech was enough to convince critics that Mrs May's ambition for Brexit is credible and achievable without alienating her own MPs"". The speech contained a lot of detail on the kind of trading relationship Mrs May wants with the EU after Brexit. Banks located in the City of London will lose the right to trade across EU without country-by-country approval, so-called passporting. A new system will be brought in to allow ""the same regulatory outcomes over time"" Associate membership of EU medicines, chemical and aviation agencies, accepting their rules and making ""appropriate"" financial contributions Parliament would reserve the right to pass its own regulations in these areas but in the knowledge it could threaten co-operation with those bodies Continued participation in EU science, education and cultural programmes, close relationship with Euratom UK to explore continued participation in EU's internal energy market while protecting single energy market on the island of Ireland Independent arbitration mechanism for trade disputes to replace role currently played the European Court of Justice Fairer deal for UK fishermen based on reciprocal access to waters and shared stocks management Mutual recognition of broadcasting rules to allow UK channels to continue to be seen in Europe Ensure continuity of rail, maritime and aviation services and of hauliers' access to European markets Keeping UK regulatory standards ""as high as the EU's"" to ensure smooth trade and while UK law may not be ""identical"" to EU law ""it should achieve the same outcomes"" This video can not be played Corbyn: Speech offered ""no clarity and no real sense of priorities"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After 20 wasted months, Theresa May has once again failed to bring real clarity to the negotiations - and worryingly, she admitted that her approach will reduce our access to European markets. ""She read out a long list of problems but failed to provide solutions, particularly on the urgent question of preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland."" Attacking Mrs May's suggestion the UK could stick closely to EU state aid rules, he added:  ""Theresa May's only clear priority today seemed to be to tie the UK permanently to EU rules which are used to drive privatisation and block support for British industry."" By BBC Brussels Correspondent Adam Fleming A European civil servant said to me recently that Brexit was a fascinating intellectual exercise in rebuilding the existing elements of the UK/EU relationship but with Britain out of the club. Is that the same thing the prime minister proposed today, with the UK retaining associate membership of many of the EU's agencies, choosing to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice where needed, trading freely and maintaining broadly similar economic and social models? One geeky-sounding proposal in particular demonstrates how ambitious - and potentially tricky - this could be. Mrs May said she wanted a bespoke deal for sharing data that went beyond the EU's usual tool of judging third countries' laws to be of equivalent status to Europe's. Yesterday Michel Barnier rejected this idea in advance. The EU chief negotiator tweeted some lukewarm praise today (lukewarm will be more than enough for Downing Street). But the EU's formal reaction will come next week the European Council President Donald Tusk publishes his first draft of guidelines for the phase of Brexit talks where all of this will be tackled. The prime minister called for a free trade agreement covering most sectors of the economy, going further than the deal signed between Canada and the EU but stopping short of Norway which is a member of the European Economic Area. ""We need to strike a new balance. but we will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway,"" she said. She again said a hard Irish border or a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be ""unacceptable"" and said it was for the UK and EU to ""work together"" on a solution. She suggested this could be either a customs partnership, where the UK ""mirrors"" EU requirements on goods from around the world, or a streamlined customs arrangement, using technology and ""trusted trader"" schemes to do away with the need for customs checks. Amid criticism from the EU that the UK was attempting to ""cherry-pick"" the best parts of the bloc's rules, she said: ""The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. ""If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The speech got a positive reaction from Brexit-backing cabinet ministers, with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tweeting: ""We will remain extremely close to our EU friends and partners - but able to innovate, to set our own agenda, to make our own laws and to do ambitious free trade deals around the world."" But pro-European Tory rebel Anna Soubry told the BBC that Leave voters would be right to question what was in it for them. ""The Brexit we are heading towards is very, very different to the one we were promised,"" she said. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed the speech, saying it provided ""clarity"" about  the UK leaving the single market and customs union and a ""recognition"" that trade-offs will inform future talks on a deal. But the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt was not impressed. He said: ""Theresa May needed to move beyond vague aspirations, we can only hope that serious proposals have been put in the post. While I welcome the call for a deep and special partnership, this cannot be achieved by putting a few extra cherries on the Brexit cake. "" The DUP, whom Mrs May relies on for key Commons votes, welcomed Mrs May's ""clear commitment that she will not countenance any new border being created in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom"". Leader Arlene Foster said she had ""set forward the basis upon which it would be possible to move forward."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he remained ""concerned that some of the constraints of leaving the customs union and the single market are still not fully recognised"". He added: ""We will now need to see more detailed and realistic proposals from the UK.  Brexit is due to happen in a little over 12 months, so time is short."" Business group the CBI tweeted: ""Excellent news if UK can stay in key agencies like EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) - glad PM has focused on them."" The TUC said there was ""still a chasm between the prime minister's rhetoric and reality"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Abuse victim Clifford Walsh speaks to the BBC about his '60 years of hate' Thousands of British people who as children were forcibly sent abroad, where many suffered abuse, should be compensated, an inquiry says. They were sent to Australia and parts of the British Empire from 1945-1970 by charities and the Catholic church. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said the government should pay all 2,000 former migrants still alive within 12 months. The Australian and UK governments apologised in 2009and 2010,external. About 4,000 children, mainly from deprived backgrounds,were sent to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, between 1945 and 1970, to give them better lives and strengthen the British population abroad. The inquiryheard from various former migrantswho claimed they and others suffered sexual and physical abuse at the hands of those running the schools and orphanages they were sent to. Norman Johnston, president of the International Association of Former Child Migrants, said the inquiry had ""pointed the finger"" at the British government. Mr Johnston, who was deported from Aberdeen at the age of seven, said that former migrants now needed to speak to Prime Minister Theresa May. ""We want to die knowing that justice has been served,"" he added. A group of children from a school in Stevenage were among those to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong, Australia This inquiry focused on England and Wales while separate inquiries have been set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The inquiry's report said all former child migrants should receive compensation - whether or not they were sexually abused - because all had been put at risk of sexual abuse. Inquiry chairwoman Professor Alexis Jay said: ""Child migration was a deeply flawed government policy that was badly implemented by numerous organisations which sent children as young as five years old abroad. ""The policy was allowed to continue despite evidence over many years showing that children were suffering."" Child migrant scandal 'bigger than Savile' Orphanage was like 'concentration camp' The inquiry said the government was ""primarily responsible"" for the scheme managed by the Catholic church and charities, including Barnardo's and The Fairbridge Society, which is now part of the Prince's Trust. The report also said the government: Failed to ensure children were protected Failed to respond to reports of abuse Did not want to jeopardise its relationship with the Australian government Did not want to upset Barnardo's or the Fairbridge Society It also found: Many of the organisations ""enjoyed patronage from persons of influence and position"" The avoidance of ""embarrassment and reputational risk was more important"" than care of the children Successive governments after 1970 failed to accept full responsibility Other institutions involved in the scheme which have failed to apologise should so do so ""as soon as possible"" By BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds The child abuse inquiry has been much criticised and this was its first opportunity to show that it could hold institutions to account. Thursday's report does not, as some feared, shrink from apportioning blame. Its central demand - reparations for the child migrants within months - requires immediate government action. Much of the evidence was truly historical while the facts were widely accepted. The abusers are all dead, so the inquiry's dilemma about not acting as a court of law did not come into play. In short this was one of IICSA's easier pieces of work. Harder inquiries and more controversy lie ahead. The investigation into child migration is one of the first of dozens of planned inquiries carried out by IICSA since it was set up in 2014to ""expose"" past failures and ""learn the lessons"". It was conceived after the 2011 death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile, when hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children, with the spotlight often falling on the institutions which failed to protect them. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the inquiry's report would be ""carefully considered"" and would be responded to ""in due course"". He said ""successive governments"" have accepted the ""misguided and deeply flawed"" policy was ""wrong"" and more than Â£9m has been made available to former child migrants to help them be reunited with their families. TheRoyal Over-Seas League,externalsaid it ""deeply regrets and ""apologises for"" its support of the child migration policy from the 1920s onwards and ""condemns unreservedly the abuse and ill treatment of children"".

Oh, she's actually giving birth"" A woman who thought she was suffering from severe stomach pain gave birth to a baby boy while her partner was calling 999 for an ambulance. Baby Phillip Alan was born weighing 4lb 13oz to surprised Rhiannon Oldham, 30, from Pontypool, south Wales, who had no idea she was pregnant. She delivered the baby at the home she shares with Gareth Williams three days after their Valentine's Day engagement. The family have now met the ambulance crew who helped them. MOT examiner Mr Williams, 34, explained how how his wife had had stomach pains the day before his son had arrived. He called the Welsh Ambulance Service the following day when things became worse. Dad 'knelt in snow' to help deliver baby Mum thanks 999 call handler who helped save baby Baby is born at railway station ""I had to carry her from the bathroom to the bedroom, and that's when I could see that something strange was happening,"" he said. ""I called 999 and I told them there was something seriously wrong with my girlfriend, and within minutes Rhiannon had actually given birth. ""It was a huge shock because we had absolutely no idea that she was pregnant, but we're over the moon."" Call centre worker Ms Oldham said: ""Just before Christmas I had what I thought was heartburn but I just took a Rennie and got on with it. ""I'd put on weight over Christmas too, but I just put it down to overindulging. ""The last couple of weeks have been a blur. One minute we were planning for a wedding - now we're planning for a nursery."" Ambulance call handler Chelsie Holbrook, who took the couple's 999 call from its contact centre in Cwmbran, said: ""The alarm bells started to ring for me when Gareth said that Rhiannon had a large lump, and before we knew it she had actually given birth. ""I've delivered five babies in my time as a call handler, and this one's definitely up there in terms of the most dramatic."" Paramedic Paul Ockenden and student paramedic Sian Todd were first to arrive at the couple's home. Mr Ockenden said: ""It's fair to say they were a little shell shocked, but we set about making the necessary checks and then Gareth cut the cord.""

A Facebook appeal was made and dozens of helpers, some with diggers, came forward to clear the path With heavy road disruption and travel chaos, a wedding in snowy conditions could be tough. Rebecca McKenzie and Daniel Hodgson were due to marry on Thursday at St Cuthbert's church in Benfieldside, Shotley Bridge, County Durham. However,the road to the church was impassable due to the heavy snow. A Facebook appeal was made and dozens of helpers, some with diggers, came forward to clear the path. A stranded groom and best man looked glum in Horncastle, 25 miles from the wedding venue It took thekindness of a local car dealershipto get groom Mike Enright to his wedding on time. Heavy snow left Mr Enright, his parents, and best man Ben Yarnell stuck 25 miles from the Lincoln wedding venue. But after an appeal on local BBC radio, two 4x4s transported the party - and the wedding cake - to waiting bride, Gina Metcalf.

"As the UK and the wider European continent shivers, the Arctic has witnessed some spectacularly high temperatures in recent days, some 30 degrees above average in places. Such a topsy-turvy picture inevitably has people wondering if this isn't some kind of fallout from global warming. But, as ever, meteorologists will not conflate single events with more longer-term trends. The UK Met Office, for example, is adamant that what is occurring now should be regarded as part of the natural ups and downs we get in our weather. The current cold snap is likely to have had its origins in the tropical Pacific, believe it or not, and something called the Madden-Julian Oscillation. In pictures: Snow persists in UK Follow live updates here Icy blizzards hit Europe transport systems It's snowing - can I refuse to come to work? This is a short-timescale variation, on the order of weeks, in the pattern of thunderstorms in the region. This looks to have set in train some disturbances that resulted in a sudden warming a few tens of kilometres up in the atmosphere(a Sudden Stratospheric Warming). This disruption worked to pull in temperate air over Canada and Greenland and the wider Arctic basin, but also put a block on the jet stream - ribbons of strong winds that move weather around the globe - moving across the Atlantic. The jet stream actually broke down over Scandinavia, leading to cold air sweeping in from Siberia towards Western Europe. In the western parts of the UK there are now Red Warnings in operationas Storm Emma moves up from the south. This weather system is pushing moisture ahead of it, and whenever cold air confronts moisture there is the chance for heavy snow. So meteorologists can describe all these events in an almost mechanical way. And it is a salute to the skill of modern forecasting that the possibility of what we're experiencing now was seen in the data well over a week ago. The experts couldn't be sure the cold snap would play out like it has, but they knew they had to start talking about it and raising awareness. However, all this is a long way from linking the specifics of what we're seeing to trends that become apparent over decades, which you have to do for a judgement about climate change. Arctic sea ice is low this winter All that said, the Arctic generally is warming faster than the rest of the globe, and the temperature anomalies in recent days have been extreme. And once again, Arctic sea-ice - that oft-quoted canary of climate change - is very low this winter. There is an interesting and growing body of research which suggests that a reduced differential between polar and mid-latitude temperatures (where summer temperatures rarely go above 40C, and winters are usually fairly mild) could eventually make for more bumpy weather like we're having now. It is widely debated but is sure to continue to be a very active line of study.

"Firefighter Dan Cheetham trekked 15 miles through the snow a day early to get to his shift Firefighter Dan Cheetham is one of many people to prove not all heroes wear capes. Snow and freezing conditions have continued to cause misery for many across the UK while thearmy has been called in to helprescue drivers stuck in the snow. But it's not just those in the military who have been lending people in need a hand. Even so, the efforts of Dan Cheetham, a Lincolnshire firefighter who walked 15 miles through the snow on Thursday - a day early - to make sure he was on time for his shift, has won the admiration of colleagues and the public alike. ""We'd taken quite a lashing through the snow,"" he told the BBC. ""The community had pulled together but there were four foot drifts in some places making roads impassable by car. ""I knew I had a duty of care to my community. That made my mind up that I had to get into work. I wouldn't recommend going out in the snow but I'm used to walking and left as early as I did because it was safer to travel in daylight."" Dave Gilbert, Mr Cheetham's manager at Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said he was ""extremely proud of the efforts that [Mr Cheetham] has gone to to ensure we've got a full crew"". But Mr Cheetham, who was worked in the fire service for five years, said he thought some of his colleagues might have thought he was a bit ""loopy"". ""I had that many layers on I looked like the abominable snowman,"" he said. Nurse Lydia Howells used a home-made sign to bag a lift to work Lydia Howells, 28, is a recovery nurse at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh. She works in the operating theatre. ""This morning I knew I had to get to work, but the car was totally snowed in and the busses weren't running so I decided to make myself a sign and hit the road walking,"" she told the BBC on Friday. ""At work I have seen how people have pulled together so I was hopeful someone would stop."" She set out wearing three coats and clutching a flask of hot water. Fortunately for Ms Howells, she was in the ""extremely windy and bitterly cold"" conditions for ""no more than two minutes"" before she was offered a lift. ""I was elated when someone pulled up,"" she said. ""It was a really nice gesture. The guy who picked me up had to let the people he worked for know what he was doing, so they didn't think he was skiving. ""I have no idea how I am going to get home after my shift, so I've brought pyjamas in case I end up staying at the hospital,"" she added. ""There was no question in my mind that I was going to get to work today. I needed to get in to look after patients."" Lydia Howells pictured with the driver who picked her up Glasgow-based surgeon Andy Renwick told BBC Radio Scotland on Thursday that one colleague walked from Anniesland to Paisley - almost eight miles - to operate on a cancer patient. ""I won't give her name because she would be genuinely upset with me,"" he said. ""She walked from Anniesland to Paisley - it took her two hours and 50 minutes. I saw her come in, she had snow goggles on, Gortexed up, top and bottom, snow shoes and walking poles."" Mr Renwick's colleague was due to operate on a patient with bowel cancer. ""She knew that had to be done and so she made extra effort to get in here to make sure that was actually delivered."" Emily O'Connor, a trainee obstetrician at Cork University Maternity Hospital, posted a picture on Twitter of her walk to work through the snow with a friend early on Thursday morning.

"Water firms have been accused of exploiting their monopoly power and neglecting the environment. The critcism comes from Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who said some firms had paid no tax and hidden their earnings offshore. And he promised to back the regulator Ofwat in tightening up rules to protect bill-payers and the environment. The industry body Water UK responded that the companies were dealing firmly with issues that threatened trust. But Mr Goveâs speech to a water industry conference must have made uncomfortable listening. Should the industry be renationalised? 'Water firms must clean up their act' Water bills set to fall from 2020 He complained that water firms had paid out almost all of their Â£18bn profits to shareholders, instead of re-investing it in mending leaks and protecting the environment. And he named names: The boss of United Utilities taking home Â£2.8m a year; the head of Severn Trent, Â£2.4m. The secretary of state said last year Anglian and Southern paid zero corporation tax, whilst Thames has paid no corporation tax for a decade. He suggested: ""Some of their best brains appear to be as intent on financial engineering as much as real engineering."" Mr Gove promised to back recommendations from the regulator Ofwat due to be published in April â and said he would not hesitate to increase the pressure. He told the firms: ""You may be private companies, but you have a responsibility to the public who canât take their custom elsewhere."" The politician complained that three billion litres of water still leak out every day - and said the figure has barely improved in the past four years. He said there had been no investment in new nationally significant supply infrastructure, such as major reservoirs, since privatisation. Craig Bennett from Friends of the Earth welcomed the comments but said Mr Gove could do much more himself to improve management of water. ""Defra are not doing enough,"" he told BBC News. ""They are still allowing new houses on flood plains â and there is constant backsliding on the need to use water more efficiently."" Dr Matt Prescott from the Environmental Rating Agency told BBC News: âThe environmental problems with the industry are a signal of financial problems ""We need effective regulation â itâs clearly not happening at the moment. Politicians  canât just have an obsession with bills."" Dr Prescott said that during the recent prosecution of Thames Water at Aylesbury Crown Court they found that the Environment Agency did not have direct access to independently sourced pollution monitoring data. Instead, they had to rely on to water companies to self-monitor pollution levels discharged from sewage works. ""We think these forms of self-regulation should stop,"" he said. Water UK Chief Executive Michael Roberts countered that companies were putting public interest first. ""Water is fundamental to all of our lives, and companies fully understand their clear responsibility to act in the public interest,"" he said. ""For me, that boils down to doing the right thing in the right way, and tackling issues where they arise, because we want to maintain the high levels of trust our customers have for us. ""We know that they trust us, because more than eight out of 10 of them say so in our private polling. ""We should not lose sight of that as we address some of the issues that critics have raised. The industry is working for water, and that works for our customers.""

"Big six energy provider E.On is making changes to how it bills customers which will see the average standard variable tariff rate rise by Â£22 a year. The changes are due to come into place on 19 April for existing customers. E.On said the removal of various discounts would make it easier for customers to understand its tariffs and to compare them with competitors. Price comparison service Energy Helpline said the rise could be up to Â£50 annually for some E.On customers. It said the bill increase was ""bad news"" for customers. Move to cap 'rip-off' energy bills A spokeswoman for E.On emphasised that the firm had ""made no changes"" to the prices it was charging for electricity and gas units. It said the increase in customers' bills was due to the removal of some of the discounts currently offered to customers for paperless billing and using both electricity and gas. ""We believe this will make it simpler and easier for customers to understand our tariffs and compare them with other suppliers in the market, the majority of whom do not offer these discounts,"" the spokeswoman added. The firm has also increased its standard charge for customers who pay their bills by cash or cheque to Â£10 per fuel per year. It said the majority of its customers, almost three quarters, paid their bills by direct debit. ""The impact on our customers' bills will vary depending on payment method, bill choice and fuel selection,"" the spokeswoman said. New legislation to allow energy regulator Ofgem to limit how much companies can charge customers for their standard variable tariffs is expected to come into effect next winter. The law will limit the cost of firms' standard default tariffs until 2020. Following that, the cap may be extended on an annual basis until 2023.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' President Donald Trump is to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week, hitting producers like Canada and China. He said steel products face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. The US imports four times more steel than it exports, and is reliant on steel from more than 100 nations. Mr Trump tweeted that the US was suffering from ""unfair trade"". But the move has hit US markets, with the Dow Jones index closing down 1.7%. The value of shares in American steel manufacturers jumped significantly after the announcement. The news is likely to provoke an angry reaction from China, and analysts have expressed fears of the prospect of new trade wars. Key US allies are also at risk of being hit with higher costs, but it is not clear if any countries will be excluded from the new measures. 'A blatant intervention' - trade partners react During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said that foreign countries were ""dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies"". And since taking office, Mr Trump said cheap imports from China were harming the viability of industry in the US, which is the world's biggest importer of steel. China isn't the only country to export the material to the US - 110 countries and territories do so. AndChina is only the 11th biggest exporter to the US,external- some US allies, including Canada, Japan and South Korea are among the 10 biggest sources of steel for the US, and they all face a big bump in costs. The recommendation to impose tariffs was made in a report,externalby Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. President Trump had asked him to investigate ""whether steel imports threaten to impair the national security"". Mr Trump promised to rebuild the American steel and aluminium industries, which he said had suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular China, for decades. ""When our country can't make aluminium and steel...you almost don't have much of a country,"" he said. ""We need great steel makers, great aluminium makers for defence."" The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 He spoke as Chinese economic adviser Liu He, a friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited the White House. Mr Trump's announcement was slightly delayed amid reports of wrangling over the issue among his aides. What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade More than a dozen metals executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp and Arcelor Mittal, joined him as he made the announcement. But officials from industries that rely on steel use have lobbied against the tariffs as they fear increased costs if they have to use more US-made metals. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The president wants to be seen as tough on trade and China, and so do many of his top officials: Pete Navarro, a trade adviser who's tipped for promotion, has hawkish views. So does Harry Harris, the president's pick for ambassador to Australia. Still, some advisers thought the president should take it slow. Aides huddled behind closed doors and in a hallway on Thursday morning, and the president's announcement was postponed. The scheduling conflict reflected a bigger clash: a fight between hardliners and those who approach trade in a more cautious manner. Meanwhile, the boss was right where he liked to be: in the eye of the storm, and everyone was waiting for him to speak. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freedland said any tariffs would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" The European Union""will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Chinahad already said it would consider retaliatory measures against the US A spokesman for US Speaker of the HousePaul Ryansaid he hoped the president ""will consider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forward"" The US Department of Energy says the industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis. But it is an industry significantly weaker than it was at the turn of the millennium. In the year 2000, the US produced112m tonsof steel - a figure that had fallen to86.5mtons in 2016. In 2000,135,000 peoplewere employed in the industry - a figure that fell to83,600in 2016. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York The threat of tariffs on steel and aluminium has hovered around the Trump administration for months, with delays making the president vulnerable to criticism that he is all bark and no bite, despite his America First message. He's now silenced those mutters and handed a victory to the steel industry. But the chaos surrounding Thursday's announcement - in which advisers apparently hoped to dissuade the president from action - underscores just how many more losers there may be. Dozens of companies in industries from car-making to construction had warned of hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, as higher prices raise costs for steel-dependent sectors such as manufacturing. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis advised that the move would cost the US support among its allies, such as Canada and South Korea. The European Union, Mexico and China have all said they are weighing retaliatory tariffs that would strike politically sensitive industries like agriculture. The last time the US imposed steel tariffs, in 2002, President George W Bush lifted them less than two years later to avoid a damaging trade war. Steel executives told the president on Thursday that they trust his judgement. But if a trade war is the outcome of this decision, as analysts expect, it remains to be seen how many will agree.

Meanwhile, the boss was right where he liked to be: in the eye of the storm, and everyone was waiting for him to speak. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freedland said any tariffs would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" The European Union""will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Chinahad already said it would consider retaliatory measures against the US A spokesman for US Speaker of the HousePaul Ryansaid he hoped the president ""will consider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forward"" The US Department of Energy says the industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis. But it is an industry significantly weaker than it was at the turn of the millennium. In the year 2000, the US produced112m tonsof steel - a figure that had fallen to86.5mtons in 2016. In 2000,135,000 peoplewere employed in the industry - a figure that fell to83,600in 2016. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York The threat of tariffs on steel and aluminium has hovered around the Trump administration for months, with delays making the president vulnerable to criticism that he is all bark and no bite, despite his America First message. He's now silenced those mutters and handed a victory to the steel industry. But the chaos surrounding Thursday's announcement - in which advisers apparently hoped to dissuade the president from action - underscores just how many more losers there may be. Dozens of companies in industries from car-making to construction had warned of hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, as higher prices raise costs for steel-dependent sectors such as manufacturing. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis advised that the move would cost the US support among its allies, such as Canada and South Korea. The European Union, Mexico and China have all said they are weighing retaliatory tariffs that would strike politically sensitive industries like agriculture. The last time the US imposed steel tariffs, in 2002, President George W Bush lifted them less than two years later to avoid a damaging trade war. Steel executives told the president on Thursday that they trust his judgement. But if a trade war is the outcome of this decision, as analysts expect, it remains to be seen how many will agree.

"Bright is one of the Netflix shows that will be available to Sky Q subscribers Sky will make Netflix available through its latest box in an attempt to tackle the threat posed by the popular streaming service. The satellite broadcaster will allow viewers to watch Netflix shows on its Sky Q platform later this year. Customers will pay for Netflix as part of their Sky bill, although prices have not yet been announced. Sky said the move would make the entertainment experience ""easier and simpler"" for customers. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said the partnership would allow Sky subscribers to seamlessly access the best entertainment in one place. The streaming service's mix of original drama, films and other programming has proved popular globally, with subscriber numbers reaching nearly 118 million at the end of 2017. While pay-TV rival Virgin Media has offered Netflix to its customers for some time, Sky has regarded it as an ""existential threat to its service"", said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders. ""It has inconvenienced its subscribers, who are more likely to have Netflix than those without pay-TV, because it has believed that its content was strong and exclusive enough to justify operating a walled garden,"" he said. ""It seems as if that confidence has subsided and bringing a competitor on board - one that could potentially satisfy Sky's subscribers for a much lower price - is a risky move that cannot now be backed away from,  but at least is a sure source of shared revenues."" The deal comes as US media giant Comcast threatens to derail Rupert Murdoch's attempt to take full control of Sky. This week the owner of NBC Universal made aÂ£22.1bn bid for the European satellite broadcaster, challenging a lower offer from 21st Century Fox.

"French police arrested the suspect after identifying his vehicle through CCTV video (file picture) A French grandfather has admitted raping and sexually assaulting around 40 women in France and Belgium since the 1980s, officials say. The married 57-year-old, who has not been officially named, was arrested after police linked his car to the rape of a young woman last week in Belgium. His DNA matched samples found after 19 other attacks. The case has shocked the northern town of Pont-sur-Sambre, where the mayor described him as a ""well-liked"" man. The father-of-three worked as a janitor and was previously the head of the local football club, French media reported, identifying him as Dino Scala. The suspect - nicknamed ""the rapist of Sambre"" after the local river - is thought to be one of the country's most prolific serial rapists in recent decades. He usually attacked the women from behind, early in the morning, wore gloves and covered his face, prosecutor Jean-Philippe Vicentini said. The man told police he had ""acted on urges he was unable to control"", Mr Vicentini added. 'One French woman in eight has been raped' France plans anti-street harassment law The investigation into a string of attacks going back to 1988 was opened in 1996. One of the victims was 13 years old and several others were 17, a police source told AFP news agency. During their search, police collected DNA samples from some 100 people. Security cameras in Belgium caught the suspect's vehicle after a young woman was raped in the border town of Erquelinnes on 5 February. On Monday French police arrested him in Pont-sur-Sambre. ""We're completely shocked,"" said Mayor Michel Detrait. ""It doesn't fit with his personality. He was well-liked, ready to help.""

"This video can not be played President Putin introduced video of a missile launch in 2018 Russia has developed a new array of nuclear weapons that are invincible, according to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin made the claims as he laid out his key policies for a fourth presidential term, ahead of an election he is expected to win in 17 days' time. The weapons he boasted of included a cruise missile that he said could ""reach anywhere in the world"". He said of the West: ""They need to take account of a new reality and understand ... [this]... is not a bluff."" Giving his annual state of the nation speech, Mr Putin used video presentations to showcase the development of two new nuclear delivery systems that he said could evade detection. One video graphic appeared to show missiles raining down on the US state of Florida. Why would Putin want to nuke Florida? One system Mr Putin described included a ""low-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defence and air defence"". Another was a submarine-launched, long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Police accused of 'Putin graffiti campaign' Russian in jail for giant duck protest During the two-hour televised speech to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament, he said the weapons were a response to US development of its missile defence system. The US State Department said it was ""certainly unfortunate to have watched the video animation that depicted a nuclear attack on the United States"" - adding that it was not ""the behaviour of a responsible international player"". Mr Putin faces seven challengers on 18 March, although none is expected to attract widespread support. The president played no part in a raucous televised debate broadcast on Wednesday that featured the other candidates. Absent from the campaign is prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running and has called on voters to boycott the poll. President Putin has so far done little campaigning, and until now has said little about his plans for the next six years. By Steven Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Before today, Vladimir Putin had delivered 13 state of the nation addresses. Address Number 14 turned out to be very different from anything that had come before. Standing in front of a giant video screen, President Putin showcased Russia's very latest strategic weapons. Like a magician pulling one rabbit after another out of his hat, he wowed his audience with images of cruise missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, underwater drones and supersonic jets. Russian MPs and senators applauded the military video show, which dominated the second half of President Putin's speech. There was a double message here. Firstly, to the West: don't push us. And, with elections coming up, there was this for the Russian people: Vote for Putin and you'll be voting for national security. I suspect the concluding image was designed to reinforce just that: as Vladimir Putin stood to the national anthem, a giant Russian flag appeared on the video screen behind him. It is a message that is likely to strike a chord with many here. Mr Putin tailored the first half of his speech towards working Russians and their concerns. He pledged to halve poverty in the country within the next six years and said he wanted life-expectancy rates to emulate Japan and France. It was Mr Putin's last speech before the election ""Every person matters to us,"" he said, adding that he also wanted to increase employment and longevity. In 2000 there were 42 million people in Russia living below the poverty line, he noted; today there were 20 million, but this still needed to come down. He warned Russians not to take the country's power for granted. ""Russia is now a leading country with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential,"" he said. ""But from the point of view of the extremely important task of ensuring people's quality of life and welfare we, of course, have not achieved the level we require. But we have to do this and will do this,"" he added to applause. Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Mr Putin also pledged to spend more on roads and reduce accidents; said teachers deserved good salaries and wages; and said there should be better access to both the internet and medical services for people in remote areas. One of the video graphics appeared to show missiles dropping on the US state of Florida Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent President Putin's emphasis on a strong Russia modernising its nuclear arsenal is a reflection of similar statements over recent months from his US counterpart Donald Trump. In his remarks, Mr Putin highlighted the development of two new nuclear delivery systems, which, he said, could evade US anti-ballistic missile defences. This is essentially because neither of them are ballistic missiles, which are fired out of the atmosphere in a high-arcing trajectory. One - effectively a very long-range nuclear-tipped torpedo - has been rumoured to be under development since Soviet days but is now seen by US analysts as a credible threat. The second system - described by Mr Putin as a cruise missile - looks to be more of a work in progress and may be a kind of very high-speed ""hypersonic"" system - described by one arms control expert as a ""glider on steroids"" - that again could evade existing anti-missile defences. China and the US are also working on similar systems of their own. Digital growth was also essential, Mr Putin said during his speech. He said he wanted Russia to become one of the world's main hubs for storing and processing big data. Graphics - including this one on Russia's working-age population (in millions) - flashed up throughout He called for more progress in making robots and artificial intelligence. New talent in technology should be nurtured and foreigners should be encouraged to study in Russia, he said. Mr Putin also spoke of Russian operations in Syria - supporting the Assad government's fight against rebels - which, he said, showed off the country's increased defence capabilities. Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? The Russian guns for hire dying in Syria Syria war: Putin's Russian mission accomplished Russia recently sent two of its most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, to Syria, even though they are still undergoing tests. There was no confirmation that Russia's new stealth fighters have been used in combat in Syria Mr Putin also announced that a bridge to the Crimean peninsula would be open within the next couple of months.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, during Mr Putin's current term in office. Russia was safeguarding its interest in the Arctic region by strengthening its military infrastructure in the region, he said.

"Carles Puigdemont faces arrest if he returns to Spain Fugitive Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont has said he is ending his bid to be reappointed president of Spain's north-eastern region. He said he was stepping aside in favour of detained activist Jordi Sanchez.

"Only men can attend football matches in Iran Iran has detained 35 women for trying to attend a football match. They tried to go to a game between Tehran teams Esteqlal and Persepolis. Iran said they were temporarily held and would be released after the match. Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino, was also in attendance, along with Iranian Sport Minister Masoud Soltanifar. A live broadcast was taken off the air when a journalist asked Mr Soltanifar when women would be allowed to attend football matches. Iranian women refused entry to match despite holding tickets What happens when sport and politics collide in Iran According to the semi-official ISNA news agency, Iranian interior ministry spokesman Seyyed Salman Samani said the female football fans were not arrested - but transferred to a ""proper place"" by police. Earlier reports said two women were held. Iran has barred women from attending football games since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Iranian women have been urged online recently to protest about their ban from stadiums There were calls on social media before the match for women to protest against the ban outside the Azadi stadium today. Women's rights activistMasih Alinejad on Wednesday called on women to attend Thursday's match,external. ""The Fifa president will be in the stadium tomorrow (1 March),"" she wrote. ""I wish women would gather outside the stadium to ask men not to enter without them."" Another user said it was a ""basic right"" for women to enter stadiums with men,external, and said this match was ""the best chance to break the 35-year-old taboo"". Azadi means ""freedom"" stadium in Persian, and one Twitter user pointed out the hypocrisy of ""naming a stadium freedom but banning half the population from entering"". By Alan Johnston, World Service Middle East regional editor The women caught sneaking into the stadium were trying to attend a particularly significant game, one being watched by the most powerful man in world football, Fifa's boss. It seems they wanted to attract Mr Infantino's attention to the ban on women attending games. And the sensitivity of the issue was apparent as Mr Infantino stood beside the country's sports minister during a live TV interview. A journalist asked this awkward question about when the ban might be lifted. The sound was faded down, and the interview abruptly taken off the air. Mr Infantino had been speaking to reporters about a two-year dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Fifa president Gianni Infantino, left, spoke at a joint press conference with Iranian Sport Minister Masoud Soltanifar Since 2016, when Saudi Arabia broke off relations with Iran, Saudi clubs have refused to play there, forcing Iranian teams to play home games in Oman. ""It's very clear that politics should stay out of football and football should stay out of politics,"" Mr Infantino said the news conference. ""There are of course political issues between countries all over the world but this should not have an impact,"" he said. Later on, the head of Fifa met with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Mr Rouhani asked Fifa to make sure that ""people are not deprived of watching competitions in their own stadiums"".

"Ken Livingstone's suspension from Labour over anti-Semitism claims has been extended pending the outcome of an internal investigation. The former London mayor's suspension had been due to expire on 27 April. But Labour's outgoing general secretary, Iain McNicol, has signed off on an extended extension. Mr Livingstone is facing an internal investigation into his conduct after refusing to apologise for statements he made about Adolf Hitler and Zionism. Labour's general secretary resigns Fresh probe into Livingstone remarks Mr McNicol announced he was standing down as Labour's general secretary on Friday after a ""tumultuous seven years"". Labour sources denied claims by the Huffington Post, which broke the story, the decision to extend Mr Livingstone's suspension was Mr McNicol's last official act. They said the decision had been taken by National Executive Committee members and although the letter informing Mr Livingstone of the decision had been sent in Mr McNicol's name it had not been the result of a unilateral decision taken by the outgoing general secretary. Mr Livingstone was suspended for a year in April 2016 over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. Jon Lansman is launching a bid to be Labour general secretary He was suspended for a further 12 months in April last year after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Jeremy Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. This has reportedly yet to get under way, with the deadline approaching for Mr Livingstone to be re-admitted to the party. Labour sources say the investigation will go before the party's disputes panel, which may refer Mr Livingstone to the party's National Constitutional Committee for possible disciplinary action or decide no further action is necessary. A Labour spokeswoman confirmed: ""Ken Livingstone has been administratively suspended from the Labour Party, pending the outcome of an internal party investigation. ""That suspension starts on the date that his membership suspension applied by the National Constitutional Committee ends on 27 April 2018."" Some Labour MPs and Jewish groups have criticised the decision not to expel Mr Livingstone, but the former Labour MP said he had been ""suspended for stating the truth"". Labour MP Wes Streeting, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Jews,told the Huffington Post,externalthe decision to extend Mr Livingstone's suspension was ""long overdue"". ""Almost a year has passed since Jeremy Corbyn announced that Mr Livingstone's conduct would be subject to further investigation with seemingly little action by the NEC."" He said Mr Livingstone should be expelled for his ""gratuitously offensive remarks"" and ""his lack of remorse"" - and urged the NEC to take tougher action against ""anti-Semites and their apologists infesting the Labour Party"". The battle to replace Mr McNicol as general secretary has, meanwhile, intensified with the founder of Momentum - the grassroots movement supporting Jeremy Corbyn - throwing his hat into the ring. In a statement on Twitter, Jon Lansman said he was applying to ""open up the contest"" and ensure there was a wide range of candidates. Mr Lansman, a key ally of the Labour leader, said if elected he would ""stay tuned to the desires"" of the party's members and trade union affiliates, ""work hard to strengthen Labour's trade union link"" and make sure the party ""really delivered for the many not the few"". An official with the Unite union, Jennie Formby, has already announced that she is standing and is reported to be favoured by Mr Corbyn. Jon Lansman set up Momentum to support and sustain Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, but the Labour leader isn't returning the favour - he would prefer Jennie Formby to be the next general secretary. She's a close personal and political ally of Unite's leader Len McCluskey and the union has been arguing that the post should go to a woman. Mr Corbyn's aides feared Mr Lansman's candidacy would split the left of the party and tried strenuously to prevent it. So Jon Lansman then suggested that a woman candidate might stand in his place. He had in mind Laura Parker - a Momentum official who  had previously worked for Mr Corbyn. The leadership were firm that Jennie Formby was their choice and Ms Parker didn't throw her hat in the ring. Today Mr Lansman declared his own candidacy - despite a further direct plea from Jeremy Corbyn to abandon the plan. Privately, the Momentum leader has complained about ""a stitch-up"". Publicly, he says he wants the process of appointing the party's top official opened up. Labour's ruling national executive will make its choice later this month.

"Bill Gates had previously spoken enthusiastically about Bitcoin Crypto-currencies are killing people in a ""fairly direct way"", Microsoft founder Bill Gates has said. He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl. In an ""ask me anything"" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering. Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology. Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: ""The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.

"This video can not be played Abuse victim Clifford Walsh speaks to the BBC about his '60 years of hate' Thousands of British people who as children were forcibly sent abroad, where many suffered abuse, should be compensated, an inquiry says. They were sent to Australia and parts of the British Empire from 1945-1970 by charities and the Catholic church. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) said the government should pay all 2,000 former migrants still alive within 12 months. The Australian and UK governments apologised in 2009and 2010,external. About 4,000 children, mainly from deprived backgrounds,were sent to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, between 1945 and 1970, to give them better lives and strengthen the British population abroad. The inquiryheard from various former migrantswho claimed they and others suffered sexual and physical abuse at the hands of those running the schools and orphanages they were sent to. Norman Johnston, president of the International Association of Former Child Migrants, said the inquiry had ""pointed the finger"" at the British government. Mr Johnston, who was deported from Aberdeen at the age of seven, said that former migrants now needed to speak to Prime Minister Theresa May. ""We want to die knowing that justice has been served,"" he added. A group of children from a school in Stevenage were among those to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong, Australia This inquiry focused on England and Wales while separate inquiries have been set up in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The inquiry's report said all former child migrants should receive compensation - whether or not they were sexually abused - because all had been put at risk of sexual abuse. Inquiry chairwoman Professor Alexis Jay said: ""Child migration was a deeply flawed government policy that was badly implemented by numerous organisations which sent children as young as five years old abroad. ""The policy was allowed to continue despite evidence over many years showing that children were suffering."" Child migrant scandal 'bigger than Savile' Orphanage was like 'concentration camp' The inquiry said the government was ""primarily responsible"" for the scheme managed by the Catholic church and charities, including Barnardo's and The Fairbridge Society, which is now part of the Prince's Trust. The report also said the government: Failed to ensure children were protected Failed to respond to reports of abuse Did not want to jeopardise its relationship with the Australian government Did not want to upset Barnardo's or the Fairbridge Society It also found: Many of the organisations ""enjoyed patronage from persons of influence and position"" The avoidance of ""embarrassment and reputational risk was more important"" than care of the children Successive governments after 1970 failed to accept full responsibility Other institutions involved in the scheme which have failed to apologise should so do so ""as soon as possible"" By BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds The child abuse inquiry has been much criticised and this was its first opportunity to show that it could hold institutions to account. Thursday's report does not, as some feared, shrink from apportioning blame. Its central demand - reparations for the child migrants within months - requires immediate government action. Much of the evidence was truly historical while the facts were widely accepted. The abusers are all dead, so the inquiry's dilemma about not acting as a court of law did not come into play. In short this was one of IICSA's easier pieces of work. Harder inquiries and more controversy lie ahead. The investigation into child migration is one of the first of dozens of planned inquiries carried out by IICSA since it was set up in 2014to ""expose"" past failures and ""learn the lessons"". It was conceived after the 2011 death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile, when hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children, with the spotlight often falling on the institutions which failed to protect them. A spokesman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the inquiry's report would be ""carefully considered"" and would be responded to ""in due course"". He said ""successive governments"" have accepted the ""misguided and deeply flawed"" policy was ""wrong"" and more than Â£9m has been made available to former child migrants to help them be reunited with their families.

"This video can not be played Alexander Worth accepted an offer to ride in the car before he died in the crash The driver of a Â£1.2 million Ferrari involved in a crash that killed a 13-year-old boy has been found guilty of his death. Alexander Worth died after the supercar ""accelerated uncontrollably"" and flipped over on a farm lane in North Warnborough, Hampshire, in August 2016. Matthew Cobden, 39, of Walton-on-Thames in Surrey, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving at Winchester Crown Court. He will be sentenced on 26 March. Alexander Worth died in the crash in North Warnborough in August 2016 The court had heard businessman Cobden had offered Alexander, from Kings Worthy in Hampshire, a ride in the Ferrari F50 when the teenager visited his car storage business with his mother and her partner. Cobden was tearful as he described how he had not worn a seatbelt and had not asked Alexander to put one on. ""It's something I think about all the time, if I had done, things could have been different,"" Cobden told the court. He had said the 12 cylinder vehicle ""accelerated uncontrollably"" when he put his foot on the accelerator. Both were thrown from the vehicle as it crashed into a fence post at approximately 40mph, and Alexander died from his injuries. Matthew Cobden stood trial at Winchester Crown Court The defence had blamed the crash on a pre-existing defect in the Ferrari. But the prosecution said the car was well-maintained and the crash was caused by driver error. A statement released by Alexander's family following the verdict described him as ""our very special boy"". ""We hope the media coverage has in some way increased awareness of the fragility of life and the danger of driving powerful cars for however short a journey, and the necessity of adhering to all sensible safety measures,"" the statement said. Cobden was granted unconditional bail until sentencing.

"At the time, police reportedly said the gunshot noise was a sign falling over A teenager tried to kill Queen Elizabeth II during a visit to New Zealand in 1981, declassified official documents confirm. Christopher Lewis, 17, fired a shot as the Queen toured the city of Dunedin, New Zealand's Security Intelligence Service (SIS) said. Police had said at the time that the gunshot sound had been caused by a sign falling over, local media report. A former police officer and local media have suggested a cover-up took place. New Zealand feared future royal tours could be cancelled, it is claimed. The royal parade took place in Dunedin on 14 October 1981.Police and members of the public heard ""what they took to be a shot"",external, according to the declassified documents obtained by news website Stuff. Lewis was arrested shortly afterwards and police discovered a rifle and used gun cartridge in a building overlooking the parade. ""Lewis did indeed originally intend to assassinate the Queen,"" the documents say. But he ""did not have a suitable vantage point from which to fire, nor a sufficiently high-powered rifle for the range"". Queen Elizabeth II: A constant amid gale-force changes New Zealand profile Lewis was not charged with attempting to kill the Queen but was accused instead of offences including discharging a firearm. An SIS memo written shortly after Lewis's first court appearance and obtained by Stuff said officials feared journalists would connect Lewis to the Queen's parade. ""Current police investigations into the shots have been conducted discreetly and most media representatives probably have the impression that the noise was caused by a firework of some description,"" the memo said. ""There is a worry, however, that in court the press may make the connections between the date of the offence and the Queen's visit."" The New Zealand government was accused of covering the incident up by former Dunedin police officer Tom Lewis in 1997. He told Stuff he doubted the full truth would emerge. ""It will be like ripping the scab off... so much pus would come out,"" he said. The New Zealand authorities feared that if the incident became public knowledge, future royal visits could be called off, Stuff said. Tom Lewis said the teenager was initially facing a charge of attempted treason but that subsequently changed. Colin Peacock of Radio New Zealand said journalists had come forward in recent weeks to say they were visited by police and told not to report ""anything about a shot or any sharp sound that was fired"". ""They do believe this came from the very very top and shut down the story,"" he told the BBC. Lewis told investigators he was the commander of an armed group but the SIS investigated the claim, found no evidence and said Lewis suffered ""delusions"". After serving his initial jail term he went on to commit armed robberies and was charged with murder. He took his own life in prison in 1997. New Zealand police have said they will investigate Lewis's case file,externalgiven the interest in the ""historic matter"", the New Zealand Herald reported.

"Sir Brian Leveson accused ministers of breaking their promise to phone hacking victims by axing his inquiry into media standards, it has emerged. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock announced the move earlier, saying the press had cleaned up its act. He said the changing media landscape meant the second part of the Leveson inquiry was not needed. But Sir Brian said in a letter to ministers last month he ""fundamentally disagreed"" with that conclusion. Press standards inquiry axed by ministers Lords vote for second stage Leveson probe Labour 'won't accept' more Mosley money The judge, who is now head of criminal justice in England and Wales, said the ""full truth"" about the extent of unlawful behaviour at the UK's tabloid newspapers had yet to be exposed. And he disputed the government's claim that the press was now sufficiently well-regulated to render further investigation into its culture and practices unnecessary. Part two of the Leveson Inquiry had been due to focus on the relationship between journalists and the police - and Sir Brian said it would have been broadened out to include data protection and ""fake news"" on social media.

In a letter to Mr Hancock and Home Secretary Amber Rudd on 23 January, he rejected press claims he had no enthusiasm for chairing part two of his inquiry. He said he would not be available, because of other commitments, but suggested it should continue under another judge. ""I have no doubt that there is still a legitimate expectation on behalf of the public and, in particular, the alleged victims of phone hacking and other unlawful conduct, that there will be a full public examination of the circumstances that allowed that behaviour to develop and clear reassurances that nothing of the same scale could occur again: that is what they were promised,"" he said. He added that he did not believe ""we are yet even near that position"" and urged ministers to consider pressing ahead with the ""bulk"" of part two ""as soon as possible"". In his statement to MPs, Mr Hancock appeared to play down Sir Brian's objections to the axing of the inquiry. Matt Hancock told MPs the press was now better regulated ""Sir Brian agrees that the inquiry should not proceed under the current terms of reference but believes that it should continue in an amended form,"" he said. ""We do not believe that reopening this costly and time consuming public inquiry is the right way forward, so considering all the factors that I have outlined to the House today, I have informed Sir Brian that we are formally closing the inquiry. ""But we will take action to safeguard the lifeblood of our democratic discourse and tackle the challenges that our media face today, not a decade ago."" Mr Hancock told MPs the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) - set up by the UK's main newspaper groups as an alternative to state-backed regulator Impress - had ""largely complied with Leveson's recommendations"". Mr Hancock also announced that the government would not put Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act - which would force media organisations to pay legal costs of libel cases whether they won or lost - into effect and said they would seek repeal ""at the earliest opportunity"". Labour's deputy leader and media spokesman Tom Watson accused Mr Hancock of being ""brazenly misleading"" about the public support for going ahead with the inquiry and about Sir Brian's own opposition to the decision to axe it. ""This kind of selective use of facts might not make a tabloid editor blush, but it is not worthy of a secretary of state,"" Mr Watson said. Mr Hancock accused Mr Watson of being ""tied up with the opponents of press freedom"" and said Labour's proposals would ""would lead to a press that is fettered and not free"". A spokesman for the lawyers who represented Kate and Gerry McCann, Christopher Jefferies, the Dowler family and other ""core participants"" at part one of the Leveson inquiry said: ""It is astonishing that the government is abandoning it promises to victims of the phone-hacking scandal."" ""In 2012, David Cameron made personal promises to the victims of press abuse that the government would implement Leveson. It is a huge disappointment to them that this government has now dropped that completely,"" said Steven Heffer, of law firm Collyer Bristow. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, welcomed the government's ""common-sense approach"" but warned that further challenges to press freedom remained in the shape of House of Lords amendments to the Data Protection Bill calling for Leveson part two to be implemented. But Evan Harris, director of campaign group Hacked Off, said: ""If this was any other industry the press would be demanding that inquiry must happen immediately, but when it is about them they applaud the cover-up of a cover up. The government will find it very difficult to maintain this cover-up for long."" Lord Justice Leveson was appointed in 2011 to carry out an inquiry into press standards, following the phone-hacking scandal. In his original terms of reference, it was envisaged the inquiry would be split into two parts. The first, looking at the culture and practices of the press and relations between politicians, press and the police, took place in 2011 and 2012, with a full report in November 2012. The second part was scheduled to consider the extent of improper conduct and governance failings by individual newspaper groups, how these were investigated by the police and whether police officers received corrupt payments or inducements.

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' President Donald Trump is to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week, hitting producers like Canada and China. He said steel products face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. The US imports four times more steel than it exports, and is reliant on steel from more than 100 nations. Mr Trump tweeted that the US was suffering from ""unfair trade"". But the move has hit US markets, with the Dow Jones index closing down 1.7%. The value of shares in American steel manufacturers jumped significantly after the announcement. The news is likely to provoke an angry reaction from China, and analysts have expressed fears of the prospect of new trade wars. Key US allies are also at risk of being hit with higher costs, but it is not clear if any countries will be excluded from the new measures. 'A blatant intervention' - trade partners react During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said that foreign countries were ""dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies"". And since taking office, Mr Trump said cheap imports from China were harming the viability of industry in the US, which is the world's biggest importer of steel. China isn't the only country to export the material to the US - 110 countries and territories do so. AndChina is only the 11th biggest exporter to the US,external- some US allies, including Canada, Japan and South Korea are among the 10 biggest sources of steel for the US, and they all face a big bump in costs. The recommendation to impose tariffs was made in a report,externalby Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. President Trump had asked him to investigate ""whether steel imports threaten to impair the national security"". Mr Trump promised to rebuild the American steel and aluminium industries, which he said had suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular China, for decades. ""When our country can't make aluminium and steel...you almost don't have much of a country,"" he said. ""We need great steel makers, great aluminium makers for defence."" The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 He spoke as Chinese economic adviser Liu He, a friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited the White House. Mr Trump's announcement was slightly delayed amid reports of wrangling over the issue among his aides. What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade More than a dozen metals executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp and Arcelor Mittal, joined him as he made the announcement. But officials from industries that rely on steel use have lobbied against the tariffs as they fear increased costs if they have to use more US-made metals. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The president wants to be seen as tough on trade and China, and so do many of his top officials: Pete Navarro, a trade adviser who's tipped for promotion, has hawkish views. So does Harry Harris, the president's pick for ambassador to Australia. Still, some advisers thought the president should take it slow. Aides huddled behind closed doors and in a hallway on Thursday morning, and the president's announcement was postponed. The scheduling conflict reflected a bigger clash: a fight between hardliners and those who approach trade in a more cautious manner. Meanwhile, the boss was right where he liked to be: in the eye of the storm, and everyone was waiting for him to speak. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freedland said any tariffs would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" The European Union""will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Chinahad already said it would consider retaliatory measures against the US A spokesman for US Speaker of the HousePaul Ryansaid he hoped the president ""will consider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forward"" The US Department of Energy says the industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis. But it is an industry significantly weaker than it was at the turn of the millennium. In the year 2000, the US produced112m tonsof steel - a figure that had fallen to86.5mtons in 2016. In 2000,135,000 peoplewere employed in the industry - a figure that fell to83,600in 2016. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News business reporter, New York The threat of tariffs on steel and aluminium has hovered around the Trump administration for months, with delays making the president vulnerable to criticism that he is all bark and no bite, despite his America First message. He's now silenced those mutters and handed a victory to the steel industry. But the chaos surrounding Thursday's announcement - in which advisers apparently hoped to dissuade the president from action - underscores just how many more losers there may be. Dozens of companies in industries from car-making to construction had warned of hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, as higher prices raise costs for steel-dependent sectors such as manufacturing. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis advised that the move would cost the US support among its allies, such as Canada and South Korea. The European Union, Mexico and China have all said they are weighing retaliatory tariffs that would strike politically sensitive industries like agriculture. The last time the US imposed steel tariffs, in 2002, President George W Bush lifted them less than two years later to avoid a damaging trade war. Steel executives told the president on Thursday that they trust his judgement. But if a trade war is the outcome of this decision, as analysts expect, it remains to be seen how many will agree.

"National Grid has said its first ""gas deficit warning"" for eight years will remain in place overnight. The power operator issued the warning earlier, saying it may not have enough gas to meet demand due to the current cold snap gripping the UK. Household supplies should not be affected, but the Grid is attempting to meet demand by limiting industrial use. It said it had already seen an increase in gas supplies as the market responded to its warning that it needed more gas. But a spokeswoman for National Grid said it was ""prudent"" to keep its earlier warning in place. ""We don't have a crystal ball"", she added. Red 'extreme' weather warning extended in UK Live: Travel warnings as more snows falls The National Grid said it had not instructed industrial users to use less gas. ""Any larger users of gas that have reduced their demand will have done so under commercial arrangements with their gas supplier,"" it said. The biggest factor is the weather. The ""beast from the east"" is bringing sub-zero temperatures to the UK and with heavy snow, boosting demand for gas from both households and businesses. The cold weather has added to problems with pipelines from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium. Energy analyst David Hunter of Schneider Electric said the industry no longer has access to the Rough gas storage facility in the North Sea that was closed by Centrica last year due to safety issues. These issues, along with declining supplies from North Sea fields, means the UK is now more reliant on gas imports. Demand is also higher due to the number of gas-fired power stations in the UK as coal-fired power stations are decommissioned. Yes. As energy analyst Peter Atherton says: ""The last to get cut off is the domestic consumer."" If suppliers are not able to meet demand, certain users will be asked to stop using gas, he explains. First gas-fired power stations will be asked to scale down gas use, followed by large industrial and business users. A Department for Business spokesperson said ""domestic households should not notice any disruption to their supply"". A short-term increase in on-the-day wholesale prices is not likely to feed into household bills, the spokesperson added. However, the cold snap has increased the number of requests for call-outs for engineers, British Gas said, which is having difficulty coping with the volume of customer queries. Two of the company's call centres in Scotland have closed due to staff shortages following the cold weather. Chemical company Ineos told the BBC it is likely to cut gas usage at its Runcorn plant by a fifth in response to the National Grid's request. However, the company said it did not expect the move to make a material difference as it gets most of the heat it needs from its own energy-from-waste plant. There was a large spike in trading prices for gas bought on the day on Wednesday, but prices for gas bought a month ahead declined slightly. Big energy suppliers mostly buy at least a month ahead so they can work out pricing for consumers and cut risks to their business. However, they also buy a day ahead, as do large energy users, and some smaller energy suppliers. Jeremy Nicholson, the director of lobbying organisation the Energy Intensive Users Group, said: ""Industrial users typically buy gas linked to the day ahead price in the wholesale market, so the surge in gas prices is hitting them hard. ""We are paying a heavy price to ensure gas continues to flow to the UK in these exceptional conditions.""

Andrew Waring was driving wife Daniella to hospital in ""adverse"" conditions on the A66 near Darlington when the couple realised they would not arrive in time.

""Having been present at the birth of our two other children I just copied what I had seen then. ""I opened the passenger door and knelt in the snow to deliver the baby.""

"This video can not be played Trump on new tariffs: 'We haven't been treated fairly' President Donald Trump is to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports next week, hitting producers like Canada and China. He said steel products face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. The US imports four times more steel than it exports, and is reliant on steel from more than 100 nations. Mr Trump tweeted that the US was suffering from ""unfair trade"". But the move has hit US markets, with the Dow Jones index closing down 1.7%. The value of shares in American steel manufacturers jumped significantly after the announcement. The news is likely to provoke an angry reaction from China, and analysts have expressed fears of the prospect of new trade wars. Key US allies are also at risk of being hit with higher costs, but it is not clear if any countries will be excluded from the new measures. 'A blatant intervention' - trade partners react During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump said that foreign countries were ""dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies"". And since taking office, Mr Trump said cheap imports from China were harming the viability of industry in the US, which is the world's biggest importer of steel. China isn't the only country to export the material to the US - 110 countries and territories do so. AndChina is only the 11th biggest exporter to the US,external- some US allies, including Canada, Japan and South Korea are among the 10 biggest sources of steel for the US, and they all face a big bump in costs. The recommendation to impose tariffs was made in a report,externalby Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. President Trump had asked him to investigate ""whether steel imports threaten to impair the national security"". Mr Trump promised to rebuild the American steel and aluminium industries, which he said had suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular China, for decades. ""When our country can't make aluminium and steel...you almost don't have much of a country,"" he said. ""We need great steel makers, great aluminium makers for defence."" The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 He spoke as Chinese economic adviser Liu He, a friend of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited the White House. Mr Trump's announcement was slightly delayed amid reports of wrangling over the issue among his aides. What would China do in a US trade war? Where Trump stands on world trade More than a dozen metals executives, including representatives from US Steel Corp and Arcelor Mittal, joined him as he made the announcement. But officials from industries that rely on steel use have lobbied against the tariffs as they fear increased costs if they have to use more US-made metals. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter The president wants to be seen as tough on trade and China, and so do many of his top officials: Pete Navarro, a trade adviser who's tipped for promotion, has hawkish views. So does Harry Harris, the president's pick for ambassador to Australia. Still, some advisers thought the president should take it slow. Aides huddled behind closed doors and in a hallway on Thursday morning, and the president's announcement was postponed. The scheduling conflict reflected a bigger clash: a fight between hardliners and those who approach trade in a more cautious manner. Meanwhile, the boss was right where he liked to be: in the eye of the storm, and everyone was waiting for him to speak. Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freedland said any tariffs would be ""absolutely unacceptable"" The European Union""will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Chinahad already said it would consider retaliatory measures against the US A spokesman for US Speaker of the HousePaul Ryansaid he hoped the president ""will consider the unintended consequences of this idea and look at other approaches before moving forward"" The US Department of Energy says the industry is recovering after a slump following the 2008 financial crisis.

"This video can not be played Trump: 'You're afraid of the NRA' US President Donald Trump has stunned lawmakers from both parties by accusing them of being ""petrified"" of the National Rifle Association (NRA). In a break from his party's anti-gun control stance, Mr Trump urged lawmakers during a televised meeting to come up with a ""strong"" reform bill. The NRA said that Mr Trump's remarks ""made for great TV"", but ""would make for bad policy"" if implemented. The US gun debate has been reignited by a deadly school shooting in Florida. ""I want you to come up with a strong bill - and really strong on background checks,"" Mr Trump told lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday, pushing them to work on bipartisan legislation. Major retailers announce new restrictions on gun sales âSpike in school threatsâ after gun rampage In the meeting, which was broadcast live from the White House, Democrats looked gleeful as Mr Trump suggested expanding background checks for gun buyers and raising the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21.

The president also accused Senator Pat Toomey of being ""afraid"" of the NRA, even though the Pennsylvania Republican has worked on a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre occurred, agreed with the president. This video can not be played Trump: 'How is it possible my son is watching this?' He said the NRA has a ""veto power"" over any gun control legislation in Congress. Mr Trump said he had previously told NRA officials: ""It's time. We've got to stop this nonsense. It's time."" Breitbart News, a strident backer of the president, criticised him in a bright red headline that said, ""TRUMP THE GUN GRABBER"". ""Take the guns first, go through due process second,"" Mr Trump said, suggesting police officers be given the power to seize guns from anyone who could pose a threat, including the mentally ill, without a court order. ""We can't wait and play games and nothing gets done,"" he added. He called for tighter restrictions on gun sales to young adults and for background checks to be expanded for all weapons purchases, including at gun shows and online. US gun lobby 'doesn't back any ban' America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump repeatedly stated his support for increasing armed security at schools, arming teachers and reducing ""gun-free zones"". ""It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody can support, as opposed to - you know - 15 bills, everybody's got their own bill,"" Mr Trump said. He also warned lawmakers against proposing a bill that included concealed carry across the US, a provision that Republicans and the NRA have long campaigned to include in any new gun legislation. Mr Trump has already directed his Justice Department to ban bump-stocks, which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. His remarks appeared to catch many Republican lawmakers unawares, especially as the president has previously been vocal about his support for firearms and the gun lobby. The Senate's second most senior Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, who was sitting next to the president, said it was ""fascinating television"" but ""surreal to actually be there"". ""We're not ditching any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn't like them,"" said Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who was not at the meeting. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said the proposed reforms might not have prevented last month's high school attack that left 17 people dead in his state.

How Trump turned against gun control Florida shooting: Who are the victims? #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The man who suggested that if his opponent had been elected ""you'd be handing in your rifles"" endorsed taking guns away from people of questionable mental fitness and worrying about due process later. The man who received $30m in support from the National Rifle Association during his presidential campaign scorned Washington politicians for being afraid of the NRA and said it had ""less power"" over him. After a bipartisan meeting with congressional legislators, Donald Trump left heads spinning. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fierce gun-control advocate, clapped in joy, while some gun-rights Republicans wondered whose side the president was on. Of course, we've seen this film before. In a January meeting with a similar group of congressional leaders, Mr Trump expressed support for any comprehensive bipartisan agreement on immigration. In the following days and weeks, his administration did everything it could to undermine the most popular compromise bill. Gun-control supporters may feel they made progress in Wednesday's White House meeting, but the NRA surely will have another chance at the president's ear.

"Bill Gates had previously spoken enthusiastically about Bitcoin Crypto-currencies are killing people in a ""fairly direct way"", Microsoft founder Bill Gates has said. He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl. In an ""ask me anything"" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering. Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology. Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: ""The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. ""Right now, crypto-currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and crypto-currencies is super risky for those who go long."" There are now some high-profile names cautioning against crypto-currency investment Veteran investor Warren Buffet has previously said that the speculative crypto-currency craze ""will come to a bad end"". Mr Gates has not always been so cynical about Bitcoin. In 2014, in an interviewon Bloomberg TV,,externalhe said that Bitcoin ""was better than currency"". His less than enthusiastic response on Reddit did not go down well with all those participating in the debate, with some reproaching him for what they felt was an attempt to influence the market. Others suggested that he needed to look again at the Bitcoin white paper. In the wide-ranging Reddit chat, Mr Gates told the audience that his top three goals were ""reducing both childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio"". Mr Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which spends billions each year on education and health projects. The foundation has also sponsored the development of blockchain - the technology that underpins crypto-currenices - for merchants in Kenya. Microsoft is also looking to integrate blockchain-based technology for verifying digital identity. The rise in value of crypto-currency has prompted governments around the world to look more closely at its impact on economies and citizens. While the technology underlying it is often praised, there are concerns about how it could disrupt the economy as well as its links to cyber-crime and money laundering.

"As the UK and the wider European continent shivers, the Arctic has witnessed some spectacularly high temperatures in recent days, some 30 degrees above average in places. Such a topsy-turvy picture inevitably has people wondering if this isn't some kind of fallout from global warming. But, as ever, meteorologists will not conflate single events with more longer-term trends. The UK Met Office, for example, is adamant that what is occurring now should be regarded as part of the natural ups and downs we get in our weather. The current cold snap is likely to have had its origins in the tropical Pacific, believe it or not, and something called the Madden-Julian Oscillation. In pictures: Snow persists in UK Follow live updates here Icy blizzards hit Europe transport systems It's snowing - can I refuse to come to work? This is a short-timescale variation, on the order of weeks, in the pattern of thunderstorms in the region. This looks to have set in train some disturbances that resulted in a sudden warming a few tens of kilometres up in the atmosphere(a Sudden Stratospheric Warming). This disruption worked to pull in temperate air over Canada and Greenland and the wider Arctic basin, but also put a block on the jet stream - ribbons of strong winds that move weather around the globe - moving across the Atlantic. The jet stream actually broke down over Scandinavia, leading to cold air sweeping in from Siberia towards Western Europe. In the western parts of the UK there are now Red Warnings in operationas Storm Emma moves up from the south. This weather system is pushing moisture ahead of it, and whenever cold air confronts moisture there is the chance for heavy snow. So meteorologists can describe all these events in an almost mechanical way. And it is a salute to the skill of modern forecasting that the possibility of what we're experiencing now was seen in the data well over a week ago. The experts couldn't be sure the cold snap would play out like it has, but they knew they had to start talking about it and raising awareness. However, all this is a long way from linking the specifics of what we're seeing to trends that become apparent over decades, which you have to do for a judgement about climate change. Arctic sea ice is low this winter All that said, the Arctic generally is warming faster than the rest of the globe, and the temperature anomalies in recent days have been extreme. And once again, Arctic sea-ice - that oft-quoted canary of climate change - is very low this winter. There is an interesting and growing body of research which suggests that a reduced differential between polar and mid-latitude temperatures (where summer temperatures rarely go above 40C, and winters are usually fairly mild) could eventually make for more bumpy weather like we're having now. It is widely debated but is sure to continue to be a very active line of study.

"Peter Wrighton's body was found near Fiveways Junction, three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk A former commando who killed a vulnerable 83-year-old dog walker in a ""savage"" attack has been jailed for at least 28 years. Alexander Palmer, 24, attacked Peter Wrighton from behind, stabbing him 45 times before dumping his body under brambles in Norfolk last August. Police initially concluded Mr Wrighton had been killed by an animal due to the severity of his injuries. Palmer, who had denied murder, was given a life sentence. Sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court, Mr Justice Goose said: ""Your offence was substantially aggravated in its seriousness, firstly by the fact that there was a significant degree of planning and of pre-meditation for this murder. ""Secondly the victim was particularly vulnerable, being aged 83 and alone. Thirdly by the extent of the savage violence you used to kill him. ""You took a knife and drove to the scene for the sole purpose of murder."" The judge added: ""You attacked the deceased for no other reason than he was walking his dogs. At the age of 83 and slightly-built he was no match for the violence of your attack."" Mr Wrighton's children, Andrew Wrighton and Carol Todd, watched from the public gallery as Palmer was taken down to the cells. Alexander Palmer denied murder, but admitted to being in the area at the time of the attack Palmer's parents were also in court as he repeatedly mouthed the words ""I love you"" towards them before he was told his minimum term. David Spens QC, defending, said: ""He was suffering from a mental disorder at the time. There is plenty of evidence that he was psychotic. ""The assault on him by a fellow trainee commander back in 2014 appears to have precipitated his mental disorder. There was not any evidence of any aggressive conduct previously."" Although Palmer is now taking prescribed anti-psychotic medication, he was not taking any at the time of the killing, Mr Spens added. Mr Wrighton's daughter Carole Todd said on Wednesday she was concerned at mental health failures In a statement given after the guilty verdict on Wednesday, Ms Todd said her family had been failed by mental health professionals. She said: ""The revelations of the evidence relating to the mental health of Alexander Palmer have shocked, astounded and angered us. ""We feel this should not have happened and mental health professionals failed him, his family and our family."" Det Supt Marina Ericson described Palmer, of Freesia Way, Cringleford, as a ""dangerous individual"". Palmer's parents were also in court as he repeatedly mouthed the words ""I love you"" towards them before he was told his minimum term Ms Ericson, who led the inquiry, said Palmer was ""callous and extremely calculated in his approach to Peter's death"". ""Officers first on the scene described the incident as an animal attack and I think that description is still accurate,"" she said. ""Palmer is a dangerous individual who was truly animalistic in his actions."" A serious case review into the involvement of police, mental health services and other agencies with Palmer prior to the killing is under way.

"Bright is one of the Netflix shows that will be available to Sky Q subscribers Sky will make Netflix available through its latest box in an attempt to tackle the threat posed by the popular streaming service. The satellite broadcaster will allow viewers to watch Netflix shows on its Sky Q platform later this year. Customers will pay for Netflix as part of their Sky bill, although prices have not yet been announced. Sky said the move would make the entertainment experience ""easier and simpler"" for customers. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said the partnership would allow Sky subscribers to seamlessly access the best entertainment in one place. The streaming service's mix of original drama, films and other programming has proved popular globally, with subscriber numbers reaching nearly 118 million at the end of 2017. While pay-TV rival Virgin Media has offered Netflix to its customers for some time, Sky has regarded it as an ""existential threat to its service"", said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders. ""It has inconvenienced its subscribers, who are more likely to have Netflix than those without pay-TV, because it has believed that its content was strong and exclusive enough to justify operating a walled garden,"" he said. ""It seems as if that confidence has subsided and bringing a competitor on board - one that could potentially satisfy Sky's subscribers for a much lower price - is a risky move that cannot now be backed away from,  but at least is a sure source of shared revenues."" The deal comes as US media giant Comcast threatens to derail Rupert Murdoch's attempt to take full control of Sky. This week the owner of NBC Universal made aÂ£22.1bn bid for the European satellite broadcaster, challenging a lower offer from 21st Century Fox.

"This video can not be played Will you miss the old Â£10 note? Bank of England paper Â£10 notes are being accepted in shops for a final day before being officially withdrawn. The Charles Darwin notes have been gradually replaced by the polymer Jane Austen notesince September. From Friday, anyone with the banknote will need to deposit it at their bank as shops will be entitled to refuse it. At the same time, a collection of new 10p coins featuring 26 designs celebrating Britain - from cricket to queuing - are entering circulation. Officially, any bank, building society or retailer is within their rights to refuse an old paper Â£10 note from Friday. Only the Bank of England in London will accept them forever. Yet all the major banks and the Post Office have said they will continue to accept deposits of these notes, featuring the portrait of naturalist Charles Darwin, from their own customers. They have been under pressure to do so from the Federation of Small Businesses, which said this would help get the older versions out of circulation quicker. At the last count, the Bank of England estimates that 211 million of these old notes are unreturned. This video can not be played New tenner designed for easier identification The launch of the polymer Jane Austen Â£10 note came after a four-month period when women, apart from the Queen, were not represented on the Bank's notes. The previous one was the Â£5 note featuring reformer Elizabeth Fry, which was replaced by a Winston Churchill fiver - a decision that led to a campaign to redress the lack of balance. A new polymer Â£20 featuring artist JMW Turner is due to be issued by the Bank of England in 2020. There are no plans to replace the current Â£50 note, the last remaining paper note from the Bank of England, which was released in 2011. Entered circulation in November 2000 The note features HMS Beagle, on which Darwin was employed as a young man, along with an illustration of his magnifying lens, and flora and fauna that he may have come across on his travels Inflation has reduced its value since 2000 to the equivalent of Â£6.17 now It is bigger than its replacement note This video can not be played Famous Faces, Duly Noted The note was issued last year, coinciding with the 200th anniversary of Jane Austen's death Two clusters of bumps are used to allow blind and partially-sighted people to feel which note it is - a first for the UK This is the Bank's second polymer note, despite complaints from religious and vegan groups that the animal fat tallow is used in the production process It is signed by the Bank's chief cashier, Victoria Cleland British currency is also changing as a new series of 10p coin designs have now started to enter circulation. A total of 2.6 million coins have been struck, each of which will have one of 26 designs aimed at celebrating British life. Each of the new designs for the 10p coin There is a design for each letter of the alphabet, from the Angel of the North to the Zebra Crossing, including fish and chips, the Loch Ness Monster and James Bond among others. Anne Jessopp, chief executive at The Royal Mint, which is producing the coins, said: ""These designs were selected because we feel they represent a diverse mix of elements that make up the country we all love."" Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said: ""This is a departure from the standard way in which The Royal Mint has celebrated what is great about Britain in the past. We have marked great events, celebrated engineers, politicians and of course royalty. ""This [is] the granularity of British life celebrated on the coinage."" The collection even includes a celebration of queuing The full list of the new 10p coins is as follows: A - Angel of the North B - Bondâ¦James Bond C - Cricket D - Double Decker Bus E - English Breakfast F - Fish & Chips G - Greenwich Mean Time H - Houses of Parliament I - Ice-Cream Cone J - Jubilee K - King Arthur L - Loch Ness Monster M - Mackintosh N - National Health Service O - Oak Tree P - Post Box Q - Queuing R - Robin S - Stonehenge T - Teapot U - Union Flag V - Village W - World Wide Web X - X Marks the Spot Y - Yeoman Z - Zebra Crossing Will you miss the old Â£10 note?

"Ken Livingstone's suspension from Labour over anti-Semitism claims has been extended pending the outcome of an internal investigation. The former London mayor's suspension had been due to expire on 27 April. But Labour's outgoing general secretary, Iain McNicol, has signed off on an extended extension. Mr Livingstone is facing an internal investigation into his conduct after refusing to apologise for statements he made about Adolf Hitler and Zionism. Labour's general secretary resigns Fresh probe into Livingstone remarks Mr McNicol announced he was standing down as Labour's general secretary on Friday after a ""tumultuous seven years"". Labour sources denied claims by the Huffington Post, which broke the story, the decision to extend Mr Livingstone's suspension was Mr McNicol's last official act. They said the decision had been taken by National Executive Committee members and although the letter informing Mr Livingstone of the decision had been sent in Mr McNicol's name it had not been the result of a unilateral decision taken by the outgoing general secretary. Mr Livingstone was suspended for a year in April 2016 over his claim that Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s. Jon Lansman is launching a bid to be Labour general secretary He was suspended for a further 12 months in April last year after a Labour disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules, prompting Jeremy Corbyn to order a fresh internal inquiry into his conduct. This has reportedly yet to get under way, with the deadline approaching for Mr Livingstone to be re-admitted to the party. Labour sources say the investigation will go before the party's disputes panel, which may refer Mr Livingstone to the party's National Constitutional Committee for possible disciplinary action or decide no further action is necessary. A Labour spokeswoman confirmed: ""Ken Livingstone has been administratively suspended from the Labour Party, pending the outcome of an internal party investigation. ""That suspension starts on the date that his membership suspension applied by the National Constitutional Committee ends on 27 April 2018."" Some Labour MPs and Jewish groups have criticised the decision not to expel Mr Livingstone, but the former Labour MP said he had been ""suspended for stating the truth"". Labour MP Wes Streeting, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Jews,told the Huffington Post,externalthe decision to extend Mr Livingstone's suspension was ""long overdue"". ""Almost a year has passed since Jeremy Corbyn announced that Mr Livingstone's conduct would be subject to further investigation with seemingly little action by the NEC."" He said Mr Livingstone should be expelled for his ""gratuitously offensive remarks"" and ""his lack of remorse"" - and urged the NEC to take tougher action against ""anti-Semites and their apologists infesting the Labour Party"". The battle to replace Mr McNicol as general secretary has, meanwhile, intensified with the founder of Momentum - the grassroots movement supporting Jeremy Corbyn - throwing his hat into the ring. In a statement on Twitter, Jon Lansman said he was applying to ""open up the contest"" and ensure there was a wide range of candidates. Mr Lansman, a key ally of the Labour leader, said if elected he would ""stay tuned to the desires"" of the party's members and trade union affiliates, ""work hard to strengthen Labour's trade union link"" and make sure the party ""really delivered for the many not the few"". An official with the Unite union, Jennie Formby, has already announced that she is standing and is reported to be favoured by Mr Corbyn. Jon Lansman set up Momentum to support and sustain Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, but the Labour leader isn't returning the favour - he would prefer Jennie Formby to be the next general secretary. She's a close personal and political ally of Unite's leader Len McCluskey and the union has been arguing that the post should go to a woman. Mr Corbyn's aides feared Mr Lansman's candidacy would split the left of the party and tried strenuously to prevent it. So Jon Lansman then suggested that a woman candidate might stand in his place. He had in mind Laura Parker - a Momentum official who  had previously worked for Mr Corbyn. The leadership were firm that Jennie Formby was their choice and Ms Parker didn't throw her hat in the ring. Today Mr Lansman declared his own candidacy - despite a further direct plea from Jeremy Corbyn to abandon the plan. Privately, the Momentum leader has complained about ""a stitch-up"". Publicly, he says he wants the process of appointing the party's top official opened up. Labour's ruling national executive will make its choice later this month.

"Culture Secretary Matt Hancock has said the government will not implement the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry. The inquiry, set up by David Cameron after the phone hacking scandal, was due to examine relations between journalists and the police. But Mr Hancock said the ""world had changed"" since Leveson's 2012 report and the press had cleaned up its act. Labour's Tom Watson said the decision was a ""bitter blow to the victims of press intrusion"". Mr Hancock also announced that the government would not put Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act - which would force media organisations to pay legal costs of libel cases whether they won or lost - into effect and said they would seek repeal ""at the earliest opportunity"". Lords vote for second stage Leveson probe Labour 'won't accept' more Mosley money The Conservatives opposed Leveson part two in their general election manifesto but peers voted to revive it last month through an amendment to the Data Protection Bill currently going through Parliament. In a Commons statement, Mr Hancock said: ""We do not believe that this costly and time-consuming public inquiry is the right way forward."" Labour's deputy leader and media spokesman Tom Watson said the newspapers had been ""lobbying hard"" for this outcome and that Mr Hancock would get ""plaudits"" in Friday's leader columns. Mr Watson claimed the newspapers had ""helped write"" the culture secretary's statement and accused Mr Hancock of failing to ""stand up to the tabloid-style newspapers who are propping up this government"". He also defended privacy campaigner Max Mosley, who is facing questions in the Daily Mail and The Sun about a racist leaflet published in the early 1960s. ""If I thought for one moment he held those views, contained in that leaflet of 57 years ago, I would not have given him the time of day. ""He is a man, though, who in the face of great family tragedy and overwhelming media intimidation, chose to use his limited resources to support the weak against the strong."" Mr Mosley has donated about Â£500,000 to Mr Watson's office and has said his family money has been used to back official media regulator Impress, set up in the wake of Leveson. The Labour Party has said it will not accept further donations from him. Mr Hancock accused Mr Watson of being ""tied up with the opponents of press freedom"" and said Labour's proposals would ""would lead to a press that is fettered and not free"". The culture secretary told MPs ""there were far too many cases of terrible behaviour"" by the press and ""over 40 people were convicted"" following police investigations. But he said there have been changes to the behaviour of the press and the procedures of the police since the Leveson Report was published in 2012. The media landscape had been through ""seismic change"" in recent years, with falling circulations, local newspapers closing and the rise of ""clickbait"" and ""fake news"" on social media, he told MPs. Asked what his message would be to the victims of press intrusion, Mr Hancock said the media industry had to be allowed to ""hold the powerful to account and respond to today's challenges"", adding that changes advocated by Leveson would ""make those challenges harder"". Mr Hancock told MPs the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) - set up by the UK's main newspaper groups as an alternative to Impress - had ""largely complied with Leveson's recommendations"". Lord Justice Leveson was appointed in 2011 to carry out an inquiry into press standards, following the phone-hacking scandal. In his original terms of reference, it was envisaged the inquiry would be split into two parts. The first, looking at the culture and practices of the press and relations between politicians, press and the police, took place in 2011 and 2012, with a full report in November 2012. The second part was scheduled to consider the extent of improper conduct and governance failings by individual newspaper groups, how these were investigated by the police and whether police officers received corrupt payments or inducements.

"The threat level from Northern Ireland-related terrorism has been reduced from substantial to moderate in mainland Britain, MI5 says. The new level means that an attack is considered possible but unlikely. It is the second lowest rating. The reduction applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The threat level in Northern Ireland remains severe, where an attack is considered highly likely. The threat from international terrorism also remains at severe. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""Despite the change which has been made today, there remains a real and serious threat against the United Kingdom from terrorism,"" and she urged the public to be vigilant. In a statement, Ms Rudd said the threat level was set independently of government by security services, who consider ""capability, intent and timescale"".

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk joked that his journey was 'not frictionless' Donald Tusk has said Theresa May needs to come up with ""a better idea"" than the EU's controversial plan to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. The PM has rejected keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's customs area saying this would split the UK in two. But the European Council president said one of the ""possible negative consequences"" of the kind of Brexit Mrs May wants would be a hard border. The two met in No 10 ahead of a big Brexit speech on Friday by Mrs May. Mrs May, who chaired a meeting of the cabinet before her talks with Mr Tusk, has already pledged not to accept the draft withdrawal treaty published on Wednesday by the EU.

An EU source said the main focus had been the nature of the UK and EU's future relationship and that all the EU's remaining members supported its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The UK and the EU agree on wanting to avoid a return to a physical border - with border posts and checks - in Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested new IT systems could be introduced to avoid the need for physical border checks but has yet to spell out how this would work in practice. But the draft EU treaty also includes the option of a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found.

And he said Mrs May's decision to rule out membership of the single market and customs union had been acknowledged ""without enthusiasm and without satisfaction"".

Mr Barnier has also been addressing the issue in a speech at the business conference in Brussels. As a result of the UK's stated negotiation red lines, he said, the only option remaining was a free trade agreement in the vein of the deals the EU already has with other third countries. He dismissed hopes of a ""mutual recognition"" arrangement on trade standards, saying this was impossible because of the UK's refusal to accept European Court of Justice oversight. And in a message to other EU leaders, he said the ""economic benefits of staying together"" were ""far bigger"" than any negative knock-on impact from Brexit. Mr Barnier also said Northern Ireland was a ""sensitive"" issue and that the problem was down to the UK's decision to leave the single market and customs union.

"At one point, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year The Home Office says it is considering allowing a medical cannabis trial to treat a six-year-old boy with a rare form of epilepsy. It previously turned down requests by the family of Alfie Dingley, from Warwickshire, tolegally take the drug. But now ministers say they are ""exploring every option"", following a meeting with the family. An option could be a three-month trial, led by Alfie's doctors and based on ""sufficient and rigorous evidence"". Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, described the move as a ""lifeline"". This video can not be played Hannah Deacon tells Victoria Derbyshire ""I'm tired of seeing my son suffer"" However the Home Office has stressed that ""no decisions have been made"". Alfie, from Kenilworth, can suffer up to 30 violent seizures a day. Midlands Live: Snow and ice causing major disruption; A&E at tipping point after consultant quits Ms Deacon took him to the Netherlands to take a cannabis-based medication in September and said, while there, his seizures reduced in number, duration and severity. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Deacon said: ""We're very positive that [the Home Office] have given us this lifeline. I think they see what a serious issue we have here."" She described witnessing the seizures as ""the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life."" ""I'm his mum, I'm not a politician, not an activist, I'm just a mum tired of seeing him suffer and I've found something that helps him. ""It's his human right to be well."" Alfie's condition is very rare, affecting only nine boys in the world Home Office Policing Minister Nick Hurd MP met with the family on Monday. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The Government has a huge amount of sympathy for the rare and difficult situation that Alfie and his family are faced with. ""The Policing Minister wants to explore every option and has met with Alfie's family to discuss treatments that may be accessible for him. ""No decisions have been made and any proposal would need to be led by senior clinicians using sufficient and rigorous evidence."" Ms Deacon described the plan as a ""sincere offer because they want to help us"". Nick Hurd wants to ""explore every option"" for Alfie's treatment Members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on drug policy reform are calling on the government to assist with Alfie's plight. Group co-chair, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said: ""It would be heartless and cruel not to allow Alfie to access the medication.""

"Peter Wrighton's body was found near Fiveways Junction, three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk A former commando who killed a vulnerable 83-year-old dog walker in a ""savage"" attack has been jailed for at least 28 years. Alexander Palmer, 24, attacked Peter Wrighton from behind, stabbing him 45 times before dumping his body under brambles in Norfolk last August. Police initially concluded Mr Wrighton had been killed by an animal due to the severity of his injuries. Palmer, who had denied murder, was given a life sentence. Sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court, Mr Justice Goose said: ""Your offence was substantially aggravated in its seriousness, firstly by the fact that there was a significant degree of planning and of pre-meditation for this murder. ""Secondly the victim was particularly vulnerable, being aged 83 and alone. Thirdly by the extent of the savage violence you used to kill him. ""You took a knife and drove to the scene for the sole purpose of murder."" The judge added: ""You attacked the deceased for no other reason than he was walking his dogs. At the age of 83 and slightly-built he was no match for the violence of your attack."" Mr Wrighton's children, Andrew Wrighton and Carol Todd, watched from the public gallery as Palmer was taken down to the cells. Alexander Palmer denied murder, but admitted to being in the area at the time of the attack Palmer's parents were also in court as he repeatedly mouthed the words ""I love you"" towards them before he was told his minimum term. David Spens QC, defending, said: ""He was suffering from a mental disorder at the time. There is plenty of evidence that he was psychotic. ""The assault on him by a fellow trainee commander back in 2014 appears to have precipitated his mental disorder. There was not any evidence of any aggressive conduct previously."" Although Palmer is now taking prescribed anti-psychotic medication, he was not taking any at the time of the killing, Mr Spens added. Mr Wrighton's daughter Carole Todd said on Wednesday she was concerned at mental health failures In a statement given after the guilty verdict on Wednesday, Ms Todd said her family had been failed by mental health professionals. She said: ""The revelations of the evidence relating to the mental health of Alexander Palmer have shocked, astounded and angered us. ""We feel this should not have happened and mental health professionals failed him, his family and our family."" Det Supt Marina Ericson described Palmer, of Freesia Way, Cringleford, as a ""dangerous individual"". Palmer's parents were also in court as he repeatedly mouthed the words ""I love you"" towards them before he was told his minimum term Ms Ericson, who led the inquiry, said Palmer was ""callous and extremely calculated in his approach to Peter's death"". ""Officers first on the scene described the incident as an animal attack and I think that description is still accurate,"" she said. ""Palmer is a dangerous individual who was truly animalistic in his actions."" A serious case review into the involvement of police, mental health services and other agencies with Palmer prior to the killing is under way.

"The threat level from Northern Ireland-related terrorism has been reduced from substantial to moderate in mainland Britain, MI5 says. The new level means that an attack is considered possible but unlikely. It is the second lowest rating. The reduction applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The threat level in Northern Ireland remains severe, where an attack is considered highly likely. The threat from international terrorism also remains at severe. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""Despite the change which has been made today, there remains a real and serious threat against the United Kingdom from terrorism,"" and she urged the public to be vigilant. In a statement, Ms Rudd said the threat level was set independently of government by security services, who consider ""capability, intent and timescale"".

"Carpetright has issued its second profit warning this year and said it is in talks with its banks. The retailer said conditions since January had ""remained difficult"" due to ""continued weak consumer confidence"". Shares in Carpetright plunged more than a quarter following the warning, valuing the firm at just under Â£39m. The company said it was in talks with its banks to ensure it complies with their lending terms, adding the banks ""currently remain fully supportive"". Carpetright warned in January that its full-year profits would be between Â£2m and Â£4m compared with previous expectations of Â£14m. While like-for-like sales - a key measure of underlying performance - have improved since then, Carpetright said they remained negative. Despite the upcoming key Easter trading period, Carpetright said that it now expected to report a small underlying pre-tax loss for the year to 28 April. Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail Toys R Us UK goes into administration As well as discussions with its banks, Carpetright said it was also examining ""a range of options to accelerate the turnaround of the business and strengthen its balance sheet"". It added the process remained at an early stage. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said it could be forced to close some underperforming stores. ""The question is whether Carpetright is just on the wrong end of a cyclical slowdown, or whether there is a deeper structural problem facing this business: the answer is probably some of both,"" he said.

"This video can not be played President Putin introduced video of a missile launch in 2018 Russia has developed a new array of nuclear weapons that are invincible, according to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin made the claims as he laid out his key policies for a fourth presidential term, ahead of an election he is expected to win in 17 days' time. The weapons he boasted of included a cruise missile that he said could ""reach anywhere in the world"". He said of the West: ""They need to take account of a new reality and understand ... [this]... is not a bluff."" Giving his annual state of the nation speech, Mr Putin used video presentations to showcase the development of two new nuclear delivery systems that he said could evade detection. One video graphic appeared to show missiles raining down on the US state of Florida. Why would Putin want to nuke Florida? One system Mr Putin described included a ""low-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defence and air defence"". Another was a submarine-launched, long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Police accused of 'Putin graffiti campaign' Russian in jail for giant duck protest During the two-hour televised speech to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament, he said the weapons were a response to US development of its missile defence system. The US State Department said it was ""certainly unfortunate to have watched the video animation that depicted a nuclear attack on the United States"" - adding that it was not ""the behaviour of a responsible international player"". Mr Putin faces seven challengers on 18 March, although none is expected to attract widespread support. The president played no part in a raucous televised debate broadcast on Wednesday that featured the other candidates. Absent from the campaign is prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running and has called on voters to boycott the poll. President Putin has so far done little campaigning, and until now has said little about his plans for the next six years. By Steven Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Before today, Vladimir Putin had delivered 13 state of the nation addresses. Address Number 14 turned out to be very different from anything that had come before. Standing in front of a giant video screen, President Putin showcased Russia's very latest strategic weapons. Like a magician pulling one rabbit after another out of his hat, he wowed his audience with images of cruise missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, underwater drones and supersonic jets. Russian MPs and senators applauded the military video show, which dominated the second half of President Putin's speech. There was a double message here. Firstly, to the West: don't push us. And, with elections coming up, there was this for the Russian people: Vote for Putin and you'll be voting for national security. I suspect the concluding image was designed to reinforce just that: as Vladimir Putin stood to the national anthem, a giant Russian flag appeared on the video screen behind him. It is a message that is likely to strike a chord with many here. Mr Putin tailored the first half of his speech towards working Russians and their concerns. He pledged to halve poverty in the country within the next six years and said he wanted life-expectancy rates to emulate Japan and France. It was Mr Putin's last speech before the election ""Every person matters to us,"" he said, adding that he also wanted to increase employment and longevity. In 2000 there were 42 million people in Russia living below the poverty line, he noted; today there were 20 million, but this still needed to come down. He warned Russians not to take the country's power for granted. ""Russia is now a leading country with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential,"" he said. ""But from the point of view of the extremely important task of ensuring people's quality of life and welfare we, of course, have not achieved the level we require. But we have to do this and will do this,"" he added to applause. Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Mr Putin also pledged to spend more on roads and reduce accidents; said teachers deserved good salaries and wages; and said there should be better access to both the internet and medical services for people in remote areas. One of the video graphics appeared to show missiles dropping on the US state of Florida Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent President Putin's emphasis on a strong Russia modernising its nuclear arsenal is a reflection of similar statements over recent months from his US counterpart Donald Trump. In his remarks, Mr Putin highlighted the development of two new nuclear delivery systems, which, he said, could evade US anti-ballistic missile defences. This is essentially because neither of them are ballistic missiles, which are fired out of the atmosphere in a high-arcing trajectory. One - effectively a very long-range nuclear-tipped torpedo - has been rumoured to be under development since Soviet days but is now seen by US analysts as a credible threat. The second system - described by Mr Putin as a cruise missile - looks to be more of a work in progress and may be a kind of very high-speed ""hypersonic"" system - described by one arms control expert as a ""glider on steroids"" - that again could evade existing anti-missile defences. China and the US are also working on similar systems of their own. Digital growth was also essential, Mr Putin said during his speech. He said he wanted Russia to become one of the world's main hubs for storing and processing big data. Graphics - including this one on Russia's working-age population (in millions) - flashed up throughout He called for more progress in making robots and artificial intelligence. New talent in technology should be nurtured and foreigners should be encouraged to study in Russia, he said. Mr Putin also spoke of Russian operations in Syria - supporting the Assad government's fight against rebels - which, he said, showed off the country's increased defence capabilities. Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? The Russian guns for hire dying in Syria Syria war: Putin's Russian mission accomplished Russia recently sent two of its most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, to Syria, even though they are still undergoing tests. There was no confirmation that Russia's new stealth fighters have been used in combat in Syria Mr Putin also announced that a bridge to the Crimean peninsula would be open within the next couple of months.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, during Mr Putin's current term in office. Russia was safeguarding its interest in the Arctic region by strengthening its military infrastructure in the region, he said.

"Daniel Ek co-founded Swedish streaming company Spotify in 2006 Spotify has filed to list on the New York Stock Exchange in a move that may value the world's biggest music streaming service at more than $23bn (Â£16.7bn). In an unconventional move, the firm will list shares directly on the NYSE. Rather than issue new shares, Spotify's existing shareholders will take their shares directly to the market. That will allow early investors and employees to sell their stakes and is not intended to raise new funding. Mark Mulligan, a UK-based music industry analyst at MIDiA Research, said: ""It's about a company that is letting its investors get their returns so it can move on to the next stage of its career."" Spotify has offered a streaming service since 2008 and has 159 million monthly active users including 71 million paid subscribers globally. Apple Music has about 36 million subscribers, but unlike Spotify it does not offer a free tier supported by advertising. What Spotify must do to survive How bands are escaping the music industry snake pit The fact that Spotify exists at all is something of a minor miracle: unknown Swedish company convinces major record labels to upload millions upon millions of songs for people to listen to without buying them. It must have been quite the pitch. Sure, the labels get royalties but it's pennies - fractions of pennies - on what they used to get from ""traditional"" online sales. Regardless, it's been clear for a long time that streaming is the music industry's future. On Wednesday, Spotify announced it would go public - but that's not to say it is here to stay. The company has long been surrounded by threats, and it's no different today. Apple, Amazon and Google are also in the streaming game and - unlike Spotify - all sell devices on which consumers can listen to music. And while Spotify has signed deals with all the ""big three"" record labels - Warner, Universal and Sony - it's the music executives that still hold the bargaining chips. Read more from Dave Lee here Spotify said its shares sold for between $37.50 and $125 each in private transactions last year and more than $132 this year. The company's potential valuation is based on a combination of stock price and how many shares it has outstanding. The prices shared by Spotify suggest a range of $6.3bn to more than $23bn. The higher figure would make Spotify one of the biggest public debuts of a tech company since 2012, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and manages exchange traded funds focused on new public companies. She cautioned, however, that private investors have tended to value firms more highly than public markets in recent years. Snap, owner of Snapchat, for example also had an almost $30bn market capitalisation afterits first day of tradinglast year, but it has struggled to sustain that figure. ""This could be an issue - could it possibly sustain those valuations?"" she said. UK pop star Dua Lipa was one of Spotify's most-streamed artists this year In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,external, Spotify said it has made annual losses every year and lost more than â¬1.2bn in losses in 2017. However, revenues rose almost 40% to â¬4bn last year, according to the filing. Europe is its largest region, with 58 million monthly active users, followed by North America. It is also making inroads in Latin America and other parts of the world. Churn rates, which measure cancellation, have fallen, while the time spent using the service has increased. ""All of that stuff paint a really strong story to investors that they're on the right path,"" Mr Mulligan said. In its filing, Spotify says it aims to ""unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators."" The firm said it had paid more than â¬8bn in royalties to artists, music labels, and publishers since its launch. The filing also hinted at plans to expand beyond music into other forms of radio. ""With our ad-supported service, we believe there is a large opportunity to grow users and gain market share from traditional terrestrial radio,"" it said.

"Snow ploughs are working to clear the M80 but conditions on the road remain extremely poor People have been urged not to travel as an amber alert for snow remains in place for much of Scotland. About 1,000 vehicles were stuck on the M80 motorway overnight, with 300 still there on Thursday morning. Some motorists spent 18 hours on the road before the carriageway was finally cleared on Thursday afternoon. However, Police Scotland have advised people not to travel during the amber warning period, which runs until 10:00 on Friday morning. Emergency crews battled throughout Thursday to clear the M80 outside Glasgow, a job made more difficult by the number of abandoned vehicles. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted that all but 10 cars had been removed from the road by about 15:00, and it reopened fully after 17:00. This video can not be played Car has near miss with bus in Edinburgh However, with conditions still difficult and a Met Office amber weather warning still in place, motorists have again been urged not to travel unless absolutely necessary. A red warning of potential risk to life expired at 10:00 on Thursday, but roads across the country remain treacherous. Traffic Scotland said ""numerous routes"" across the country were ""experiencing snow blowing off the fields reducing visibility and leaving drifts"". The vast majority of ScotRail services are still cancelled, but the rail operator is now running a ""very small number"" of trains in the central belt. None will run after 19:00, and the firm warned that there will be no services in the worst-hit areas on Friday morning while lines are tested. Live updates from the second day of snow disruption Stranded M80 driver praises generous locals 'Hero' drivers get staff to hospitals BBC journalist's brush with the Beast from the East What's behind the UK's freezing weather? Most buses in the central belt have also been cancelled and Glasgow Subway services will end at 19:00, but Edinburgh trams are running. About 200 people spent the night at Glasgow Airport, where all flights have been cancelled for the rest of the day. The airport said it hoped to reopen on Friday morning, depending on the weather. However, it said there would be continued disruption and urged passengers to only travel after checking on the status of their flight. Some flights went ahead at Edinburgh Airport on Thursday, but these have now finished and bosses urged passengers not to come to the airport, saying airlines were ""currently assessing their plans for tomorrow"". Some vehicles were stranded on the M80 for several hours More than 1,600 schools across the country are closed - with the vast majority expected to also be shut on Friday. Parents shouldcheck their local council websitesfor details. Elsewhere, the Scottish Conservatives havecancelled their conference, which had been due to open in Aberdeen on Friday. Speaking at Holyrood, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon delivered a blunt warning to haulage firms, saying there were far more lorries on the roads than there should have been during the worst of the wintry conditions, and paid tribute to the work of the emergency services. She said: ""I saw some branded HGVs in pictures yesterday and given the branding on them I would struggle to say that their transport was unavoidable."" Ms Sturgeon stressed: ""The advice today for the general public remains do not travel unless it is unavoidable. ""And let me be very clear what that means. While everything possible will be done to keep roads clear and open, if you do travel during this period you do face significant risk of encountering blocked roads and possibly becoming stranded."" It's snowing - Can I refuse to go to work? However, Brian Kenny of the Road Haulage Association told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive programme that the first minister had ""missed the point"". He said: ""Most of these HGVs were trying to get back to a safe haven."" This video can not be played 'I brought pizza to stranded divers' Fresh heavy snow fell in many places overnight, with the Met Office saying some areas of Scotland saw up to 30cm (11.8 inches) of snow fall and up to 40cm (15.7 inches) in ""a few places"" by mid-morning. Emergency services spent the night battling to keep vehicles moving on the roads, with a particular focus on the M80, which runs between Glasgow and Stirling. The road became blocked on Wednesday afternoon and for much of the night, with an estimated 1,000 vehicles at a standstill at its height as eight-mile tailbacks built up in both directions. Some drivers abandoned their vehicles on the road overnight, making it harder to remove them. This video can not be played The small number of vehicles that ventured onto the A9 near Dunblane were travelling slowly but freely on Thursday morning. Police spoke to trapped motorists to ensure they were OK and to distribute water and snacks, with a plan implemented to allow agencies to go in and recover stranded vehicles and treat the road. Lesley Forster told BBC Scotland she had managed to get home after spending a ""horrific"" 18 hours on the M80 near Cumbernauld. She left Edinburgh at 14:00 on Wednesday and got back to Mollinsburn, north of Glasgow, at 08:00. Ms Forster said: ""I had nothing with me. I had to use the water I had with me to put in to my window wipers. I was stuck for 18 hours and have never been so frightened in my life. It was freezing cold. I had a total meltdown. ""There were no snow ploughs or anything. A young lad came out of his house with a sled filled with water and a few bits of food - all he had in the house - and handed it out. I am so grateful to him. ""Once it started to get light and you could see everything round about you and you have got the reality of it, and were thinking: 'You are going to come out of this alive"". Local residentsdelivered food and drinks to many trapped motorists, with Mountain Rescue personnel and other emergency service crews also involved. Among those stranded was a bus full of passengers. This video can not be played A major road linking the west end of Glasgow to the city centre was eerily quiet on Thursday morning Stein Connolly at the Transport Scotland control room said that while problems on the M80 had been cleared, issues should persist into the weekend. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Newsdrive programme that he had ""never been as close to the Met Office in my life"", saying that ""I don't think it is going to end, not right away"". Mr Connelly added: ""We have got the amber warning until tomorrow but there is still yellow warnings right into the weekend. ""So we are still going to have some challenges, some cold temperatures and some snow, but if we can maintain the roads the way they are now, hopefully going into a yellow we will be in a better place and we will be able to maintain that."" Police Scotland told motorists to avoid the worst-hit areas, and to stay in their vehicles if they do become stuck. Supt Helen Harrison said: ""We do not want anyone to put themselves or others at risk in these conditions. ""If you can postpone your journey in affected areas until after the amber warning ceases, I would urge you to do so."" Leanne McKillop and Yvonne Davies spent the night at Glasgow Airport Meanwhile, friends Leanne McKillop and Yvonne Davies were among those who spent the night at Glasgow Airport, where they said they have had nothing to eat and nothing to sleep on. Ms McKillop told BBC Breakfast: ""We have been stuck here since 10am yesterday morning. The airlines basically just walked away saying it was to do with the airport. ""There are people sleeping on the floor, there were not enough blankets. There was bedding for about 100 people and there are about 500 people here. ""Our flight is meant to be going at 12:30 today but we don't know - it is a case of wait and see."" This was the first time a red alert for snow has ever been issued in Scotland, and only the second time anywhere in the UK.

"Culture Secretary Matt Hancock has said the government will not implement the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry. The inquiry, set up by David Cameron after the phone hacking scandal, was due to examine relations between journalists and the police. But Mr Hancock said the ""world had changed"" since Leveson's 2012 report and the press had cleaned up its act. Labour's Tom Watson said the decision was a ""bitter blow to the victims of press intrusion"". Mr Hancock also announced that the government would not put Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act - which would force media organisations to pay legal costs of libel cases whether they won or lost - into effect and said they would seek repeal ""at the earliest opportunity"". Lords vote for second stage Leveson probe Labour 'won't accept' more Mosley money The Conservatives opposed Leveson part two in their general election manifesto but peers voted to revive it last month through an amendment to the Data Protection Bill currently going through Parliament. In a Commons statement, Mr Hancock said: ""We do not believe that this costly and time-consuming public inquiry is the right way forward."" Labour's deputy leader and media spokesman Tom Watson said the newspapers had been ""lobbying hard"" for this outcome and that Mr Hancock would get ""plaudits"" in Friday's leader columns. Mr Watson claimed the newspapers had ""helped write"" the culture secretary's statement and accused Mr Hancock of failing to ""stand up to the tabloid-style newspapers who are propping up this government"". He also defended privacy campaigner Max Mosley, who is facing questions in the Daily Mail and The Sun about a racist leaflet published in the early 1960s. ""If I thought for one moment he held those views, contained in that leaflet of 57 years ago, I would not have given him the time of day. ""He is a man, though, who in the face of great family tragedy and overwhelming media intimidation, chose to use his limited resources to support the weak against the strong."" Mr Mosley has donated about Â£500,000 to Mr Watson's office and has said his family money has been used to back official media regulator Impress, set up in the wake of Leveson. The Labour Party has said it will not accept further donations from him. Mr Hancock accused Mr Watson of being ""tied up with the opponents of press freedom"" and said Labour's proposals would ""would lead to a press that is fettered and not free"". The culture secretary told MPs ""there were far too many cases of terrible behaviour"" by the press and ""over 40 people were convicted"" following police investigations. But he said there have been changes to the behaviour of the press and the procedures of the police since the Leveson Report was published in 2012. The media landscape had been through ""seismic change"" in recent years, with falling circulations, local newspapers closing and the rise of ""clickbait"" and ""fake news"" on social media, he told MPs. Asked what his message would be to the victims of press intrusion, Mr Hancock said the media industry had to be allowed to ""hold the powerful to account and respond to today's challenges"", adding that changes advocated by Leveson would ""make those challenges harder"". Mr Hancock told MPs the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) - set up by the UK's main newspaper groups as an alternative to Impress - had ""largely complied with Leveson's recommendations"". Lord Justice Leveson was appointed in 2011 to carry out an inquiry into press standards, following the phone-hacking scandal. In his original terms of reference, it was envisaged the inquiry would be split into two parts. The first, looking at the culture and practices of the press and relations between politicians, press and the police, took place in 2011 and 2012, with a full report in November 2012. The second part was scheduled to consider the extent of improper conduct and governance failings by individual newspaper groups, how these were investigated by the police and whether police officers received corrupt payments or inducements.

But he said there have been changes to the behaviour of the press and the procedures of the police since the Leveson Report was published in 2012. The media landscape had been through ""seismic change"" in recent years, with falling circulations, local newspapers closing and the rise of ""clickbait"" and ""fake news"" on social media, he told MPs. Asked what his message would be to the victims of press intrusion, Mr Hancock said the media industry had to be allowed to ""hold the powerful to account and respond to today's challenges"", adding that changes advocated by Leveson would ""make those challenges harder"". Mr Hancock told MPs the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) - set up by the UK's main newspaper groups as an alternative to Impress - had ""largely complied with Leveson's recommendations"". Lord Justice Leveson was appointed in 2011 to carry out an inquiry into press standards, following the phone-hacking scandal. In his original terms of reference, it was envisaged the inquiry would be split into two parts. The first, looking at the culture and practices of the press and relations between politicians, press and the police, took place in 2011 and 2012, with a full report in November 2012. The second part was scheduled to consider the extent of improper conduct and governance failings by individual newspaper groups, how these were investigated by the police and whether police officers received corrupt payments or inducements.

"Labour says it will not accept any more money from privacy campaigner Max Mosley amid a row over a racist by-election leaflet he published in 1961. The leaflet, backing a candidate for his father Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, said: ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health."" Mr Mosley says he doesn't recall the leaflet and he is not a racist. But Labour said the ex-Formula 1 boss's donations to deputy leader Tom Watson's office would come to an end. Press standards inquiry axed by ministers Mr Mosley has given about Â£500,000 to fund the running of Mr Watson's office as well as policy research over the past few years. As well as being deputy leader, Mr Watson is also shadow culture secretary and in charge of the party's policy on press regulation. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Mosley suggested he would continue to financially support Mr Watson, who he described as ""one of the most honest and courageous politicians we have got"". But a Labour source suggested the funding arrangement had come to an end. ""The Labour Party has moved away from large-scale donations from wealthy individuals,"" the source said. ""I don't believe that there will be any more payments from Max Mosley to the Labour Party or Tom Watson. The last payments were made last year."" Conservative Party deputy chairman James Cleverly told London's Evening Standard: ""Tom Watson should seriously consider distancing himself from Mr Mosley and returning the money."" The Metropolitan Police says it will ""assess"" a dossier on Mr Mosley put together by the Daily Mail, which has suggested the leaflet,which it discovered in archives in Manchester,external, calls into question evidence he gave to a High Court trial in 2008. A Met spokeswoman said: ""This afternoon the CPS forwarded information from the Daily Mail to the Metropolitan Police. ""An assessment will be carried out."" Tom Watson's office has been funded by Max Mosley The former motor racing boss was presented with a photocopy of the leaflet, for Union Movement candidate Walter Hesketh in the 1961 Moss Side by-election,during an interview with Channel 4 News,external. The leaflet, which says it was ""published by Max Mosley"", includes the warning: ""Protect your health. There is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD [sexually transmitted disease] and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children's health."" Asked about the final line, Mr Mosley told Channel 4 News: ""I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely."" But he said he had ""no reason to apologise to anyone"" since the sentiments expressed in the leaflet did ""not reflect my view then or now"". The Daily Mail said it raised questions over Mr Mosley's evidence to a High Court trial, in which he successfully sued the News of the World over reports that a sado-masochistic sex session he had had with five prostitutes was ""Nazi-themed"". The Sun, which featured allegations on its front page, said its parent company News UK, which used to publish the News of the World, was awaiting the result of the police assessment. During the 2008 trial, Mr Mosley denied any knowledge of the leaflet. Speaking on Tuesday, he said ""obviously"" he ""would not have done that if I knew of its existence"". Mr Mosley has campaigned for tighter press regulation since the trial and has donated funds to press regulator Impress. He is also attempting to use data protection laws to delete references to what he calls this ""private party"" and what he says are inaccurate references about his relationship to Impress. Mr Watson has insisted his views on the need for tougher press regulation were ""well known"" and had not changed as a result of his association with Mr Mosley, who he has described in the past as a friend. Speaking in the Commons after the government announced it would not hold the second part of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, he said: ""If I thought for one moment he held those views, contained in that leaflet of 57 years ago, I would not have given him the time of day. ""He is a man, though, who in the face of great family tragedy and overwhelming media intimidation, chose to use his limited resources to support the weak against the strong.""

"Hope Hicks, one of President Trump's closest advisers, is to step down as White House communications director. The announcement came a day after she testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee, but White House sources said this was not the reason. Ms Hicks, 29, is reported to have told colleagues she was leaving because she felt she had achieved all she could. She has worked for Mr Trump for years. She is the fourth person to serve as the president's communications chief. On Tuesday, Ms Hicks gave a nine-hour testimony in front of the panel investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Ms Hicks is reported to have admitted to the panel that she had occasionally told what amounted to ""white lies"" for President Trump, but she denied lying about anything relevant to the investigation. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders - who described Ms Hicks as ""in a league of her own"" - said it remained unclear when she would leave the administration. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Hicks is reported to have told colleagues she was leaving because she felt she had accomplished all she could in the White House. Her departure will come as a major blow to Mr Trump, who said he would miss having her by his side. A former press secretary, she rose through the ranks to occupy the desk closest to the Oval Office. Ms Hicks kept a low public profile but recently found herself part of a scandal when newspapers exposed that she was in a relationship with White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who had been accused of domestic violence against past partners. Whennews of the allegations against Mr Porterbroke last month, it was Ms Hicks who helped draft an initial White House statement defending him. Mr Trump was reportedly not consulted and was unimpressed with her handling of the controversy. From model to Trump's media director White House aide 'admits white lies' Ms Hicks became head of the White House communications team last August, after the abrupt firing of Anthony Scaramucci. In a statement, Mr Trump said: ""Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. ""I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future."" Mr Scaramucci, speaking on Fox News, said: ""She's one of the least malicious people I've ever met in my life. She's dedicated, she's charming, she's thoughtful, at the end of the day she's going to have an unbelievable career."" A former campaign official quoted by Politico magazine saidMs Hicks's departure left the White House without an expert ""Trump translator"",external. ""She knew what the president wanted and could explain it to the communications [team],"" the official said. Ms Hicks, Mr Scaramucci, Sean Spicer and Mike Dubke have all served in the role since January 2017. The latest upheaval comes just after Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had his White House security clearance downgraded. On Tuesday night, the president also fired off a fierce tweet against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Hope Hicks had been there since the beginning; since before the beginning. When the Trump campaign was just a ragtag band of political neophytes, she was the one distributing press releases and answering media requests. Where others had stumbled or been pushed out of Donald Trump's orbit, Hicks quietly persevered - and rode the train all the way to one of the most powerful White House jobs. Now she too is gone. She lasted nearly as long as the preceding three White House communications directors combined, but the position continues to be cursed. Administration sources insist that it was a planned exit, that she was simply waiting for the right time. It's hard, however, to imagine timing worse than this. It comes just a day after her eight hours of testimony before a congressional committee investigating possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, where she reportedly admitted to telling ""white lies"" in defence of the president. Although she may be exiting the White House, it's unlikely she escapes the spotlight so easily. She had a ringside seat to many of the controversies that have swirled around the Trump campaign and presidency - and subsequent revelations could put her name in the headlines again. Ms Hicks is seen as a key witness in the ongoing inquiry into whether the Trump team colluded with Russia. During the nine-hour hearing on Tuesday, she reportedly stonewalled lawmakers about a 2016 meeting between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee investigating alleged Russian meddling, said that she now needed to testify. ""She has no right to claim executive privilege. She has no claim to refuse to come before the judiciary committee now she's stepped down. She should be a witness before the judiciary committee,"" he said.

"This video can not be played President Putin introduced video of a missile launch in 2018 Russia has developed a new array of nuclear weapons that are invincible, according to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin made the claims as he laid out his key policies for a fourth presidential term, ahead of an election he is expected to win in 17 days' time. The weapons he boasted of included a cruise missile that he said could ""reach anywhere in the world"". He said of the West: ""They need to take account of a new reality and understand ... [this]... is not a bluff."" Giving his annual state of the nation speech, Mr Putin used video presentations to showcase the development of two new nuclear delivery systems that he said could evade detection. One video graphic appeared to show missiles raining down on the US state of Florida. Why would Putin want to nuke Florida? One system Mr Putin described included a ""low-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defence and air defence"". Another was a submarine-launched, long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Police accused of 'Putin graffiti campaign' Russian in jail for giant duck protest During the two-hour televised speech to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament, he said the weapons were a response to US development of its missile defence system. The US State Department said it was ""certainly unfortunate to have watched the video animation that depicted a nuclear attack on the United States"" - adding that it was not ""the behaviour of a responsible international player"". Mr Putin faces seven challengers on 18 March, although none is expected to attract widespread support. The president played no part in a raucous televised debate broadcast on Wednesday that featured the other candidates. Absent from the campaign is prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running and has called on voters to boycott the poll. President Putin has so far done little campaigning, and until now has said little about his plans for the next six years. By Steven Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Before today, Vladimir Putin had delivered 13 state of the nation addresses. Address Number 14 turned out to be very different from anything that had come before. Standing in front of a giant video screen, President Putin showcased Russia's very latest strategic weapons. Like a magician pulling one rabbit after another out of his hat, he wowed his audience with images of cruise missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, underwater drones and supersonic jets. Russian MPs and senators applauded the military video show, which dominated the second half of President Putin's speech. There was a double message here. Firstly, to the West: don't push us. And, with elections coming up, there was this for the Russian people: Vote for Putin and you'll be voting for national security. I suspect the concluding image was designed to reinforce just that: as Vladimir Putin stood to the national anthem, a giant Russian flag appeared on the video screen behind him. It is a message that is likely to strike a chord with many here. Mr Putin tailored the first half of his speech towards working Russians and their concerns. He pledged to halve poverty in the country within the next six years and said he wanted life-expectancy rates to emulate Japan and France. It was Mr Putin's last speech before the election ""Every person matters to us,"" he said, adding that he also wanted to increase employment and longevity. In 2000 there were 42 million people in Russia living below the poverty line, he noted; today there were 20 million, but this still needed to come down. He warned Russians not to take the country's power for granted. ""Russia is now a leading country with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential,"" he said. ""But from the point of view of the extremely important task of ensuring people's quality of life and welfare we, of course, have not achieved the level we require. But we have to do this and will do this,"" he added to applause. Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Mr Putin also pledged to spend more on roads and reduce accidents; said teachers deserved good salaries and wages; and said there should be better access to both the internet and medical services for people in remote areas. One of the video graphics appeared to show missiles dropping on the US state of Florida Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent President Putin's emphasis on a strong Russia modernising its nuclear arsenal is a reflection of similar statements over recent months from his US counterpart Donald Trump. In his remarks, Mr Putin highlighted the development of two new nuclear delivery systems, which, he said, could evade US anti-ballistic missile defences. This is essentially because neither of them are ballistic missiles, which are fired out of the atmosphere in a high-arcing trajectory. One - effectively a very long-range nuclear-tipped torpedo - has been rumoured to be under development since Soviet days but is now seen by US analysts as a credible threat. The second system - described by Mr Putin as a cruise missile - looks to be more of a work in progress and may be a kind of very high-speed ""hypersonic"" system - described by one arms control expert as a ""glider on steroids"" - that again could evade existing anti-missile defences. China and the US are also working on similar systems of their own. Digital growth was also essential, Mr Putin said during his speech. He said he wanted Russia to become one of the world's main hubs for storing and processing big data. Graphics - including this one on Russia's working-age population (in millions) - flashed up throughout He called for more progress in making robots and artificial intelligence. New talent in technology should be nurtured and foreigners should be encouraged to study in Russia, he said. Mr Putin also spoke of Russian operations in Syria - supporting the Assad government's fight against rebels - which, he said, showed off the country's increased defence capabilities. Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? The Russian guns for hire dying in Syria Syria war: Putin's Russian mission accomplished Russia recently sent two of its most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, to Syria, even though they are still undergoing tests. There was no confirmation that Russia's new stealth fighters have been used in combat in Syria Mr Putin also announced that a bridge to the Crimean peninsula would be open within the next couple of months.Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, during Mr Putin's current term in office. Russia was safeguarding its interest in the Arctic region by strengthening its military infrastructure in the region, he said.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk joked that his journey was 'not frictionless' Donald Tusk has said Theresa May needs to come up with ""a better idea"" than the EU's controversial plan to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland. The PM has rejected keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's customs area saying this would split the UK in two. But the European Council president said one of the ""possible negative consequences"" of the kind of Brexit Mrs May wants would be a hard border. The two met in No 10 ahead of a big Brexit speech on Friday by Mrs May. Mrs May, who chaired a meeting of the cabinet before her talks with Mr Tusk, has already pledged not to accept the draft withdrawal treaty published on Wednesday by the EU. Katya Adler: Real crisis or par for course? Brexit: 'No deal' would hurt UK car industry Toyota to build new Auris in UK She reiterated this position to Mr Tusk during what Downing Street said was a ""positive and constructive meeting"". The prime minister wants to resolve the Northern Ireland question ""through the overall relationship between the UK and the EU"", Downing Street said. An EU source said the main focus had been the nature of the UK and EU's future relationship and that all the EU's remaining members supported its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The UK and the EU agree on wanting to avoid a return to a physical border - with border posts and checks - in Northern Ireland. The UK has suggested new IT systems could be introduced to avoid the need for physical border checks but has yet to spell out how this would work in practice. But the draft EU treaty also includes the option of a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found. Both the EU and the Irish government say it is up to the UK to come up with concrete alternatives to what they describe as a ""backstop"" option. This video can not be played Tony Blair tells Today people are ""sacrificing peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit"" Mrs May says the EU proposal would ""threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK"" by creating a border down the Irish Sea. In a speech in Brussels before travelling to London Mr Tusk said he was ""absolutely sure that all the essential elements of the draft"" would be accepted by the 27 remaining EU members. And he said Mrs May's decision to rule out membership of the single market and customs union had been acknowledged ""without enthusiasm and without satisfaction"". The PM has said she wants a deal which will allow trade to be ""as frictionless as possible"". But Mr Tusk warned: ""There can be no frictionless trade outside of the customs union and the single market. Friction is an inevitable side-effect of Brexit by nature."" Mr Barnier has also been addressing the issue in a speech at the business conference in Brussels. As a result of the UK's stated negotiation red lines, he said, the only option remaining was a free trade agreement in the vein of the deals the EU already has with other third countries. He dismissed hopes of a ""mutual recognition"" arrangement on trade standards, saying this was impossible because of the UK's refusal to accept European Court of Justice oversight. And in a message to other EU leaders, he said the ""economic benefits of staying together"" were ""far bigger"" than any negative knock-on impact from Brexit. Mr Barnier also said Northern Ireland was a ""sensitive"" issue and that the problem was down to the UK's decision to leave the single market and customs union. The EU will look at UK proposals ""in a very constructive way"", he said, adding: ""Any vision of the future must take into account the fact that the EU cannot and will not compromise on its founding principles."" Irish senator Neale Richmond, European affairs spokesman for the Fine Gael party that leads the government, said Britain has provided ""zero detail"" on its proposed alternatives to keeping Northern Ireland in a customs area with the EU to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. This video can not be played May: I'll make opposition to plans 'crystal clear' to EU Veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash told the BBC's Newsnight there were ""technical ways"" of managing the Irish border and accused the EU of trying to create a ""constitutional crisis"" for the UK. Cabinet ministers have suggested Friday's speech by Mrs May will give the EU the clarity that it has been seeking about what kind of trade relationship the UK wants after its departure on 29 March 2019. In an apparent concession to the EU ahead of the speech, the government said EU nationals coming to the UK during a transition period after Brexit, expected to last two years, would be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major Kuenssberg: A Brexit warning from one PM to another UK's transition offer to EU nationals' Mrs May has said her long-term goal is a ""bespoke economic partnership"", underpinned by a comprehensive free trade agreement guaranteeing tariff-free access to EU markets for British goods and services. This video can not be played EU's Michel Barnier: I'm not trying to provoke anyone Brexit: All you need to know Reality Check: What does the EU Brexit draft reveal? Earlier former prime minister Tony Blair urged the EU to put forward new ideas to address ""genuine underlying grievances beneath the Brexit vote, especially around immigration"" - saying this could lead voters to change their minds on leaving. In a new report, the Commons Business Committee warned failure to reach any kind of deal would be damaging for the car industry and only close alignment with the EU would ensure its survival. But on Tuesday the industry received a vote of confidencewhen Toyota saidit would build the next generation of its Auris hatchback at its Burnaston plant in Derbyshire, safeguarding more than 3,000 jobs.

"Daniel Ek co-founded Swedish streaming company Spotify in 2006 Spotify has filed to list on the New York Stock Exchange in a move that may value the world's biggest music streaming service at more than $23bn (Â£16.7bn). In an unconventional move, the firm will list shares directly on the NYSE. Rather than issue new shares, Spotify's existing shareholders will take their shares directly to the market. That will allow early investors and employees to sell their stakes and is not intended to raise new funding. Mark Mulligan, a UK-based music industry analyst at MIDiA Research, said: ""It's about a company that is letting its investors get their returns so it can move on to the next stage of its career."" Spotify has offered a streaming service since 2008 and has 159 million monthly active users including 71 million paid subscribers globally. Apple Music has about 36 million subscribers, but unlike Spotify it does not offer a free tier supported by advertising. What Spotify must do to survive How bands are escaping the music industry snake pit The fact that Spotify exists at all is something of a minor miracle: unknown Swedish company convinces major record labels to upload millions upon millions of songs for people to listen to without buying them. It must have been quite the pitch. Sure, the labels get royalties but it's pennies - fractions of pennies - on what they used to get from ""traditional"" online sales. Regardless, it's been clear for a long time that streaming is the music industry's future. On Wednesday, Spotify announced it would go public - but that's not to say it is here to stay. The company has long been surrounded by threats, and it's no different today. Apple, Amazon and Google are also in the streaming game and - unlike Spotify - all sell devices on which consumers can listen to music. And while Spotify has signed deals with all the ""big three"" record labels - Warner, Universal and Sony - it's the music executives that still hold the bargaining chips. Read more from Dave Lee here Spotify said its shares sold for between $37.50 and $125 each in private transactions last year and more than $132 this year. The company's potential valuation is based on a combination of stock price and how many shares it has outstanding. The prices shared by Spotify suggest a range of $6.3bn to more than $23bn. The higher figure would make Spotify one of the biggest public debuts of a tech company since 2012, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and manages exchange traded funds focused on new public companies. She cautioned, however, that private investors have tended to value firms more highly than public markets in recent years. Snap, owner of Snapchat, for example also had an almost $30bn market capitalisation afterits first day of tradinglast year, but it has struggled to sustain that figure. ""This could be an issue - could it possibly sustain those valuations?"" she said. UK pop star Dua Lipa was one of Spotify's most-streamed artists this year In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,external, Spotify said it has made annual losses every year and lost more than â¬1.2bn in losses in 2017.

"Academics warn it is unlikely the government will achieve its target of recycling 50% of household waste being recycled by 2020 Recycling rates of councils serving 14 million households in England have fallen over five years, analysis by BBC News has found. Half of local authorities recycled a lower proportion of household waste in 2016-17 than in 2011-12. Experts warn the UK is likely to miss its target of recycling 50% of household rubbish by 2020. The Local Government Association (LGA) said recycling in England had still quadrupled compared with 10 years ago. Since 2011-12 the overall household recycling rate in England has risen by just 0.7%, while most regions have seen a fall. Analysing statistics held by theDepartment for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,external(Defra), and theMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government,external, the BBC England Data Unit has found: Out of 350 councils for which there are comparable figures, 173 had lower recycling rates in 2016-17 compared to 2011-12. The majority of regions in England saw a decline in household recycling rates over the same period. The amount that all councils budgeted to spend on recycling services has fallen in real terms from a high of Â£630m in 2013-14 to Â£569m in 2016-17 - a fall of 10%. Local council budgets for all waste management services have also been cut in real terms by Â£400m since 2010-11, with projected spending falling from Â£4.5bn to Â£4.1bn in 2016-17. The North East of England has seen the largest fall in recycling rates, which has left local volunteer groups having to clear up waste. ""Our windswept beaches are plagued by rubbish"" says Carl Quartermain, who set up the group Friends of Redcar five years ago. ""Every month we get around 40 volunteers who sweep our beaches and we pick up hundreds of kilos of rubbish from sanitary products to every plastic bottle imaginable"". After setting the group up Mr Quartermain became a local councillor and has seen first hand the pressure local authorities are under. ""Councils just don't have the financial resources to do what they once did, and when it comes to waste and recycling, I feel this is very much a model for the future where local community groups work in partnership with the council"". Community group Friends of Redcar litter pick local beaches every month on Teesside As councils have warned against the government making further cuts to their budget, some experts predict that spending on recycling services is likely to be reduced further. Jennifer Glover from the Local Government Intelligence Unit (LGIU) said: ""When you've got a creaking social care system trying to look after elderly people, and children being taken into care, recycling rates are simply not a priority for many councils."" A survey by the LGIU,externalfound only one in 10 councils said environmental and waste issues were their greatest immediate pressure, compared to six out of 10 that said adult social care and children and education services were their most pressing issues. The UK government has a target that 50% of household waste will be recycled by 2020. ""I'd be surprised if we get anywhere near that"" said Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable waste management at the University of Northampton. ""We've got some parts of the country doing well when it comes to recycling, but when it comes to areas with low rates, these places tend to be poor with transient communities and have lots of flats and tower blocks. ""In those places it's hard to separate your waste, and we've done surveys that have found that the more your neighbours recycle, the more you're likely to."" Hartlepool Council, which saw the biggest drop in recycling, said it was ""working hard"" to reverse the trend. Derby City Council said its recycling rates had fallen after it made changes to its recycling collection services in 2014, but said rates had increased in the past two years. It said it had taken away ""kerbside blue bin recycling"" from some areas of the city ""due to high levels of contamination"" but was ""reaching out"" to people who had put the non-recyclable rubbish in the wrong bin. Budget figures for the current financial year, 2017-18, show local authorities plan to inject an additional Â£42m into recycling services, with the Local Government Association (LGA) claiming recycling is a real ""success story for councils"". Councillor Martin Tett from the LGA said: ""Recycling rates having quadrupled in the last decade and our own polling shows eight out of 10 people are happy with the way their local council collects their rubbish. ""But councils are under huge financial pressures and in England face an overall funding gap that will exceed Â£5 billion by 2020. Having to prioritise vital services such as the demand for children's services, adult social care and homelessness support is leaving increasingly less money for councils to fund other services such as waste collection."" The environmental damage that waste plastic can do has been highlighted by programmes such as Blue Planet In January, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government's new environmental policy aimed toeradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has suggested that the use ofplastic drink straws could be banned. Environment minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey told the BBC: ""We have made good progress and in 2016 recycled or recovered over 70% of all packaging waste across the UK, far exceeding the EU target of 60%. Recycling of household waste also continues to increase. ""Our 25-year plan for the environment sets out our commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it, and we'll be setting out more detail on how we further increase our recycling rates in our Resources and Waste Strategy later this year.""

"Labour says it will not accept any more money from privacy campaigner Max Mosley amid a row over a racist by-election leaflet he published in 1961. The leaflet, backing a candidate for his father Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, said: ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health."" Mr Mosley says he doesn't recall the leaflet and he is not a racist. But Labour said the ex-Formula 1 boss's donations to deputy leader Tom Watson's office would come to an end. Press standards inquiry axed by ministers Mr Mosley has given about Â£500,000 to fund the running of Mr Watson's office as well as policy research over the past few years. As well as being deputy leader, Mr Watson is also shadow culture secretary and in charge of the party's policy on press regulation. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Mosley suggested he would continue to financially support Mr Watson, who he described as ""one of the most honest and courageous politicians we have got"". But a Labour source suggested the funding arrangement had come to an end. ""The Labour Party has moved away from large-scale donations from wealthy individuals,"" the source said. ""I don't believe that there will be any more payments from Max Mosley to the Labour Party or Tom Watson. The last payments were made last year."" Conservative Party deputy chairman James Cleverly told London's Evening Standard: ""Tom Watson should seriously consider distancing himself from Mr Mosley and returning the money."" The Metropolitan Police says it will ""assess"" a dossier on Mr Mosley put together by the Daily Mail, which has suggested the leaflet,which it discovered in archives in Manchester,external, calls into question evidence he gave to a High Court trial in 2008. A Met spokeswoman said: ""This afternoon the CPS forwarded information from the Daily Mail to the Metropolitan Police. ""An assessment will be carried out."" Tom Watson's office has been funded by Max Mosley The former motor racing boss was presented with a photocopy of the leaflet, for Union Movement candidate Walter Hesketh in the 1961 Moss Side by-election,during an interview with Channel 4 News,external. The leaflet, which says it was ""published by Max Mosley"", includes the warning: ""Protect your health. There is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD [sexually transmitted disease] and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children's health."" Asked about the final line, Mr Mosley told Channel 4 News: ""I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely."" But he said he had ""no reason to apologise to anyone"" since the sentiments expressed in the leaflet did ""not reflect my view then or now"". The Daily Mail said it raised questions over Mr Mosley's evidence to a High Court trial, in which he successfully sued the News of the World over reports that a sado-masochistic sex session he had had with five prostitutes was ""Nazi-themed"". The Sun, which featured allegations on its front page, said its parent company News UK, which used to publish the News of the World, was awaiting the result of the police assessment. During the 2008 trial, Mr Mosley denied any knowledge of the leaflet. Speaking on Tuesday, he said ""obviously"" he ""would not have done that if I knew of its existence"". Mr Mosley has campaigned for tighter press regulation since the trial and has donated funds to press regulator Impress. He is also attempting to use data protection laws to delete references to what he calls this ""private party"" and what he says are inaccurate references about his relationship to Impress. Mr Watson has insisted his views on the need for tougher press regulation were ""well known"" and had not changed as a result of his association with Mr Mosley, who he has described in the past as a friend. Speaking in the Commons after the government announced it would not hold the second part of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, he said: ""If I thought for one moment he held those views, contained in that leaflet of 57 years ago, I would not have given him the time of day. ""He is a man, though, who in the face of great family tragedy and overwhelming media intimidation, chose to use his limited resources to support the weak against the strong.""

"This video can not be played Resham Khan pities the man who threw acid on her People caught with acid or other corrosive substances in public could face up to six months in jail under new guidelines for England and Wales. It is the first time the Sentencing Council's guidelines for judges and magistrates have explicitly listed acid as a potentially dangerous weapon. The advice also covers possession of knives and other weapons. Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012. Justice Minister Rory Stewart said: ""Those caught with any offensive weapon must feel the full force of the law."" Acid attacks: What has led to the rise and how can they be stopped? Hell in a bottle: I survived an acid attack A letter to my acid attacker The new advice states: ""An offensive weapon is defined in legislation as 'any article made or adapted for use for causing injury'. ""A highly dangerous weapon is, therefore, a weapon, including a corrosive substance (such as acid), whose dangerous nature must be substantially above and beyond this."" The injuries of Darren Pidgeon, victim of an acid attack in Thundersley, Essex The guidance says that an adult caught carrying acid twice or using it to threaten should receive a mandatory six-month prison sentence. Those under 18 would receive a four months' detention and training order. The guidelines do not cover situations where the weapon is used to harm somebody - those instances would be covered by guidance on assault, attempted murder or murder. Acid or other corrosive chemicals have been used as weapons in a range of crimes, including revenge, so-called ""honour crimes"", gang violence and theft from delivery drivers. In one of the most serious recent cases, a man who threw acid in a packed London nightclub, injuring 22 people,was jailed for 20 years. Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012 to 504 in 2016-17, according to a Freedom of Information request to police forces by the BBC. In January, some of the UK's largest retailersagreed to voluntarily stop sales of acidsto customers under 18 years old. The Home Office said it will shortly announce its response to last year's consultation on new legislation banning sales of corrosives to under 18s and introducing a new offence for possessing corrosive products in a public space. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn? The guidance also says that under-18s who film their crimes to post them on social media could face tougher punishments. Courts will also be encouraged to consider in greater detail the age, maturity, background and circumstances of young offenders when sentencing. The Sentencing Council said the new guidance will ensure those convicted of offences involving knives or particularly dangerous weapons, as well as those who repeatedly offend, will receive the highest sentences. There were 37,443 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending in September 2017, a 21% increase on the previous year and the highest number since 2011, the earliest point for which comparable data is available. Nine charts on the rise of knife crime Sentencing Council member Rosina Cottage said:  ""Too many people in our society are carrying knives. ""If someone has a knife on them, it only takes a moment of anger or drunkenness for it to be taken out and for others to be injured or killed. ""These new guidelines give courts comprehensive guidance to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of offending."" The guidelines come into force in England and Wales from 1 June.

"One 'heat map' from the study shows the percentage of children classed as moderately or severely underweight (MSU) in each pixel in the year 2000 Exceptionally detailed maps of child growth and education across Africa suggest that no single country is set to end childhood malnutrition by 2030. That target wasset by the UN as a Sustainable Development Goal. However, the new maps, which give detail to the level of an individual village, show that almost every nation has at least one region where children's health is improving. They are published inNature,external. The two studies have mapped child growth rates and educational attainment for women of reproductive age - tracking progress in both in 51 countries between 2000 and 2015. The scientists targeted these two factors in particular because they are important predictors of child mortality. ""Together, these are very useful indicators of where populations are doing well and where they're being left behind,"" explained Prof Simon Hay, a global health researcher from the University of Washington in the US. Prof Hay and his team pieced together data from community-level surveys and produced a series of 5km by 5km scale maps, showing child growth and educational attainment across Africa over the 15-year span of the study. This revealed that most African countries, especially much of sub-Saharan Africa and eastern and southern regions, show improvement in malnutrition. They also showed large disparities within individual countries. But by mapping these in such detail, scientists say policymakers will have the evidence to direct their resources. Kofi Annan, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former secretary general of the UN, endorsed this aim in an article he wrote in response to the maps' publication. ""Without good data,"" he wrote, ""we're flying blind. If you can't see it, you can't solve it."" While progress has been ""astonishing"" the maps showed disparities within individual countries While highlighting what he called ""stark disparities"" in progress, particularly in conflict-affected areas, Mr Annan said the progress in Africa that these maps painted was ""astonishing"". ""Especially for me,"" he said, ""an African accustomed to international headlines depicting a continent consumed by war, famine and hunger. The Africa shown in these maps tells a different story - one of measurable, steady progress on issues long thought intractable. ""[But] there are villages where all children are too short for their age. Across most of the Sahel, a semi-arid swath of land from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, high rates of stunting persist, with no hint of improvement. ""Such fine-grained insight brings tremendous responsibility to act."" Progress in Africa has never before been mapped in this level of detail and Prof Hay said that making the data openly available and providing ""the best information we can"" would help to direct resources towards the populations most in need. ""We can look at those communities that are doing particularly well and ask if there are lessons we can learn and apply elsewhere,"" he told BBC News. In a study that is considered to have been the birth of modern epidemiology in the 19th Century, the London physician John Snow mapped cholera cases in London - revealing in a world-changing map how cases in the city were clustered around one water pump in Broad Street. This led to the revelation that the disease was spread through contaminated water. Mr Annan concluded that these maps could be as powerful in the long battle against hunger. ""They are another tool in our arsenal,"" he said. ""Alone, they won't eradicate malnutrition but they will enable Africa's leaders to act strategically.""

"This video can not be played Will you miss the old Â£10 note? Bank of England paper Â£10 notes are being accepted in shops for a final day before being officially withdrawn. The Charles Darwin notes have been gradually replaced by the polymer Jane Austen notesince September. From Friday, anyone with the banknote will need to deposit it at their bank as shops will be entitled to refuse it. At the same time, a collection of new 10p coins featuring 26 designs celebrating Britain - from cricket to queuing - are entering circulation. Officially, any bank, building society or retailer is within their rights to refuse an old paper Â£10 note from Friday. Only the Bank of England in London will accept them forever. Yet all the major banks and the Post Office have said they will continue to accept deposits of these notes, featuring the portrait of naturalist Charles Darwin, from their own customers. They have been under pressure to do so from the Federation of Small Businesses, which said this would help get the older versions out of circulation quicker. At the last count, the Bank of England estimates that 211 million of these old notes are unreturned. This video can not be played New tenner designed for easier identification The launch of the polymer Jane Austen Â£10 note came after a four-month period when women, apart from the Queen, were not represented on the Bank's notes. The previous one was the Â£5 note featuring reformer Elizabeth Fry, which was replaced by a Winston Churchill fiver - a decision that led to a campaign to redress the lack of balance.

"Academics warn it is unlikely the government will achieve its target of recycling 50% of household waste being recycled by 2020 Recycling rates of councils serving 14 million households in England have fallen over five years, analysis by BBC News has found. Half of local authorities recycled a lower proportion of household waste in 2016-17 than in 2011-12. Experts warn the UK is likely to miss its target of recycling 50% of household rubbish by 2020. The Local Government Association (LGA) said recycling in England had still quadrupled compared with 10 years ago. Since 2011-12 the overall household recycling rate in England has risen by just 0.7%, while most regions have seen a fall. Analysing statistics held by theDepartment for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,external(Defra), and theMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government,external, the BBC England Data Unit has found: Out of 350 councils for which there are comparable figures, 173 had lower recycling rates in 2016-17 compared to 2011-12. The majority of regions in England saw a decline in household recycling rates over the same period. The amount that all councils budgeted to spend on recycling services has fallen in real terms from a high of Â£630m in 2013-14 to Â£569m in 2016-17 - a fall of 10%. Local council budgets for all waste management services have also been cut in real terms by Â£400m since 2010-11, with projected spending falling from Â£4.5bn to Â£4.1bn in 2016-17. The North East of England has seen the largest fall in recycling rates, which has left local volunteer groups having to clear up waste. ""Our windswept beaches are plagued by rubbish"" says Carl Quartermain, who set up the group Friends of Redcar five years ago. ""Every month we get around 40 volunteers who sweep our beaches and we pick up hundreds of kilos of rubbish from sanitary products to every plastic bottle imaginable"". After setting the group up Mr Quartermain became a local councillor and has seen first hand the pressure local authorities are under. ""Councils just don't have the financial resources to do what they once did, and when it comes to waste and recycling, I feel this is very much a model for the future where local community groups work in partnership with the council"". Community group Friends of Redcar litter pick local beaches every month on Teesside As councils have warned against the government making further cuts to their budget, some experts predict that spending on recycling services is likely to be reduced further. Jennifer Glover from the Local Government Intelligence Unit (LGIU) said: ""When you've got a creaking social care system trying to look after elderly people, and children being taken into care, recycling rates are simply not a priority for many councils."" A survey by the LGIU,externalfound only one in 10 councils said environmental and waste issues were their greatest immediate pressure, compared to six out of 10 that said adult social care and children and education services were their most pressing issues. The UK government has a target that 50% of household waste will be recycled by 2020. ""I'd be surprised if we get anywhere near that"" said Margaret Bates, professor of sustainable waste management at the University of Northampton. ""We've got some parts of the country doing well when it comes to recycling, but when it comes to areas with low rates, these places tend to be poor with transient communities and have lots of flats and tower blocks. ""In those places it's hard to separate your waste, and we've done surveys that have found that the more your neighbours recycle, the more you're likely to."" Hartlepool Council, which saw the biggest drop in recycling, said it was ""working hard"" to reverse the trend. Derby City Council said its recycling rates had fallen after it made changes to its recycling collection services in 2014, but said rates had increased in the past two years. It said it had taken away ""kerbside blue bin recycling"" from some areas of the city ""due to high levels of contamination"" but was ""reaching out"" to people who had put the non-recyclable rubbish in the wrong bin. Budget figures for the current financial year, 2017-18, show local authorities plan to inject an additional Â£42m into recycling services, with the Local Government Association (LGA) claiming recycling is a real ""success story for councils"". Councillor Martin Tett from the LGA said: ""Recycling rates having quadrupled in the last decade and our own polling shows eight out of 10 people are happy with the way their local council collects their rubbish. ""But councils are under huge financial pressures and in England face an overall funding gap that will exceed Â£5 billion by 2020. Having to prioritise vital services such as the demand for children's services, adult social care and homelessness support is leaving increasingly less money for councils to fund other services such as waste collection."" The environmental damage that waste plastic can do has been highlighted by programmes such as Blue Planet In January, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government's new environmental policy aimed toeradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has suggested that the use ofplastic drink straws could be banned. Environment minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey told the BBC: ""We have made good progress and in 2016 recycled or recovered over 70% of all packaging waste across the UK, far exceeding the EU target of 60%. Recycling of household waste also continues to increase. ""Our 25-year plan for the environment sets out our commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we inherited it, and we'll be setting out more detail on how we further increase our recycling rates in our Resources and Waste Strategy later this year.""

"Sir James Dyson accused the mainstream car industry of polluting the world with diesel emissions Dyson is seeking an extra 300 engineers in a push to build its first electric car by 2020. Best known for its vacuum cleaners and hand dryers, the firm caused a stir whenit announced plans for a battery powered vehicle. Dyson already has a 400-strong team working on the project and has doubled the number of scientists working on its battery programmes over the past year. The jobs news came as it revealed 2017 underlying earnings rose 27% to Â£801m. Dyson to make electric cars from 2020 Dyson settles legal dispute with ex-chief Dyson is better known for its vacuum cleaners than its cars Dyson said the electric car team - which up until now has been based in its Malmesbury headquarters in the Cotswolds - would shortly move to its new research and development base in Hullavington in Wiltshire. The privately-owned firm is yet to decide where its electric cars - once they have been designed - will be manufactured. The UK is reported to be in contention for the work, along with Singapore, Malaysia and China.

"This video can not be played Trump: 'You're afraid of the NRA' US President Donald Trump has stunned lawmakers from both parties by accusing them of being ""petrified"" of the National Rifle Association (NRA). In a break from his party's anti-gun control stance, Mr Trump urged lawmakers during a televised meeting to come up with a ""strong"" reform bill. The NRA said that Mr Trump's remarks ""made for great TV"", but ""would make for bad policy"" if implemented. The US gun debate has been reignited by a deadly school shooting in Florida. ""I want you to come up with a strong bill - and really strong on background checks,"" Mr Trump told lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday, pushing them to work on bipartisan legislation. Major retailers announce new restrictions on gun sales âSpike in school threatsâ after gun rampage In the meeting, which was broadcast live from the White House, Democrats looked gleeful as Mr Trump suggested expanding background checks for gun buyers and raising the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21. The Republican president said the NRA has ""great power over you people"", but that the lobby has ""less power over me"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president also accused Senator Pat Toomey of being ""afraid"" of the NRA, even though the Pennsylvania Republican has worked on a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre occurred, agreed with the president. This video can not be played Trump: 'How is it possible my son is watching this?' He said the NRA has a ""veto power"" over any gun control legislation in Congress. Mr Trump said he had previously told NRA officials: ""It's time. We've got to stop this nonsense. It's time."" Breitbart News, a strident backer of the president, criticised him in a bright red headline that said, ""TRUMP THE GUN GRABBER"". ""Take the guns first, go through due process second,"" Mr Trump said, suggesting police officers be given the power to seize guns from anyone who could pose a threat, including the mentally ill, without a court order. ""We can't wait and play games and nothing gets done,"" he added. He called for tighter restrictions on gun sales to young adults and for background checks to be expanded for all weapons purchases, including at gun shows and online. US gun lobby 'doesn't back any ban' America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump repeatedly stated his support for increasing armed security at schools, arming teachers and reducing ""gun-free zones"". ""It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody can support, as opposed to - you know - 15 bills, everybody's got their own bill,"" Mr Trump said. He also warned lawmakers against proposing a bill that included concealed carry across the US, a provision that Republicans and the NRA have long campaigned to include in any new gun legislation. Mr Trump has already directed his Justice Department to ban bump-stocks, which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. His remarks appeared to catch many Republican lawmakers unawares, especially as the president has previously been vocal about his support for firearms and the gun lobby. The Senate's second most senior Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, who was sitting next to the president, said it was ""fascinating television"" but ""surreal to actually be there"". ""We're not ditching any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn't like them,"" said Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who was not at the meeting. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said the proposed reforms might not have prevented last month's high school attack that left 17 people dead in his state. This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class Conservative lawmakers oppose gun restrictions as an infringement of the Second Amendment to the US constitution, which governs the right to bear arms. How Trump turned against gun control Florida shooting: Who are the victims? #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The man who suggested that if his opponent had been elected ""you'd be handing in your rifles"" endorsed taking guns away from people of questionable mental fitness and worrying about due process later. The man who received $30m in support from the National Rifle Association during his presidential campaign scorned Washington politicians for being afraid of the NRA and said it had ""less power"" over him. After a bipartisan meeting with congressional legislators, Donald Trump left heads spinning. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fierce gun-control advocate, clapped in joy, while some gun-rights Republicans wondered whose side the president was on. Of course, we've seen this film before. In a January meeting with a similar group of congressional leaders, Mr Trump expressed support for any comprehensive bipartisan agreement on immigration. In the following days and weeks, his administration did everything it could to undermine the most popular compromise bill. Gun-control supporters may feel they made progress in Wednesday's White House meeting, but the NRA surely will have another chance at the president's ear.

"The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is investigating the breach Germany is investigating a security breach of its defence and interior ministries' private networks, a government spokesman has confirmed. A notorious Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear, or APT28, is being widely blamed in German media. They are thought to be behind a number of cyber-attacks on the West, including breaches in the 2016 US election. The hack was first realised in December and may have lasted up to a year, the DPA news agency reported. The group is reported to have targeted the federal government's internal communications network with malware.

""We can confirm that the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and intelligence services are investigating a cyber-security incident concerning the federal government's information technology and networks,"" a German interior ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. He said the attack was ""isolated"" and had been ""brought under control"" but declined to comment on reports of Russian involvement. Fancy Bear was blamed for a similar attack on the lower house of the German parliament in 2015and is also thought to have targeted the Christian Democratic Union party of Chancellor Angela Merkel. The hacking group being widely blamed was also said to behind breaches on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and international sport Officials in the country issued repeated warnings about the potential of ""outside manipulation"" in last year's German election.

"This video can not be played Resham Khan pities the man who threw acid on her People caught with acid or other corrosive substances in public could face up to six months in jail under new guidelines for England and Wales. It is the first time the Sentencing Council's guidelines for judges and magistrates have explicitly listed acid as a potentially dangerous weapon. The advice also covers possession of knives and other weapons. Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012. Justice Minister Rory Stewart said: ""Those caught with any offensive weapon must feel the full force of the law."" Acid attacks: What has led to the rise and how can they be stopped? Hell in a bottle: I survived an acid attack A letter to my acid attacker The new advice states: ""An offensive weapon is defined in legislation as 'any article made or adapted for use for causing injury'. ""A highly dangerous weapon is, therefore, a weapon, including a corrosive substance (such as acid), whose dangerous nature must be substantially above and beyond this."" The injuries of Darren Pidgeon, victim of an acid attack in Thundersley, Essex The guidance says that an adult caught carrying acid twice or using it to threaten should receive a mandatory six-month prison sentence. Those under 18 would receive a four months' detention and training order. The guidelines do not cover situations where the weapon is used to harm somebody - those instances would be covered by guidance on assault, attempted murder or murder. Acid or other corrosive chemicals have been used as weapons in a range of crimes, including revenge, so-called ""honour crimes"", gang violence and theft from delivery drivers. In one of the most serious recent cases, a man who threw acid in a packed London nightclub, injuring 22 people,was jailed for 20 years. Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012 to 504 in 2016-17, according to a Freedom of Information request to police forces by the BBC. In January, some of the UK's largest retailersagreed to voluntarily stop sales of acidsto customers under 18 years old. The Home Office said it will shortly announce its response to last year's consultation on new legislation banning sales of corrosives to under 18s and introducing a new offence for possessing corrosive products in a public space. This video can not be played What should you do in case of a chemical burn? The guidance also says that under-18s who film their crimes to post them on social media could face tougher punishments. Courts will also be encouraged to consider in greater detail the age, maturity, background and circumstances of young offenders when sentencing. The Sentencing Council said the new guidance will ensure those convicted of offences involving knives or particularly dangerous weapons, as well as those who repeatedly offend, will receive the highest sentences. There were 37,443 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending in September 2017, a 21% increase on the previous year and the highest number since 2011, the earliest point for which comparable data is available. Nine charts on the rise of knife crime Sentencing Council member Rosina Cottage said:  ""Too many people in our society are carrying knives. ""If someone has a knife on them, it only takes a moment of anger or drunkenness for it to be taken out and for others to be injured or killed. ""These new guidelines give courts comprehensive guidance to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of offending."" The guidelines come into force in England and Wales from 1 June.

"The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is investigating the breach Germany is investigating a security breach of its defence and interior ministries' private networks, a government spokesman has confirmed. A notorious Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear, or APT28, is being widely blamed in German media. They are thought to be behind a number of cyber-attacks on the West, including breaches in the 2016 US election. The hack was first realised in December and may have lasted up to a year, the DPA news agency reported. The group is reported to have targeted the federal government's internal communications network with malware. Bears with keyboards: Russian hackers snoop on West Is Russia really interfering in European states? What are malware, patches and worms? ""We can confirm that the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and intelligence services are investigating a cyber-security incident concerning the federal government's information technology and networks,"" a German interior ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. He said the attack was ""isolated"" and had been ""brought under control"" but declined to comment on reports of Russian involvement. Fancy Bear was blamed for a similar attack on the lower house of the German parliament in 2015and is also thought to have targeted the Christian Democratic Union party of Chancellor Angela Merkel. The hacking group being widely blamed was also said to behind breaches on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and international sport Officials in the country issued repeated warnings about the potential of ""outside manipulation"" in last year's German election. The hacking group has been linked to the Russian state by multiple security experts investigating its international hacks. They are also known by other names including Sofacy, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Tsar Team. The group played a key role in 2016's attack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the US, according to security experts.

"This video can not be played Trump: 'You're afraid of the NRA' US President Donald Trump has stunned lawmakers from both parties by accusing them of being ""petrified"" of the National Rifle Association (NRA). In a break from his party's anti-gun control stance, Mr Trump urged lawmakers during a televised meeting to come up with a ""strong"" reform bill. The NRA said that Mr Trump's remarks ""made for great TV"", but ""would make for bad policy"" if implemented. The US gun debate has been reignited by a deadly school shooting in Florida. ""I want you to come up with a strong bill - and really strong on background checks,"" Mr Trump told lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday, pushing them to work on bipartisan legislation. Major retailers announce new restrictions on gun sales âSpike in school threatsâ after gun rampage In the meeting, which was broadcast live from the White House, Democrats looked gleeful as Mr Trump suggested expanding background checks for gun buyers and raising the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21. The Republican president said the NRA has ""great power over you people"", but that the lobby has ""less power over me"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president also accused Senator Pat Toomey of being ""afraid"" of the NRA, even though the Pennsylvania Republican has worked on a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre occurred, agreed with the president. This video can not be played Trump: 'How is it possible my son is watching this?' He said the NRA has a ""veto power"" over any gun control legislation in Congress. Mr Trump said he had previously told NRA officials: ""It's time. We've got to stop this nonsense. It's time."" Breitbart News, a strident backer of the president, criticised him in a bright red headline that said, ""TRUMP THE GUN GRABBER"". ""Take the guns first, go through due process second,"" Mr Trump said, suggesting police officers be given the power to seize guns from anyone who could pose a threat, including the mentally ill, without a court order. ""We can't wait and play games and nothing gets done,"" he added. He called for tighter restrictions on gun sales to young adults and for background checks to be expanded for all weapons purchases, including at gun shows and online. US gun lobby 'doesn't back any ban' America's gun culture in 10 charts Mr Trump repeatedly stated his support for increasing armed security at schools, arming teachers and reducing ""gun-free zones"". ""It would be so beautiful to have one bill that everybody can support, as opposed to - you know - 15 bills, everybody's got their own bill,"" Mr Trump said. He also warned lawmakers against proposing a bill that included concealed carry across the US, a provision that Republicans and the NRA have long campaigned to include in any new gun legislation. Mr Trump has already directed his Justice Department to ban bump-stocks, which enable a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. His remarks appeared to catch many Republican lawmakers unawares, especially as the president has previously been vocal about his support for firearms and the gun lobby. The Senate's second most senior Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, who was sitting next to the president, said it was ""fascinating television"" but ""surreal to actually be there"". ""We're not ditching any constitutional protections simply because the last person the president talked to today doesn't like them,"" said Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who was not at the meeting. Florida Senator Marco Rubio said the proposed reforms might not have prevented last month's high school attack that left 17 people dead in his state. This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class Conservative lawmakers oppose gun restrictions as an infringement of the Second Amendment to the US constitution, which governs the right to bear arms. How Trump turned against gun control Florida shooting: Who are the victims? #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The man who suggested that if his opponent had been elected ""you'd be handing in your rifles"" endorsed taking guns away from people of questionable mental fitness and worrying about due process later. The man who received $30m in support from the National Rifle Association during his presidential campaign scorned Washington politicians for being afraid of the NRA and said it had ""less power"" over him. After a bipartisan meeting with congressional legislators, Donald Trump left heads spinning. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fierce gun-control advocate, clapped in joy, while some gun-rights Republicans wondered whose side the president was on. Of course, we've seen this film before. In a January meeting with a similar group of congressional leaders, Mr Trump expressed support for any comprehensive bipartisan agreement on immigration. In the following days and weeks, his administration did everything it could to undermine the most popular compromise bill. Gun-control supporters may feel they made progress in Wednesday's White House meeting, but the NRA surely will have another chance at the president's ear.

"This video can not be played Meghan Markle on #MeToo and #TimesUp Meghan Markle wants to ""shine a light on women feeling empowered"" as she begins to work with royal charities. She said she hoped to ""hit the ground running"" as she joined Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to discuss their foundation. Her fiance, Harry, joked that the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The Royal Foundation, set up in 2009, focuses on causes close to the royals' hearts, including the armed forces, conservation and mental health. William, Catherine, Harry and Ms Markle held the foundation's first forum on Wednesday to discuss its plans for the future. ""We've all got that same passion to want to make a difference,"" said Ms Markle. The former actress, who is to marry Prince Harry in May, has previously campaigned for the United Nations on topics such as gender equality and modern slavery. She told the forum: ""For me it's very important to want to hit the ground running... even if it's doing it quietly behind the scenes, which is what I've focused my energy on thus far."" Meghan Markle joined Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on stage in London Prince Harry explained he was keen to focus on sustainable tourism over the coming year She went on: ""[I have also been] meeting with the organisations behind the scenes quietly, learning as much as I can so I can maximise the opportunity we have here to really make an impact."" Speaking about her work on women's rights, she said: ""You'll often hear people say: 'You are helping people find their voices'. ""I fundamentally disagree with that because women don't need to find a voice - they have a voice. ""They need to feel empowered to use it and people need to be encouraged to listen."" Ms Markle said she wanted to ""hit the ground running"" after her wedding in May Analysis By Sarah Campbell, Royal Correspondent, BBC News Billed as the inaugural forum of the Royal Foundation - the focus (from the media's perspective anyway) was largely on Meghan Markle. And, as befits an actress, it's fair to say she stole the show. As has become the norm, early tweets focused on what she was wearing (Jason Wu... if you're interested), her manner (totally at ease) and finally, what she said. Prior to her engagement, Ms Markle had been a prominent advocate of female empowerment, not least through her role with UN Women. It is therefore hardly surprising that she was happy to talk about it as an issue. More interestingly, and unprompted, she mentioned the #MeToo and #TimesUp campaigns. She didn't endorse the movements, but even their mention could be seen as a break from usual royal protocol, which generally gives a wide berth to any issue which could be seen as political. Is this a glimpse of a slightly more edgy royal-to-be? What is without doubt is that Ms Markle, under the umbrella of the Royal Foundation, will certainly add to the royal's already considerable campaigning power. The Duchess of Cambridge also gave a short speech at the event The foursome laughed when asked whether they had ever had disagreements when working together. William said ""oh yes"", as Harry added: ""Healthy disagreements."" He continued: ""I think it's really good we've got four different personalities, we've all got that same passion to want to make a difference, but different opinions. ""And I think those opinions work really, really well. Working as family does have its challenges, of course it does... the fact everyone is laughing means you know exactly (what I mean) - but we're stuck together for the rest of our lives."" Prince Harry was also heard mentioning how the family were already busy with the ""wedding"", to which Ms Markle replied: ""We can multi-task."" The Duke of Cambridge gave a speech explaining the foundation's core aims Opening the event, Prince William said the foundation's purpose was not to seek ""quick wins"". He said: ""All of the projects have seen us working to change mindsets to make a real and lasting difference. ""They have all seen us trying to tackle the biggest challenges of the day. ""They have all seen the foundation listening and taking advice from charities and experts, rather than showing up and pretending we have all the answers. ""And they have all seen us uniting people, forming teams and coalitions, to work to make a difference together."" Prince Harry added that he was hoping to focus on sustainable tourism in the future while the Duchess, who is heavily pregnant, spoke about parenthood influencing her charitable work.

"This video can not be played ""Those 17 people aren't going to be there"" - Florida student reflects on first day back in class Two major US retailers have announced new restrictions on gun sales following the shooting at a Florida school where 17 people died. Dick's Sporting Goods, which has more than 600 shops, said it would no longer sell assault-style rifles, and backed ""common sense gun reform"". Walmart later said it was raising the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years. It came as Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School pupils returned to classes. Grief counsellors were on hand as students and teachers arrived at the campus, two weeks after 17 of their peers were shot dead by an expelled former student with an AR-15 rifle. In the aftermath of the 14 February shooting, pressure has mounted on US politicians to act on gun control and for corporations to cut ties with the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA). Firms includingHertz car rental, United airlines and Delta airlines have ended discounts to NRA members. Trump: Lawmakers 'afraid' of US gun lobby Florida school officer defends his actions âSpike in school threatsâ after gun rampage Walmart, the largest seller of guns in the US, said it would remove items from its website that resembled assault-style rifles. The retailerstopped selling high-powered rifles in its shops in 2015,external, citing low demand. In a statement, Walmart said: ""We take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms."" In Washington, President Donald Trump urged a group of lawmakers with diverse views to come up with a comprehensive bipartisan solution in a televised meeting. Republican leaders in Congress have rejected raising the minimum legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, but Mr Trump said he ""would give pretty serious thought to it"", despite opposition from the NRA, which supported him as a candidate. He told the lawmakers: ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA, you can't be petrified."" Also on Wednesday,a teacher in the state of Georgia was arrested after barricading himself in a classroom and firing a handgun.No-one was injured. Guns on display at a Dick's store in Massachusetts In announcing its policy change, Dick's Sporting Goods said in a statement,externalthat it had ""tremendous respect and admiration for the students organising and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country"". It added: ""We have heard you. The nation has heard you."" The retailer said it was committing itself to: No longer selling assault-style rifles (The company had stopped selling such weapons at its main shops after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting but 35 shops run by a subsidiary called Field & Stream had continued to do so) Banning the sale of high-capacity magazines that allow more shots to be fired without reloading Not selling any firearms to anyone under the age of 21 It said that while it supported the Second Amendment to the US constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms, ""gun violence is an epidemic that's taking the lives of too many people"". Dick's CEO Edward Stack told CNN he expected a backlash from some customers, saying ""the hunt business is an important part of the business, no doubt about it"". The Parkland shooting suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, bought a gun at Dick's but not the weapon he is alleged to have used in the attack, Mr Stack said. US gun lobby 'doesn't back any ban' School to close over church rifle event Demi Lovato brings Florida survivors on stage ""We did everything by the book, and we did everything that the law required, and he was still able to buy a gun,"" he told ABC. At Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a line of police officers, school staff and community members bearing flowers greeted some 3,000 students who returned to classes on Wednesday morning. There were also many reporters, shouting questions to the teenagers about how they felt. Lyliah Skinner, a 16-year-old student, told the BBC before she left home: ""We're not going to really be learning much today - it's all about healing."" She also said she was feeling nervous ""because I'm scared it's gonna happen again"". Lyliah listed people she knew who would not be returning, including Joaquin Oliver, who sat just in front of her in a class they shared. Lyliah Skinner packs her bag before returning to school David Hogg, a senior student and now leading activist, was also feeling trepidation. It was ""really hard to think about"" what occurred two weeks ago, he said. ""Imagine getting in a plane crash and having to get back on the same plane again and again and again and being expected to learn and act like nothing's wrong,"" he told NBC News. Florida shooting: Who are the victims? #WhatIf hashtag used to debate gun control The handling of the shooting by authorities sparked criticism after it emerged that the FBI and local police had failed to follow up on multiple tips about Mr Cruz, and that an armed deputy at the school had stayed outside the school building while the attack took place. The school's Building 12, the site of the shootings, will remain closed and cordoned off indefinitely. Students returned for half a day of classes, but the focus was reconnecting with each other Members of Florida's State House and Senate will soon begin reviewing proposed bills related to firearms, which need their approval and also that of Governor Rick Scott. Among other restrictions, they would raise the legal age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and giving police more control to seize weapons from mentally ill people. A controversial $67m voluntary programme to arm school staff, including teachers, would ensure they were trained by law enforcement and allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus, according to the New York Times.

"The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is investigating the breach Germany is investigating a security breach of its defence and interior ministries' private networks, a government spokesman has confirmed. A notorious Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear, or APT28, is being widely blamed in German media. They are thought to be behind a number of cyber-attacks on the West, including breaches in the 2016 US election. The hack was first realised in December and may have lasted up to a year, the DPA news agency reported. The group is reported to have targeted the federal government's internal communications network with malware. Bears with keyboards: Russian hackers snoop on West Is Russia really interfering in European states? What are malware, patches and worms? ""We can confirm that the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and intelligence services are investigating a cyber-security incident concerning the federal government's information technology and networks,"" a German interior ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. He said the attack was ""isolated"" and had been ""brought under control"" but declined to comment on reports of Russian involvement. Fancy Bear was blamed for a similar attack on the lower house of the German parliament in 2015and is also thought to have targeted the Christian Democratic Union party of Chancellor Angela Merkel. The hacking group being widely blamed was also said to behind breaches on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and international sport Officials in the country issued repeated warnings about the potential of ""outside manipulation"" in last year's German election. The hacking group has been linked to the Russian state by multiple security experts investigating its international hacks. They are also known by other names including Sofacy, Pawn Storm, Sednit and Tsar Team. The group played a key role in 2016's attack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in the US, according to security experts.

"Sir James Dyson accused the mainstream car industry of polluting the world with diesel emissions Dyson is seeking an extra 300 engineers in a push to build its first electric car by 2020. Best known for its vacuum cleaners and hand dryers, the firm caused a stir whenit announced plans for a battery powered vehicle. Dyson already has a 400-strong team working on the project and has doubled the number of scientists working on its battery programmes over the past year. The jobs news came as it revealed 2017 underlying earnings rose 27% to Â£801m. Dyson to make electric cars from 2020 Dyson settles legal dispute with ex-chief Dyson is better known for its vacuum cleaners than its cars Dyson said the electric car team - which up until now has been based in its Malmesbury headquarters in the Cotswolds - would shortly move to its new research and development base in Hullavington in Wiltshire. The privately-owned firm is yet to decide where its electric cars - once they have been designed - will be manufactured. The UK is reported to be in contention for the work, along with Singapore, Malaysia and China.

"EU nationals who arrive in the UK during the transition period after Brexit will be eligible for indefinite leave to remain, the government says. Sources say it is a compromise offer to the EU which wants citizens to have exactly the same rights as they do now during the transition period. It means free movement of people is effectively set to continue until the end of the two year or so transition. But the UK says new arrivals should not expect all the same rights as now. The EU wants the transition period - which is intended to smooth the way to the future post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK says it should last around two years from March 2019. May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draft May to fight post-Brexit residency move Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major Brexit: All you need to know Those arriving in the UK after 29 March 2019, the day Britain leaves the EU, will have to register with the authorities if they want to stay longer than three months. They will then be allowed to stay for five years ""working, studying or being self-sufficient"" to qualify to apply for indefinite leave to remain, part of the process of becoming a UK citizen. EU citizens who have been continually living in the EU for five years by 29 March 2019 will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting ""settled status"". They will be able to bring spouses and other family members to the UK automatically under EU free movement rules. Those who arrive after Brexit day will also be able to bring family members to the UK under free movement rules, during the transition period. But - in the main change to the current arrangements - when the transition period has ended they will have to abide by the rules that currently apply to British citizens who want to be joined by family members from outside the EU, such as the minimum income requirement. Since July 2012, UK citizens and settled residents applying to bring a non-EU partner to the country must be earning at least Â£18,600 per year before tax. The threshold is higher for those who are also sponsoring children. Asked how the Home Office proposals differed from free movement - something Theresa May has always insisted will end in March next year - the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We'll have a registration system and some of their rights will be different. ""When we leave EU the free movement directive doesn't apply but during the implementation period people will be free to come and live, work and study here. It's for Brussels to respond, this is us setting out our position."" The Home Office is encouraging EU member states to ""mirror"" these rules for UK citizens moving to EU member states during transition. But in a major sticking point with the EU, the UK is insisting EU citizens arriving in the UK during transition must have their rights defined and interpreted solely in UK law and through the UK courts. British judges will not be able to refer questions of interpretation to the European Court of Justice, the Home Office says. Irish citizens will not be subject to the agreement and therefore will not need to register,the Home Office says in fact sheet explaining the changes,external. When the transition period has ended, the UK will put in place a new immigration system which the Home Office says will ""strengthen control of our borders and address the public's concerns about the impacts of unrestricted immigration from the EU on jobs, wages and public services"". Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ""We have been pressing the Home Office for some time to clarify the arrangements for EU citizens arriving during the transition period so it is sensible that they have finally done so. ""But they should be a bit more straight with people. This new paper reiterates the prime minister's line that the expectations of EU citizens arriving in the UK after our exit will not be the same as those who moved here before our withdrawal, yet it then goes on to provide a long list of ways in which arrangements will be exactly the same. ""The clock is ticking and there isn't time to negotiate or implement an entirely new system of immigration or citizens' rights by March 2019 and they shouldn't suggest that things will change next year when they won't.""

"Italian restaurant chain Prezzo is preparing to close about a third of its outlets in an attempt to rescue the business, the BBC understands. The chain, which is owned by private equity firm TPG Capital, employs about 4,500 people. Prezzo is also expected to completely close its TexMex chain Chimichanga, which has 33 restaurants in the UK. The move to close 100 of its 300 stores would form part of a deal to cut rent costs in the future. Specialist restructuring firm AlixPartners is understood to be drafting a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a step short of going into administration - on the company's behalf. The CVA aims to make Prezzo viable and allow the company to continue trading. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver closes flagship restaurant The situation means that hundreds of jobs are under threat, but the firm may redeploy some staff. Prezzo was bought by TPG in 2014 for just over Â£300m. It is the latest of a string of High Street firms to run into difficulties. The UK arm oftoy retailer Toys R Usandelectronics chain Maplinboth collapsed into administration this week. Burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian have both had to undergo similar restructurings this year, agreeing rescue plans with their lenders and landlords, and closing restaurants. Barbecoa, a smaller chain also owned by Jamie Oliver, went into administration earlier this month. Analysts have said fears over the strength of the UK economy have meant consumers have cut back on discretionary spending. Last year, consumer spending fell for the first time since 2012,according to payments processor Visa.,external Wages have also been rising at a slower pace than inflation, leaving consumers worse off. The restaurant sector has also faced higher costs for the ingredients it buys overseas due to the drop in the pound since the UK voted to leave the European Union.

"Daniel Ek co-founded Swedish streaming company Spotify in 2006 Spotify has filed to list on the New York Stock Exchange in a move that may value the world's biggest music streaming service at more than $23bn (Â£16.7bn). In an unconventional move, the firm will list shares directly on the NYSE. Rather than issue new shares, Spotify's existing shareholders will take their shares directly to the market. That will allow early investors and employees to sell their stakes and is not intended to raise new funding. Mark Mulligan, a UK-based music industry analyst at MIDiA Research, said: ""It's about a company that is letting its investors get their returns so it can move on to the next stage of its career."" Spotify has offered a streaming service since 2008 and has 159 million monthly active users including 71 million paid subscribers globally. Apple Music has about 36 million subscribers, but unlike Spotify it does not offer a free tier supported by advertising. What Spotify must do to survive How bands are escaping the music industry snake pit The fact that Spotify exists at all is something of a minor miracle: unknown Swedish company convinces major record labels to upload millions upon millions of songs for people to listen to without buying them. It must have been quite the pitch. Sure, the labels get royalties but it's pennies - fractions of pennies - on what they used to get from ""traditional"" online sales. Regardless, it's been clear for a long time that streaming is the music industry's future. On Wednesday, Spotify announced it would go public - but that's not to say it is here to stay. The company has long been surrounded by threats, and it's no different today. Apple, Amazon and Google are also in the streaming game and - unlike Spotify - all sell devices on which consumers can listen to music. And while Spotify has signed deals with all the ""big three"" record labels - Warner, Universal and Sony - it's the music executives that still hold the bargaining chips. Read more from Dave Lee here Spotify said its shares sold for between $37.50 and $125 each in private transactions last year and more than $132 this year. The company's potential valuation is based on a combination of stock price and how many shares it has outstanding. The prices shared by Spotify suggest a range of $6.3bn to more than $23bn. The higher figure would make Spotify one of the biggest public debuts of a tech company since 2012, said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research and manages exchange traded funds focused on new public companies. She cautioned, however, that private investors have tended to value firms more highly than public markets in recent years. Snap, owner of Snapchat, for example also had an almost $30bn market capitalisation afterits first day of tradinglast year, but it has struggled to sustain that figure. ""This could be an issue - could it possibly sustain those valuations?"" she said. UK pop star Dua Lipa was one of Spotify's most-streamed artists this year In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,external, Spotify said it has made annual losses every year and lost more than â¬1.2bn in losses in 2017. However, revenues rose almost 40% to â¬4bn last year, according to the filing. Europe is its largest region, with 58 million monthly active users, followed by North America.

"Hope Hicks, one of President Trump's closest advisers, is to step down as White House communications director. The announcement came a day after she testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee, but White House sources said this was not the reason. Ms Hicks, 29, is reported to have told colleagues she was leaving because she felt she had achieved all she could. She has worked for Mr Trump for years. She is the fourth person to serve as the president's communications chief. On Tuesday, Ms Hicks gave a nine-hour testimony in front of the panel investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Ms Hicks is reported to have admitted to the panel that she had occasionally told what amounted to ""white lies"" for President Trump, but she denied lying about anything relevant to the investigation. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders - who described Ms Hicks as ""in a league of her own"" - said it remained unclear when she would leave the administration. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Hicks is reported to have told colleagues she was leaving because she felt she had accomplished all she could in the White House. Her departure will come as a major blow to Mr Trump, who said he would miss having her by his side. A former press secretary, she rose through the ranks to occupy the desk closest to the Oval Office. Ms Hicks kept a low public profile but recently found herself part of a scandal when newspapers exposed that she was in a relationship with White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who had been accused of domestic violence against past partners. Whennews of the allegations against Mr Porterbroke last month, it was Ms Hicks who helped draft an initial White House statement defending him. Mr Trump was reportedly not consulted and was unimpressed with her handling of the controversy. From model to Trump's media director White House aide 'admits white lies' Ms Hicks became head of the White House communications team last August, after the abrupt firing of Anthony Scaramucci. In a statement, Mr Trump said: ""Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person. ""I will miss having her by my side but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future."" Mr Scaramucci, speaking on Fox News, said: ""She's one of the least malicious people I've ever met in my life. She's dedicated, she's charming, she's thoughtful, at the end of the day she's going to have an unbelievable career."" A former campaign official quoted by Politico magazine saidMs Hicks's departure left the White House without an expert ""Trump translator"",external. ""She knew what the president wanted and could explain it to the communications [team],"" the official said. Ms Hicks, Mr Scaramucci, Sean Spicer and Mike Dubke have all served in the role since January 2017. The latest upheaval comes just after Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had his White House security clearance downgraded. On Tuesday night, the president also fired off a fierce tweet against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington Hope Hicks had been there since the beginning; since before the beginning. When the Trump campaign was just a ragtag band of political neophytes, she was the one distributing press releases and answering media requests. Where others had stumbled or been pushed out of Donald Trump's orbit, Hicks quietly persevered - and rode the train all the way to one of the most powerful White House jobs. Now she too is gone. She lasted nearly as long as the preceding three White House communications directors combined, but the position continues to be cursed. Administration sources insist that it was a planned exit, that she was simply waiting for the right time. It's hard, however, to imagine timing worse than this. It comes just a day after her eight hours of testimony before a congressional committee investigating possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, where she reportedly admitted to telling ""white lies"" in defence of the president. Although she may be exiting the White House, it's unlikely she escapes the spotlight so easily. She had a ringside seat to many of the controversies that have swirled around the Trump campaign and presidency - and subsequent revelations could put her name in the headlines again. Ms Hicks is seen as a key witness in the ongoing inquiry into whether the Trump team colluded with Russia. During the nine-hour hearing on Tuesday, she reportedly stonewalled lawmakers about a 2016 meeting between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee investigating alleged Russian meddling, said that she now needed to testify. ""She has no right to claim executive privilege. She has no claim to refuse to come before the judiciary committee now she's stepped down. She should be a witness before the judiciary committee,"" he said.

Almost 700 of KFC's UK outlets were closed last week after it decided to switch suppliers from Bidvest to DHL. At the time, DHL blamed ""operational issues"" at a warehouse near Rugby it was using for deliveries nationwide. The chain has apologised to customers, running a newspaper ad showing a photo of a chicken bucket with the KFC logo letters rearranged to read ""FCK"". The accompanying text read: ""WE'RE SORRY. A chicken restaurant without any chicken. It's not ideal... Thank you for bearing with us."" The GMB union criticised KFC's decision to move its contract from Bidvest, which national officer Mick Rix said was a ""very well respected, specialised logistics provider"", to one that lacked a track record in food distribution.

"At one point, Alfie had 3,000 seizures and 48 hospital visits in a year The Home Office says it is considering allowing a medical cannabis trial to treat a six-year-old boy with a rare form of epilepsy. It previously turned down requests by the family of Alfie Dingley, from Warwickshire, tolegally take the drug. But now ministers say they are ""exploring every option"", following a meeting with the family. An option could be a three-month trial, led by Alfie's doctors and based on ""sufficient and rigorous evidence"". Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, described the move as a ""lifeline"". This video can not be played Hannah Deacon tells Victoria Derbyshire ""I'm tired of seeing my son suffer"" However the Home Office has stressed that ""no decisions have been made"". Alfie, from Kenilworth, can suffer up to 30 violent seizures a day. Midlands Live: Snow and ice causing major disruption; A&E at tipping point after consultant quits Ms Deacon took him to the Netherlands to take a cannabis-based medication in September and said, while there, his seizures reduced in number, duration and severity. Speaking to the BBC, Ms Deacon said: ""We're very positive that [the Home Office] have given us this lifeline. I think they see what a serious issue we have here."" She described witnessing the seizures as ""the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life."" ""I'm his mum, I'm not a politician, not an activist, I'm just a mum tired of seeing him suffer and I've found something that helps him. ""It's his human right to be well."" Alfie's condition is very rare, affecting only nine boys in the world Home Office Policing Minister Nick Hurd MP met with the family on Monday. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The Government has a huge amount of sympathy for the rare and difficult situation that Alfie and his family are faced with. ""The Policing Minister wants to explore every option and has met with Alfie's family to discuss treatments that may be accessible for him. ""No decisions have been made and any proposal would need to be led by senior clinicians using sufficient and rigorous evidence."" Ms Deacon described the plan as a ""sincere offer because they want to help us"". Nick Hurd wants to ""explore every option"" for Alfie's treatment Members of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on drug policy reform are calling on the government to assist with Alfie's plight. Group co-chair, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said: ""It would be heartless and cruel not to allow Alfie to access the medication.""
