"The waiting list for hospital treatment will not start falling for two years, ministers say, despite unveiling aplan,externalto tackle England's backlog in care. Six million people are on a waiting list - one in nine of the population. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this number would probably increase, with demand expected to rise now Covid pressure was easing. He also set out plans to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. These include a 28-day target for cancer diagnosis by March 2024, which should have been introduced last year but was delayed by the pandemic. The proportion of cancer patients starting treatment within 62 days would return to its pre-pandemic level by March 2023, Mr Javid said, although this would still leave it some way short of the 85% target. Waiting times would be cut by a 30% rise in the NHS's capacity for treatment, he said. Crucial to this will be the establishment of a network of 160 community diagnostic centres along with surgical hubs focused on high-volume routine surgery away from major hospital sites - to increase efficiency and reduce the chance of emergency cases leading to cancellations. Extra investment of Â£8bn over the next three years, funded through a national-insurance rise, will pay for these new facilities. To free up staff time, follow-up appointments would be arranged on a case-by-case basis, rather than for all patients automatically, Mr Javid said. And a new online service, My Planned Care, will inform patients about waiting times and how to prepare for treatment. The plan would not just ""reset"" the NHS to where it had been before Covid, Mr Javid said, but build on what had been learned and make it ""fit for the future"". ""Just as we came together to tackle the virus, now we must come together in a new national mission to fight what the virus has brought with it,"" he said.

The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed.

People are thought to have been deterred from seeking help for non-urgent care, everything from knee and hip surgery to treatment for sight problems and joint pain. And the health secretary said the NHS was working on the basis half of these ""missing patients"" could now come forward. He also promised to eliminate waits of over a year by 2025. Currently more than 300,000 people have waited this long, up from 1,600 before Covid hit. There was no promise to meet the target of seeing 92% of patients within 18 weeks, however, last achieved in 2016. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said tackling the backlog would take time and ""cannot happen overnight"" but promised the health service would apply the same ""can-do"" spirit it had  throughout the pandemic. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting accused the Tories of ""mismanagement"" of the NHS, pointing out performance had been declining before the pandemic. And he said there was nothing in the health secretary's plan about tackling the ""single biggest challenge"" facing the NHS - the lack of staff. ""There are 93,000 staffing vacancies in the NHS today,"" Mr Streeting said. ""It is understaffed, overworked - and if he's not careful, he will lose more people than he is able to recruit.""

"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said the Church of England is taking too long to remove memorials linked to the slave trade. Mr Welby criticised delays in taking down a plaque to slavery financier Tobias Rustat at a Cambridge college chapel. ""Why is it so much agony to remove a memorial to slavery?"" he said. Earlier at the General Synod, the head of a Church racial justice body said the lack of change was ""a scandal"". A Church court is consideringwhether a plaque to 17th Century courtier Mr Rustat, who invested in the Royal African Company, can be removed from the wall of a chapel at Jesus College, Cambridge. The college, which proposed the removal, says Mr Rustat's financial involvement in the company helped it to enslave 150,000 African men, women and children over 50 years - more than any other institution. Mr Welby pointed out that Jesus College now has a black woman as its master, Sonita Alleyne, who has to look at a memorial to a man who financed slavery ""every time she sits in her stall"". The archbishop questioned why it was ""so difficult"" to remove the marble plaque, when the college only wanted to move it to another location where it can be interpreted and explained. ""We need to change our practices,"" he said. Tobias Rustat, a major benefactor of Jesus College, commissioned the memorial plaque himself Mr Welby was responding after Labour peer Lord Boateng - chair of the Archbishops' Racial Justice Commission, which aims to identify and root out systemic racism in the church - drew applause as he said the Church's lack of action on race issues was ""chilling"". He said statues and monuments to people involved in the slave trade caused him hurt, while the failure to improve diversity meant ""the government front bench looks better"" than the Church's leadership. Only one out of 42 senior bishops is from an ethnic minority, compared to six out of 23 members of the cabinet. ""Imagine what it is to go into a place of worship to look up and to see a monument to someone who was a party to the enslavement of your ancestors,"" said Lord Boateng. ""We are members in churches which have themselves benefitted from the horrors of the slave trade. That is the reality."" He referred to the church's missionary organisation, the Society of the Propagation of the Gospel, which owned a plantation in the 18th Century - and which branded the word ""Society"" on the skins of the people they enslaved.

"Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst (left) and director Jane Campion are all recognised for The Power of the Dog Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog, an intense Western starring Benedict Cumberbatch, leads this year's Oscar board with 12 nominations. It is closely followed by Dune, which has 10, and Belfast and West Side Story, which have seven each. Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Garfield are among the UK nominees in the lead acting categories. Dame Judi Dench and CiarÃ¡n Hinds are nominated for their supporting roles in Sir Kenneth Branagh's Belfast. His autobiographical black-and-white film about a family in Northern Ireland during The Troubles is one of 10 films in the running for best picture. Sir Kenneth, who is also nominated for best director, said in a statement: ""It's a long way from the streets of Belfast to the Academy Awards. Dame Judi Dench is nominated for her performance in Belfast, while Sir Kenneth Branagh is up for best director ""Today, I think of my mother and father, and my grandparents - how proud they were to be Irish, how much this city meant to them. They would have been overwhelmed by this incredible honour - as am I. ""Given a story as personal as this one, it's a hell of a day for my family, and the family of our film. I thank Academy voters for their incredible and generous recognition."" The Oscar nominations in full We need to talk about why Bruno won't win an Oscar Read more about the films in this year's awards race Sir Kenneth becomes the first person to be nominated in seven different Oscar categories throughout his career. He already has director, actor, supporting actor, adapted screenplay and live action short nominations, but can now add best original screenplay and best picture. He is yet to win, however. With her nomination, New Zealand director Jane Campion becomes the first woman to have been nominated for best director twice, having been recognised for The Piano in 1993. Her film, The Power of the Dog, is a slow and suspenseful western which also scored nominations for three of its supporting actors - Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kirsten Dunst. Dune, which stars Zendaya and TimothÃ©e Chalamet, is one of 10 nominees for best picture The Power of the Dog - 12 Dune - 10 Belfast - 7 West Side Story - 7 King Richard - 6 Don't Look Up - 4 Nightmare Alley - 4 Drive My Car - 4 Andrew Garfield (right) is nominated for his performance in Tick Tick... Boom!, directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (left) Many nominees shared their joy on social media after the Academy unveiled its shortlists on Tuesday. Jessica Chastain, nominated for her leading performance in The Eyes of Tammy Faye,tweeted:,external""This morning felt like a dream"". Australian actor Kodi Smit-McPhee said he was ""deeply honoured"" to have been recognised as a best supporting actor nominee in the Power of the Dog. Belfast star CiarÃ¡n Hinds, another nominee in that category, said in a statement: ""Having worked in this industry for nearly 50 years, I thought there wasn't much that could surprise me still. Today, I can honestly say, I am astounded, thrilled and deeply grateful."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""All I long for is to tell stories that remind us of how to live,"" Garfield said in a statement. ""Jonathan's story offers us a treasure map. Thank you for keeping his song reverberating through our universe."" Jessie Buckley told RTÃ,externalshe was in ""complete shock"" after being nominated for best supporting actress, adding: ""The Lost Daughter is so special to me... To be recognised for anything connected to it is just a wild dream come true.""

Two couples are nominated within the 20 acting places that were available. Penelope Cruz (Parallel Mothers) and Javier Bardem (Being The Ricardos) have been married since 2010, while Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst are engaged. In a statement, Dunst said: ""To be honored by the Academy is a truly humbling experience. For both Jesse and I to get our first nominations together is beyond our wildest dreams."" Denzel Washington's nomination for The Tragedy of Macbeth is his 10th, extending the record he already holds as the most nominated black actor ever. Will Smith has been nominated for best actor for his performance in King Richard There is no overlap between the best actress and best picture categories - all five women nominated for a leading role appeared in films which did not make it into the top category. This is common at the Oscars. While Frances McDormand and Nomadland synced their wins last year, that was the first time in 15 years that the winner of best actress appeared in the film that also won best picture. Efforts to nominate more popular films and make the Oscars more relevant to young people were only partly successful, as fans of James Bond and Spider-Man were left disappointed. Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi saga Dune was the most successful film to get a best picture nod, after taking $400m (Â£294m) at the box office worldwide. House of Gucci's Lady Gaga (far right) and Jared Leto (second left) both missed out in their respective acting categories With far more films in the awards season race this year and only a limited number of slots available in each category, it was inevitable that some films and stars would miss out. The voting system means that, while the Academy does not choose to actively reject a particular movie, director or actor, a heavily-tipped contender can miss out if they don't get as many votes as some of their peers. For example, the red carpet will have to do without without Lady Gaga and her Oscars outfit this year. She had been tipped for a best actress nomination for House of Gucci, but has missed out. It's not a good year to be both a musician and an actor. Gaga's co-star Jared Leto, who is also the singer with Thirty Seconds To Mars, and Alana Haim, who has gone from the band Haim to starring in Licorice Pizza, were both in contention but have been overlooked. Kristen Stewart did make it on to the best actress list, though, for playing Princess Diana in Spencer. Her first Oscar nomination, the former Twilight star was the frontrunner to win a few months ago, but Spencer has rapidly fallen out of favour and it wasn't certain that she would be nominated. On the best supporting actress list, Dame Judi had been an outsider to be nominated for Belfast - but she is loved by the Oscars, and has now received her eighth career nomination. Her on-screen daughter-in-law Caitriona Balfe, who was thought to have been Belfast's more likely representative in that category, was not recognised. The Lost Daughter has scored acting nominations for Jessie Buckley (far left) and Olivia Colman (second right) Irish star Jessie Buckley was also something of a surprise in the best supporting actress category. She plays the younger version of Olivia Colman's character in The Lost Daughter - with Colman herself up for best actress, days after being snubbed in the Bafta nominations. Overall, Oscar voters liked The Power of the Dog a bit more than expected, and liked Dune a bit less than expected - typified by the fact that, although Dune has 10 nominations, Denis Villeneuve didn't make the cut for best director. Tracee Ellis Ross and Leslie Jordan announced the nominations in Los Angeles on Tuesday. There is pressure to make the Oscars more popular with and relevant to young audiences, after 2021's pared-down ceremonytanked in the ratings,,externalpartly due to the absence of big film releases during lockdown. The Academy has confirmed the ceremony will have a host this year, but has not yet revealed who it will be. The ceremony hasn't had a host since Jimmy Kimmel was at the helm in 2018. Instead, a variety of celebrity guests have introduced individual categories and announced winners. This year's ceremony will take place on Sunday 27 March.

"A hacker allegedly made off with nearly 120,000 Bitcoin - now valued at about $5bn - in 2016 after breaching the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange Stolen Bitcoin worth more than $4bn (Â£2.9bn) has been seized by the US Department of Justice - the largest ever confiscation of its kind. Officials also charged two people on Tuesday with attempting to launder the money, stolen by a hacker who breached a cryptocurrency platform in 2016. The hacker allegedly made off with nearly 120,000 Bitcoin. Then valued at about $71m, its value now exceeds $5bn. About 94,000 Bitcoin have been recovered. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr said the seizure was proof the government ""will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system"". The money originates from the 2016 hack of a crypto exchange known as Bitfinex. According to Justice Department officials, a hacker breached the platform, made more than 2,000 unauthorised transactions and then funnelled the money into a digital wallet allegedly run by Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, of New York. A criminal complaint alleges Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, laundered about 25,000 of the stolen Bitcoin through various accounts over the past five years and used various methods to cover their tracks, from fake identities to converting their Bitcoin into other digital currencies. Investigators from Washington DC, New York, Chicago and Ansbach, Germany collaborated on the lengthy probe. In a statement, Bitfinex said it had cooperated with the inquiry and was ""pleased"" the stolen funds had been recovered. Lichtenstein and Morgan will appear before a federal judge later on Tuesday, on counts of conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If found guilty, they could each serve up to 25 years in prison. The asset seizure comes four months after the launch of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team  at the Justice Department. In what is believed to be its previous largest financial seizure, the team seized some $2.3m in cryptocurrency last year, recovering the ransom paid by the Colonial Pipeline company to end a crippling cyberattack. Correction 9th February: This article originally reported that the record seizure by the US Department of Justice amounted to $5bn in stolen Bitcoin. In fact 94,000 of the 120,000 stolen Bitcoin have been recovered, at a value of $4bn (Â£2.9bn) and so we have amended the article to make this clear.

"The co-founder of exercise brand Peloton is to step down from leading the company as it plans to cut thousands of jobs. John Foley, chief executive of the firm for 10 years, will be replaced by Barry McCarthy, the former chief financial officer of Spotify. Despite the change, one of Peloton's biggest investors doubled down on its calls for the company to be sold. Amazon, Nike and Apple are rumoured to be interested in bidding for the firm. The company, which pairs its equipment with streaming and live exercise classes, had seen sales of its bikes and treadmills soar during the pandemic, but the post-lockdown return to gyms has left the firm worth less than a fifth of its peak $50bn valuation. Mr Foley said Mr McCarthy was the ""right leader to take the company into its next phase of growth"". Mr Foley will become Peloton's executive chairman. After announcing the change in leadership, US-based Peloton also said it will cut about 2,800 jobs globally due to a drop in demand for its products. Shares in the firm jumped by as much as 19% on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. John Foley is stepping down as Peloton's chief executive But one of Peloton's top investors, Blackwells Capital, which owns a near 5% stake in the company, said the changes did not address the concerns of investors and renewed its calls from last month for the company to be sold. ""Mr Foley has proven he is not suited to lead Peloton, whether as CEO or executive chair, and he should not be hand-picking directors, as he appears to have done today,"" added Jason Aintabi, chief investment officer at Blackwells. In a presentation sent by Blackwells to Peloton on Monday, the investment firm said the company had been ""horribly mismanaged, with unbridled enthusiasm taking the place of disciplined leadership"". The presentation,externalattacked Mr Foley's abilities as a leader, saying he had made ""a series of poor decisions relating to product, pricing, demand, safety and capital allocation"". Blackwells has previously said Peloton and its customer base were ""extremely attractive"" to companies such as Nike, Apple, Disney and Sony, which are looking to boost their presence in the home, health and wellness sectors. Mr Foleytold The Wall Street Journal,external, that the company was ""open to exploring any opportunity that could create value for Peloton shareholders"" but declined to comment further. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said that the leadership change made it more likely that Peloton would ultimately be sold. ""If a bidding process begins, we view Apple as the likely acquirer due to the clear strategic fit with its healthcare/fitness/subscription initiatives, while Amazon and Nike among others could be potential bidders in the mix,"" they added. ""The reality is that Foley was the pilot on the Peloton growth plane and him leaving paints a bleak picture with the main visionary no longer in charge."" Analysts have estimated that Peloton could be valued between $12bn and $15bn, depending on timing and the competition. Setting out its plans to cut costs on Tuesday, Peloton said along with worker cuts, around 20% of its corporate staff would made redundant. Mr Foley said the decision was ""not taken lightly"". The company expects its restructuring programme to cost about $130m, which will be related to severance packages. The company also said it was ""winding down"" the development of the Peloton Output Park - a factory in Ohio where it had hoped to make its exercise equipment and create 2,000 jobs. Shelving the plant will cost $60m. Peloton reported its ""connected fitness"" subscriptions in the second quarter of its financial year grew by 66% from a year earlier, while its paid digital members rose 38%. Total revenue in the quarter grew 6% to $1.1bn. The company, which previously expected sales of $4.4bn to $4.8bn this financial year, has revised down its forecast to $3.7bn to $3.8bn. Billions, starring British actor Damian Lewis, depicted one character's brush with a Peloton bike Aside from demand falling for its products, there have also been recent PR disasters for the company, including when TV characters hadheart attacks when using Peloton machines. A fictional character in the Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That died of a heart attack using a Peloton machine, and there was also a brush with death in Billions. After the And Just Like That death, Peloton tried to recover the PR narrative with a parody advert featuring Chris Noth alive and well, and benefitting from exercise. But that backfired after allegations of sexual assault, which he denied. Meanwhile in August the US Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said they were investigating the company after a child was pulled under one of its treadmills and killed, while other customers had reported injuries. Weeks after the reports, Peloton recalled 125,000 of its Tread+ running machines after initially saying there was ""no reason"" to stop using the machine before changing its stance.

"ScotRail has said its peak-time commuter services will not return to pre-pandemic levels - despite 150 services being added from May. The rail operator previously announcedit would drop from its pre-Covid number of 2,400 services a day to 2,100. It said the move was in line with new travel patterns and overcapacity on some routes. That figure has now been revised, but returning services will be during the day rather than at traditional peaks. The Scottish government'sadvice on working from homechanged last month, with employers asked to implement a phased return to hybrid working - at home, and in the office. However, ScotRail's operations director David Simpson saidevidence gathered during a consultation process,externalsuggested hybrid working would mean there would continue to be ""plenty of space"" on commuter services. He told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""People's commuting habits are changing hugely.

Scotland's rail operator posts losses of Â£64.5m The timetable switch will come after Dutch-based Abellio - which currently runs the ScotRail franchice -is stripped of its contract from 1 April. ScotRail, which covers all passenger services in Scotland except those run by other operators which cross the border, will then be brought under Scottish government control. The rail operator has defended its decision to review services, saying revenue has been slashed since March 2020 while costs have stayed the same. Mr Simpson said: ""The service is only being used by about 50% of the number of customers who used it before the pandemic. ""There is absolutely plenty of space on the current service levels to cope with the commuter and leisure demand. ""We are monitoring that on a daily basis and if there is any need to lengthen trains or put more services on, we will do so. But so far there has been no evidence of that. ""The peak, commuter services won't see a return to pre-pandemic levels. ""What are doing is focusing services on the middle of the day and at the weekends, where the evidence is showing that people really want to travel."" Railway unions have accused the company of using Covid as a cover for cuts. ScotRail said it had not had to lay off a single member of staff and wanted to work with trade unions ""to provide a safe and reliable railway"".

"Adele will give her first performance at the Brit Awards since 2016 The 2022 Brit Awards take place at the O2 Arena on Tuesday night, with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Dave and Little Simz leading the nominations. All four artists are up for the night's biggest prizes - artist and album of the year - alongside Sam Fender. The ceremony is being hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who takes over from Jack Whitehall. ""I'm still pinching myself,"" says the star, who firsttweeted about his ambitions to helm the show in 2011,external. ""I don't know who's won what - or even who's nominated for what! There might even be a little surprise performance. I don't know just yet."" All will be revealed when the show starts at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday. It will be broadcast live on ITV, and on YouTube for viewers outside the UK. Adele to return to stage at Brit Awards Brit Awards announce first gender-neutral nominees Brit Awards 2022: Full list of nominees Dave is one of the most highly-anticipated performers of the night Last year's Brit Awards took place as part of the government's pilot scheme for the return of live events. Covid restrictions necessitated a mixture of live and virtual performances, with artists like Coldplay, The Weeknd and Elton John appearing on tape. This year, organisers have vowed to ""keep everything in the room"" - even when that meantscrapping a planned performance from US star Doja Cat, after members of her team tested positive for Covid. As a result, Tuesday's performances are exclusively coming from British artists - including all five artist of the year nominees: Adele, Dave, Ed Sheeran, Little Simz and Sam Fender. Of those, Dave has the most to live up to. Hisaudacious, politically-charged, performance of Black,externalin 2019 is one of the most powerful Brits moments of all time. And even if he chooses to play his biggest hit from last year - the largely apolitical Stormzy collaboration, Clash - he's bound to make the most of his four minutes on stage. Elsewhere, Holly Humberstone, winner of the Rising Star prize and an electrifying live performer, will make her Brits debut; while Anne-Marie and KSI will play their platinum-certified, song of the year-nominated hit, Don't Play. And bringing a touch of old-school rock and roll energy is Liam Gallagher, who'll be showcasing his new single, Everything's Electric. Could Little Simz beat more established stars like Adele and Ed Sheeran? It's almost impossible to ignore the sales juggernaut that is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins. Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks. The Brits are set up to reward commercial success - so she would appear to be a lock-in for the best artist and album categories. And if Adele wins the other two prizes she's nominated for (song of the year and best pop artist) she'll tie with Robbie Williams as the most-awarded artist in Brits history, with 13 trophies weighing down her mantlepiece. Rapper Little Simz is the dark horse in the best album race. Her smart, funky record Sometimes I Might Be Introvert wasmusic critics' favourite album of 2021, and her producer, Inflo, has already been namedproducer of the year. If the 1,300-strong voting academy reflects those choices, Simz could be going home with her first-ever Brit. For song of the year, my money is on Glass Animals - whose dream-pop anthem Heat Waves has become a streaming phenomenon. First released in October 2020, it has spent 61 weeks on the UK charts, eventually climbing into the top five at the end of last year. Amongst the 10 nominees, it has the highest total of Spotify streams - 1.2 billion, compared to the 885 million for Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, and the 636 million earned by Adele's Easy On Me. For best group, Little Mix are a good shout. There's a lot of affection for them in the industry, and this will be the last chance to reward Jade, Perrie and Leigh-Anne before they go on hiatus later this year. But voters could also be swayed by the reassuring presence of Coldplay - who've picked up a record ninth best group nomination - and Wolf Alice, whose Blue Weekend was one of the best-reviewed albums of 2021. Dua Lipa was the last person to win best female, in 2021, before the category was retired The Brits took the decision to scrap gendered awards last year, falling in line with other major music prizes like the Grammys, MTV Awards and Australia's Arias. The move attracted some criticism from the likes of Piers Morgan and culture secretary Nadine Dorries - who said she was concerned about how the new system ""would work in terms of fair gender representation"". In the end, more women have been nominated than at any time in the past decade; and it seems fair to assume Adele will walk away with the lion's share of the prizes. Brits chairman Tom March says the move away from best male and female prizes ""felt right"". ""I like the idea of creating the biggest award and accolade possible - and artist of the year has that gravitas,""he told Music Week,external. ""The most important thing for me was making sure it didn't reduce opportunity,"" he added, noting that the creation of five new awards - including best dance and best pop act - had created ""opportunities for more artists to be nominated"". This video can not be played How Mo Gilligan predicted he'd host the Brits in 2011 Every Brits host puts their own stamp on the show. James Corden was the effusive music fan, Dermot O'Leary was the polished entertainer and Jack Whitehall terrorised innocent pop stars with his barbed asides. ""You've got to be so sharp, man,"" says Mo Gilligan, who's taking over this year. ""Remember when you went to school and you had a compass to draw circles? That's how sharp you've got to be. ""But that's the cool thing about the Brits. You can have moments where it can be a bit chaotic and there's some carnage - but then you can have iconic moments where you're like, 'Oh my God, I was there and I seen that live'."" The comedian and Masked Singer judge says he'll be less confrontational than his predecessor. ""I feel like I'm the person who's party you're coming to, but not everyone knows each other, so I've got to make sure everyone's having a great time."" Pop star Olivia Rodrigo could go home with two trophies These are much harder to call. The competition for best international artist is unbelievably tough - with Billie Eilish facing off against Taylor Swift, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X. But the one to beat is Olivia Rodrigo, whose debut album Sour was the UK's fourth biggest record of the year. She also made her live debut at last year's Brit Awards, something that is sure to linger in the minds of the voting academy. Rodrigo's pop-punk anthem Good 4U has a good shot at winning best international song, too. Other strong contenders include The Weeknd's Save Your Tears and Lil Nas X's Montero (Call Me By Your Name). Front-runners for best international group are Abba, who are riding a huge wave of affection following their unexpected comeback last September. If they win, it'll be the Swedish band's first ever Brit Award. They only have one previous nomination - for best album - in 1977. ""I must say, I don't think we've ever had such good reviews as we have for this album,"" says songwriter and keyboard player Benny Andersson. ""Obviously we're kosher now and we weren't in the '70s."" And if they win, how will he celebrate? ""I don't know,"" he laughs. ""I can send you a text to tell you.""

Adele won three out the four main prizes at Brit Awards on Tuesday, where she also put in an assured performance of her track I Drink Wine. The singer won best artist, album and song of the year for Easy on Me. Ed Sheeran was also crowned songwriter of the year at London's O2 Arena, and played two tracks, including one alongside special guest Stormzy. Dua Lipa won the night's other big prize, as TikTok users voted for her and not Adele as the best pop/R&B act. It means that for now at least, Robbie Williams remains out on his own ahead of Adele as the most awarded artist in Brits history with 13. After winning the first of her three awards, for best song, Adele beamed: ""I can't believe a piano ballad won up against that many bangers"". Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks, and this was recognised by the Brits, which rewards mainstream success.

""Come on my guy, come down man - I know you like a cheeseboard. Look at you looking for the Dairylea.""

The South Shields rocker thanked his manager for ""walking into that pub 10 years ago"" and discovering him. Abba were last nominated for a Brit Award in 1977, losing out to Simon & Garfunkel and the same fate befell them on Tuesday, as Silk Sonic - aka Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak [sic] - took the best international group. Billie Eilish fended off competition from Olivia Rodrigo to win best international artist. But 18-year-old Rodrigo, who made her live debut at last year's awards, made up for it by winning best international song for her pop-punk anthem Good 4U. Other winners on the night included last year's big winner, Dave for best hip-hop/grime/rap, Wolf Alice for best group, and Becky Hill for best dance. Holly Humberstone knew before she arrived she had won the rising star award. She told the BBC that her rapid ascent, which has happened during the pandemic, has been ""very strange to me"" so far.

Bamber Gascoigne on the University Challenge set in 1968 Paul Sinha, star of ITV's quiz show The Chase,tweeted:,external""[Gascoigne's] effortless erudition, making whole swathes of impenetrable knowledge seem cheerfully accessible, was totally inspiring to this kid of the 80s. Sadly we may never see his like on our screens again."" Former University Challenge contestantBobby Seagull wrote:,external""Farewell Bamber Gascoigne... He set the tone for one of the best UK TV quiz shows. Scholarly, gentle and yet commanding, he joins the pantheon of great gameshow hosts. We shall miss you. RIP Bamber."" Only Connect presenterVictoria Coren Mitchell said,external: ""No quiz host has ever seemed more like they could answer all the questions themselves."" University Challenge aired on ITV for 25 years before being revived on the BBC in 1994 with Jeremy Paxman as the quiz master. Gascoigne also found cult fame after an episode of anarchic sitcom The Young Ones was named after him - titled Bambi - in 1984. Gascoigne died at his home in Richmond following a short illness The League of Gentleman star and Sherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss played Gascoigne in the 2006 film Starter for Ten. Author David Nicholls, who wrote the book the film was based on,posted on Twitter:,external""Very sad to see this. Bamber was a big part of my TV childhood and was very gracious about his fictional cameo in Starter For Ten. He came to the book launch and left me quite starstruck."" Gascoigne also presented 1977 ITV documentary series The Christians and the 1990 Channel 4 TV series The Great Moghuls, and created an online history encyclopaedia called HistoryWorld. More recently, his Surrey home has become familiar to fans of the BBC comedy Ghosts. He inherited West Horsley Place - which is known as Button House in the series - from his aunt, the Duchess of Roxburghe, in 2014. Bamber and Christina Gascoigne were together for 62 years and married for 55 The 15th Century house is also home to Grange Park Opera's summer festival. In a statement, Christina Gascoigne said: ""Bamber and I had a fantastic 62 years together full of friends and adventures. We never had a quarrel, not even when I turned the car over while we were driving to India. ""He was an incredibly generous man and everything he did was pointed towards sharing the gifts of his own life with others - he was even instrumental in the creation of a new Thames boat: the skerry (a cross between the skiff and the wherry) so that schoolchildren could enjoy the river as much as he did. ""For 30 years, we swam in the river every day possible (only in the summer). He loved opera and was thrilled that he could have an opera house in the garden he inherited from his aunt Mary Roxburghe. ""It was 50 years ago that he hosted University Challenge, but that is what everyone remembers. That and his limitless thirst for knowledge, which he retained like a sponge."" Bamber Gascoigne was made a CBE by the Queen in 2018 Gascoigne was born in London and won scholarships to Eton and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he met his wife. He also co-wrote the 1950s musical revue Share My Lettuce, which showcased rising stars Kenneth Williams and Dame Maggie Smith. The TV host was appointed CBE in 2018 for services to the arts. In a statement, Peter Gwyn, executive producer of University Challenge, said everyone on the show ""has been deeply saddened to hear of Bamber's death, and our thoughts and sympathy go to his family and friends"". ""Bamber was unlike anyone else on television when the programme started back in 1962 - he was utterly charming, erudite and, at times, seemingly omniscient, and his 25 years spent presenting the programme established it firmly as the institution it is now. He was a unique presence in British broadcasting and he'll be very sadly missed.""

"Adele will give her first performance at the Brit Awards since 2016 The 2022 Brit Awards take place at the O2 Arena on Tuesday night, with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Dave and Little Simz leading the nominations. All four artists are up for the night's biggest prizes - artist and album of the year - alongside Sam Fender. The ceremony is being hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who takes over from Jack Whitehall. ""I'm still pinching myself,"" says the star, who firsttweeted about his ambitions to helm the show in 2011,external. ""I don't know who's won what - or even who's nominated for what! There might even be a little surprise performance. I don't know just yet."" All will be revealed when the show starts at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday. It will be broadcast live on ITV, and on YouTube for viewers outside the UK. Adele to return to stage at Brit Awards Brit Awards announce first gender-neutral nominees Brit Awards 2022: Full list of nominees Dave is one of the most highly-anticipated performers of the night Last year's Brit Awards took place as part of the government's pilot scheme for the return of live events. Covid restrictions necessitated a mixture of live and virtual performances, with artists like Coldplay, The Weeknd and Elton John appearing on tape. This year, organisers have vowed to ""keep everything in the room"" - even when that meantscrapping a planned performance from US star Doja Cat, after members of her team tested positive for Covid. As a result, Tuesday's performances are exclusively coming from British artists - including all five artist of the year nominees: Adele, Dave, Ed Sheeran, Little Simz and Sam Fender. Of those, Dave has the most to live up to. Hisaudacious, politically-charged, performance of Black,externalin 2019 is one of the most powerful Brits moments of all time. And even if he chooses to play his biggest hit from last year - the largely apolitical Stormzy collaboration, Clash - he's bound to make the most of his four minutes on stage. Elsewhere, Holly Humberstone, winner of the Rising Star prize and an electrifying live performer, will make her Brits debut; while Anne-Marie and KSI will play their platinum-certified, song of the year-nominated hit, Don't Play. And bringing a touch of old-school rock and roll energy is Liam Gallagher, who'll be showcasing his new single, Everything's Electric. Could Little Simz beat more established stars like Adele and Ed Sheeran? It's almost impossible to ignore the sales juggernaut that is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins. Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks. The Brits are set up to reward commercial success - so she would appear to be a lock-in for the best artist and album categories. And if Adele wins the other two prizes she's nominated for (song of the year and best pop artist) she'll tie with Robbie Williams as the most-awarded artist in Brits history, with 13 trophies weighing down her mantlepiece. Rapper Little Simz is the dark horse in the best album race. Her smart, funky record Sometimes I Might Be Introvert wasmusic critics' favourite album of 2021, and her producer, Inflo, has already been namedproducer of the year. If the 1,300-strong voting academy reflects those choices, Simz could be going home with her first-ever Brit. For song of the year, my money is on Glass Animals - whose dream-pop anthem Heat Waves has become a streaming phenomenon. First released in October 2020, it has spent 61 weeks on the UK charts, eventually climbing into the top five at the end of last year. Amongst the 10 nominees, it has the highest total of Spotify streams - 1.2 billion, compared to the 885 million for Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, and the 636 million earned by Adele's Easy On Me. For best group, Little Mix are a good shout. There's a lot of affection for them in the industry, and this will be the last chance to reward Jade, Perrie and Leigh-Anne before they go on hiatus later this year. But voters could also be swayed by the reassuring presence of Coldplay - who've picked up a record ninth best group nomination - and Wolf Alice, whose Blue Weekend was one of the best-reviewed albums of 2021. Dua Lipa was the last person to win best female, in 2021, before the category was retired The Brits took the decision to scrap gendered awards last year, falling in line with other major music prizes like the Grammys, MTV Awards and Australia's Arias. The move attracted some criticism from the likes of Piers Morgan and culture secretary Nadine Dorries - who said she was concerned about how the new system ""would work in terms of fair gender representation"". In the end, more women have been nominated than at any time in the past decade; and it seems fair to assume Adele will walk away with the lion's share of the prizes. Brits chairman Tom March says the move away from best male and female prizes ""felt right"". ""I like the idea of creating the biggest award and accolade possible - and artist of the year has that gravitas,""he told Music Week,external. ""The most important thing for me was making sure it didn't reduce opportunity,"" he added, noting that the creation of five new awards - including best dance and best pop act - had created ""opportunities for more artists to be nominated"". This video can not be played How Mo Gilligan predicted he'd host the Brits in 2011 Every Brits host puts their own stamp on the show. James Corden was the effusive music fan, Dermot O'Leary was the polished entertainer and Jack Whitehall terrorised innocent pop stars with his barbed asides. ""You've got to be so sharp, man,"" says Mo Gilligan, who's taking over this year. ""Remember when you went to school and you had a compass to draw circles? That's how sharp you've got to be. ""But that's the cool thing about the Brits. You can have moments where it can be a bit chaotic and there's some carnage - but then you can have iconic moments where you're like, 'Oh my God, I was there and I seen that live'."" The comedian and Masked Singer judge says he'll be less confrontational than his predecessor. ""I feel like I'm the person who's party you're coming to, but not everyone knows each other, so I've got to make sure everyone's having a great time."" Pop star Olivia Rodrigo could go home with two trophies These are much harder to call. The competition for best international artist is unbelievably tough - with Billie Eilish facing off against Taylor Swift, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X. But the one to beat is Olivia Rodrigo, whose debut album Sour was the UK's fourth biggest record of the year. She also made her live debut at last year's Brit Awards, something that is sure to linger in the minds of the voting academy. Rodrigo's pop-punk anthem Good 4U has a good shot at winning best international song, too. Other strong contenders include The Weeknd's Save Your Tears and Lil Nas X's Montero (Call Me By Your Name). Front-runners for best international group are Abba, who are riding a huge wave of affection following their unexpected comeback last September. If they win, it'll be the Swedish band's first ever Brit Award. They only have one previous nomination - for best album - in 1977. ""I must say, I don't think we've ever had such good reviews as we have for this album,"" says songwriter and keyboard player Benny Andersson. ""Obviously we're kosher now and we weren't in the '70s."" And if they win, how will he celebrate? ""I don't know,"" he laughs. ""I can send you a text to tell you.""

Adele won three out the four main prizes at Brit Awards on Tuesday, where she also put in an assured performance of her track I Drink Wine. The singer won best artist, album and song of the year for Easy on Me. Ed Sheeran was also crowned songwriter of the year at London's O2 Arena, and played two tracks, including one alongside special guest Stormzy. Dua Lipa won the night's other big prize, as TikTok users voted for her and not Adele as the best pop/R&B act. It means that for now at least, Robbie Williams remains out on his own ahead of Adele as the most awarded artist in Brits history with 13. After winning the first of her three awards, for best song, Adele beamed: ""I can't believe a piano ballad won up against that many bangers"". Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks, and this was recognised by the Brits, which rewards mainstream success. After winning the Brits first-ever genderless award for artist of the year, the star added: ""I really love being a woman and being a female artist."" This video can not be played How Mo Gilligan predicted he'd host the Brits in 2011 The ceremony was hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who took over (at the ""Mo-2 Arena"" as he re-named it) from Jack Whitehall. The comedian took a swipe at Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the well-documented party-gate controversy. ""Boris, I know you're watching,"" the host said into the camera. ""I know you love a party. ""Come on my guy, come down man - I know you like a cheeseboard. Look at you looking for the Dairylea."" In pictures: The head-turning outfits at the Brits One of the best performances of the night came from best new artist winner, Little Simz, who was joined by Crown actress Emma Corrin on-stage during a medley of tracks from her critically-acclaimed album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Her smart, funky record wasmusic critics' favourite album of 2021, and ahead of the Brits her producer, Inflo, who has also worked with Adele, was named asproducer of the year. ""Look what you've done mum,"" said Simz, collecting her award while accompanied by her mother.

The South Shields rocker thanked his manager for ""walking into that pub 10 years ago"" and discovering him. Abba were last nominated for a Brit Award in 1977, losing out to Simon & Garfunkel and the same fate befell them on Tuesday, as Silk Sonic - aka Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak [sic] - took the best international group. Billie Eilish fended off competition from Olivia Rodrigo to win best international artist. But 18-year-old Rodrigo, who made her live debut at last year's awards, made up for it by winning best international song for her pop-punk anthem Good 4U. Other winners on the night included last year's big winner, Dave for best hip-hop/grime/rap, Wolf Alice for best group, and Becky Hill for best dance. Holly Humberstone knew before she arrived she had won the rising star award. She told the BBC that her rapid ascent, which has happened during the pandemic, has been ""very strange to me"" so far. ""I feel like I'm in some kind of alternate universe, but I feel just so lucky,"" she said. Last year's Brit Awards took place as part of the government's pilot scheme for the return of live events.

""We're still living in this terribly gendered society even though everything is like, 'live, laugh, love' and everyone's fine."" She added: ""I constantly feel second or discriminated against because of being a woman and isn't that insane? The zeitgeist makes you think it isn't like that anymore.

"Boris Johnson has appointed several new ministers to his cabinet, to replace those whose resignations this week ultimately prompted him to announce he would step down as prime minister. A fuller reshuffle is likely once Mr Johnson's successor is in place, but in the interim period Nadhim Zahawi has been promoted to chancellor, after Rishi Sunak quit, and Stephen Barclay has replaced Sajid Javid as health secretary. James Cleverly and Greg Clark also return to the cabinet, replacing Mr Zahawi as education secretary and the sacked Michael Gove as levelling up, housing and communities secretary respectively. Who else is in the current cabinet? Here is a guide to the people in Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces, as well as those who have changed roles. Boris Johnson became prime minister in December 2019 and immediately faced the UK's looming exit from the EU and the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The health crisis has been described as perhaps the biggest challenge the country has faced since World War Two. Mr Johnsonâs election win secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. He succeeded Theresa May as prime minister. His only previous cabinet post was foreign secretary, which he quit over differences with Mrs May over Brexit. Since being at 10 Downing Street, he married his fiancee Carrie Symonds and the couple have had two children. Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed chancellor following the resignation of Rishi Sunak. A former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s, Mr Zahawi co-founded the market research firm YouGov and is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons. A strong media performer, the minister has been relied upon regularly to defend the prime minister on broadcast media rounds. Mr Zahawi was promoted to the cabinet in September 2021 after overseeing the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme and served as education secretary for eight months. He was elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in May 2010 and has also served as a business minister. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Liz Truss replaced Dominic Raab as foreign secretary in September 2021. Her first role in Boris Johnson's cabinet was as international trade secretary. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Kit Malthouse replaces Stephen Barclay as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was previously a minister jointly at the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice and attended cabinet. He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"". He was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015. A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, he lays claim to signing trade deals around the world in more than two decades of frontline politics. Ben Wallace has been defence secretary since July 2019. Mr Wallace trained at Sandhurst before joining the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaced Liz Truss as international trade secretary in September 2021. She returned after losing her place in the cabinet when the Department for International Development was scrapped. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. Stephen Barclay has become health secretary after Sajid Javid quit the role. He had been Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office since September 2021. In February, Boris Johnson also appointed him as the new chief of staff at No 10. He had previously served as chief secretary to the Treasury and Brexit secretary. The former insurance company solicitor was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. James Cleverly has taken over as education secretary after Nadhim Zahawi was made chancellor and his replacement, Michelle Donelan, quit hours later. The former soldier, who rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Royal Artillery, is one of the partyâs most effective media performers. Theresa May made him party chairman and Boris Johnson initially promoted him to the cabinet as minister without portfolio before demoting him in his February 2020 reshuffle. Despite supporting Mrs Mayâs Withdrawal Agreement, he is popular with Brexiteers and served in the London Assembly while Mr Johnson was mayor. The father-of-two has been MP for Braintree in Essex since 2015. Jacob Rees-Mogg takes on a newly created role in cabinet having previously been an attending member as the Leader of the House of Commons. He is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it was his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. Nadine Dorries remains culture secretary, having replaced Oliver Dowden in the role in September 2021. She was previously a minister for health and social care. Ms Dorries was elected as the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire in May 2005. In November 2012, she was temporarily suspended from the Conservative party after taking part in reality TV programme I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. Before she entered politics Ms Dorries trained as a nurse, then went on to set up her own business and later became a director at BUPA. Kwasi Kwarteng remains as business secretary. The MP for Spelthorne in Surrey, seen as a rising star on the right of the party for many years, had been energy minister since July 2019. He was previously a junior Brexit minister. Before becoming an MP in 2010, he worked as an analyst in financial services. Greg Clark was named as levelling up, housing and communities secretary after Michael Gove was sacked by Boris Johnson. He is responsible for ""levelling up"" - the programme to help communities who feel they have been left behind. Mr Clark was local government and communities secretary â covering much of the same brief as his latest role â for a year under David Cameron, and had been a minister in several other departments during the coalition. He also served in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as business secretary and, more recently, chaired the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee. A former business consultant and BBC executive, Mr Clark has been MP for Royal Tunbridge Wells since 2005. Therese Coffey remains as work and pensions secretary. The former environment minister was initially appointed to the role after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she later spoke about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. Dominic Raab replaced Robert Buckland as justice secretary in September 2021. Mr Raab faced criticism and calls for his resignation over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis. He was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. Grant Shapps remains transport secretary. The former international development minister was appointed to transport in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice has been environment secretary since February 2020. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Shailesh Vara was appointed Northern Ireland secretary following Brandon Lewisâs resignation. He was a minister at the Northern Ireland Office from July 2018 to November 2018. He has been a minister in the justice and work & pensions departments, and also spent time as a government whip. Mr Vara, who is married with two children, was elected Conservative MP for North West Cambridgeshire in 2005. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Robert Buckland returns to the cabinet, becoming Welsh secretary following Simon Hartâs resignation. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department and served as justice secretary from July 2019 to September 2021. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He was born in Llanelli and practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning before becoming an MP. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Andrew Stephenson has become minister without portfolio, attending cabinet, and remains a transport minister. He has previously spent time as a minister in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. He has also been a government whip. Mr Stephenson was first elected as Conservative MP for Pendle in May 2010. Simon Clarke is chief secretary to the treasury, and also attends cabinet. The MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was previously a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. Mr Clarke, a qualified solicitor, worked as a policy specialist on health and education before being elected in 2017. Mark Spencer moves from the role of government enforcer as the chief whip to the Leader of the House. Mr Spencer had served in the whips' office since 2016 and was also parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. The MP for Daventry moves from the Foreign Office to become the new chief whip, in charge of disciplining Conservative MPs. He was first elected in 2010 but before becoming a politician, ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. The former MEP is a qualified football referee and referees on the Northamptonshire Combination League. Michael Ellis QC has been appointed minister for the Cabinet Office. He will remain paymaster general, which he was appointed last year. Mr Ellis worked as a barrister for 17 years before being elected MP for Northampton North in 2010.

"This video can not be played What do people think of Llandudno's roaming wild goats? A pair of fighting goats blocked off the entrance to a supermarket car park. A herd of Great Orme goats were seen at Asda in Llandudno, Conwy county, with one pair locking horns at the traffic lights. Nurse Michelle Evans, who saw them, said: ""They were having a right scrap and making a heck of a noise. It sounded like one was hurt."" Conwy council said it could not remove the goats as they were on private property. Ms Evans added: ""They were really going at it. The two goats fighting had their horns locked while the rest of the herd was just watching. ""People were beeping their horns because they couldn't get in or out of Asda. In the end, people just drove around them. You don't expect to see that when you go to pick up your shopping!""

"The waiting list for hospital treatment will not start falling for two years, ministers say, despite unveiling aplan,externalto tackle England's backlog in care. Six million people are on a waiting list - one in nine of the population. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this number would probably increase, with demand expected to rise now Covid pressure was easing. He also set out plans to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. These include a 28-day target for cancer diagnosis by March 2024, which should have been introduced last year but was delayed by the pandemic. The proportion of cancer patients starting treatment within 62 days would return to its pre-pandemic level by March 2023, Mr Javid said, although this would still leave it some way short of the 85% target. Waiting times would be cut by a 30% rise in the NHS's capacity for treatment, he said. Crucial to this will be the establishment of a network of 160 community diagnostic centres along with surgical hubs focused on high-volume routine surgery away from major hospital sites - to increase efficiency and reduce the chance of emergency cases leading to cancellations. Extra investment of Â£8bn over the next three years, funded through a national-insurance rise, will pay for these new facilities. To free up staff time, follow-up appointments would be arranged on a case-by-case basis, rather than for all patients automatically, Mr Javid said. And a new online service, My Planned Care, will inform patients about waiting times and how to prepare for treatment. The plan would not just ""reset"" the NHS to where it had been before Covid, Mr Javid said, but build on what had been learned and make it ""fit for the future"". ""Just as we came together to tackle the virus, now we must come together in a new national mission to fight what the virus has brought with it,"" he said.

People are thought to have been deterred from seeking help for non-urgent care, everything from knee and hip surgery to treatment for sight problems and joint pain. And the health secretary said the NHS was working on the basis half of these ""missing patients"" could now come forward. He also promised to eliminate waits of over a year by 2025. Currently more than 300,000 people have waited this long, up from 1,600 before Covid hit. There was no promise to meet the target of seeing 92% of patients within 18 weeks, however, last achieved in 2016. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said tackling the backlog would take time and ""cannot happen overnight"" but promised the health service would apply the same ""can-do"" spirit it had  throughout the pandemic. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting accused the Tories of ""mismanagement"" of the NHS, pointing out performance had been declining before the pandemic. And he said there was nothing in the health secretary's plan about tackling the ""single biggest challenge"" facing the NHS - the lack of staff. ""There are 93,000 staffing vacancies in the NHS today,"" Mr Streeting said. ""It is understaffed, overworked - and if he's not careful, he will lose more people than he is able to recruit.""

"Oil giant BP has rejected calls for a windfall tax on energy companies' bumper profits, saying it would reduce investment in UK gas and renewables. BP posted a profit of $12.8bn (Â£9.5bn) for 2021 after oil and gas prices surged in the second half of the year. That has prompted calls for a one-off tax to help support families struggling to pay their energy bills. Labour said it was ""only fair and right"" that energy firms making higher profits should pay more tax. But BP said: ""Generally, a windfall tax on UK oil and gas producers would not encourage investment in producing the UK's gas resources. ""Very importantly, we also believe the UK should continue its [low carbon] energy transition as fast as possible. BP is committed to playing our part here,"" a company spokesperson said. Last week, rival oil giant Shell also reported profits of $19bn on the same day that the energy regulator Ofgem announced UK householders would see a 54% rise in their domestic energy bills in April. That has prompted criticism that energy firms are raking in excess profits on the back of fuel poverty and""creeping climate apocalypse"",external. But the oil giants argue they are facing an unprecedented challenge: while the global economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, they are being urged to shift to lower carbon alternatives, and need big profits to fund that transition. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Watch: Government 'sided with oil and gas companies' BP said over this decade the firm planned to invest more than twice what it made in Britain, the ""great majority"" in offshore wind, solar, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and electric vehicle charging. BP has moved further than many of its rivals, outlining a plan to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 and reduce its oil output by 40%, or more than 1 million barrels per day. The strong results showed BP was doing what it had promised: ""performing while transforming"" BP chief executive Bernard Looney said. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. An example of such a windfall would be high energy prices. Companies that get oil and gas out of the ground are getting much more money for it than they were last year, largely because there has been so much more demand as the world emerges from the pandemic. Read more about windfall taxes here Last year's profit compares to a $5.7bn loss BP reported in 2020, when economies around the world were shut down due to the Covid pandemic. But rising demand for oil last year, as economies reopened, combined with supply chain challenges, pushed energy prices sharply higher by the end of 2021. The surge in revenues prompted Mr Looney to describe BP as ""a cash machine"", with profits reaching more than $4bn in the final quarter. Those profits come at a particularly sensitive time with UK households facing a cost of living crisis, which has already prompted the government to step in with a council tax rebate and loans to smooth the coming rise in domestic energy prices. The Treasury said it would not comment on speculation over tax changes but pointed out that oil and gas firms' profits are already taxed at a higher rate than other businesses. ""A windfall tax could deter Â£14bn worth of opportunities awaiting investment, which would risk both security of our energy supply, as well as almost 200,000 jobs that rely on the industry,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. The same high energy prices that are delivering crushing bills to households are seeing profits at companies like BP and Shell balloon. It seems like a no-brainer to tax one to solve the other. Both Conservative and Labour governments have imposed windfall taxes before. But government officials and industry experts insist it's not that simple. BP and Shell's operations in UK waters have dwindled and they already pay double the tax rate of other businesses on UK-based profits. Taxing them on overseas revenues is problematic as they already pay in the countries in which they operate. Previous windfall taxes have generally been on companies with predominantly UK based operations. Even if you could design a mechanism to do it, the government is adamant that it would deter investment in securing the best yield from domestic fossil fuel reserves and be a raid on money that could be used to build or buy wind farms, generate hydrogen or install more electric car charging points. Sceptics would say big payouts to shareholders dent the credibility of that, but others say shareholders are primarily pension funds so a windfall tax would be hitting savers. Whatever the merits of the arguments, with profits at Shell and BP set to rise significantly again this year as gas and oil prices stay high, it's unlikely calls for a windfall tax will go away. However Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both called for a windfall tax on the profits of firms such as BP and Shell to fund more support for households. ""The boss of BP described the energy price crisis as a cash machine for his company - and the people supplying the cash are the British people through rocketing energy bills,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow secretary of state for climate and net zero. ""In these circumstances, it is only fair and right for oil and gas producers to contribute to helping the millions of families facing soaring inflation and a cost of living crisis."" Under a plan outlined by Labour last month, North Sea energy producers would pay higher corporation tax for a year to fund Â£1.2bn of help for households. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: ""It simply cannot be right these energy companies are making super profits whilst people are too scared to turn their radiators on and terrified there will be a cold snap. ""A windfall tax is the best way to get money to the people who need it quickly, but also to make sure there is some sense of trust and proportionality in the system."" Only a fraction of BP's profits are generated in the North Sea, however, so a windfall tax applied only to those operations would raise limited revenue, while applying an additional tax to the firm's global profits might be more difficult to execute. Former BP executive Nick Butler said what mattered most was not how much money the oil giants were making but how they chose to spend those profits. ""What society needs now is both the transition to low carbon and energy security,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We need to invest in oil and gas because 80% of all the energy we use every day is oil and gas, and we need companies like BP and Shell investing in that supply to ensure volatility of the world market is mitigated.""

"19-year-old Zhu Yi sobbed openly after her error-riddled skate on Monday Chinese figure skater Zhu Yi has faced increasing criticism on Chinese social media, after falling several times during her Olympic team event skates. The debut of the US-born athlete on Sunday saw her fail to land jumps, pushing Team China out of the medals. A second performance on Monday, where she fell twice, earned more criticism. Her performance was called shameful and embarrassing by some, with personal attacks made on her background and her poor grasp of Mandarin. The criticism also appeared to be linked to discontent that the skater, who was raised in the US, was allegedly chosen for the team event over Chinese-born skaters. Many questioned why the 19-year-old had been chosen and made groundless claims that Ms Zhu had been favoured because her father is a prominent scientist. The hashtag #ZhuYiFellDown also reportedly trended on Weibo, before it was later taken down. However, searches for her name remain visible. The vicious level of attack led to Weibo deleting over 300 posts and suspending accounts. Tokyo Games: Chinese nationalists turn on Olympic athletes The Olympic skier caught in a China-US divide Zhu, who gave up her US citizenship to join Team China in 2018, had appeared visibly tense on the ice even before she fell on an early jump, crashing into the wall. After her performance on Sunday, she said she felt upset and embarrassed. ""I guess I felt a lot of pressure because I know everybody in China was pretty surprised with the selection for ladies' singles, and I just really wanted to show them what I was able to do, but unfortunately I didn't."" On Monday the criticism erupted again after Zhu, looking for redemption, fell on consecutive jumps and struggled through the rest of the routine. Holding back tears on the ice, she sobbed openly after finishing. Zhu Yi fell twice on turns in her second skate for the team competition While her teammates on the sidelines welcomed her back warmly, online the reception was largely negative. ""She has no strength and it seems like she has no passion and enthusiasm on the stage,"" one social media user wrote. Others ridiculed her distress. ""I hate that she's crying. Can crying solve anything?"" one wrote. But many have also condemned the backlash, defending and expressing sympathy for the young athlete. ""To vent emotions on this young athlete, using social media to throw rocks down a well when she makes mistakes - that's cyber-bullying and no matter what it's going too far,"" said Hu Xijin, a well known former editor-in-chief of the nationalist Global Times newspaper. His post was widely shared. Team China athletes often face great scrutiny from the Chinese publicand immense pressure to win medals for national glory. Zhu was one of about a dozen athletes recruited by China for its Winter Games medal campaign. Still, others have drawn comparisons between the treatment of Zhu to Eileen Gu, another American-born athlete who chose to compete for China - and won a dramatic gold in the women's freestyle skiing big air final on Tuesday. The Olympic skier caught in a China-US divide Gu is widely adored in China and even given the nickname of China's ""Snow Princess"". She has been praised for not only her athletic ability but also her Mandarin skills and embrace of Chinese culture. Commenting on the row around Zhu, Gu said that ""90% of comments are positive and uplifting"" on Chinese social platforms. ""It's part of the sport and everyone understands that,"" she added.

"Children get less specialist support for mental health than adults do, a wellbeing expert says Government plans for mental health support teams in a third of schools in England by 2022-23 lack ambition and need to be stepped up, MPs have heard. Children's wellbeing expert Lord Layard urged the Commons education committee to push for a national rollout before the end of this Parliament. He also said only a third of children with diagnosable mental ill health get support from specialist NHS services. The figure was ""shocking"" and the situation was ""unbelievable"", he said. The government aims to have 400 mental health support teams covering a third of pupils by 2023. Huge leap in children in mental health crisis 'We've lost faith in child mental health care' 'I was begging for help after my child overdosed' The teams offer lower level mental health support in groups of schools, mainly via NHS wellbeing practitioners who have received bespoke training. But the demand for support has risen substantially recently. Last week, theBBC revealed a 77% increase in referrals to specialist services. The committee heard there were serious problems in accessing support at this end of the spectrum. Lord Layard told the committee: ""The young people in the most trouble are the people who are diagnosable  - we are talking about 10% of our children. ""The shocking thing is that only about a third of these children get any form of specialist support. This is much worse than for adults."" He added: ""It's unbelievable that we have that situation, we have CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) that has such a high threshold - unless you're stabbing your sister, or something like, that you're assessed not to be bad enough. ""And until recently there have been no resources for anyone below the CAMHS threshold."" This figure is in line withthe latest report from England's children's commissioner,,externalwhich analysed children's access to treatment and found 32% of children with a diagnosable mental health need were accessing treatment in 2020-21. This video can not be played Five tips to boost your child's wellbeing Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, Shadow Minister for Mental Health, told the Commons in an opposition day debate that the children coming into A&E where she works were getting younger and younger. She said: ""Imagine if we treated childhood cancer like we do children's mental illness, waiting for symptoms to get worse before they see a specialist. waiting for months or even years for treatment, leaving patients and parents to rely on charity - there would be an outcry."" This is what the government is doing, she claimed. Health Minister Maggie Throup said the government had been investing record sums into children's mental health. ""We now have a foundation from which we can build the necessary levels of care and support and we know we need to be more ambitious."" This was why the government planned to have an extra 345,000 children accessing support by 2023-24 and has rapidly expanded the children's mental health workforce, she said. Mouhssin Ismail, principal of Newham Collegiate Sixth Form in east London, which has its own counsellors in school, said demand was out-stripping supply. ""Even when we refer to CAMHS, the waiting lists are significant and the students that need the help are not getting it in a timely manner,"" he said. Catherine Roche, chief executive of Place2Be children's mental health charity - which has teams embedded in schools - said children were coming forward with really severe needs. She said the government's mental health support teams were a good initiative, but they needed to be everywhere. Gordon Knott says thresholds for specialist services have been rising consistently over recent years Gordon Knott, director of children's mental health charity,Croydon Drop-In,external, which also runs a mental health support team in the south London borough, says his organisation works with very serious cases. Some 35% of the children it sees are presenting with self-harm, while 45% come with suicidal thoughts or plans, he said. He told the BBC the decision on whether a self-harming child is seen by specialist services can come down to how deep their cuts are, because thresholds for treatment have become progressively higher. He agrees mental health support teams are a good scheme, but that their spread is not wide enough.

Read more about windfall taxes here Last year's profit compares to a $5.7bn loss BP reported in 2020, when economies around the world were shut down due to the Covid pandemic. But rising demand for oil last year, as economies reopened, combined with supply chain challenges, pushed energy prices sharply higher by the end of 2021. The surge in revenues prompted Mr Looney to describe BP as ""a cash machine"", with profits reaching more than $4bn in the final quarter. Those profits come at a particularly sensitive time with UK households facing a cost of living crisis, which has already prompted the government to step in with a council tax rebate and loans to smooth the coming rise in domestic energy prices. The Treasury said it would not comment on speculation over tax changes but pointed out that oil and gas firms' profits are already taxed at a higher rate than other businesses. ""A windfall tax could deter Â£14bn worth of opportunities awaiting investment, which would risk both security of our energy supply, as well as almost 200,000 jobs that rely on the industry,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. The same high energy prices that are delivering crushing bills to households are seeing profits at companies like BP and Shell balloon. It seems like a no-brainer to tax one to solve the other. Both Conservative and Labour governments have imposed windfall taxes before. But government officials and industry experts insist it's not that simple. BP and Shell's operations in UK waters have dwindled and they already pay double the tax rate of other businesses on UK-based profits. Taxing them on overseas revenues is problematic as they already pay in the countries in which they operate. Previous windfall taxes have generally been on companies with predominantly UK based operations. Even if you could design a mechanism to do it, the government is adamant that it would deter investment in securing the best yield from domestic fossil fuel reserves and be a raid on money that could be used to build or buy wind farms, generate hydrogen or install more electric car charging points. Sceptics would say big payouts to shareholders dent the credibility of that, but others say shareholders are primarily pension funds so a windfall tax would be hitting savers. Whatever the merits of the arguments, with profits at Shell and BP set to rise significantly again this year as gas and oil prices stay high, it's unlikely calls for a windfall tax will go away. However Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both called for a windfall tax on the profits of firms such as BP and Shell to fund more support for households. ""The boss of BP described the energy price crisis as a cash machine for his company - and the people supplying the cash are the British people through rocketing energy bills,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow secretary of state for climate and net zero. ""In these circumstances, it is only fair and right for oil and gas producers to contribute to helping the millions of families facing soaring inflation and a cost of living crisis."" Under a plan outlined by Labour last month, North Sea energy producers would pay higher corporation tax for a year to fund Â£1.2bn of help for households. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: ""It simply cannot be right these energy companies are making super profits whilst people are too scared to turn their radiators on and terrified there will be a cold snap. ""A windfall tax is the best way to get money to the people who need it quickly, but also to make sure there is some sense of trust and proportionality in the system."" Only a fraction of BP's profits are generated in the North Sea, however, so a windfall tax applied only to those operations would raise limited revenue, while applying an additional tax to the firm's global profits might be more difficult to execute. Former BP executive Nick Butler said what mattered most was not how much money the oil giants were making but how they chose to spend those profits. ""What society needs now is both the transition to low carbon and energy security,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We need to invest in oil and gas because 80% of all the energy we use every day is oil and gas, and we need companies like BP and Shell investing in that supply to ensure volatility of the world market is mitigated.""

We never had a quarrel, not even when I turned the car over while we were driving to India. ""He was an incredibly generous man and everything he did was pointed towards sharing the gifts of his own life with others - he was even instrumental in the creation of a new Thames boat: the skerry (a cross between the skiff and the wherry) so that schoolchildren could enjoy the river as much as he did. ""For 30 years, we swam in the river every day possible (only in the summer). He loved opera and was thrilled that he could have an opera house in the garden he inherited from his aunt Mary Roxburghe.

""Bamber was unlike anyone else on television when the programme started back in 1962 - he was utterly charming, erudite and, at times, seemingly omniscient, and his 25 years spent presenting the programme established it firmly as the institution it is now.

"Children get less specialist support for mental health than adults do, a wellbeing expert says Government plans for mental health support teams in a third of schools in England by 2022-23 lack ambition and need to be stepped up, MPs have heard. Children's wellbeing expert Lord Layard urged the Commons education committee to push for a national rollout before the end of this Parliament. He also said only a third of children with diagnosable mental ill health get support from specialist NHS services. The figure was ""shocking"" and the situation was ""unbelievable"", he said. The government aims to have 400 mental health support teams covering a third of pupils by 2023. Huge leap in children in mental health crisis 'We've lost faith in child mental health care' 'I was begging for help after my child overdosed' The teams offer lower level mental health support in groups of schools, mainly via NHS wellbeing practitioners who have received bespoke training. But the demand for support has risen substantially recently. Last week, theBBC revealed a 77% increase in referrals to specialist services. The committee heard there were serious problems in accessing support at this end of the spectrum. Lord Layard told the committee: ""The young people in the most trouble are the people who are diagnosable  - we are talking about 10% of our children. ""The shocking thing is that only about a third of these children get any form of specialist support. This is much worse than for adults."" He added: ""It's unbelievable that we have that situation, we have CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) that has such a high threshold - unless you're stabbing your sister, or something like, that you're assessed not to be bad enough. ""And until recently there have been no resources for anyone below the CAMHS threshold."" This figure is in line withthe latest report from England's children's commissioner,,externalwhich analysed children's access to treatment and found 32% of children with a diagnosable mental health need were accessing treatment in 2020-21. This video can not be played Five tips to boost your child's wellbeing Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, Shadow Minister for Mental Health, told the Commons in an opposition day debate that the children coming into A&E where she works were getting younger and younger. She said: ""Imagine if we treated childhood cancer like we do children's mental illness, waiting for symptoms to get worse before they see a specialist. waiting for months or even years for treatment, leaving patients and parents to rely on charity - there would be an outcry."" This is what the government is doing, she claimed. Health Minister Maggie Throup said the government had been investing record sums into children's mental health. ""We now have a foundation from which we can build the necessary levels of care and support and we know we need to be more ambitious."" This was why the government planned to have an extra 345,000 children accessing support by 2023-24 and has rapidly expanded the children's mental health workforce, she said. Mouhssin Ismail, principal of Newham Collegiate Sixth Form in east London, which has its own counsellors in school, said demand was out-stripping supply. ""Even when we refer to CAMHS, the waiting lists are significant and the students that need the help are not getting it in a timely manner,"" he said. Catherine Roche, chief executive of Place2Be children's mental health charity - which has teams embedded in schools - said children were coming forward with really severe needs. She said the government's mental health support teams were a good initiative, but they needed to be everywhere. Gordon Knott says thresholds for specialist services have been rising consistently over recent years Gordon Knott, director of children's mental health charity,Croydon Drop-In,external, which also runs a mental health support team in the south London borough, says his organisation works with very serious cases. Some 35% of the children it sees are presenting with self-harm, while 45% come with suicidal thoughts or plans, he said. He told the BBC the decision on whether a self-harming child is seen by specialist services can come down to how deep their cuts are, because thresholds for treatment have become progressively higher. He agrees mental health support teams are a good scheme, but that their spread is not wide enough. ""Young people say to us: 'We saw a Nightingale Hospital built in a week, we housed the homeless overnight during the pandemic, why can't we be more ambitious in terms of looking after young people's mental health?'""

"Relatives of those killed and injured in the bookmakers attack gathered to remember them on Saturday The Police Ombudsman has found ""collusive behaviour"" by police in a number of loyalist murders, including the 1992 attack atthe Sean Graham betting shop. Areport by Marie Anderson,externalalso identified ""significant"" investigative and intelligence failures. Police apologised for the ""failings identified"". The report found no evidence that any of the shootings was preventable. Bookmakers attack families reach settlement Police Ombudsman's full report,external The Police Ombudsman's report considers details of RUC conduct in relation to eight loyalist attacks between 1990 and 1998. These attacks resulted in 11 murders and one attempted murder. All of the victims were Catholic. Here's a look at each of the cases and the victims. On the day of the attempted murder Mr Caskey was shot when walking to his parents' home at Dromara Street off the lower Ormeau Road in south Belfast. The route taken by Mr Caskey took him through an entry linking Artana Street with Dromara Street, where he was shot in the back. He managed to run from the scene and found his way to a nearby house where he remained until the arrival of an ambulance and police. No organisation claimed responsibility for this shooting. No-one has been prosecuted for the attack. Mr Conlon, 54, was a driver for STS Taxis of Avoca Park, Andersonstown. At 21:00 on the day of his murder he was dispatched to two locations from his base. Following the first fare, it is believed that Mr Conlon collected a fare from the Devenish Arms Inn at Finaghy Road North, Belfast, to be taken to the Errigle Inn, Ormeau Road. At 22:17 he was found in Finnis Drive, Belfast, in his taxi, having sustained fatal gunshot wounds. In a call to the BBC, the UDA/UFF claimed responsibility for the murder of Mr Conlon. No-one has been prosecuted in connection with the murder. Mr Conlon's son, Paul Conlon, said the report contained ""devastating details regarding the killing of our father"". Aidan Wallace, 22, was in the Devenish Arms Inn, Finaghy Road North in Belfast on the day of his murder. Two gunmen entered the premises and indiscriminately opened fire at customers and staff. Mr Wallace, who was playing snooker with his brother, was fatally wounded and three others, including an eight-year-old boy, sustained gunshot wounds. Police believed that the gunmen escaped in a stolen car, which was recovered later that day in Locksley Place, Finaghy. That evening an anonymous caller, using a recognised codeword, rang the BBC and claimed responsibility on behalf of the UFF. No-one has been prosecuted for his murder. Intelligence received by the police indicated that the attack on the Devenish Arms Inn was in retaliation for an Irish Peoples Liberation Organisation (IPLO) attack at the Donegall Arms, on 21 December 1991, during which two Protestant men were murdered. Three other men were also injured in this attack, two of whom were allegedly members of South Belfast UDA/UFF. The five people who died in the betting shop attack were, from left, Willie McManus, Christy Doherty, Jack Duffin, James Kennedy and Peter Magee Five people - Jack Duffin, 66; Willie McManus, 54; Christy Doherty, 52; Peter Magee, 18; and James Kennedy, 15 - died in the attack on Sean Graham Bookmakers on the Ormeau Road. Seven more people were wounded. Fifteen customers and members of staff were in the betting shop when two masked men entered the premises and opened fire with two guns. Later, the BBC got a message from an anonymous caller using a recognised UDA/UFF codeword claiming the attack. Among other comments, the caller referenced Teebane, anIRA bombing in County Tyrone just over two weeks previouslyin which eight Protestant workmen were killed. No-one has been prosecuted for the murders or attempted murders at the Sean Graham betting shop. Last week,settlements were reached in High Court actions over alleged state collusion in the killings. Jack Duffin was a married father of three sons and was a stonemason by trade. Willie McManus was a married father of four and had worked as a crane driver. Christy Doherty was one of five brothers and four sisters and lived in the Lower Ormeau Road. Peter Magee was one of six siblings, one of whom was his twin brother Martin. James Kennedy, who was only 15, was the second of five boys and was a pupil at St Joseph's Secondary School. He lived with his brothers and mother and father, Kathleen and Jackie in Stanton Street. On the day of his murder, Mr Gilbride, 36, arrived outside his parents' home at Fernwood Street where he often had lunch. As the married father-of-three got out of his car a gunman fired three shots resulting in fatal injuries. The gunman was believed to have fled on foot though an unoccupied house situated directly opposite the murder scene, and into a rear alley. Shortly before 13:00 that day an RUC patrol heard three shots on the Ormeau Road. The officers responded and found Mr Gilbride lying on the road behind his car, which was parked outside his parents' home. In an anonymous telephone call to the BBC on the same day, a caller using a recognised codeword, claimed the attack on behalf of the UDA/UFF. No-one has been prosecuted in connection with his murder. A Chinese restaurant on the Dublin Road, Belfast, received a call placing an order for a takeaway to be delivered to a property at Vernon Court. The caller gave no name. The takeaway was delivered by Mr Moran, a 22-year-old father of one, from the Ormeau Road, who arrived at the address shortly before midnight. He knocked on the door, waking up the occupants who were in bed. The occupant heard three gunshots as he got out of bed and immediately telephoned police. The police arrived shortly thereafter and found Mr Moran lying on the doorstep of the delivery address. He had sustained three gunshot wounds and was taken to Belfast City Hospital where he died from his injuries on 25 October. The murder of Mr Moran was not claimed by any organisation. The ombudsman said that, in light of the intelligence held by police, she was of the view that this was a sectarian murder carried out by loyalists in retaliation forthe bombing of Frizzell's Fish Shopon the Shankill Road less than 12 hours earlier. No-one has been prosecuted in connection with his murder. On the day of the 34-year-old mother of two's murder, a man wearing a crash helmet and holding a rifle entered a house on Balfour Avenue in the lower Ormeau Road. The family who lived in the house retreated to the rear of the property. As they telephoned 999, they heard a burst of gunfire, followed by the sound of a car driving away. They discovered that the living room window of their neighbour's house had been smashed. James (Jim) Clinton, his wife Theresa Clinton and their children were the occupants. He was in his bedroom when he was woken by the sound of glass breaking. He heard his wife scream, followed by gunfire. He ran downstairs and found her lying on their settee, fatally injured. A concrete block had been used to smash his living room window. The next day a BBC reporter got an anonymous telephone message from a caller who claimed the attack using a recognised UDA/UFF codeword. No-one has been prosecuted in connection with Mrs Clinton's murder. Lawrence (Larry) Brennan, 51, was a driver for Enterprise Taxis on the Ormeau Road, Belfast. The father-of-two was from the Markets area of Belfast. At approximately 19:20 he left the depot in his car, which was parked on the Ormeau Road. As he was sitting in the driver's seat, Mr Brennan was shot through the driver's side window and fatally wounded. The gunman then crossed the road and fled on foot along Deramore Avenue. No paramilitary group claimed responsibility for the murder The next day the RUC received information that an anonymous telephone caller had claimed  'the Spanish Republican Party' was responsible for the murder. They researched this claim but their enquiries revealed that this organisation did not exist and concluded the call was a hoax. Police intelligence indicated the attack was carried out by South Belfast UDA/UFF, in direct response to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) murder of a member of that organisation earlier the same day. No-one has been prosecuted in connection with his murder.

"Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst (left) and director Jane Campion are all recognised for The Power of the Dog Jane Campion's The Power of the Dog, an intense Western starring Benedict Cumberbatch, leads this year's Oscar board with 12 nominations. It is closely followed by Dune, which has 10, and Belfast and West Side Story, which have seven each. Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Garfield are among the UK nominees in the lead acting categories. Dame Judi Dench and CiarÃ¡n Hinds are nominated for their supporting roles in Sir Kenneth Branagh's Belfast. His autobiographical black-and-white film about a family in Northern Ireland during The Troubles is one of 10 films in the running for best picture. Sir Kenneth, who is also nominated for best director, said in a statement: ""It's a long way from the streets of Belfast to the Academy Awards. Dame Judi Dench is nominated for her performance in Belfast, while Sir Kenneth Branagh is up for best director ""Today, I think of my mother and father, and my grandparents - how proud they were to be Irish, how much this city meant to them. They would have been overwhelmed by this incredible honour - as am I. ""Given a story as personal as this one, it's a hell of a day for my family, and the family of our film. I thank Academy voters for their incredible and generous recognition."" The Oscar nominations in full We need to talk about why Bruno won't win an Oscar Read more about the films in this year's awards race Sir Kenneth becomes the first person to be nominated in seven different Oscar categories throughout his career. He already has director, actor, supporting actor, adapted screenplay and live action short nominations, but can now add best original screenplay and best picture. He is yet to win, however. With her nomination, New Zealand director Jane Campion becomes the first woman to have been nominated for best director twice, having been recognised for The Piano in 1993. Her film, The Power of the Dog, is a slow and suspenseful western which also scored nominations for three of its supporting actors - Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kirsten Dunst. Dune, which stars Zendaya and TimothÃ©e Chalamet, is one of 10 nominees for best picture The Power of the Dog - 12 Dune - 10 Belfast - 7 West Side Story - 7 King Richard - 6 Don't Look Up - 4 Nightmare Alley - 4 Drive My Car - 4 Andrew Garfield (right) is nominated for his performance in Tick Tick... Boom!, directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (left) Many nominees shared their joy on social media after the Academy unveiled its shortlists on Tuesday. Jessica Chastain, nominated for her leading performance in The Eyes of Tammy Faye,tweeted:,external""This morning felt like a dream"". Australian actor Kodi Smit-McPhee said he was ""deeply honoured"" to have been recognised as a best supporting actor nominee in the Power of the Dog. Belfast star CiarÃ¡n Hinds, another nominee in that category, said in a statement: ""Having worked in this industry for nearly 50 years, I thought there wasn't much that could surprise me still.

Two couples are nominated within the 20 acting places that were available. Penelope Cruz (Parallel Mothers) and Javier Bardem (Being The Ricardos) have been married since 2010, while Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst are engaged. In a statement, Dunst said: ""To be honored by the Academy is a truly humbling experience. For both Jesse and I to get our first nominations together is beyond our wildest dreams."" Denzel Washington's nomination for The Tragedy of Macbeth is his 10th, extending the record he already holds as the most nominated black actor ever. Will Smith has been nominated for best actor for his performance in King Richard There is no overlap between the best actress and best picture categories - all five women nominated for a leading role appeared in films which did not make it into the top category. This is common at the Oscars. While Frances McDormand and Nomadland synced their wins last year, that was the first time in 15 years that the winner of best actress appeared in the film that also won best picture. Efforts to nominate more popular films and make the Oscars more relevant to young people were only partly successful, as fans of James Bond and Spider-Man were left disappointed. Denis Villeneuve's sci-fi saga Dune was the most successful film to get a best picture nod, after taking $400m (Â£294m) at the box office worldwide. House of Gucci's Lady Gaga (far right) and Jared Leto (second left) both missed out in their respective acting categories With far more films in the awards season race this year and only a limited number of slots available in each category, it was inevitable that some films and stars would miss out. The voting system means that, while the Academy does not choose to actively reject a particular movie, director or actor, a heavily-tipped contender can miss out if they don't get as many votes as some of their peers. For example, the red carpet will have to do without without Lady Gaga and her Oscars outfit this year. She had been tipped for a best actress nomination for House of Gucci, but has missed out. It's not a good year to be both a musician and an actor. Gaga's co-star Jared Leto, who is also the singer with Thirty Seconds To Mars, and Alana Haim, who has gone from the band Haim to starring in Licorice Pizza, were both in contention but have been overlooked. Kristen Stewart did make it on to the best actress list, though, for playing Princess Diana in Spencer. Her first Oscar nomination, the former Twilight star was the frontrunner to win a few months ago, but Spencer has rapidly fallen out of favour and it wasn't certain that she would be nominated. On the best supporting actress list, Dame Judi had been an outsider to be nominated for Belfast - but she is loved by the Oscars, and has now received her eighth career nomination. Her on-screen daughter-in-law Caitriona Balfe, who was thought to have been Belfast's more likely representative in that category, was not recognised. The Lost Daughter has scored acting nominations for Jessie Buckley (far left) and Olivia Colman (second right) Irish star Jessie Buckley was also something of a surprise in the best supporting actress category. She plays the younger version of Olivia Colman's character in The Lost Daughter - with Colman herself up for best actress, days after being snubbed in the Bafta nominations. Overall, Oscar voters liked The Power of the Dog a bit more than expected, and liked Dune a bit less than expected - typified by the fact that, although Dune has 10 nominations, Denis Villeneuve didn't make the cut for best director. Tracee Ellis Ross and Leslie Jordan announced the nominations in Los Angeles on Tuesday. There is pressure to make the Oscars more popular with and relevant to young audiences, after 2021's pared-down ceremonytanked in the ratings,,externalpartly due to the absence of big film releases during lockdown. The Academy has confirmed the ceremony will have a host this year, but has not yet revealed who it will be. The ceremony hasn't had a host since Jimmy Kimmel was at the helm in 2018. Instead, a variety of celebrity guests have introduced individual categories and announced winners. This year's ceremony will take place on Sunday 27 March.

"The waiting list for hospital treatment will not start falling for two years, ministers say, despite unveiling aplan,externalto tackle England's backlog in care. Six million people are on a waiting list - one in nine of the population. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said this number would probably increase, with demand expected to rise now Covid pressure was easing. He also set out plans to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. These include a 28-day target for cancer diagnosis by March 2024, which should have been introduced last year but was delayed by the pandemic. The proportion of cancer patients starting treatment within 62 days would return to its pre-pandemic level by March 2023, Mr Javid said, although this would still leave it some way short of the 85% target. Waiting times would be cut by a 30% rise in the NHS's capacity for treatment, he said. Crucial to this will be the establishment of a network of 160 community diagnostic centres along with surgical hubs focused on high-volume routine surgery away from major hospital sites - to increase efficiency and reduce the chance of emergency cases leading to cancellations. Extra investment of Â£8bn over the next three years, funded through a national-insurance rise, will pay for these new facilities. To free up staff time, follow-up appointments would be arranged on a case-by-case basis, rather than for all patients automatically, Mr Javid said. And a new online service, My Planned Care, will inform patients about waiting times and how to prepare for treatment. The plan would not just ""reset"" the NHS to where it had been before Covid, Mr Javid said, but build on what had been learned and make it ""fit for the future"". ""Just as we came together to tackle the virus, now we must come together in a new national mission to fight what the virus has brought with it,"" he said.

People are thought to have been deterred from seeking help for non-urgent care, everything from knee and hip surgery to treatment for sight problems and joint pain. And the health secretary said the NHS was working on the basis half of these ""missing patients"" could now come forward. He also promised to eliminate waits of over a year by 2025. Currently more than 300,000 people have waited this long, up from 1,600 before Covid hit. There was no promise to meet the target of seeing 92% of patients within 18 weeks, however, last achieved in 2016. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said tackling the backlog would take time and ""cannot happen overnight"" but promised the health service would apply the same ""can-do"" spirit it had  throughout the pandemic. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting accused the Tories of ""mismanagement"" of the NHS, pointing out performance had been declining before the pandemic. And he said there was nothing in the health secretary's plan about tackling the ""single biggest challenge"" facing the NHS - the lack of staff. ""There are 93,000 staffing vacancies in the NHS today,"" Mr Streeting said. ""It is understaffed, overworked - and if he's not careful, he will lose more people than he is able to recruit.""

"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was heckled by protesters in Westminster on Monday Protest is familiar in Westminster and always has been. It's an important part of our political tradition. But in 2022, very angry gatherings are common. Small bands of furious members of the public are often spotted on the corner of Parliament Square, or outside Portcullis House, where many MPs work and gather. They sometimes hold placards and are normally carrying camera phones to record and share their exploits, carefully watching who goes past. OnMonday such a group spotted the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.He became the latest, along with the shadow foreign secretary and Labour's leader in the Lords, to be personally targeted and swarmed, before being bundled into the back of a police car for his own safety. The experience, inevitably filmed and posted online in minutes, was another ugly reminder of what many politicians encounter in the name of this modern form of protest - abusive, personal, edgy. But it's also reignited the anger inside the Conservative Party at theprime minister's false claims in Parliament a week ago. Sir Keir was bundled into a police car for his own protection after being surrounded by protesters Mr Johnson misleadingly suggested the Labour leader had been involved in the decision not to prosecute serial sex offender Jimmy Savile, a political attack that attracted criticism from some Conservatives straight away. It led later in the week to the resignation of one of his closest political confidants, and was one of the reasons why concern was spreading in Conservative ranks last week about Mr Johnson's leadership. His refusal to apologise, and partial retraction, made some MPs queasy and was the trigger for at least one of them to add their private letter to those already submitted in an effort to oust him. Since then the prime minister has been trying to demonstrate that he would make good on his promise to the party to change - to sharpen up No 10, to end the missteps and mistakes. Two arrested after protesters surround Keir Starmer Aide quits over PM's Savile comments Fact-checking PM's Jimmy Savile claim More Tories come out against PM amid parties row Some of the protesters who surrounded Sir Keir were heard to be shouting ""Jimmy Savile"" among the frenzied accusations they were hurling at him. It's impossible to say categorically that they had been driven by the prime minister's comments last week. But the ugly event has stirred calls again among Tory MPs for the PM to take back his comments completely, and to acknowledge the danger of what he'd said. There is no sign as I write that No 10 has any intention of doing so. Mr Johnson has condemned the behaviour of the protesters but made no comment about the content of their accusations, far less addressed suggestions that his own conduct may have had something to do with it. So the prime minister may find himself accused of stirring up an unpleasant episode of modern protest just at the point when No 10 had been trying to calm things down.

His wife Christina said he was ""an incredibly generous man and everything he did was pointed towards sharing the gifts of his own life with others"". Stephen Fry led the tributes, saying he was ""such an elegant, intelligent man"". Fry, who took part in University Challenge in 1980,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Oh no, not Bamber. He was so kind and warm to us students who sat nervously at those desks."" Gascoigne, who died after a short illness, became best known for his famous University Challenge catchphrases such as ""Fingers on buzzers"", ""Your starter for 10"", and ""I'll have to hurry you"". Bamber Gascoigne on the University Challenge set in 1968 Paul Sinha, star of ITV's quiz show The Chase,tweeted:,external""[Gascoigne's] effortless erudition, making whole swathes of impenetrable knowledge seem cheerfully accessible, was totally inspiring to this kid of the 80s. Sadly we may never see his like on our screens again."" Former University Challenge contestantBobby Seagull wrote:,external""Farewell Bamber Gascoigne... He set the tone for one of the best UK TV quiz shows. Scholarly, gentle and yet commanding, he joins the pantheon of great gameshow hosts. We shall miss you. RIP Bamber."" Only Connect presenterVictoria Coren Mitchell said,external: ""No quiz host has ever seemed more like they could answer all the questions themselves."" University Challenge aired on ITV for 25 years before being revived on the BBC in 1994 with Jeremy Paxman as the quiz master. Gascoigne also found cult fame after an episode of anarchic sitcom The Young Ones was named after him - titled Bambi - in 1984. Gascoigne died at his home in Richmond following a short illness The League of Gentleman star and Sherlock co-creator Mark Gatiss played Gascoigne in the 2006 film Starter for Ten. Author David Nicholls, who wrote the book the film was based on,posted on Twitter:,external""Very sad to see this. Bamber was a big part of my TV childhood and was very gracious about his fictional cameo in Starter For Ten. He came to the book launch and left me quite starstruck."" Gascoigne also presented 1977 ITV documentary series The Christians and the 1990 Channel 4 TV series The Great Moghuls, and created an online history encyclopaedia called HistoryWorld. More recently, his Surrey home has become familiar to fans of the BBC comedy Ghosts. He inherited West Horsley Place - which is known as Button House in the series - from his aunt, the Duchess of Roxburghe, in 2014. Bamber and Christina Gascoigne were together for 62 years and married for 55 The 15th Century house is also home to Grange Park Opera's summer festival. In a statement, Christina Gascoigne said: ""Bamber and I had a fantastic 62 years together full of friends and adventures. We never had a quarrel, not even when I turned the car over while we were driving to India. ""He was an incredibly generous man and everything he did was pointed towards sharing the gifts of his own life with others - he was even instrumental in the creation of a new Thames boat: the skerry (a cross between the skiff and the wherry) so that schoolchildren could enjoy the river as much as he did. ""For 30 years, we swam in the river every day possible (only in the summer). He loved opera and was thrilled that he could have an opera house in the garden he inherited from his aunt Mary Roxburghe. ""It was 50 years ago that he hosted University Challenge, but that is what everyone remembers. That and his limitless thirst for knowledge, which he retained like a sponge."" Bamber Gascoigne was made a CBE by the Queen in 2018 Gascoigne was born in London and won scholarships to Eton and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he met his wife. He also co-wrote the 1950s musical revue Share My Lettuce, which showcased rising stars Kenneth Williams and Dame Maggie Smith. The TV host was appointed CBE in 2018 for services to the arts. In a statement, Peter Gwyn, executive producer of University Challenge, said everyone on the show ""has been deeply saddened to hear of Bamber's death, and our thoughts and sympathy go to his family and friends"". ""Bamber was unlike anyone else on television when the programme started back in 1962 - he was utterly charming, erudite and, at times, seemingly omniscient, and his 25 years spent presenting the programme established it firmly as the institution it is now. He was a unique presence in British broadcasting and he'll be very sadly missed.""

"Up to a third of UK children - mostly young teens - consume at least one energy drink a week, while some are having them almost daily, new research suggests. Those who drink lots may get headaches and sleep problems, warn the authors of a report in theBMJ Open.,external High consumption is also linked to worse educational outcomes. Many shops already stop under-16s from buying the drinks, which can be high in caffeine, sugar and other stimulants. A single can might contain more caffeine than an espresso. The UK government has already said it will soon ban sales to children, because advice and warning labels have not been enough of a deterrent for some. The latest study, commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, analysed data on thousands of UK children, as well as consumption by youngsters in other countries from around the world, including the US and Canada. The findings suggest: up to half of children globally, and a third of UK children, consume these drinks at least weekly boys drink them more often than girls higher consumption is linked to greater poverty/deprivation frequent consumption - five or more times a week - is linked to poorer mental and physical health, and worse academic performance Lead researcher Claire Khouja, from the University of York, said: ""Our research has uncovered consistent evidence of links between the regular consumption of these drinks and harmful effects on children's overall wellbeing. These findings offer support for a government policy banning the sale of energy drinks to children. ""Our study also indicates that children who are better informed about the contents of energy drinks, drink less, suggesting that an education campaign and/or more prominent warnings on packaging could reduce consumption."" The researchers stress that their findings rely on surveys, and so cannot prove that energy drinks cause problems for children. What's in an energy drink and are they dangerous?,external Supermarkets ban energy drink sales to under-16s Last year, medics writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) warned of the dangers of energy drinks, after a student who drank too manydeveloped heart failure.

Energy drinks and their ingredients have been deemed safe by regulatory authorities around the world.

"Oil giant BP has rejected calls for a windfall tax on energy companies' bumper profits, saying it would reduce investment in UK gas and renewables. BP posted a profit of $12.8bn (Â£9.5bn) for 2021 after oil and gas prices surged in the second half of the year. That has prompted calls for a one-off tax to help support families struggling to pay their energy bills. Labour said it was ""only fair and right"" that energy firms making higher profits should pay more tax. But BP said: ""Generally, a windfall tax on UK oil and gas producers would not encourage investment in producing the UK's gas resources. ""Very importantly, we also believe the UK should continue its [low carbon] energy transition as fast as possible. BP is committed to playing our part here,"" a company spokesperson said. Last week, rival oil giant Shell also reported profits of $19bn on the same day that the energy regulator Ofgem announced UK householders would see a 54% rise in their domestic energy bills in April. That has prompted criticism that energy firms are raking in excess profits on the back of fuel poverty and""creeping climate apocalypse"",external. But the oil giants argue they are facing an unprecedented challenge: while the global economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, they are being urged to shift to lower carbon alternatives, and need big profits to fund that transition. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Watch: Government 'sided with oil and gas companies' BP said over this decade the firm planned to invest more than twice what it made in Britain, the ""great majority"" in offshore wind, solar, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and electric vehicle charging. BP has moved further than many of its rivals, outlining a plan to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 and reduce its oil output by 40%, or more than 1 million barrels per day.

"Oil giant BP has rejected calls for a windfall tax on energy companies' bumper profits, saying it would reduce investment in UK gas and renewables. BP posted a profit of $12.8bn (Â£9.5bn) for 2021 after oil and gas prices surged in the second half of the year. That has prompted calls for a one-off tax to help support families struggling to pay their energy bills. Labour said it was ""only fair and right"" that energy firms making higher profits should pay more tax. But BP said: ""Generally, a windfall tax on UK oil and gas producers would not encourage investment in producing the UK's gas resources. ""Very importantly, we also believe the UK should continue its [low carbon] energy transition as fast as possible. BP is committed to playing our part here,"" a company spokesperson said. Last week, rival oil giant Shell also reported profits of $19bn on the same day that the energy regulator Ofgem announced UK householders would see a 54% rise in their domestic energy bills in April. That has prompted criticism that energy firms are raking in excess profits on the back of fuel poverty and""creeping climate apocalypse"",external. But the oil giants argue they are facing an unprecedented challenge: while the global economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, they are being urged to shift to lower carbon alternatives, and need big profits to fund that transition. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Watch: Government 'sided with oil and gas companies' BP said over this decade the firm planned to invest more than twice what it made in Britain, the ""great majority"" in offshore wind, solar, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and electric vehicle charging. BP has moved further than many of its rivals, outlining a plan to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 and reduce its oil output by 40%, or more than 1 million barrels per day.

"Up to a third of UK children - mostly young teens - consume at least one energy drink a week, while some are having them almost daily, new research suggests. Those who drink lots may get headaches and sleep problems, warn the authors of a report in theBMJ Open.,external High consumption is also linked to worse educational outcomes. Many shops already stop under-16s from buying the drinks, which can be high in caffeine, sugar and other stimulants. A single can might contain more caffeine than an espresso. The UK government has already said it will soon ban sales to children, because advice and warning labels have not been enough of a deterrent for some. The latest study, commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care, analysed data on thousands of UK children, as well as consumption by youngsters in other countries from around the world, including the US and Canada. The findings suggest: up to half of children globally, and a third of UK children, consume these drinks at least weekly boys drink them more often than girls higher consumption is linked to greater poverty/deprivation frequent consumption - five or more times a week - is linked to poorer mental and physical health, and worse academic performance Lead researcher Claire Khouja, from the University of York, said: ""Our research has uncovered consistent evidence of links between the regular consumption of these drinks and harmful effects on children's overall wellbeing. These findings offer support for a government policy banning the sale of energy drinks to children. ""Our study also indicates that children who are better informed about the contents of energy drinks, drink less, suggesting that an education campaign and/or more prominent warnings on packaging could reduce consumption."" The researchers stress that their findings rely on surveys, and so cannot prove that energy drinks cause problems for children. What's in an energy drink and are they dangerous?,external Supermarkets ban energy drink sales to under-16s Last year, medics writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) warned of the dangers of energy drinks, after a student who drank too manydeveloped heart failure.

Energy drinks and their ingredients have been deemed safe by regulatory authorities around the world. The British Soft Drinks Association's director general, Gavin Partington, said: ""Our members do not market or promote energy drinks to under-16s, nor do they sample products with this age group. ""In addition, energy drinks carry an advisory note stating 'not recommended for children'.

"The border area in Humla, Nepal, with Chinese buildings in the foreground and snow-covered Mount Kailash far away A Nepalese government report leaked to the BBC accuses China of encroaching into Nepal along the two countries' shared border. It is the first time there have been official claims from Nepal of Chinese interference in its territory. The report was commissioned last September following claims that China has been trespassing in the district of Humla, in the far west of Nepal. China's embassy in Kathmandu denies there has been any encroachment. Following the publication of the leaked report, Nepalese Communications Minister Gyanendra Bahadur Karki said any border issues with its neighbours would be dealt with diplomatically. ""Either with India or with China, if there are any issues at our border we will resolve them through diplomatic means. ""Such problems should not arise and the Nepal government will always make efforts to prevent such situations,"" he told a regular news briefing in Kathmandu. It is unclear why the report has not yet been published by the Nepalese government. But it has over recent years improved ties with China to counterbalance its long-standing relationship with India, its giant neighbour to the south. A long-standing boundary dispute between Nepal and India has hampered relations between the two for years. The report's findings are likely to put pressure on the growing links Nepal has with China. Their common border runs for nearly 1,400km (870 miles) along the Himalayan mountains. It was laid out in a series of treaties signed between the two countries in the early 1960s. Much of it is in remote, hard-to-reach areas. On the ground, the boundary is demarcated by a chain of pillars, set kilometres apart. This sometimes makes it hard to know exactly where the border is located. The Nepalese government decided to send a taskforce to Humla after reports about possible Chinese encroachment. Some claimed China had built a series of buildings on the Nepalese side of the border. The team consisted of representatives from the police and the government. In its report, passed to the BBC, the group found that surveillance activities by Chinese security forces had restricted religious activities on the Nepalese side of the border in a place called Lalungjong. The area has traditionally been a draw for pilgrims because of its proximity to Mount Kailash, just over the border in China, which is a sacred site for both Hindus and Buddhists. The report also concluded that China had been limiting grazing by Nepalese farmers. In the same area, it found China was building a fence around a border pillar, and attempting to construct a canal and a road on the Nepalese side of the border. But the taskforce did find that Chinese buildings originally thought to have been constructed inside Nepal had, in fact, been built on the Chinese side of the border. Nepalese soldiers on a previous visit to Humla - the report said soldiers should be stationed in the area The investigators found local Nepalese people were often reluctant to talk about border issues because some of them depended on continued access to Chinese markets across the border. The report recommended Nepalese security forces be stationed in the area to guarantee security. It also suggested Nepal and China should reactivate a dormant mechanism set up to resolve these kinds of border issues. Budhhi Narayan Shrestha, a prominent cartographer and former head of Nepal's survey department, said people living near the border should be clearly told exactly where it is so they can better protect Nepalese territory. As China denies any encroachment, it is not clear what its motives might be for asserting control over its border with Nepal, but security could be one reason. How a new map is stirring old rivalries A new Dubai or a Chinese enclave? China and India face off on the roof of the world Historically, there was some unofficial cross-border traffic, including pilgrims and traders, but China has gradually restricted this movement. Vijay Kant Karna, a former Nepalese diplomat who now works at a think-tank in Kathmandu, said Beijing could be worried about India, its regional rival with whom it has its own border issues. ""It looks like they are concerned about infiltration from outside forces, so they want to disconnect relations across the border,"" he said. China might also be worried about movement in the opposite direction. The region on the Chinese side of the border is Tibet, from where many people have fled to escape what they see as Beijing's repression. About 20,000 Tibetan refugees live in Nepal; others have passed through on their way to India and elsewhere. Over recent years, China has tried to cut off this escape route. There have been reports of Chinese encroachment into Nepal over the last two years, leading to occasional protests in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu. The latest demonstration was just last month. In response, the Chinese embassy in Nepal issued a statement in January saying: ""There is no dispute at all. It is hoped that the Nepali people [will] not be misled with false individual reports."" The embassy has not, however, responded to the BBC about the specific allegations laid out in the unpublished report. It is thought the Nepalese government has taken up the border issue with Beijing - but it is not saying what China has said in reply.

Following the publication of the leaked report, Nepalese Communications Minister Gyanendra Bahadur Karki said any border issues with its neighbours would be dealt with diplomatically. ""Either with India or with China, if there are any issues at our border we will resolve them through diplomatic means. ""Such problems should not arise and the Nepal government will always make efforts to prevent such situations,"" he told a regular news briefing in Kathmandu. It is unclear why the report has not yet been published by the Nepalese government. But it has over recent years improved ties with China to counterbalance its long-standing relationship with India, its giant neighbour to the south. A long-standing boundary dispute between Nepal and India has hampered relations between the two for years. The report's findings are likely to put pressure on the growing links Nepal has with China. Their common border runs for nearly 1,400km (870 miles) along the Himalayan mountains. It was laid out in a series of treaties signed between the two countries in the early 1960s. Much of it is in remote, hard-to-reach areas. On the ground, the boundary is demarcated by a chain of pillars, set kilometres apart. This sometimes makes it hard to know exactly where the border is located. The Nepalese government decided to send a taskforce to Humla after reports about possible Chinese encroachment. Some claimed China had built a series of buildings on the Nepalese side of the border. The team consisted of representatives from the police and the government. In its report, passed to the BBC, the group found that surveillance activities by Chinese security forces had restricted religious activities on the Nepalese side of the border in a place called Lalungjong. The area has traditionally been a draw for pilgrims because of its proximity to Mount Kailash, just over the border in China, which is a sacred site for both Hindus and Buddhists. The report also concluded that China had been limiting grazing by Nepalese farmers. In the same area, it found China was building a fence around a border pillar, and attempting to construct a canal and a road on the Nepalese side of the border. But the taskforce did find that Chinese buildings originally thought to have been constructed inside Nepal had, in fact, been built on the Chinese side of the border. Nepalese soldiers on a previous visit to Humla - the report said soldiers should be stationed in the area The investigators found local Nepalese people were often reluctant to talk about border issues because some of them depended on continued access to Chinese markets across the border. The report recommended Nepalese security forces be stationed in the area to guarantee security. It also suggested Nepal and China should reactivate a dormant mechanism set up to resolve these kinds of border issues. Budhhi Narayan Shrestha, a prominent cartographer and former head of Nepal's survey department, said people living near the border should be clearly told exactly where it is so they can better protect Nepalese territory. As China denies any encroachment, it is not clear what its motives might be for asserting control over its border with Nepal, but security could be one reason. How a new map is stirring old rivalries A new Dubai or a Chinese enclave? China and India face off on the roof of the world Historically, there was some unofficial cross-border traffic, including pilgrims and traders, but China has gradually restricted this movement. Vijay Kant Karna, a former Nepalese diplomat who now works at a think-tank in Kathmandu, said Beijing could be worried about India, its regional rival with whom it has its own border issues. ""It looks like they are concerned about infiltration from outside forces, so they want to disconnect relations across the border,"" he said. China might also be worried about movement in the opposite direction. The region on the Chinese side of the border is Tibet, from where many people have fled to escape what they see as Beijing's repression. About 20,000 Tibetan refugees live in Nepal; others have passed through on their way to India and elsewhere. Over recent years, China has tried to cut off this escape route. There have been reports of Chinese encroachment into Nepal over the last two years, leading to occasional protests in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu. The latest demonstration was just last month. In response, the Chinese embassy in Nepal issued a statement in January saying: ""There is no dispute at all. It is hoped that the Nepali people [will] not be misled with false individual reports."" The embassy has not, however, responded to the BBC about the specific allegations laid out in the unpublished report. It is thought the Nepalese government has taken up the border issue with Beijing - but it is not saying what China has said in reply.

"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was heckled by protesters in Westminster on Monday Protest is familiar in Westminster and always has been. It's an important part of our political tradition. But in 2022, very angry gatherings are common. Small bands of furious members of the public are often spotted on the corner of Parliament Square, or outside Portcullis House, where many MPs work and gather. They sometimes hold placards and are normally carrying camera phones to record and share their exploits, carefully watching who goes past. OnMonday such a group spotted the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.He became the latest, along with the shadow foreign secretary and Labour's leader in the Lords, to be personally targeted and swarmed, before being bundled into the back of a police car for his own safety. The experience, inevitably filmed and posted online in minutes, was another ugly reminder of what many politicians encounter in the name of this modern form of protest - abusive, personal, edgy. But it's also reignited the anger inside the Conservative Party at theprime minister's false claims in Parliament a week ago. Sir Keir was bundled into a police car for his own protection after being surrounded by protesters Mr Johnson misleadingly suggested the Labour leader had been involved in the decision not to prosecute serial sex offender Jimmy Savile, a political attack that attracted criticism from some Conservatives straight away. It led later in the week to the resignation of one of his closest political confidants, and was one of the reasons why concern was spreading in Conservative ranks last week about Mr Johnson's leadership. His refusal to apologise, and partial retraction, made some MPs queasy and was the trigger for at least one of them to add their private letter to those already submitted in an effort to oust him. Since then the prime minister has been trying to demonstrate that he would make good on his promise to the party to change - to sharpen up No 10, to end the missteps and mistakes. Two arrested after protesters surround Keir Starmer Aide quits over PM's Savile comments Fact-checking PM's Jimmy Savile claim More Tories come out against PM amid parties row Some of the protesters who surrounded Sir Keir were heard to be shouting ""Jimmy Savile"" among the frenzied accusations they were hurling at him. It's impossible to say categorically that they had been driven by the prime minister's comments last week. But the ugly event has stirred calls again among Tory MPs for the PM to take back his comments completely, and to acknowledge the danger of what he'd said. There is no sign as I write that No 10 has any intention of doing so. Mr Johnson has condemned the behaviour of the protesters but made no comment about the content of their accusations, far less addressed suggestions that his own conduct may have had something to do with it. So the prime minister may find himself accused of stirring up an unpleasant episode of modern protest just at the point when No 10 had been trying to calm things down.

"Hafan y MÃ´r park in north Wales is already fully booked for its opening week Holidaymakers still want a staycation this year - despite many pandemic restrictions easing, tourism leaders have said. One major holiday park destination in Wales said it was already fully booked ahead of its opening week in March. Tourism bosses across Snowdonia said demand was buoyant - with bookings expected to exceed last summer. But the sector said managing to recruit enough staff to meet holidaymakers' expectations was challenging. ""Already in our early bookings, our park is full,"" said Denise Bossons, the general manager overseeing operations at Hafan y MÃ´r in Pwllheli. Will travel return to normal this summer? The quirky holiday lets that are nothing like home The park on Gwynedd's LlÅ·n peninsula is one of the largest in the Haven holiday group's portfolio, and for more than 40 years was known as Butlin's Pwllheli. Hafan y MÃ´r park boss Denise Bossons says they are continuing to invest millions of pounds in their staycation destination At the height of the holiday season, the park now employs about 650 people - the vast majority local to the area. In November, a Â£15m redevelopment programme for the park was approved by planners, reflecting the company's confidence in the staycation market. You don't need 'abroad' for a holiday Snowdon: Call it Yr Wyddfa The staycation confidence is echoed by the Snowdonia 360 partnership, which brings together and promotes about 30 visitor destinations around the national park and north Wales coast. It said there had already been a surge in advance bookings for this year - and also next year. This video can not be played Snowdon has seen a sharp increase in visitors since the start of the pandemic ""The figures are looking very promising,"" said Sian Pritchard at Snowdonia 360. ""Some of our accommodation providers are fully booked for February half-term, some also fully booked over Easter, and we are also finding people want to come to the area now, which is out of season."" She said staycations in north Wales were ""here to stay"" for this year and next year, with many of the visitors making a return journey, after enjoying experiences on their doorstep during the pandemic. Snowdonia 360's Sian Pritchard says they are expecting an incredibly busy 2022 season ""Those with families especially, and those who have invested in having their pets over lockdown, they are looking for dog-friendly, family friendly holidays, and I think north Wales is the perfect destination for that,"" she added. But demand to holiday closer to home, alongside the pandemic, has brought other challenges - especially when it comes to recruiting hospitality staff. The Italianate village of Portmeirion near Porthmadog is expecting to cater for up to 3,000 visitors a day, alongside a thriving hotel business on the site made famous by the cult 1960s television show The Prisoner. The picturesque Italianate village of Portmeirion continues to fly the flag for holidays on your doorstep Location manager Meurig Jones said they would had to be creative in how they deal with that demand, and would be holding job fairs at the attraction in the coming weeks. ""I think there are less people around, and the tourism industry isn't the easiest to work in,"" he said, adding: ""It's long hours, and it can be long nights."" Being put through their paces: New recruits to Haven's chef academy Back at Hafan y MÃ´r, the teams there need to recruit 350 new staff working across its entire operations, from catering and bar staff, to running site supermarkets and cleaning teams. In the kitchens of its main Coast House restaurant, it has come up with a new approach to tackling the shortage in chefs and cooks - and that is to train them from scratch. This year, about 25 new recruits, some without any catering experience, are being taught at Haven's inhouse chef academy. This video can not be played The holiday camps are packed, the sun is shining and the phrase ""staycation"" is yet to be invented. Welcome to 1971 One of those putting them through their paces is chef Billy Butcher: ""We've got a lot variety of people among the new recruits, with a lot of different levels of where they are at - some of them don't even know how to cook an egg. ""Through this training process they are starting to learn skills they never thought they never thought they'd be able to learn,"" he added. Travel rules: What you need to know Covid passports: Where do you need them? By the end of February, the trainees will begin a guaranteed 18 month placement, finding themselves working in live kitchens, and ready to serve up food for real holidaymakers at Hafan y Mor, and other Haven parks across the UK. But have firms such as Haven put all their eggs - and bacon in this case - in one basket, banking on another bumper staycation summer? Travel agent Gwen Elen Morgan does not think so. Stay and away - travel agent Gwen Morgan says holidaymakers are choosing both options Based at independent travel firm Nico Travel in the Conwy Valley town of Llanrwst, she said while they are seeing the return of the international traveller, holidaying near to home remains popular. ""I think people are definitely enjoying staycations this year,"" she said. ""It's a win-win for us, because we can offer both - it's great for everybody."" THE TUCKERS ARE BACK:They might not always be on the right side of the law, but who's telling? LOVE LETTER TO WRESTLING:The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be Holidays abroad are now OK, says Mark Drakeford Holiday bookings jump as Covid travel tests axed Urgent tourism rethink call amid staycation boom Overloaded visitor experience 'could harm Wales' Record visits to north Wales boost businesses Compare your staycation to the holidays of 1971.

"Oil giant BP has rejected calls for a windfall tax on energy companies' bumper profits, saying it would reduce investment in UK gas and renewables. BP posted a profit of $12.8bn (Â£9.5bn) for 2021 after oil and gas prices surged in the second half of the year. That has prompted calls for a one-off tax to help support families struggling to pay their energy bills. Labour said it was ""only fair and right"" that energy firms making higher profits should pay more tax. But BP said: ""Generally, a windfall tax on UK oil and gas producers would not encourage investment in producing the UK's gas resources. ""Very importantly, we also believe the UK should continue its [low carbon] energy transition as fast as possible. BP is committed to playing our part here,"" a company spokesperson said. Last week, rival oil giant Shell also reported profits of $19bn on the same day that the energy regulator Ofgem announced UK householders would see a 54% rise in their domestic energy bills in April. That has prompted criticism that energy firms are raking in excess profits on the back of fuel poverty and""creeping climate apocalypse"",external. But the oil giants argue they are facing an unprecedented challenge: while the global economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, they are being urged to shift to lower carbon alternatives, and need big profits to fund that transition. Sunak defends response as energy bills soar by Â£693 Petrol prices: Are we paying too much at the pump? Watch: Government 'sided with oil and gas companies' BP said over this decade the firm planned to invest more than twice what it made in Britain, the ""great majority"" in offshore wind, solar, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and electric vehicle charging. BP has moved further than many of its rivals, outlining a plan to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 and reduce its oil output by 40%, or more than 1 million barrels per day. The strong results showed BP was doing what it had promised: ""performing while transforming"" BP chief executive Bernard Looney said. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies. The idea is to target firms that were lucky enough to benefit from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. An example of such a windfall would be high energy prices. Companies that get oil and gas out of the ground are getting much more money for it than they were last year, largely because there has been so much more demand as the world emerges from the pandemic. Read more about windfall taxes here Last year's profit compares to a $5.7bn loss BP reported in 2020, when economies around the world were shut down due to the Covid pandemic. But rising demand for oil last year, as economies reopened, combined with supply chain challenges, pushed energy prices sharply higher by the end of 2021. The surge in revenues prompted Mr Looney to describe BP as ""a cash machine"", with profits reaching more than $4bn in the final quarter. Those profits come at a particularly sensitive time with UK households facing a cost of living crisis, which has already prompted the government to step in with a council tax rebate and loans to smooth the coming rise in domestic energy prices. The Treasury said it would not comment on speculation over tax changes but pointed out that oil and gas firms' profits are already taxed at a higher rate than other businesses. ""A windfall tax could deter Â£14bn worth of opportunities awaiting investment, which would risk both security of our energy supply, as well as almost 200,000 jobs that rely on the industry,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. The same high energy prices that are delivering crushing bills to households are seeing profits at companies like BP and Shell balloon. It seems like a no-brainer to tax one to solve the other. Both Conservative and Labour governments have imposed windfall taxes before. But government officials and industry experts insist it's not that simple. BP and Shell's operations in UK waters have dwindled and they already pay double the tax rate of other businesses on UK-based profits. Taxing them on overseas revenues is problematic as they already pay in the countries in which they operate. Previous windfall taxes have generally been on companies with predominantly UK based operations. Even if you could design a mechanism to do it, the government is adamant that it would deter investment in securing the best yield from domestic fossil fuel reserves and be a raid on money that could be used to build or buy wind farms, generate hydrogen or install more electric car charging points. Sceptics would say big payouts to shareholders dent the credibility of that, but others say shareholders are primarily pension funds so a windfall tax would be hitting savers. Whatever the merits of the arguments, with profits at Shell and BP set to rise significantly again this year as gas and oil prices stay high, it's unlikely calls for a windfall tax will go away. However Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both called for a windfall tax on the profits of firms such as BP and Shell to fund more support for households. ""The boss of BP described the energy price crisis as a cash machine for his company - and the people supplying the cash are the British people through rocketing energy bills,"" said Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow secretary of state for climate and net zero. ""In these circumstances, it is only fair and right for oil and gas producers to contribute to helping the millions of families facing soaring inflation and a cost of living crisis."" Under a plan outlined by Labour last month, North Sea energy producers would pay higher corporation tax for a year to fund Â£1.2bn of help for households. Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: ""It simply cannot be right these energy companies are making super profits whilst people are too scared to turn their radiators on and terrified there will be a cold snap. ""A windfall tax is the best way to get money to the people who need it quickly, but also to make sure there is some sense of trust and proportionality in the system."" Only a fraction of BP's profits are generated in the North Sea, however, so a windfall tax applied only to those operations would raise limited revenue, while applying an additional tax to the firm's global profits might be more difficult to execute. Former BP executive Nick Butler said what mattered most was not how much money the oil giants were making but how they chose to spend those profits. ""What society needs now is both the transition to low carbon and energy security,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""We need to invest in oil and gas because 80% of all the energy we use every day is oil and gas, and we need companies like BP and Shell investing in that supply to ensure volatility of the world market is mitigated.""

"Adele will give her first performance at the Brit Awards since 2016 The 2022 Brit Awards take place at the O2 Arena on Tuesday night, with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Dave and Little Simz leading the nominations. All four artists are up for the night's biggest prizes - artist and album of the year - alongside Sam Fender. The ceremony is being hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who takes over from Jack Whitehall. ""I'm still pinching myself,"" says the star, who firsttweeted about his ambitions to helm the show in 2011,external. ""I don't know who's won what - or even who's nominated for what! There might even be a little surprise performance. I don't know just yet."" All will be revealed when the show starts at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday. It will be broadcast live on ITV, and on YouTube for viewers outside the UK. Adele to return to stage at Brit Awards Brit Awards announce first gender-neutral nominees Brit Awards 2022: Full list of nominees Dave is one of the most highly-anticipated performers of the night Last year's Brit Awards took place as part of the government's pilot scheme for the return of live events. Covid restrictions necessitated a mixture of live and virtual performances, with artists like Coldplay, The Weeknd and Elton John appearing on tape. This year, organisers have vowed to ""keep everything in the room"" - even when that meantscrapping a planned performance from US star Doja Cat, after members of her team tested positive for Covid. As a result, Tuesday's performances are exclusively coming from British artists - including all five artist of the year nominees: Adele, Dave, Ed Sheeran, Little Simz and Sam Fender. Of those, Dave has the most to live up to. Hisaudacious, politically-charged, performance of Black,externalin 2019 is one of the most powerful Brits moments of all time. And even if he chooses to play his biggest hit from last year - the largely apolitical Stormzy collaboration, Clash - he's bound to make the most of his four minutes on stage. Elsewhere, Holly Humberstone, winner of the Rising Star prize and an electrifying live performer, will make her Brits debut; while Anne-Marie and KSI will play their platinum-certified, song of the year-nominated hit, Don't Play. And bringing a touch of old-school rock and roll energy is Liam Gallagher, who'll be showcasing his new single, Everything's Electric. Could Little Simz beat more established stars like Adele and Ed Sheeran? It's almost impossible to ignore the sales juggernaut that is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins. Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks. The Brits are set up to reward commercial success - so she would appear to be a lock-in for the best artist and album categories. And if Adele wins the other two prizes she's nominated for (song of the year and best pop artist) she'll tie with Robbie Williams as the most-awarded artist in Brits history, with 13 trophies weighing down her mantlepiece. Rapper Little Simz is the dark horse in the best album race. Her smart, funky record Sometimes I Might Be Introvert wasmusic critics' favourite album of 2021, and her producer, Inflo, has already been namedproducer of the year. If the 1,300-strong voting academy reflects those choices, Simz could be going home with her first-ever Brit. For song of the year, my money is on Glass Animals - whose dream-pop anthem Heat Waves has become a streaming phenomenon. First released in October 2020, it has spent 61 weeks on the UK charts, eventually climbing into the top five at the end of last year. Amongst the 10 nominees, it has the highest total of Spotify streams - 1.2 billion, compared to the 885 million for Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, and the 636 million earned by Adele's Easy On Me. For best group, Little Mix are a good shout. There's a lot of affection for them in the industry, and this will be the last chance to reward Jade, Perrie and Leigh-Anne before they go on hiatus later this year. But voters could also be swayed by the reassuring presence of Coldplay - who've picked up a record ninth best group nomination - and Wolf Alice, whose Blue Weekend was one of the best-reviewed albums of 2021. Dua Lipa was the last person to win best female, in 2021, before the category was retired The Brits took the decision to scrap gendered awards last year, falling in line with other major music prizes like the Grammys, MTV Awards and Australia's Arias. The move attracted some criticism from the likes of Piers Morgan and culture secretary Nadine Dorries - who said she was concerned about how the new system ""would work in terms of fair gender representation"". In the end, more women have been nominated than at any time in the past decade; and it seems fair to assume Adele will walk away with the lion's share of the prizes. Brits chairman Tom March says the move away from best male and female prizes ""felt right"". ""I like the idea of creating the biggest award and accolade possible - and artist of the year has that gravitas,""he told Music Week,external. ""The most important thing for me was making sure it didn't reduce opportunity,"" he added, noting that the creation of five new awards - including best dance and best pop act - had created ""opportunities for more artists to be nominated"". This video can not be played How Mo Gilligan predicted he'd host the Brits in 2011 Every Brits host puts their own stamp on the show. James Corden was the effusive music fan, Dermot O'Leary was the polished entertainer and Jack Whitehall terrorised innocent pop stars with his barbed asides. ""You've got to be so sharp, man,"" says Mo Gilligan, who's taking over this year. ""Remember when you went to school and you had a compass to draw circles? That's how sharp you've got to be. ""But that's the cool thing about the Brits. You can have moments where it can be a bit chaotic and there's some carnage - but then you can have iconic moments where you're like, 'Oh my God, I was there and I seen that live'."" The comedian and Masked Singer judge says he'll be less confrontational than his predecessor. ""I feel like I'm the person who's party you're coming to, but not everyone knows each other, so I've got to make sure everyone's having a great time."" Pop star Olivia Rodrigo could go home with two trophies These are much harder to call. The competition for best international artist is unbelievably tough - with Billie Eilish facing off against Taylor Swift, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X. But the one to beat is Olivia Rodrigo, whose debut album Sour was the UK's fourth biggest record of the year. She also made her live debut at last year's Brit Awards, something that is sure to linger in the minds of the voting academy. Rodrigo's pop-punk anthem Good 4U has a good shot at winning best international song, too. Other strong contenders include The Weeknd's Save Your Tears and Lil Nas X's Montero (Call Me By Your Name). Front-runners for best international group are Abba, who are riding a huge wave of affection following their unexpected comeback last September. If they win, it'll be the Swedish band's first ever Brit Award. They only have one previous nomination - for best album - in 1977. ""I must say, I don't think we've ever had such good reviews as we have for this album,"" says songwriter and keyboard player Benny Andersson. ""Obviously we're kosher now and we weren't in the '70s."" And if they win, how will he celebrate? ""I don't know,"" he laughs. ""I can send you a text to tell you.""

Adele won three out the four main prizes at Brit Awards on Tuesday, where she also put in an assured performance of her track I Drink Wine. The singer won best artist, album and song of the year for Easy on Me. Ed Sheeran was also crowned songwriter of the year at London's O2 Arena, and played two tracks, including one alongside special guest Stormzy. Dua Lipa won the night's other big prize, as TikTok users voted for her and not Adele as the best pop/R&B act. It means that for now at least, Robbie Williams remains out on his own ahead of Adele as the most awarded artist in Brits history with 13. After winning the first of her three awards, for best song, Adele beamed: ""I can't believe a piano ballad won up against that many bangers"". Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks, and this was recognised by the Brits, which rewards mainstream success.

"Adele will give her first performance at the Brit Awards since 2016 The 2022 Brit Awards take place at the O2 Arena on Tuesday night, with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Dave and Little Simz leading the nominations. All four artists are up for the night's biggest prizes - artist and album of the year - alongside Sam Fender. The ceremony is being hosted for the first time by comedian Mo Gilligan, who takes over from Jack Whitehall. ""I'm still pinching myself,"" says the star, who firsttweeted about his ambitions to helm the show in 2011,external. ""I don't know who's won what - or even who's nominated for what! There might even be a little surprise performance. I don't know just yet."" All will be revealed when the show starts at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday. It will be broadcast live on ITV, and on YouTube for viewers outside the UK. Adele to return to stage at Brit Awards Brit Awards announce first gender-neutral nominees Brit Awards 2022: Full list of nominees Dave is one of the most highly-anticipated performers of the night Last year's Brit Awards took place as part of the government's pilot scheme for the return of live events. Covid restrictions necessitated a mixture of live and virtual performances, with artists like Coldplay, The Weeknd and Elton John appearing on tape. This year, organisers have vowed to ""keep everything in the room"" - even when that meantscrapping a planned performance from US star Doja Cat, after members of her team tested positive for Covid. As a result, Tuesday's performances are exclusively coming from British artists - including all five artist of the year nominees: Adele, Dave, Ed Sheeran, Little Simz and Sam Fender. Of those, Dave has the most to live up to. Hisaudacious, politically-charged, performance of Black,externalin 2019 is one of the most powerful Brits moments of all time. And even if he chooses to play his biggest hit from last year - the largely apolitical Stormzy collaboration, Clash - he's bound to make the most of his four minutes on stage. Elsewhere, Holly Humberstone, winner of the Rising Star prize and an electrifying live performer, will make her Brits debut; while Anne-Marie and KSI will play their platinum-certified, song of the year-nominated hit, Don't Play. And bringing a touch of old-school rock and roll energy is Liam Gallagher, who'll be showcasing his new single, Everything's Electric. Could Little Simz beat more established stars like Adele and Ed Sheeran? It's almost impossible to ignore the sales juggernaut that is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins. Her so-called ""divorce album"", 30, was thebiggest-seller of 2021, selling more than 600,000 copies in just six weeks. The Brits are set up to reward commercial success - so she would appear to be a lock-in for the best artist and album categories. And if Adele wins the other two prizes she's nominated for (song of the year and best pop artist) she'll tie with Robbie Williams as the most-awarded artist in Brits history, with 13 trophies weighing down her mantlepiece. Rapper Little Simz is the dark horse in the best album race. Her smart, funky record Sometimes I Might Be Introvert wasmusic critics' favourite album of 2021, and her producer, Inflo, has already been namedproducer of the year. If the 1,300-strong voting academy reflects those choices, Simz could be going home with her first-ever Brit. For song of the year, my money is on Glass Animals - whose dream-pop anthem Heat Waves has become a streaming phenomenon. First released in October 2020, it has spent 61 weeks on the UK charts, eventually climbing into the top five at the end of last year. Amongst the 10 nominees, it has the highest total of Spotify streams - 1.2 billion, compared to the 885 million for Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, and the 636 million earned by Adele's Easy On Me. For best group, Little Mix are a good shout. There's a lot of affection for them in the industry, and this will be the last chance to reward Jade, Perrie and Leigh-Anne before they go on hiatus later this year. But voters could also be swayed by the reassuring presence of Coldplay - who've picked up a record ninth best group nomination - and Wolf Alice, whose Blue Weekend was one of the best-reviewed albums of 2021. Dua Lipa was the last person to win best female, in 2021, before the category was retired The Brits took the decision to scrap gendered awards last year, falling in line with other major music prizes like the Grammys, MTV Awards and Australia's Arias. The move attracted some criticism from the likes of Piers Morgan and culture secretary Nadine Dorries - who said she was concerned about how the new system ""would work in terms of fair gender representation"". In the end, more women have been nominated than at any time in the past decade; and it seems fair to assume Adele will walk away with the lion's share of the prizes. Brits chairman Tom March says the move away from best male and female prizes ""felt right"". ""I like the idea of creating the biggest award and accolade possible - and artist of the year has that gravitas,""he told Music Week,external. ""The most important thing for me was making sure it didn't reduce opportunity,"" he added, noting that the creation of five new awards - including best dance and best pop act - had created ""opportunities for more artists to be nominated"". This video can not be played How Mo Gilligan predicted he'd host the Brits in 2011 Every Brits host puts their own stamp on the show. James Corden was the effusive music fan, Dermot O'Leary was the polished entertainer and Jack Whitehall terrorised innocent pop stars with his barbed asides. ""You've got to be so sharp, man,"" says Mo Gilligan, who's taking over this year. ""Remember when you went to school and you had a compass to draw circles? That's how sharp you've got to be. ""But that's the cool thing about the Brits. You can have moments where it can be a bit chaotic and there's some carnage - but then you can have iconic moments where you're like, 'Oh my God, I was there and I seen that live'."" The comedian and Masked Singer judge says he'll be less confrontational than his predecessor. ""I feel like I'm the person who's party you're coming to, but not everyone knows each other, so I've got to make sure everyone's having a great time."" Pop star Olivia Rodrigo could go home with two trophies These are much harder to call. The competition for best international artist is unbelievably tough - with Billie Eilish facing off against Taylor Swift, Doja Cat and Lil Nas X. But the one to beat is Olivia Rodrigo, whose debut album Sour was the UK's fourth biggest record of the year. She also made her live debut at last year's Brit Awards, something that is sure to linger in the minds of the voting academy. Rodrigo's pop-punk anthem Good 4U has a good shot at winning best international song, too. Other strong contenders include The Weeknd's Save Your Tears and Lil Nas X's Montero (Call Me By Your Name). Front-runners for best international group are Abba, who are riding a huge wave of affection following their unexpected comeback last September. If they win, it'll be the Swedish band's first ever Brit Award. They only have one previous nomination - for best album - in 1977. ""I must say, I don't think we've ever had such good reviews as we have for this album,"" says songwriter and keyboard player Benny Andersson. ""Obviously we're kosher now and we weren't in the '70s."" And if they win, how will he celebrate? ""I don't know,"" he laughs. ""I can send you a text to tell you.""

"BBC Reality Check has examined Boris Johnson's claim that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) and has found no evidence that Sir Keir was involved at any point in the decision not to charge Savile. The Labour leader called Mr Johnson's comments a ""ridiculous slur"" and they have been criticised by the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Mr Johnson had said that Sir Keir ""spent most of his time [as DPP] prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile"". He made the unfounded claim, which has been discredited before, in the House of Commons where ""parliamentary privilege"" gives MPs certain legal protections over what they say. On Tuesday 1 February, Downing Street said Boris Johnson ""stands by"" his comments. But on Thursday 3 February, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm not talking about the leader of the opposition's personal record when he was DPP. I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole."" In response to Mr Johnson's latest comments, Downing Street's head of policy, Munira Mirza,announced her resignation- saying the PM should have apologised. In her resignation letter, published by The Spectator, she wrote: ""You are a better man than many of your detractors will ever understand, which is why it is so desperately sad that you let yourself down by making a scurrilous accusation against the leader of the opposition."" Jimmy Savile was revealed to be a serial sexual abuser after his death in 2011. The DJ and television presenter had attacked hundreds of women and children at various locations including hospitals, schools and the BBC. Four allegations of sexual assault by Savile in the 1970s were investigated by Surrey and Sussex Police in 2007 and 2008. Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service in 2009 when Surrey Police interviewed Savile and consulted a CPS lawyer who decided there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution to take place. As Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Keir Starmer was the most senior public prosecutor in England and Wales and responsible for leading the CPS. The CPS prosecutes most criminal cases in England and Wales and employsabout 6,000 staff,,externalhalf of them lawyers who decide which cases should go ahead. In 2012, Sir Keir commissioneda report,externalfrom Alison Levitt QC into why Savile was not prosecuted. In three cases investigated by Surrey Police, no prosecutions were brought on the basis that none of the victims was prepared to give evidence in court. The report suggestedthat had the victims known there were other people making similar complaints they might have been prepared to do so. Prosecutions could have been possible ""had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach"". It also concluded: ""I have seen nothing to suggest that the decisions not to prosecute were consciously influenced by any improper motive on the part of either police or prosecutors."" The CPS said: ""There is no reference within the report to any involvement from the DPP in the decision-making in the case. The reviewing lawyer at the time set out their own reasons for the decisions they took, which are reproduced in the report."" Reality Check spoke to Nazir Afzal who was Chief Crown Prosecutor in the CPS for North West England from 2011-15. We asked him whether - as DPP - Keir Starmer would have known about the decision not to prosecute Savile. He said: ""None of that would have been escalated beyond the south-east and Keir wasn't aware of it."" ""At that time we were dealing [with] 900,000 prosecutions a year,"" he added. Sir Keir said when the report was published: ""I would like to take the opportunity to apologise for the shortcomings in the part played by the CPS in these cases. If this report and my apology are to serve their full purpose, then this must be seen as a watershed moment."" The Labour leader called Mr Johnson's comment ""a ridiculous slur, peddled by right-wing trolls"". Unfounded posts directly accusing Sir Keir of failing to prosecute Savile saw an upsurge on social media after he became Labour leader in April 2020. They have been shared by British followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, among others. A video clip of the prime minister's accusation has been spreading on anti-vaccine channels with thousands of followers on social media chat app Telegram, as ""proof"" of an alleged cover-up of high-profile child abuse. Richard Scorer, a lawyer who represented victims of Savile, told the BBC that the prime minister's claim was ""fundamentally baseless"". He said the victims he had spoken to were ""disgusted by Mr Johnson's comments"" and called on the prime minister to withdraw them and apologise. The Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""far from satisfied that the comments in question were appropriate on this occasion"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said: 'I'm certainly not repeating it... I can't substantiate that"", when asked about it on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Conservative MP Simon Hoare tweeted that""the Jimmy Savile false allegations should be withdrawn"".,external His colleague Julian Smith said that the claim was ""wrong & cannot be defended"".

"Hafan y MÃ´r park in north Wales is already fully booked for its opening week Holidaymakers still want a staycation this year - despite many pandemic restrictions easing, tourism leaders have said. One major holiday park destination in Wales said it was already fully booked ahead of its opening week in March. Tourism bosses across Snowdonia said demand was buoyant - with bookings expected to exceed last summer. But the sector said managing to recruit enough staff to meet holidaymakers' expectations was challenging. ""Already in our early bookings, our park is full,"" said Denise Bossons, the general manager overseeing operations at Hafan y MÃ´r in Pwllheli. Will travel return to normal this summer? The quirky holiday lets that are nothing like home The park on Gwynedd's LlÅ·n peninsula is one of the largest in the Haven holiday group's portfolio, and for more than 40 years was known as Butlin's Pwllheli. Hafan y MÃ´r park boss Denise Bossons says they are continuing to invest millions of pounds in their staycation destination At the height of the holiday season, the park now employs about 650 people - the vast majority local to the area. In November, a Â£15m redevelopment programme for the park was approved by planners, reflecting the company's confidence in the staycation market. You don't need 'abroad' for a holiday Snowdon: Call it Yr Wyddfa The staycation confidence is echoed by the Snowdonia 360 partnership, which brings together and promotes about 30 visitor destinations around the national park and north Wales coast. It said there had already been a surge in advance bookings for this year - and also next year. This video can not be played Snowdon has seen a sharp increase in visitors since the start of the pandemic ""The figures are looking very promising,"" said Sian Pritchard at Snowdonia 360. ""Some of our accommodation providers are fully booked for February half-term, some also fully booked over Easter, and we are also finding people want to come to the area now, which is out of season."" She said staycations in north Wales were ""here to stay"" for this year and next year, with many of the visitors making a return journey, after enjoying experiences on their doorstep during the pandemic. Snowdonia 360's Sian Pritchard says they are expecting an incredibly busy 2022 season ""Those with families especially, and those who have invested in having their pets over lockdown, they are looking for dog-friendly, family friendly holidays, and I think north Wales is the perfect destination for that,"" she added. But demand to holiday closer to home, alongside the pandemic, has brought other challenges - especially when it comes to recruiting hospitality staff. The Italianate village of Portmeirion near Porthmadog is expecting to cater for up to 3,000 visitors a day, alongside a thriving hotel business on the site made famous by the cult 1960s television show The Prisoner. The picturesque Italianate village of Portmeirion continues to fly the flag for holidays on your doorstep Location manager Meurig Jones said they would had to be creative in how they deal with that demand, and would be holding job fairs at the attraction in the coming weeks. ""I think there are less people around, and the tourism industry isn't the easiest to work in,"" he said, adding: ""It's long hours, and it can be long nights."" Being put through their paces: New recruits to Haven's chef academy Back at Hafan y MÃ´r, the teams there need to recruit 350 new staff working across its entire operations, from catering and bar staff, to running site supermarkets and cleaning teams. In the kitchens of its main Coast House restaurant, it has come up with a new approach to tackling the shortage in chefs and cooks - and that is to train them from scratch. This year, about 25 new recruits, some without any catering experience, are being taught at Haven's inhouse chef academy. This video can not be played The holiday camps are packed, the sun is shining and the phrase ""staycation"" is yet to be invented. Welcome to 1971 One of those putting them through their paces is chef Billy Butcher: ""We've got a lot variety of people among the new recruits, with a lot of different levels of where they are at - some of them don't even know how to cook an egg. ""Through this training process they are starting to learn skills they never thought they never thought they'd be able to learn,"" he added. Travel rules: What you need to know Covid passports: Where do you need them? By the end of February, the trainees will begin a guaranteed 18 month placement, finding themselves working in live kitchens, and ready to serve up food for real holidaymakers at Hafan y Mor, and other Haven parks across the UK. But have firms such as Haven put all their eggs - and bacon in this case - in one basket, banking on another bumper staycation summer? Travel agent Gwen Elen Morgan does not think so. Stay and away - travel agent Gwen Morgan says holidaymakers are choosing both options Based at independent travel firm Nico Travel in the Conwy Valley town of Llanrwst, she said while they are seeing the return of the international traveller, holidaying near to home remains popular.

"This video can not be played Courtney Peterson paid to see a psychologist privately as an NHS referral was taking too long When Courtney Peterson lost her unborn daughter, Lillian, a few months before the pandemic, her medical care was ""cold and clinical"". She felt like she was ""just a number"" and she didn't get the support she needed. Ms Peterson shared her story as a committee of MSPs said women and families in similar situations must be given help to cope with their experiences as a ""matter of urgency"". They found there was currently no specific support in Scotland for those suffering from birth trauma. The term is used to describe trauma during or after birth that can include post-traumatic stress disorder. The Scottish government said it would take time to fully consider the comments and recommendations of the committee and respond in due course. Miscarriage: 'I was in pain - they did not listen' 'NHS abandoned me after I tried to kill myself' New mums' 'postcode lottery' for mental health care Mental health help for new mothers Ms Peterson toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat she would have been discharged from hospital on the day she lost her baby, had it not been for the protests of her friend. ""I definitely feel like you are just a number,"" she said. ""You don't want personalisation but you want someone to support you as you. Not as 'You are one in four women who has a miscarriage'. ""You want someone to look at it and say 'I'm really sorry this has happened' and support you nicely through it."" As she struggled to come to terms with her loss, Ms Peterson contacted her GP and asked to be put on a waiting list to see a psychologist. But she added: ""I heard back maybe six to seven months later and by that point it was far too late and I had already gone privately."" Her experience led to her moving from Aberdeen to Shropshire. She said: ""I will always have my daughter with me, no matter where I am. ""But to be able to get away from a place where I was constantly in a negative space, to be able to help myself positively, has been a really nice breath of fresh air."" Harri Lidher said families who experience the loss of a baby need more support Harri Lidher lost her baby at full term last autumn, after picking up Sepsis from a medical procedure - a membrane sweep - to induce labour. She told The Nine that she later woke up from a nap and knew something was wrong when she couldn't feel her son move. Husband Steve took her to hospital but medics were unable to find a heartbeat. She said: ""It felt really unbearable to live when I've been going through it. It's just been too hard. ""I think there definitely needs to be more to help people, especially that initial six months to a year."" In a report published on Tuesday, the committee said it heard that ""there are no services that directly address birth trauma"". It also heard of a ""sharp rise"" in cases during the pandemic. One woman revealed she was told her baby did not have a heartbeat while her partner waited in the car outside the hospital. It added: ""The committee urges the Scottish government to develop and support birth trauma prevention work as a matter of urgency and to work across all NHS health boards to implement resulting measures."" The MSPs said it was ""unacceptable"" that parents who had lost babies had to wait until 2024 for the establishment of specialist baby loss units and called for the timetable to be accelerated. The committee said national protocols should be devised to allow for care to be provided for parents who had lost a baby in a separate area from maternity wards. One witness described bereaved parents having to ""run a gauntlet of balloons, teddies and all these things saying 'congratulations'"". Cat Berry, the group facilitator and volunteer co-ordinator at Juno Perinatal Mental Health Support, said women who go to hospital in the knowledge that they are going through miscarriage or that they will have a stillbirth are told in advance they will be greeted by a specialist bereavement midwife. But she added: ""That is not happening. ""They are actually pressing the buzzer to the maternity ward, and they are then greeted at the door by happy fathers with balloons saying 'congratulations' or 'welcome to the world'."" Committee convener Gillian Martin said: ""Up to 20% of women in Scotland experience negative mental health impacts before, during and after giving birth and the aim of our inquiry was to shine a spotlight on this important issue and to see what more should be done to support these women."" A spokesman for the Scottish government said it was committed to providing ""equitable, coordinated access"" to mental health provision for women, infants and their families throughout pregnancy and afterwards. It has invested more than Â£16m in perinatal and infant mental health since 2019, he added. ""Experiencing the loss of a baby at any stage of pregnancy is devastating for the families involved, and they need to be supported and treated with care, empathy and kindness,"" he said. ""Our national Bereavement Care Pathway that are currently being piloted in Scotland have the voices of bereaved parents at the heart of their development. ""We also welcome the committee's support for specialist mother and baby Units.  Women and families from across Scotland can access this care if it is clinically appropriate and there is a fund to support women and families with the cost of travel and expenses to these units. ""Later this month we will also launch a public consultation on how best to take forward our commitment to increase the number of mother and baby beds available.""
