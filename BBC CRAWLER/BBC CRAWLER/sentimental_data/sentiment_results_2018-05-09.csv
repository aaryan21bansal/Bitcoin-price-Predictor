"Sophie Lionnet's body was found on a bonfire in her employers' garden in September 2017 The trial over the alleged torture and murder of a nanny by her employers is ""stranger than fiction"", a jury heard. Prosecutor Richard Howell QC told the Old Bailey Sabrina Kouider and Ouissem Medouni treated French national Sophie Lionnet as ""less than human"". The couple blame each other for killing Ms Lionnet, whose body was burnt in the garden of their Wimbledon flat. The pair admit perverting the course of justice by disposing of the 21-year-old's body but deny murder. In his summing up speech, Mr Howell said the accused were driven by a ""preposterous"" obsession with Ms Kouider's ex-boyfriend, and former Boyzone pop star, Mark Walton. Boyzone founder 'never heard' of French nanny Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' Blue's Duncan James denies crowbar claim at murder trial Sophie Lionnet murder accused 'claimed Donald Trump connection' ""Of all the cases this historic building has heard, this must without hesitation enter the category of the more bizarre,"" Mr Howell said. ""Expressions such as 'you really could not make it up' and 'truth is stranger than fiction' come readily to mind. ""The defendants made a truly odd couple. There is a unique bond between them that has kept them together on and off for many years, a bond based partly in love and something close to it. ""But, as far as this trial is concerned, the point that really matters is that together they were a truly toxic combination."" Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider deny murder but admit perverting the course of justice During the trial, Ms Kouider, 35, and Mr Medouni, 40, were accused of torturing Ms Lionnet in the lead-up to her death. Mr Horwell said they regarded ""submissive"" Miss Lionnet as ""expendable"" and killed her out of ""revenge and punishment"". Mr Walton, a founder member of Boyzone, was praised by Mr Horwell for his ""integrity and honesty"" in giving evidence to the court. He added: ""Walton is a wealthy man - and good luck to him for that - but it is of course a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune will often be parted from it.""

"England fans were targeted by Russian supporters at a Euro 2016 match in Marseilles Russian authorities have given their ""assurance"" fans will be safe from violence at the World Cup finals. Officials have a ""blacklist"" of known hooligans and have banned anyone responsible for trouble at Euro 2016 from attending, the Foreign Affairs Committee heard. Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin was responding to concerns of other MPs. About 10,000 England fans are expected to travel to Russia in June. There wereviolent clashes when Russian fans charged England supportersin the stadium when the two countries played each other in Marseille at Euro 2016. Trouble was also reported in the city's streets between England, Russia and France fans. Fights involving football fans also broke out in the streets of Marseille Ms Baldwin told the committee that Russia was ""responsible"" for running a safe World Cup in June and had given its ""assurances"" to Fifa and the UK government. She said the threat of hooliganism had been a focus of two years of planning ahead of the event. The deployment of police officers who will be based in the country during the tournament was ""at least as large as any other country"" and co-operation with Russian authorities was ""strong"", Ms Baldwin said. Conservative MP Priti Patel questioned the minister about whether she was concerned there would be a repeat of the violence against England fans in Marseille. Harriet Baldwin said she had been given ""assurances"" by Russian officials Ms Baldwin said it had been a ""specific focus"" of authorities and she welcomed the banning of hooligans. She said:  ""I think this is an area where the police co-operation has been extensive but clearly as with any football event this is a risk that does need to be closely worked on and the risk of violence needs to be mitigated."" Asked if there were particular groups England fans should be aware of, Ms Baldwin said there is a ""blacklist of known troublemakers"" numbering about 1,800 people. The committee also heard that a ""mobile embassy"" will tour the cities hosting England games to assist fans. She said the Foreign Office's preparations had been affected by the expulsion of 23 UK diplomats from Russia in the wake of thepoisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliain Salisbury in March. But Ms Baldwin said her department had adapted to meet the challenge. Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat questioned the advice that fans from LGBT communities should exercise caution, and he suggested they could not rely on the assurances that Russian police would protect them. He said: ""We are not talking about fans being a little bit cautious, we're talking about fans realising that the police force there may not be on their side. ""That the law enforcement authorities may actually be working against them and that the state that they would expect to turn to in terms of protection may be the organisation that is going to repress them the harshest."" Ms Baldwin said she ""accepts"" Mr Tugendhat's comments but there had been ""assurances"". She urged fans to check theForeign Office's dedicated website,externalas well as the general travel advice for Russia before making their decision whether to travel.

"Mr Mahathir said he hoped a swearing-in ceremony would be held on Thursday Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has scored a historic victory in the general election. At the age of 92, Mr Mahathir defeated the Barisan Nasional coalition, which has been in power 60 years. He had come out of retirement to take on his former protege Najib Razak, who has been beset by allegations of corruption and cronyism. Mr Mahathir told reporters: ""We are not seeking revenge, we want to restore the rule of law"". The election commission said Mr Mahathir's opposition alliance had won 115 seats, over the threshold of 112 seats needed to form a government. He said he hoped a swearing-in ceremony would be held on Thursday. Mr Mahathir will become the oldest elected leader in the world. Mahathir Mohamad: A political survivor Najib Razak: Malaysia's tainted political aristocrat Malaysia country profile A government spokesman later declared nationwide public holidays for Thursday and Friday. With only a few seats left to count, official results showed Mr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan alliance, along with an ally in Sabah state, Borneo, had won 115 seats with BN on 79 seats. Opposition supporters poured on to the streets in celebration as the results became clear. Mahathir Mohamad's supporters took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur in celebration The campaign pitted Mr Mahathir's opposition group against the BN, led by incumbent Prime Minister Najib Razak. The BN and its major party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), have dominated Malaysian politics since the country won independence from Britain in 1957, but the once-powerful coalition has seen its popularity decline in recent years. In the previous election, in 2013, the opposition made unprecedented gains, winning the popular vote, but it failed to win enough seats to form a government. In a dramatic turn of events, then-opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was sentenced to five years jail on sodomy charges, which he said were part of a political smear campaign. Malaysia Elections: A battle of old allies Could Mahathir Mohamad make a comeback? Malaysia's youth have power they won't use Mr Mahathir, who was once an integral part of BN and a mentor to Mr Najib,abandoned the coalition in 2016. As he left, he said he was ""embarrassed"" to be associated with a party ""that is seen as supporting corruption"". Mr Najib has been embroiled in a corruption scandal, which saw him accused of pocketing some $700m from the 1Malaysian Development Berhad, a state investment fund. He has vehemently denied all allegations and been cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund is still being investigated by several countries and Mr Najib has been accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials. Mr Najib (L) was a former protege of Mr Mahathir (C) The government recently passed a law redrawing election boundaries, leading to accusations that it had gerrymandered constituencies to ensure they were filled by Malay Muslims, who are traditionally BN supporters. In the days before the poll, election reform group Bersih 2.0 accused the Election Commission (EC) of multiple ""electoral crimes"", including irregularities in postal voting and failing to remove dead people from the electoral roll. A controversial fake news law was also recently introduced, which critics say could be used by the authorities to muffle dissent. Mr Mahathir is himself being investigated under that law after alleging that his plane had been sabotaged. Malaysians had their fingers marked with indelible ink, showing that they had voted The government had insisted the election would be free and fair, with Mr Najib saying that the EC acted ""for the good of all"". Voters were electing 222 members of parliament as well as state assembly members in 12 of the 13 states. Malaysia uses a first-past-the-post electoral system, where the party that gets the most seats in parliament wins even if it does not win the popular vote.

"The woman had initially called Strasbourg's ambulance service A recording of an emergency service operator mocking a young mother, who died hours after her call was ignored, has sparked outrage in France. Naomi Musenga, 22, called Strasbourg's ambulance service with severe stomach pain and said: ""I'm going to die"". ""You'll definitely die one day, like everyone else,"" the worker replied. The woman eventually called another service and was taken to a hospital but died after a heart attack. The health minister has ordered an investigation. In the three-minute audio, Musenga - in a very weak voice - appeals for help and struggles to describe her pain while speaking with the ambulance service (Samu). The operator, apparently in an annoyed voice, replies: ""If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll hang up!"" ""I'm in a lot of pain,"" the woman replies. The worker then tells her to call a doctor, and gives her the number for a different service, SOS MÃ©decins, which sends out doctors instead of an ambulance. ""Help me, I'm very ill,"" the woman repeats. ""I can't help you, I don't know what you've got,"" answers the operator, giving the other number again, adding: ""I can't do it for you."" On front line with ambulance service How a speedy emergency services app is saving lives The recording also has an exchange between the operator and another staff member making fun of Musenga. The woman eventually managed to call SOS MÃ©decins and, after a five-hour wait, was taken to a hospital by the ambulance service. After suffering a stroke, she was transferred to the intensive care unit butdied hours later of ""multiple organ failure due to a hemorrhagic shock"", according to Le Monde newspaper (in French).,external Allow Facebook content?

The hospital said initial inquiries had led it to believe that the ""treatment of the call had not conformed to good practice"". The local prosecutor has opened an investigation. Reacting on Tuesday, Health Minister AgnÃ¨s Buzyn said on Twitter she was ""deeply outraged"" by the case and requested an investigation from the government agency in charge of health and social affairs, Igas.

Naomi Musenga's elder sister, Louange, said the way she had been treated was shocking. ""She was alone, she said she was going to die, her sheets were filthy, no-one should die in these conditions."" Describing Musenga as ""bright, strong, courageous"", she added: ""Naomi, as a human being... simply had the right to be rescued, to be cared for. This must not happen again."" London ranked top city for students Potential new cure found for baldness Meghan Markle waxwork revealed by Tussauds On Facebook, a page Justice pour Naomi Musenga (Justice for Naomi Musenga) has called for the ""truth and justice"", while a hashtag #JusticePourNaomi has been used hundreds of times on Twitter, with some accusing the Samu of ""negligence"" and ""racism"". The case has also highlighted what the head of France's association of emergency doctors sees as a crisis in the country's ambulance service. While condemning what happened in Strasbourg as shocking, Patrick Pelloux told Le Parisien newspaper the number of ambulance emergencies had mushroomed from eight million in 1988 to 21 million today, while the number of calls had trebled. There were carers who were ""exhausted, stressed and burnt out, who become detached from the patient's suffering,"" he said. A former Samu worker pointed out that out of 100 calls, only 10 to 20 were real emergencies, with the majority being people who are drunk, anxious or want someone to talk to.

"Faster, more frequent trains are being promised by Network Rail as it embarks on a digital overhaul to cope with rising passenger numbers, ageing equipment and the construction of HS2. The aim is for 70% of journeys to benefit from digital technology by the time HS2 reaches Manchester in 2033. Routes into various London mainline stations and across the Pennines will be the first to benefit. Network Rail described it as ""a turning point in the history of our railways"". More than half the UK's analogue signalling systems will need to be replaced in the next 15 years. That would cost about Â£20bn but deliver very little benefit to passengers, said Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne. ""New digital signalling offers a more cost-effective alternative that also brings significant benefit for rail users, such as more capacity, speed and reliability,"" he said. ""Not since the railway transformed from steam to diesel in the 1960s has a technological breakthrough held such promise to vastly improve our railway."" Trains could soon run 24 hours a day across network - rail boss Network Rail to end station toilet charges in 2019 Weather impact 'priority' for Network Rail Digital train control is already a reality on Crossrail and on Thameslink services through London Bridge, which uses ""fly-by-wire"" automatically operated trains. In the five years to 2024 the industry is planning to introduce it across the Pennines, the southern end of the East Coast main line into King's Cross and on some major commuter routes into Waterloo. The digital technology will safely allow more services to operate every hour by running trains closer together, improving frequency and capacity and reducing signal failures. Track is currently divided into long sections separated by traffic lights, but these will become shorter and the signalling system will be visible in the train's cab. There are 20,000 miles of track and 30,000 bridges, tunnels and viaducts on the British network It runs 19 of Britain's largest stations, while the remaining 2,500-plus are run by the train operating companies More than 4.6 million journeys are made every day in Great Britain, which is 1.7 billion in a year - double the amount taken 20 years ago The programme will be launched at an event in York on Thursday to be attended by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. He said: ""We're not going to transform a Victorian system overnight - there's been not enough done for many, many years. ""Passenger numbers have doubled, the railways are bursting at the seams.

"This video can not be played Haspel: 'I would never take CIA back to interrogation programme' The self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks has asked for permission to share information about Gina Haspel, nominee for CIA director, at her confirmation hearing. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is held at Guantanamo Bay,has asked a judge if he can share six paragraphs of information, the New York Times says,external. Mr Mohammed was tortured by the CIA following his capture in 2003. Ms Haspel is facing a grilling from senators at the hearing. Her nomination has faced opposition over her role at a secret CIA prison in Thailandwhere detainees were waterboarded in 2002. Ms Haspel told the Senate intelligence committee that under her leadership the agency would not restart a secret detention and interrogation programme under which suspects were tortured. She told committee members that, in retrospect, ""it is clear... that CIA was not prepared to conduct a detention and interrogation programme"". ""Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership the CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation programme,"" she added. Gina Haspel, the CIA pick Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: Al-Qaeda 'kingpin' Ms Haspel declined to confirm whether she had overseen waterboarding sessions. She told the committee she supported the CIA's decision to destroy videotapes of the interrogations, saying it was to protect the identities of agents. Senator Kamala Harris asked Ms Haspel if she agreed witha statement made by President Trump that torture worksas an interrogation method. She replied: ""Senator, I don't believe that torture works."" The hearing was briefly interrupted by a protester who was escorted out by police. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, pictured here in a 2012 courtroom sketch, is accused with others of executing the attacks of 11 September 2001 The request by Mr Mohammed to supply information to the intelligence committee was submitted to army judge Col James Pohl, according to one of Mr Mohammed's lawyers, Lt Col Derek Poteet. The request includes an attachment called ""Additional Facts, Law and Argument in Support"", which includes the six paragraphs, the New York Times reported. Col Poteet said he was not able to describe the information. It is not clear if the request has been allowed. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is of Pakistani origin but was born in Kuwait, was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and transferred to Guantanamo, in Cuba, in 2006. CIA documents confirm that he was subjected to waterboarding - simulated drowning - 183 times. Ms Haspel, who is President Donald Trump's choice to replace now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is facing a tough hearing in the Senate where the narrow Republican majority makes her confirmation uncertain. Many Democrats have spoken out against her nomination. She is a career intelligence officer with more than 30 years of experience but controversially ran a prison in Thailand where suspected al-Qaeda members were subjected to waterboarding in 2002. Correspondents say she was known for her harsh views. The so-called ""black sites"", where the CIA carried out ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques, were closed by former US President Barack Obama. However, President Trump has since spoken out in favour of the harsh interrogation of suspects.

"This video can not be played Analysis: What's next for the Iran deal? Barbara Plett Usher explains Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has addressed US President Donald Trump directly, telling him he ""made a mistake"" in deciding to leave a multi-country nuclear deal. Mr Khamenei said: ""I said from the first day: don't trust America."" He urged his government to get guarantees from European powers before agreeing to continue with the deal. The 2015 agreement curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of UN, US and EU sanctions. It was signed by Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. But Mr Trump, long opposed to the deal, said on Tuesday that it was ""defective at its core"" and the US would withdraw, reimposing economic sanctions. Iran faces up to its options Who are the winners and losers? Other signatories to the accord say they are still committed to it and want it to continue. French President Emmanuel Macron has also called the US decision ""a mistake"". The UK's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Britain had ""no intention of walking away"", and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would ""do everything in our power for Iran to adhere to its obligations in the future"". This video can not be played Trump: Severe consequences if Iran restarts nuclear programme Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who is regarded as a moderate reformist and under whom the 2015 deal was signed, has indicated he will try to salvage it. He said his country was preparing to restart uranium enrichment in case the deal collapsed, but also said: ""If we achieve the deal's goals in co-operation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place."" This video can not be played There was fury in Iran's parliament following the announcement But Mr Khamenei, the highest power in the land, was sceptical, saying in a televised speech that he did not trust Britain, France or Germany, and would need ""guarantees"" before continuing the nuclear deal. Addressing the government, he said: ""We hear that you want to continue the nuclear deal with the three European countries. I don't have confidence in these three countries."" ""If you want to conclude an agreement, obtain real guarantees, otherwise tomorrow they will do the same as the United States."" ""Their words have no value,"" he said of foreign leaders. ""Today they say one thing and tomorrow another. They have no shame."" Is there a Plan B? Why Trump ditched the deal Meanwhile, Mr Trump warned Iran of unspecified ""severe consequences"" if it restarted its nuclear programme. Addressing reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said he hoped Iran would be willing to negotiate a new deal, adding: ""I would advise Iran not start their nuclear programme. I would advise them very strongly. If they do there will be very severe consequence."" By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian service The Iranians seem divided on social media. The tag #thankyoutrump has been used by those who are supportive of the US president's decision to leave the nuclear deal with Iran. Those who are happy are from different groups. They include the hardline anti-American opponents of President Rouhani, plus the people that are against the regime who say the deal hasn't benefited them. And then there are those in the middle, those who do want change but are not sure that sanctions will accelerate that. They sound disappointed. They accuse the US of being deceptive and dishonest. They say the sanctions will target the people not the politicians. Mr Macron said France - ""along with our partners"" - was looking to prevent tensions escalating in the region. ""I regret the decision of the American president. I think it's a mistake and that's why we Europeans have decided to remain in the nuclear agreement,"" he told German broadcaster ARD. In earlier comments, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ""The deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there"". He said there would be a meeting between France, Britain, Germany and Iran on Monday. Johnson: UK won't walk away from Iran deal Russia said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Mr Trump's decision, while China and Germany expressed regret. But the move has been welcomed by Iran's major regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Saudi Arabia signalled on Wednesday that it would look to acquire its own nuclear weapons if Iran does. ""We have made it very clear that if Iran acquires a nuclear capability, we'll do everything we can to do the same,"" foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a prominent critic of the accord, said he ""fully supports"" Mr Trump's withdrawal from a ""disastrous"" deal. This video can not be played People in the Iran-aligned suburbs of Beirut give their reaction to US withdrawal from the nuclear deal In his address on Tuesday, Mr Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". Mr Trump alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's ""destabilising activities"" in the region enough, and could not detect or prevent any breaking of the terms of the deal. What is the nuclear accord? Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who on Wednesday again said Iran was honouring its commitments. These include: limiting the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons limiting the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium modifying a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb But Mr Trump said: ""It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will."" He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East. He also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.

Some exemptions are due to be negotiated but it is not yet clear what they will be. Pain for some of Europe's biggest companies Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Iran's currency, the rial, fell in the run-up to Mr Trump's announcement and afterwards, heralding economic pain for the country. While Iran was under sanctions between 2012 and 2016, its oil production fell. On Tuesday, oil prices rose worldwide to a three-and-a-half-year high, in anticipation of reduced supply. Saudi Arabia said it would step in to prevent shortages.

"Asda has suspended a controversial Â£99 petrol pump deposit trial after an outcry from customers. Those using pay-at-the-pump facilities at certain petrol stations were debited Â£99 on top of their fuel purchase. Asda said the deposit was a holding charge to ensure customers had enough money to pay for their fuel. But following the backlash, Asda said it would ""suspend"" the scheme pending review because ""we always want to do the right thing for our customers"". One customer,Jade Louise, took to Facebook when she saw a Â£99 debit on her online bank after topping up at the weekend. But the money never left her account, according to the supermarket and banks. The trial was introduced at three petrol stations to assess if it would help cut down fraud and stop people inadvertently going into the red. The deposit is intended to be cancelled as soon as the correct value is paid. However, Asda said the scheme requires coordination between MasterCard and Visa and customers' banks. Some banks are not able to comply, the supermarket said. In a statement, Asda said: ""The intention of Visa and MasterCard in this trial was to ensure customers had sufficient funds in their account to pay for their fuel, and the Â£99 would be immediately released back to customers by their bank. ""Whilst we have received very few complaints about this process, until we can be given assurance that all banks are able to comply with the Visa and MasterCard rule change, we cannot continue to implement this change and risk harming our customers' trust in us."" Mastercard told the BBC that a change in industry rules last year meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel. Jade Louise says she won't be using pay-at-the-pump for a while. Previously, motorists had just Â£1 taken from their accounts as a pre-authorisation to confirm that their card was valid. Ms Louise got a shock when she viewed her online statement after buying Â£5 worth of petrol at Asda in Dewsbury over the Bank Holiday weekend. She used the pay-at-the-pump system which allows motorists to buy petrol without having to go into a kiosk. ""All I wanted to do was top up my almost full tank, because having two children, you never know when you'll need it,"" she told the BBC. So when she saw the Â£99 pending transaction on her account, she took to Facebook to warn others of the charge. ""They should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this .... absolute joke!!!"", she wrote. She said she is happy Asda has stopped the trials ""because they haven't thought carefully enough about what could go wrong and how it could negatively impact their customers"". ""I won't be using pay at the pump fuel stations for the foreseeable future."" One solution, she says, is: ""Bring back manned stations and give people work."" What would you spend Â£10,000 on?

"A woman who believed she had been charged Â£99 for Â£5 worth of petrol at Asda says the supermarket's new payment system is an ""absolute joke"". Jade Louise took to Facebook when she saw a Â£99 debit on her online bank after topping up at the weekend. But the money never left her account, according to the supermarket and banks. The Â£99 is in effect a holding charge introduced to help cut down fraud and stop people inadvertently going into the red. The pre-authorised amount is cancelled as soon as the correct value is paid. A Mastercard spokesperson told the BBC: ""Last year, a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn't fill up with more fuel than they could afford."" Under the previous system, motorists had just Â£1 taken from their accounts as a pre-authorisation to confirm that their card was valid. The new system is designed to protect consumers and the petrol station, according to Mastercard. ""If customers don't have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed,"" the spokesperson explained. In short, that means that if you only have Â£40 available in your account, you will only be able to buy Â£40-worth of petrol, under the new system. Asked about the Â£99, Mastercard said: ""While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn."" In other words, the money never leaves a consumer's account - only the actual amount they spend is taken. Jade Louise got a shock when she viewed her online statement after buying a fiver's worth of petrol at Asda in Dewsbury over the Bank Holiday weekend. She used the pay-at-the-pump system which allows motorists to buy petrol without having to go into a kiosk. ""All I wanted to do was top up my almost full tank, because having two children, you never know when you'll need it,"" she told the BBC. ""Anything could happen over the next few weeks that might mean I can't afford to put fuel in, so as a precaution to make sure I can get me and my children from A to B, I sometimes top up silly amounts like Â£5 to keep it at full."" So when she saw the Â£99 pending transaction (pictured above) on her account, she took to Facebook to warn others of the charge. ""They should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this .... absolute joke!!!"", she wrote. She said: ""I've been told the money doesn't actually leave your account, it's just ring-fenced until Asda claim the second transaction of the actual amount of fuel you took. Regardless, for three days I was unable to access my money."" Asda said: ""We take any customer complaint seriously, but it's important to clarify that at no point has Asda taken or held Jade Louise's money as a result of this transaction. ""Visa and MasterCard have increased the minimum pre-authorisation amount at pay at the pump petrol pumps for all retailers and unfortunately, there seems to have been a delay in Jade Louise's bank releasing the hold."" The supermarket said it was unaware of anyone else having any problems using the system. Even though the new higher pre-authorisation level was set last year, it is only now being introduced. Asda is trialling it at three sites over the next two months at petrol stations in Dewsbury, Barry and Widnes. It is likely to be introduced more widely and at rival supermarkets when their petrol stations are upgraded.

"Drinks from three of the UK's largest cinema chains have been found to contain unacceptably high levels of bacteria, a BBC investigation has found. Fizzy drinks from Cineworld, Odeon and Vue were tested in 30 cinemas, for BBC One's Watchdog programme. Seven branches sold drinks with unacceptable bacteria levels. Environmental health expert Tony Lewis said he was ""concerned"" it was ""an indicator of hygiene failure"". Traces of the bacteriasalmonella,external, which can cause food poisoning, were reportedly discovered in two drinks from branches of Odeon cinemas. Listeria had also been found, in a drinks holder, Watchdog said. The investigation tested drinks at 10 branches of each company. It also looked for bacteria on the seat fabric, on the cup holder and in ice cubes. The results were sent to London Metropolitan University's ""superlab"" to be tested. According to Watchdog, out of the seven cinemas with drinks with high bacteria levels: Four belonged to Cineworld, where one drink had 70 times the level considered acceptable Vue had one of the high bacteria drinks, and this was 100 times the acceptable level Odeon had two high bacteria drinks and one had 10,000 times the acceptable level Mr Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: ""That's the highest I've seen. And that is an indicator of equipment not being kept clean. That's a worry."" Salmonella bacteria can cause vomiting, stomach cramps and fever He said high bacteria levels in fizzy drinks were particularly concerning because they were ingested immediately. Ice containing bacteria levels above an acceptable level - more than 1,000 units of bacteria per one millilitre of liquid - were found in nine cinemas, Watchdog said. Four of those ice samples were from Cineworld branches, two were from Vue, and three from Odeon. The highest bacteria count in ice was 10 million bacteria in one millilitre of liquid, and was found in the same Odeon branch as the highest bacteria-filled drink. Mr Lewis said: ""Ultimately, it's about people cutting corners And it's also about managers, owners of cinemas, managers of cinemas, not taking their responsibilities seriously and potentially keeping on top of the issues."" Watchdog reported mixed results on bacteria on the seats and in drinks holders. Since those bacteria are unlikely to reach your mouth, they are thought to be less of a concern. The cinema chains have all told the programme they take hygiene ""incredibly seriously"" and have robust cleaning procedures in place. Odeon and Cineworld said seats, drinks holders and drink dispensers were thoroughly cleaned daily, with the ice machines emptied and fully cleaned weekly. Odeon said it was therefore ""surprised and disappointed at the Watchdog findings"" and had immediately launched its own investigation, adding  it had ""taken immediate steps"" and ""further strengthened procedures"" across the UK. Cineworld said the branches tested ""have all been awarded the maximum food hygiene rating of five by their local authority"" and its cleaning procedures were compulsory for all branches. Vue rejected the findings, saying it ""follows strict hygiene procedures daily"". It also said it undertook its own independent tests regularly, ""conducted by a qualified clinical microbiologist with nationally recognised accredited training"", and worked with ""third-party water experts, exceeding the requirements for water testing"".

"This video can not be played Analysis: What's next for the Iran deal? Barbara Plett Usher explains Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has addressed US President Donald Trump directly, telling him he ""made a mistake"" in deciding to leave a multi-country nuclear deal. Mr Khamenei said: ""I said from the first day: don't trust America."" He urged his government to get guarantees from European powers before agreeing to continue with the deal. The 2015 agreement curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of UN, US and EU sanctions. It was signed by Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. But Mr Trump, long opposed to the deal, said on Tuesday that it was ""defective at its core"" and the US would withdraw, reimposing economic sanctions. Iran faces up to its options Who are the winners and losers? Other signatories to the accord say they are still committed to it and want it to continue. French President Emmanuel Macron has also called the US decision ""a mistake"". The UK's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Britain had ""no intention of walking away"", and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would ""do everything in our power for Iran to adhere to its obligations in the future"". This video can not be played Trump: Severe consequences if Iran restarts nuclear programme Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who is regarded as a moderate reformist and under whom the 2015 deal was signed, has indicated he will try to salvage it. He said his country was preparing to restart uranium enrichment in case the deal collapsed, but also said: ""If we achieve the deal's goals in co-operation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place."" This video can not be played There was fury in Iran's parliament following the announcement But Mr Khamenei, the highest power in the land, was sceptical, saying in a televised speech that he did not trust Britain, France or Germany, and would need ""guarantees"" before continuing the nuclear deal. Addressing the government, he said: ""We hear that you want to continue the nuclear deal with the three European countries. I don't have confidence in these three countries."" ""If you want to conclude an agreement, obtain real guarantees, otherwise tomorrow they will do the same as the United States."" ""Their words have no value,"" he said of foreign leaders. ""Today they say one thing and tomorrow another. They have no shame."" Is there a Plan B? Why Trump ditched the deal Meanwhile, Mr Trump warned Iran of unspecified ""severe consequences"" if it restarted its nuclear programme. Addressing reporters at the White House on Wednesday, he said he hoped Iran would be willing to negotiate a new deal, adding: ""I would advise Iran not start their nuclear programme. I would advise them very strongly. If they do there will be very severe consequence."" By Rana Rahimpour, BBC Persian service The Iranians seem divided on social media. The tag #thankyoutrump has been used by those who are supportive of the US president's decision to leave the nuclear deal with Iran. Those who are happy are from different groups. They include the hardline anti-American opponents of President Rouhani, plus the people that are against the regime who say the deal hasn't benefited them. And then there are those in the middle, those who do want change but are not sure that sanctions will accelerate that. They sound disappointed. They accuse the US of being deceptive and dishonest. They say the sanctions will target the people not the politicians. Mr Macron said France - ""along with our partners"" - was looking to prevent tensions escalating in the region. ""I regret the decision of the American president. I think it's a mistake and that's why we Europeans have decided to remain in the nuclear agreement,"" he told German broadcaster ARD. In earlier comments, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ""The deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there"". He said there would be a meeting between France, Britain, Germany and Iran on Monday. Johnson: UK won't walk away from Iran deal Russia said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Mr Trump's decision, while China and Germany expressed regret. But the move has been welcomed by Iran's major regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Saudi Arabia signalled on Wednesday that it would look to acquire its own nuclear weapons if Iran does. ""We have made it very clear that if Iran acquires a nuclear capability, we'll do everything we can to do the same,"" foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a prominent critic of the accord, said he ""fully supports"" Mr Trump's withdrawal from a ""disastrous"" deal. This video can not be played People in the Iran-aligned suburbs of Beirut give their reaction to US withdrawal from the nuclear deal In his address on Tuesday, Mr Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". Mr Trump alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's ""destabilising activities"" in the region enough, and could not detect or prevent any breaking of the terms of the deal. What is the nuclear accord? Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who on Wednesday again said Iran was honouring its commitments. These include: limiting the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons limiting the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium modifying a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb But Mr Trump said: ""It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will."" He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East. He also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.

Some exemptions are due to be negotiated but it is not yet clear what they will be. Pain for some of Europe's biggest companies Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Iran's currency, the rial, fell in the run-up to Mr Trump's announcement and afterwards, heralding economic pain for the country. While Iran was under sanctions between 2012 and 2016, its oil production fell. On Tuesday, oil prices rose worldwide to a three-and-a-half-year high, in anticipation of reduced supply. Saudi Arabia said it would step in to prevent shortages.

"Drinks from three of the UK's largest cinema chains have been found to contain unacceptably high levels of bacteria, a BBC investigation has found. Fizzy drinks from Cineworld, Odeon and Vue were tested in 30 cinemas, for BBC One's Watchdog programme. Seven branches sold drinks with unacceptable bacteria levels. Environmental health expert Tony Lewis said he was ""concerned"" it was ""an indicator of hygiene failure"". Traces of the bacteriasalmonella,external, which can cause food poisoning, were reportedly discovered in two drinks from branches of Odeon cinemas. Listeria had also been found, in a drinks holder, Watchdog said. The investigation tested drinks at 10 branches of each company. It also looked for bacteria on the seat fabric, on the cup holder and in ice cubes. The results were sent to London Metropolitan University's ""superlab"" to be tested. According to Watchdog, out of the seven cinemas with drinks with high bacteria levels: Four belonged to Cineworld, where one drink had 70 times the level considered acceptable Vue had one of the high bacteria drinks, and this was 100 times the acceptable level Odeon had two high bacteria drinks and one had 10,000 times the acceptable level Mr Lewis, head of policy at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: ""That's the highest I've seen. And that is an indicator of equipment not being kept clean. That's a worry."" Salmonella bacteria can cause vomiting, stomach cramps and fever He said high bacteria levels in fizzy drinks were particularly concerning because they were ingested immediately. Ice containing bacteria levels above an acceptable level - more than 1,000 units of bacteria per one millilitre of liquid - were found in nine cinemas, Watchdog said. Four of those ice samples were from Cineworld branches, two were from Vue, and three from Odeon. The highest bacteria count in ice was 10 million bacteria in one millilitre of liquid, and was found in the same Odeon branch as the highest bacteria-filled drink. Mr Lewis said: ""Ultimately, it's about people cutting corners And it's also about managers, owners of cinemas, managers of cinemas, not taking their responsibilities seriously and potentially keeping on top of the issues."" Watchdog reported mixed results on bacteria on the seats and in drinks holders. Since those bacteria are unlikely to reach your mouth, they are thought to be less of a concern. The cinema chains have all told the programme they take hygiene ""incredibly seriously"" and have robust cleaning procedures in place. Odeon and Cineworld said seats, drinks holders and drink dispensers were thoroughly cleaned daily, with the ice machines emptied and fully cleaned weekly. Odeon said it was therefore ""surprised and disappointed at the Watchdog findings"" and had immediately launched its own investigation, adding  it had ""taken immediate steps"" and ""further strengthened procedures"" across the UK. Cineworld said the branches tested ""have all been awarded the maximum food hygiene rating of five by their local authority"" and its cleaning procedures were compulsory for all branches. Vue rejected the findings, saying it ""follows strict hygiene procedures daily"". It also said it undertook its own independent tests regularly, ""conducted by a qualified clinical microbiologist with nationally recognised accredited training"", and worked with ""third-party water experts, exceeding the requirements for water testing"".

"The growing use of streamed TV services has encouraged users to seek out faster speeds There has been a marked improvement in home broadband, according to an annual survey by the UK's communications watchdog Ofcom. It said that average fixed-line download speeds rose by 28% over the year to 46.2 megabits per second, while uploads gained by 44% to 6.2 Mbps. It added that the typical household now consumed 190 gigabytes of data a month, in large part due to the use of Netflix and other streamed TV services. But rural consumers still lag behind. Ofcom said: in urban areas, 59% of connections delivered average speeds topping 30 Mbps over the 20:00-22:00 peak-time period - meeting the watchdog's definition of ""superfast"" - while 17% were under 10 Mbps. but in rural areas, only 23% of connections surpassed 30 Mbps over the same hours, while 53% were under 10 Mbps. The regulator said the primary reasons for the discrepancy were less availability and reduced take-up of cable and fibre services in the countryside. Later this month, internet service providers will be obliged to quote average peak-time speeds in their adverts and other promotional materials, rather than the ""up to"" figures that have been more common. TalkTalk broadband 'worst for customer service' 'More than half' of UK homes face broadband woes Ads for broadband face new rules The report's numbers were generated by installing speed-testing boxes at about 4,700 volunteers' properties in November. Ofcom has also broken down its results by nation, revealing that England had the fastest speeds while Wales had the slowest: The watchdog highlighted that many households could improve their speeds at no extra cost by asking to be switched to fibre where it was available. It noted that 93% of UK properties now had access to superfast services but said that about 40% still subscribed to a copper-based ""standard"" ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) package. The report also highlighted that Virgin Media - the UK's biggest cable provider - had made improvements, particularly over the peak evening period. Ofcom ascribed this to an investment in additional network capacity,although the Thinkbroadband,externalnews sitenoted that a critical BBC Watchdog investigationwas likely to have spurred matters on. Virgin's ""up to 200 Mbps"" package was singled out for delivering the fastest measured download speeds, averaging 193.6 Mbps over a 24-hour period. But Ofcom noted that the firm had launched an even faster 300 Mbps deal in 2017. However, too few of its volunteers had subscribed to generate a report.

"Cancer patients are being put at risk by immigration rules, say specialist doctors. NHS hospital trusts are struggling to recruit genetic counsellors, who identify people at risk of hereditary cancer and other serious conditions. Some hospitals rely on foreign workers, who now find it difficult to get visas asimmigration rules have tightened,external. The Home Office said priority was given to people working in occupations with shortages. Health bosses criticise visa rules for doctors NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff How knowing your genetic code could lengthen your life Home Office visa delays 'inhumane' Steph Burcher, a genetic counsellor from New Zealand, has been working at an NHS trust in London for the past two years. Having arrived on a young person's working visa which was about to run out, she applied for a sponsored work visa in order to stay. Last month, she was refused the document and has now moved back to New Zealand, with the option to reapply each month. She said: ""It was really disappointing to get confirmation. I really enjoy my job and would like to continue doing it but unfortunately I can't without a visa. ""I'm aware of a lot of NHS workers who are struggling to get their visas at the moment. There's a lot of uncertainty. ""It's really difficult for my employers. At the moment they've said they will hold the job open for me but I can't expect them to do that indefinitely. ""It has a huge impact on my team members - we're already two members of the team down, so they're already operating at capacity and really struggling with the workload."" Ms Burcher added: ""It's having a huge impact on our patients as well. There are already huge waitlists for them and it's only going to get worse."" Foreign workers who are offered a job in the UK have to apply for atier 2 visa,external. These are granted up to a monthly limit, with priority given to applicants in a ""shortage occupation"" like nursing and those earning high salaries. Cancer specialists are now calling for genetic counselling to be placed on the shortage occupation list, to increase the chances of rota gaps being filled. Dr Katie Snape, a consultant cancer geneticist, told the BBC some patients were now waiting months for outpatient appointments, outside the NHS's 18-week target to be seen. She said: ""There is a nationwide shortage of genetic counsellors at the moment. We have advertised posts and been unable to appoint either UK or EU-trained genetic counsellors into those positions. Genetic analysis can give an early warning of who is at risk of cancer ""The problem has now been compounded because we have highly skilled professionals from other countries that are unable to get work visas, effectively because they don't earn enough money to get the points needed for the visa. Dr Snape said there was no doubt waits were getting longer. ""It varies depending on hospital trust and where you are in the UK. People can wait now six, nine, 12 months, and we know of even longer in some cases. ""It's absolutely devastating when someone gets a diagnosis of an advanced and incurable cancer. We absolutely know that assessing genetic risk can enable us to early-detect and prevent and cure cancers. ""So the fact that we are unable to provide safe genetic cancer services in this country I think is awful."" The impact of these delays could have a profound effect on patients, according to Prof Jayant Vaidya, a leading breast cancer surgeon. He said: ""This is important for cancer, because in a small proportion of breast cancers, women can be identified as being predisposed to developing cancer. ""If they can be given preventative treatment, they have a much better outcome than if they develop the cancer later on, and that's why it's so important to identify such women and give treatment, in which case they can be cured."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""The shortage occupation list is set following advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee and kept under regular review. ""It is important that our immigration system works in the national interest, ensuring that employers look first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas. ""When demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of tier 2 (general) places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupations."" Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Health Service Journal he supported the idea of a dedicated visa category for health and social care workers - which would enable more to come into the UK. He said: ""I think it is a really interesting idea. And it's something I should probably raise with the new home secretary.""

"This video can not be played ""It was a nightmare, it wasnât safe enough to drive"" BMW is extending a UK recall of its cars after the BBC's Watchdog found that vehicles could cut out completely while they are being driven. It is recalling 312,000 vehicles: the BMW 1 Series, the 3 Series, the Z4 and its X1 petrol and diesel models made between March 2007 and August 2011. BMW initially recalled 36,410 petrol cars last year over safety issues. It said it now recognised there may have been similar problems in cars not covered by the first recall. The German carmaker initially recalled cars in the UK after Narayan Gurung, who was travelling with his wife on Christmas Day in 2016, died when their Ford Fiesta crashed into a tree to avoid a broken-down BMW in Guildford, Surrey. BMW advert 'promoted dangerous driving' The BMW had suffered an electrical fault, causing its brake lights to fail and resulting in the vehicle stalling on a dark A-road. An investigation by Watchdog has found that the fault could affect a wider number of cars. Narayan Gurung was killed on Christmas Day in 2016 when his car swerved to avoid a stalled BMW One BMW owner, Mwape Kambafwile, told the BBC how his BMW 3 Series car had cut out completely while he was driving in December 2016. ""I just thought to myself if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous,"" he said. Mr Kambafwile said he took his car to BMW who called the next day to say that they had found the fault, which looked like ""the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box"". BMW allowed Mr Kambafwile to take the car home without any warning not to use it, he said. He refused to drive the car and was furious to later discover that petrol versions of the same vehicle had been recalled for the same fault. It recently emerged that BMW had failed to tell the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency about the electrical fault in some of its cars that led to the death of Mr Gurung. BMW said it had worked with the DVSA and rejected suggestions it had ignored instructions or provided incorrect information. An inquest revealed that the carmaker had received complaints of an electrical issue that caused a total power failure as early as 2011. BMW recalled 500,000 cars in the US in 2013, as well as in Australia, Canada and South Africa. Commenting on Watchdog's investigation, BMW said: ""We now recognise that there may have been some cases of similar power supply issues in vehicles not covered by the original recall. ""In order to reassure customers with concerns about the safety of their vehicles, we are voluntarily extending the recall. ""We are therefore announcing today that we will take the proactive step of expanding the existing UK recall to cover all vehicles potentially affected by the power supply issue."" BMW said that it will open a customers' complaints line and will contact affected owners directly.

"Britain has ""no intention of walking away"" from the Iran nuclear deal despite the United States pulling out, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says. Mr Johnson told MPs the UK would ""strive to preserve the gains"" made by the international agreement. The 2015 deal curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of UN, US and EU sanctions. US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday he will pull out, describing it as ""defective at its core"". Labour accused the president of a ""reckless, senseless and immoral act of diplomatic sabotage"". But some Conservative MPs - including former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon - backed Mr Trump's stance. Other signatories to the agreement - the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - say they remain committed to it. Iran has said it will try to salvage the agreement, but would restart uranium enrichment if it could not. Simon Jack: Iran sanctions threaten North Sea deal Why did Trump ditch the deal? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Is there a Plan B? Mr Johnson - who had travelled to the United States in a last-minute attempt to persuade the Trump administration not to ditch the deal - told MPs the responsibility was now on the president to set out how he plans to secure a new settlement. ""Britain stands ready to support that task, but in the meantime we will strive to preserve the gains made by the [agreement]"", he added. The foreign secretary said while the UK shared US concerns about Iran, the ""painfully negotiated"" agreement was effective and had increased the amount of time it would take Tehran to develop nuclear weapons. A watchdog has reported nine times that Iran had complied with the terms of the agreement, he added. Mr Johnson also said the government would do its utmost to protect UK commercial interests in Iran from US sanctions. Iran sanctions threaten North Sea deal Sir Michael Fallon - who was UK defence secretary when the deal was signed - said the US president was right in his criticism of the ""rather flimsy agreement"" which he said ""should never have been called comprehensive"". ""Far from constraining Iranian behaviour, it has enabled the Iranian regime to use its new financial freedom to interfere in Syria, in Iraq, above all in Yemen and to sponsor Houthi attacks on our friends in Saudi Arabia,"" he said. Mr Johnson said he did ""not recall him making these points"" at the time and disagreed with his views. Another former minister, Robert Halfon, said the UK should support the US instead of ""appeasing"" Iran, and Andrew Percy condemned Iran's ""increasingly malign and dangerous influence"". After speaking to each other on Tuesday evening, Mrs May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron made clear they would not let the agreement - officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) - collapse. In a joint statement, they said they regretted President Trump's decision. ""Our governments remain committed to ensuring the agreement is upheld, and will work with all the remaining parties to the deal to ensure this remains the case including through ensuring the continuing economic benefits to the Iranian people that are linked to the agreement,"" they wrote. ""After engaging with the US Administration in a thorough manner over the past months, we call on the US to do everything possible to preserve the gains for nuclear non-proliferation brought about by the JCPoA, by allowing for a continued enforcement of its main elements."" The UK's Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said the UK would be seeking to ""de-escalate"" the situation, ""no matter how difficult that is in a tricky region"". In his address on Tuesday, President Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. The US Treasury said the sanctions would target industries mentioned in the deal, including Iran's oil sector, aircraft manufacturers exporting to Iran and Iranian government attempts to buy US dollar banknotes. Major European and US companies are likely to be hit. Some exemptions are due to be negotiated but it is not yet clear what. US National Security Adviser John Bolton is reported as saying that European companies doing business in Iran will have to stop doing so within six months or face US sanctions. Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal represents a failure of British and European diplomacy. They were unable to persuade the US president to change his mind. But it also marks the start of the next and perhaps harder task of trying to hold what is left of the agreement together. All three countries have promised to stay in the deal, known by its acronym the JCPoA. All three countries have promised to work with the remaining signatories to uphold the agreement. The key question will be how far the UK and other European countries are ready and able to go to protect their banks and firms from US sanctions if they do business with Iran. A failure of British and European diplomacy The shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Washington's decision risked plunging the Middle East into ""deeper destruction, chaos and conflict"". ""If the nuclear deal is torn up, we not only destroy that platform for future progress, we risk triggering a rapid nuclear arms race in the Middle East, we risk the hardline theocrats seizing all the reins of power in Tehran, and we risk the descent into an unimaginable conflict with Iran,"" she said. Ms Thornberry told the BBC she would have taken a ""different approach"" towards Mr Trump, describing the US president as a ""bully"" that she would ""stand up to"". ""Boris Johnson was complacent, and what he did was too little too late,"" she said, warning of the US ""trampling on our business"" with sanctions on UK firms that trade in Iran. The SNP's Stephen Gethins said President Trump's ""deeply reckless"" move had undermined the importance of the democratic process. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the government had ""discovered the limits of sycophancy"" in dealing with the US president, calling for safeguards for industry affected by US sanctions.

"This video can not be played Haspel: 'I would never take CIA back to interrogation programme' The self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks has asked for permission to share information about Gina Haspel, nominee for CIA director, at her confirmation hearing. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is held at Guantanamo Bay,has asked a judge if he can share six paragraphs of information, the New York Times says,external. Mr Mohammed was tortured by the CIA following his capture in 2003. Ms Haspel is facing a grilling from senators at the hearing. Her nomination has faced opposition over her role at a secret CIA prison in Thailandwhere detainees were waterboarded in 2002. Ms Haspel told the Senate intelligence committee that under her leadership the agency would not restart a secret detention and interrogation programme under which suspects were tortured. She told committee members that, in retrospect, ""it is clear... that CIA was not prepared to conduct a detention and interrogation programme"". ""Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership the CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation programme,"" she added. Gina Haspel, the CIA pick Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: Al-Qaeda 'kingpin' Ms Haspel declined to confirm whether she had overseen waterboarding sessions. She told the committee she supported the CIA's decision to destroy videotapes of the interrogations, saying it was to protect the identities of agents. Senator Kamala Harris asked Ms Haspel if she agreed witha statement made by President Trump that torture worksas an interrogation method. She replied: ""Senator, I don't believe that torture works."" The hearing was briefly interrupted by a protester who was escorted out by police. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, pictured here in a 2012 courtroom sketch, is accused with others of executing the attacks of 11 September 2001 The request by Mr Mohammed to supply information to the intelligence committee was submitted to army judge Col James Pohl, according to one of Mr Mohammed's lawyers, Lt Col Derek Poteet. The request includes an attachment called ""Additional Facts, Law and Argument in Support"", which includes the six paragraphs, the New York Times reported. Col Poteet said he was not able to describe the information. It is not clear if the request has been allowed. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is of Pakistani origin but was born in Kuwait, was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and transferred to Guantanamo, in Cuba, in 2006. CIA documents confirm that he was subjected to waterboarding - simulated drowning - 183 times. Ms Haspel, who is President Donald Trump's choice to replace now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is facing a tough hearing in the Senate where the narrow Republican majority makes her confirmation uncertain. Many Democrats have spoken out against her nomination. She is a career intelligence officer with more than 30 years of experience but controversially ran a prison in Thailand where suspected al-Qaeda members were subjected to waterboarding in 2002. Correspondents say she was known for her harsh views. The so-called ""black sites"", where the CIA carried out ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques, were closed by former US President Barack Obama. However, President Trump has since spoken out in favour of the harsh interrogation of suspects.

"Cancer patients are being put at risk by immigration rules, say specialist doctors. NHS hospital trusts are struggling to recruit genetic counsellors, who identify people at risk of hereditary cancer and other serious conditions. Some hospitals rely on foreign workers, who now find it difficult to get visas asimmigration rules have tightened,external. The Home Office said priority was given to people working in occupations with shortages. Health bosses criticise visa rules for doctors NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff How knowing your genetic code could lengthen your life Home Office visa delays 'inhumane' Steph Burcher, a genetic counsellor from New Zealand, has been working at an NHS trust in London for the past two years. Having arrived on a young person's working visa which was about to run out, she applied for a sponsored work visa in order to stay. Last month, she was refused the document and has now moved back to New Zealand, with the option to reapply each month. She said: ""It was really disappointing to get confirmation. I really enjoy my job and would like to continue doing it but unfortunately I can't without a visa. ""I'm aware of a lot of NHS workers who are struggling to get their visas at the moment. There's a lot of uncertainty. ""It's really difficult for my employers. At the moment they've said they will hold the job open for me but I can't expect them to do that indefinitely. ""It has a huge impact on my team members - we're already two members of the team down, so they're already operating at capacity and really struggling with the workload."" Ms Burcher added: ""It's having a huge impact on our patients as well. There are already huge waitlists for them and it's only going to get worse."" Foreign workers who are offered a job in the UK have to apply for atier 2 visa,external. These are granted up to a monthly limit, with priority given to applicants in a ""shortage occupation"" like nursing and those earning high salaries. Cancer specialists are now calling for genetic counselling to be placed on the shortage occupation list, to increase the chances of rota gaps being filled. Dr Katie Snape, a consultant cancer geneticist, told the BBC some patients were now waiting months for outpatient appointments, outside the NHS's 18-week target to be seen. She said: ""There is a nationwide shortage of genetic counsellors at the moment. We have advertised posts and been unable to appoint either UK or EU-trained genetic counsellors into those positions. Genetic analysis can give an early warning of who is at risk of cancer ""The problem has now been compounded because we have highly skilled professionals from other countries that are unable to get work visas, effectively because they don't earn enough money to get the points needed for the visa. Dr Snape said there was no doubt waits were getting longer. ""It varies depending on hospital trust and where you are in the UK. People can wait now six, nine, 12 months, and we know of even longer in some cases. ""It's absolutely devastating when someone gets a diagnosis of an advanced and incurable cancer. We absolutely know that assessing genetic risk can enable us to early-detect and prevent and cure cancers. ""So the fact that we are unable to provide safe genetic cancer services in this country I think is awful."" The impact of these delays could have a profound effect on patients, according to Prof Jayant Vaidya, a leading breast cancer surgeon. He said: ""This is important for cancer, because in a small proportion of breast cancers, women can be identified as being predisposed to developing cancer. ""If they can be given preventative treatment, they have a much better outcome than if they develop the cancer later on, and that's why it's so important to identify such women and give treatment, in which case they can be cured."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""The shortage occupation list is set following advice from the independent Migration Advisory Committee and kept under regular review. ""It is important that our immigration system works in the national interest, ensuring that employers look first to the UK resident labour market before recruiting from overseas. ""When demand exceeds the monthly available allocation of tier 2 (general) places, priority is given to applicants filling a shortage or PhD-level occupations."" Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Health Service Journal he supported the idea of a dedicated visa category for health and social care workers - which would enable more to come into the UK. He said: ""I think it is a really interesting idea. And it's something I should probably raise with the new home secretary.""

"Helicopter shots of a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home in 2014 were used sparingly and nothing private was broadcast, lawyers for the BBC have told the High Court. Sir Cliff is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. Gavin Millar QC, for the BBC, said shots were focused on what the police were doing, not the singer's home. Mr Justice Mann reserved his judgement and will hand it down ""in due course"". Footage of a search of the singer's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire, was broadcast in August 2014 as part of a report on South Yorkshire Police's sexual assault inquiry into the singer. Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The 77-year-old singer says broadcasting the images of the search of his home was a ""very serious invasion"" of privacy, but the BBC says the story was in the public interest. In his final submissions, Mr Millar said shots had been taken from the air to illustrate the story. ""Officers were shown walking in and out,"" Mr Millar told Mr Justice Mann. ""It was not directed at (Sir Cliff's) home but directed at what the police officers were doing. ""They didn't show anything private in the sense of his private life."" He said the singer must accept ""some reduction in his private life"" as the singer had ""used that status to give his opinions on moral and religious issues in interviews"". South Yorkshire Police conducted the search of Sir Cliff's flat while investigating an allegation the singer sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985.

"This video can not be played A fired-up Ed Miliband called for a promised press inquiry to be carried out Ministers have seen off a bid to force them to implement a second stage of the Leveson inquiry into press standards. Despite an impassioned speech by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the government won by 304 votes to 295. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, who promised a ""press standards"" review in Northern Ireland before the vote, said it was a ""great day"" for a free press. DUP MP Ian Paisley called it a ""Leveson for Northern Ireland"" and the nine DUP MPs who voted backed the government. Northern Ireland was not covered by the original Leveson inquiry in 2012. Hacked Off, which has been campaigning for statutory regulation of the press since the phone-hacking scandal, insisted the vote ""was not the end"" and the ""fight goes on in Parliament and the courts"". But the News Media Association, which represents local and national newspapers, said the freedom of the press had won the day in the face of ""dangerous anti-media"" proposals. Press standards inquiry axed by ministers Lords vote for second stage Leveson probe Leveson report: At-a-glance Mr Miliband moved the amendment to the Data Protection Bill, which was backed by the SNP, and would have meant a new inquiry into press standards. Five Conservative rebels voted with Labour - Crispin Blunt, Peter Bone, Ken Clarke, Dominic Grieve and Philip Hollobone - and one Labour MP, John Grogan, voted with the government. But the votes of nine DUP MPs were crucial for the government. Mr Miliband told ministers that their decision to axe Leveson had been ""contemptible"" and it was a ""matter of honour about the promises we made"" to the victims of phone hacking, saying the then Prime Minister David Cameron had pledged in 2012 to launch the second part of the inquiry. A second amendment to the Data Protection Bill which would have required publishers not signed up to a state-approved regulator to pay their own and their opponent's legal costs in relation to alleged data breaches was dropped after the SNP withdrew its support. The requirement to pay costs - which was due to have been tabled by Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson - would have stood even if the publisher won. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said it would have made it ""near impossible"" to uncover stories of abuse as he highlighted the work of The Times' chief investigative reporter Andrew Norfolk, who uncovered the Rotherham child abuse scandal. Lord Justice Leveson (pictured above) was appointed in 2011 to carry out an inquiry into press standards, following the phone-hacking scandal In his original terms of reference, it was envisaged the inquiry would be split into two parts A royal charter on press regulation was granted in 2013, incorporating key recommendations from the 2012 Leveson report A small number of publications have joined Impress, the self-regulatory body set up to be ""Leveson-compliant"" Most newspapers have signed up to Ipso, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which has no intention of applying for recognition under the royal charter Mr Hancock says the press has cleaned up its act since the Leveson report was published and it would harm press freedom to re-open it - and it would have had a ""catastrophic"" impact on local newspapers. The government tabled a series of amendments in a bid to avoid Commons defeats, with one allowing the Information Commissioner's Office to give advice on how to seek redress in cases of complaints against the press. Mr Hancock also said Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary would be undertaking a review of how police forces were adhering to new media relations guidance, as recommended by Sir Brian Leveson.

The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport later clarified that this would form part of its proposed UK-wide review of journalists' compliance with the new data protection regulations, to be undertaken by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in four years time. ""Within this ICO review, or aligned to it, we will make sure there is an independent named reviewer for Northern Ireland,"" a spokesman said. The newspaper industry was united in its opposition to a second phase to the inquiry. But Sir Brian Leveson has said he ""fundamentally disagrees"" with claims changes to the media landscape meant it was unnecessary. In a letter to ministers in February, he said the ""full truth"" about the extent of unlawful behaviour at tabloid newspapers had yet to be exposed.

"The UK government has reached a settlement with former Libyan dissident Abdul Hakim Belhaj over a long-running rendition case, the BBC understands. Mr Belhaj claims MI6 helped the US kidnap him in Thailand in 2004 to return him and his wife to Libya, where he says he was tortured. The attorney general will make a statement in Parliament on Thursday. The settlement terms are unknown but Mr Belhaj, 52, has previously demanded an apology and a token Â£1 in damages. A leading opponent of the then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Mr Belhaj says he was abducted in Bangkok - along with his pregnant wife, Fatima Boudchar - while attempting to fly to London to claim UK asylum. Mr Belhaj claims MI6 provided key intelligence in 2004 on his movements which ultimately led to the capture and rendition of him and his wife by the US to Libya. Rendition is the process of sending a suspect for interrogation in another country where torture may be practised. Profile: Abdul Hakim Belhaj Q&A: UK rendition allegations Now a politician in Libya, Mr Belhaj spent six years in prison upon his return to the country and Moroccan-born Ms Boudchar was released shortly before giving birth. Human rights charity Reprieve says Ms Boudchar and her son will be in Parliament for Thursday's statement. Abdul Hakim Belhaj led an Islamic fighting group against the Libyan government Mr Belhaj was born in 1966 in the Souq al-Jumaa area of Tripoli and studied at al-Fateh University, where press reports say he earned a civil engineering degree. He became an opponent of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi and commanded the now defunct Libyan Islamic Fighting Group which staged a low-level insurgency war and three times attempted to assassinate Col Gaddafi. He fled the country in 2001 but was arrested three years later in Thailand and was returned to Libya by, he says, the CIA. He then spent six years in prison where he says he was tortured regularly. Mr Belhaj is now a politician in Libya. Once regarded by Western intelligence services as a terrorism suspect, Mr Belhaj alleges he was tortured by his Libyan jailers and questioned by British intelligence officers during his detention. Former foreign secretary Jack Straw, who was responsible for MI6 at the time, has denied he was aware of the rendition of Mr Belhaj.

"The Galileo system was conceived to give Europe an independent sat-nav capability An executive at Airbus says that work on the Galileo sat-nav system will have to be moved out of the UK if the company wins a key contract. Galileo has become something of a political football in Brexit talks. The EU says it would have to stop the UK from accessing the encrypted part of the network when it leaves next year. Colin Paynter, the company's UK managing director, said that EU rules required Airbus to transfer all work to its factories in France and Germany. Mr Paynter was speaking at a Commons committee hearing on Exiting the European Union on Wednesday. The system was conceived to give Europe its own satellite-navigation capability - independent of US GPS - for use in positioning and timing applications, such as in finance, telecommunications, the utilities, and to support the emergency services and the military. The UK has played a key role in the programme, and Airbus is currently bidding for the renewal of a contract covering the Galileo ground control segment - potentially worth about 200 million euros. This work is currently run out of Portsmouth. About 100 people are currently employed by Airbus on these services. Most would likely have to move to where the work is, but it's possible some could be reallocated to other projects. ""One of the conditions in that bid documentation from the European Space Agency is that all work has to be led by an EU-based company by March '19,"" Mr Paynter told the committee. ""Effectively that means that for Airbus to bid and win that work, we will effectively novate (move) all of the work from the UK to our factories in France and Germany on day one of that contract."" Colin Paynter said the work would be transferred to Airbus factories in France and Germany Asked by Committee chair Hilary Benn MP whether the Brexit transition period could mitigate this condition, Mr Paynter replied: ""No, because this area of Galileo - and many areas of Galileo - is classed as a security-sensitive procurement. I believe that isn't covered in the transitional arrangements."" The UK's access to Galileo's encrypted service, which would be required for military and security uses of the system, would be blocked by the EU after Brexit. This warning prompted the Business Secretary Greg Clark to announce that the government would look into options for developing its own satellite-navigation system. Asked by Labour MP Pat McFadden whether developing a British sat-nav system was feasible, Mr Paynter replied: ""I think the key thing for me is, it's not up to industry to determine whether there's a requirement or need for an independent UK system... I would say that, in terms of feasibility, I think after such a long and deep involvement with the Galileo programme as UK industry, we have all the skills and capabilities needed to support that programme should it come out."" But Dr Bleddyn Bowen, who researches space and defence at the University of Leicester, told the committee: ""Technically, yes, it's feasible - Britaincoulddo it. But it will cost a lot of money and it will run over budget."" He added: ""You need to look at the other GNSSs - global navigation satellite systems - that have been built. The Americans are currently building their third generation of GPS satellites, which have become notorious for cost overruns and delays because they're encountering new technological problems as they improve the system. ""Britain has just built the satellites for the Galileo system. That means Britain has to build anewsatellite-navigation system - not the same one. That will mean new technological developments and innovations as well, which will cause delays."" According to one estimate, the UK has paid about 1.4 billion euros into the 12-14 billion-euro Galileo programme since 2005. Estimates for the cost of an indigenous system in the range of Â£3-5bn were probably right, Mr Paynter said. That was money Dr Bowen told the committee could be better spent elsewhere, filling missing capability gaps in the British space programme.

"Katy Perry has sent Taylor Swift an actual olive branch, seemingly ending the beef between the two megastars. Swifty, who is about to start her Reputation tour, shared a video of the package she received from Katy - which appeared to include a note with the words ""miscommunications"" and ""deeply sorry"" written on it. The olive branch is a symbol of peace. The pair reportedly fell out in a row over backing dancers, before writing songs about each other. Taylor's Bad Blood is thought to be about Katy, while Swish Swish is said to be about Taylor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A woman who believed she had been charged Â£99 for Â£5 worth of petrol at Asda says the supermarket's new payment system is an ""absolute joke"". Jade Louise took to Facebook when she saw a Â£99 debit on her online bank after topping up at the weekend. But the money never left her account, according to the supermarket and banks. The Â£99 is in effect a holding charge introduced to help cut down fraud and stop people inadvertently going into the red. The pre-authorised amount is cancelled as soon as the correct value is paid. A Mastercard spokesperson told the BBC: ""Last year, a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn't fill up with more fuel than they could afford."" Under the previous system, motorists had just Â£1 taken from their accounts as a pre-authorisation to confirm that their card was valid. The new system is designed to protect consumers and the petrol station, according to Mastercard. ""If customers don't have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed,"" the spokesperson explained. In short, that means that if you only have Â£40 available in your account, you will only be able to buy Â£40-worth of petrol, under the new system. Asked about the Â£99, Mastercard said: ""While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn."" In other words, the money never leaves a consumer's account - only the actual amount they spend is taken. Jade Louise got a shock when she viewed her online statement after buying a fiver's worth of petrol at Asda in Dewsbury over the Bank Holiday weekend. She used the pay-at-the-pump system which allows motorists to buy petrol without having to go into a kiosk. ""All I wanted to do was top up my almost full tank, because having two children, you never know when you'll need it,"" she told the BBC. ""Anything could happen over the next few weeks that might mean I can't afford to put fuel in, so as a precaution to make sure I can get me and my children from A to B, I sometimes top up silly amounts like Â£5 to keep it at full."" So when she saw the Â£99 pending transaction (pictured above) on her account, she took to Facebook to warn others of the charge. ""They should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this .... absolute joke!!!"", she wrote. She said: ""I've been told the money doesn't actually leave your account, it's just ring-fenced until Asda claim the second transaction of the actual amount of fuel you took. Regardless, for three days I was unable to access my money."" Asda said: ""We take any customer complaint seriously, but it's important to clarify that at no point has Asda taken or held Jade Louise's money as a result of this transaction. ""Visa and MasterCard have increased the minimum pre-authorisation amount at pay at the pump petrol pumps for all retailers and unfortunately, there seems to have been a delay in Jade Louise's bank releasing the hold."" The supermarket said it was unaware of anyone else having any problems using the system. Even though the new higher pre-authorisation level was set last year, it is only now being introduced. Asda is trialling it at three sites over the next two months at petrol stations in Dewsbury, Barry and Widnes. It is likely to be introduced more widely and at rival supermarkets when their petrol stations are upgraded.

"This video can not be played Haspel: 'I would never take CIA back to interrogation programme' The self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks has asked for permission to share information about Gina Haspel, nominee for CIA director, at her confirmation hearing. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is held at Guantanamo Bay,has asked a judge if he can share six paragraphs of information, the New York Times says,external. Mr Mohammed was tortured by the CIA following his capture in 2003. Ms Haspel is facing a grilling from senators at the hearing. Her nomination has faced opposition over her role at a secret CIA prison in Thailandwhere detainees were waterboarded in 2002. Ms Haspel told the Senate intelligence committee that under her leadership the agency would not restart a secret detention and interrogation programme under which suspects were tortured. She told committee members that, in retrospect, ""it is clear... that CIA was not prepared to conduct a detention and interrogation programme"". ""Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership the CIA will not restart such a detention and interrogation programme,"" she added. Gina Haspel, the CIA pick Khalid Sheikh Mohammed: Al-Qaeda 'kingpin' Ms Haspel declined to confirm whether she had overseen waterboarding sessions. She told the committee she supported the CIA's decision to destroy videotapes of the interrogations, saying it was to protect the identities of agents. Senator Kamala Harris asked Ms Haspel if she agreed witha statement made by President Trump that torture worksas an interrogation method. She replied: ""Senator, I don't believe that torture works."" The hearing was briefly interrupted by a protester who was escorted out by police. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, pictured here in a 2012 courtroom sketch, is accused with others of executing the attacks of 11 September 2001 The request by Mr Mohammed to supply information to the intelligence committee was submitted to army judge Col James Pohl, according to one of Mr Mohammed's lawyers, Lt Col Derek Poteet. The request includes an attachment called ""Additional Facts, Law and Argument in Support"", which includes the six paragraphs, the New York Times reported. Col Poteet said he was not able to describe the information. It is not clear if the request has been allowed. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is of Pakistani origin but was born in Kuwait, was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and transferred to Guantanamo, in Cuba, in 2006. CIA documents confirm that he was subjected to waterboarding - simulated drowning - 183 times. Ms Haspel, who is President Donald Trump's choice to replace now Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is facing a tough hearing in the Senate where the narrow Republican majority makes her confirmation uncertain. Many Democrats have spoken out against her nomination. She is a career intelligence officer with more than 30 years of experience but controversially ran a prison in Thailand where suspected al-Qaeda members were subjected to waterboarding in 2002. Correspondents say she was known for her harsh views. The so-called ""black sites"", where the CIA carried out ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques, were closed by former US President Barack Obama. However, President Trump has since spoken out in favour of the harsh interrogation of suspects.

Claims that Cambridge Analytica used data gathered from millions of Facebook profiles, and that Russia-backed advertising influenced the US presidential election, have led to fears that political campaigning on social media could be a threat to democracy. In Ireland, there have already been complaints from local groups that foreign campaigners with big budgets were trying to sway the vote. Whether or not foreign entities really do have the power to unduly influence election results is unclear. But recent scandals have shown that allowing political advertising on social media to go unchecked risks undermining confidence in the result and can leave the public feeling manipulated.

"A potential new cure for baldness has been discovered using a drug originally intended to treat osteoporosis. Researchers found the drug had a dramatic effect on hair follicles in the lab, stimulating them to grow. It contains a compound which targets a protein that acts as a brake on hair growth and plays a role in baldness. Project leader Dr Nathan Hawkshaw told the BBC a clinical trial would be needed to see if the treatment was effective and safe in people. Only two drugs are currently available to treat balding (androgenetic alopecia): minoxidil, for men and women finasteride, for men only Neither is available on the NHS and both have side-effects and are not always very effective, so patients often resort to hair transplantation surgery instead. I had a transplant after hairstyle made me go bald Too young to go bald Behind the scenes of a hair transplant Early baldness higher heart disease risk factor than obesity, says study Baldness research 'creates a new hair follicle' The research, published inPLOS Biology,external, was done in a lab, with samples containing scalp hair follicles from more than 40 male hair-transplant patients. The researchers, from the University of Manchester, first latched onto an old immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine A, used since the 1980s to prevent transplant organ rejection and reduce symptoms of autoimmune disease. The scientists found that the drug reduced the activity of a protein called SFRP1, a key growth regulator that affects many tissues including hair follicles. But because of its side effects, CsA was unsuitable as a baldness treatment. The team went on to look for another agent that targeted SFRP1 and found that WAY-316606 was even better at suppressing the protein. Dr Hawkshaw said the treatment could ""make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss"". Hair loss is a daily occurrence and generally nothing to worry about. Some types are temporary and some are permanent. You should see a doctor because of: sudden hair loss developing bald patches losing hair in clumps head itching and burning worry about hair loss Source:NHS Choices,external A British Association of Dermatologists spokesman told the BBC: ""This is a very interesting study. ""As the researchers say, hair loss is a common disorder and it can cause considerable damage to emotional health, including loss of self-esteem and confidence. ""That said, more research will need to be done before it can be used by people with hair loss. ""For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss.

"Care homes operator Sunrise Senior Living will pay more than Â£2m in compensation after charging thousands of pounds in compulsory ""upfront fees"". The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) secured the deal for those who had paid the fees since 1 October 2015. People who have left or leave within two years of moving into one of the company's homes are eligible. Sunrise chief executive Dr Natalie-Jane Macdonald said the firm made the move voluntarily. ""We previously charged an up-front community fee, which helped maintain the outstanding facilities and communal areas that our residents expect and enjoy,"" she told the BBC. ""However, we have agreed with the CMA that residents who stayed with us for shorter than average periods were not able to enjoy as much of the benefit of our facilities as residents who are with us for a longer time."" She added: ""The Care Quality Commission has recognised us as one of the best care providers in the UK. We are deeply proud of the care we provide."" What is the cost of care in your area? Reality Check: UK pensioners in the workforce The average individual payout from Sunrise will be about Â£3,000 and if the resident dies in this timescale, their family will receive the money. The move comes as part of the CMA's continuing investigation into how some care homes charge for their services. Last November, the watchdog found that as well as charging the ""upfront fees"", some care homeswere also billing families for weeks after their relatives had died. It also highlighted how those paying for themselves were paying much higher charges than council-funded residents. The average weekly charge for self-funders was Â£846 - 40% more than local authority rates. In the Sunrise case, the CMA was concerned that the care home group's description of its ""upfront fees"" and how the money would be used was unclear. Moreover, prospective residents were having to pay out before they had secured a place at the home. The CMA also raised concerns that the fee was non-refundable once someone had lived in the home for more than 30 days. George Lusty, the CMA's senior director for consumer protection,told BBC Radio 4's Today programmesaid it was a ""really good outcome"", adding: ""We hope that this news will act as a spur to others to make sure they are doing the right thing by residents."" The CMA was looking into other similar cases, he said. Sarah (not her real name) has told the BBC about her battle over fees requested by a Sunrise care home. ""I have just moved two relatives into a Sunrise home. It has been very stressful due to the way the contract is written. ""I was adamant I was not going to pay Â£5,000 per person before they moved in and Sunrise very quickly offered to remove this. Now I see why. ""Negotiations with Sunrise where almost impossible. They were almost entirely inflexible and although they have agreed to a 'fixed fee', the contract says they can change their minds whenever they want with 30 days' notice. ""Respite for two weeks for the two of them is costing just over Â£4,000 - a huge amount of money for people who have worked hard and been careful all their lives. ""Sunrise offer such superior care and environments to other homes, you feel a pressure to try and get them in there. It has been exhausting and emotional for me to organise, to say the very least. ""Once you are emotionally invested, Sunrise will not contractually commit to any of the verbal assurances and you feel vulnerable, once your relatives are in, that they will keep increasing your fee. It's a very stressful process,"" Janet Morrison, chief executive of charity Independent Age, said such fees were unacceptable and welcomed the refunds. ""It is vital that care home providers are completely transparent on what any fees or charges cover, so older people and their families are clear on what they are paying for,"" she said. Alex Hayman of consumer group Which? said it was a significant move by Sunrise: ""Other care home providers should now scrap these excessive charges, and we urge the government to swiftly act on its commitment to strengthen protections for all residents and their families."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at charity Age UK, said: ""It is a travesty that these type of fees were imposed on residents in the first place. We hope this sets a precedent for other providers to ensure they are not charging unnecessarily and that all fees are fair.""

"Summer Grant died when the bouncy castle blew away while she was still inside Two fairground workers have been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after a bouncy castle blew away with a young girl still inside. Summer Grant, seven, died in hospital after she was rescued from the inflatable -  which bounced for 300m - in Harlow, Essex, on 26 March 2016. William Thurston, 29, and his wife Shelby, 26,  failed to ensure the bouncy castle was ""adequately anchored"" to the ground, the court heard. They will be sentenced in June. The three-week trial heard Summer only had ""a few minutes"" left of her turn on the bouncy castle, but Mrs Thurston said she decided to ""let them finish their go"" before taking the inflatable down. Prosecutor Tracy Ayling QC said: ""While Summer was in the bouncy castle, it blew away from its moorings and bounced 300 metres down a hill. Having hit a tree, it came to rest."" She said the Thurstons, of Whitecross Road, Wilburton, Cambridgeshire, did notmonitor weather conditionsto ensure it was safe to use on the day. Shelby and William Thurston have been found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence Mr Thurston said he was aware that Storm Katie was due to arrive two days later, but believed it was ""not hugely significant"". Chelmsford Crown Court had heard the bouncy castle - called Circus Superdome - had lifted ""suddenly"" while Summer was inside. Mr Thurston said he felt  ""a sense of disbelief"" and ""froze for a second"" before giving chase. He told the court how he unzipped an emergency exit on the inflatable, carried Summer out and placed her in the recovery position, describing it as ""the worst thing I'd ever seen"". Summer suffered ""multiple traumatic injuries to the head, neck and chest"" and died later in hospital. Cordons were set up at the fairground at Harlow Town Park after the incident Det Ch Insp Daniel Stoten, from the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate, said the Thurstons had acted ""disgracefully"" putting up a bouncy castle in 36mph winds. ""The Thurstons held a huge responsibility to ensure the safety of the children that used their rides. ""They treated this responsibility with total disregard, putting profit before safety,"" he said. ""Summer Grant was a beautiful little girl with a beaming smile and a caring nature. Her parents Cara and Lee, her sister Lily and her wider family have suffered an unspeakable loss."" David Kerr-Sheppard, the Essex Air Ambulance pilot who attended the scene, told the trialconditions were squallywith ""sudden, sometimes violent bursts of wind that could easily change direction"". He said the weather was not suitable to fly Summer to a London hospital and she was instead taken by road to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow. Jenny Hopkins, of the East of England Crown Prosecution Service, said after the verdicts: ""This should have been a happy, family day out at a funfair. ""It resulted in Summer's death. I hope that these convictions today will be of a small comfort to Summer's family."" The couple were also found guilty of a health and safety offence.  They were convicted by majority verdicts of ten to two after 11 hours of deliberations by the jury. Judge Mr Justice Garnham, who delayed sentencing for four weeks, said he would be ""seriously considering imprisonment"".

"As a result of Owen Scott's actions, one of his daughters will be wheelchair-dependent for the rest of her life A man who tried to kill his three children and step-daughter in a hammer attack before crashing his car at 92mph has had his jail term increased. Owen Scott had been jailed for life for four counts of attempted murder and dangerous driving after the crash near Penistone, South Yorkshire. Scott, 29, of Hampshire, had his minimum term increased by the Court of Appeal from 14 to 24 years. The children were inside the car when he crashed it into a pub last August. Read more stories from across Yorkshire Two girls, aged seven and eight, and two boys, aged 21 months and nine months, were seriously injured with all four youngsters suffering brain damage in the crash. As a result of her injuries, one of his daughters will be wheelchair-dependent for the rest of her life. Challenging the original sentence, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the 14-year term for Scott, from Fawley, had been unduly lenient. The crash happened at the junction of Bower Hill, Coates Lane and the A629 He said a series of aggravating factors, including the gross abuse of trust and the vulnerability of the young victims, meant the case fell outside normal sentencing guidelines. Lord Justice Treacy, sitting with two other judges, said: ""Four young lives have been grievously affected, their mother's life has been blighted and the level of harm which has been done is very high indeed. ""It follows from that analysis that the sentence imposed below was unduly lenient."" Scott had been in a cocaine-induced psychotic episode, when he deliberately crashed into the Travellers Inn, near Penistone, early on 23 August last year. The court heard he had collected the children from his former partner's home in Southampton on the pretext of taking them on a shopping trip. Scott then drove to the Isle of Wight, Liverpool and Greater Manchester before arriving in Huddersfield ahead of the crash, which he claims to have no memory of. The judge said: ""It is clear that some of the children were old enough to understand what the offender was doing whilst those attacks were taking place."" Defence barrister Michelle Colborn further stressed Scott had little recollection of what happened.

"This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out President Donald Trump wasn't always so dead against the Iran deal and it's not a big issue for voters, so why is he pulling out now? It was a move that had been telegraphed for months, despite last-ditch attempts by US allies and domestic backers of the agreement to convince the president to stick with the status quo. In his announcement, the president said that he was open to renewed negotiations, putting trust in his ability as a deal-maker to succeed. ""A constructive deal could have easily been struck at the time,"" Trump said of the 2015 negotiations. ""But it wasn't."" Now the president will have his chance to show he can do better. But why withdraw now? Opinion pollsshow a majority of Americans are in favour of staying,externalin the deal, and, while Mr Trump has said he's simply keeping another promise, this was never an issue that motivated his base the way immigration, trade and the economy did. Here are three reasons why he grew to hate the deal and made this move. Mr Trump has, at times, framed his opposition to the Iran deal on very personal terms. He has repeatedly mocked former Secretary of State John Kerry, one of the architects of the agreement, including cracks about a bicycle accident that left him with a broken leg. According to one report, Mr Kerry's efforts to reach out to Iranians in recent days helped push the president further toward abandoning the deal. The president tweeted about it earlier on Tuesday, so the topic was certainly on his mind. ""John Kerry can't get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it!""Trump wrote,external. ""Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country!"" Iran nuclear deal: Key details Global reaction to pull-out Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has taken aim at practically every one of his predecessor's signature achievements. Within a week of his inauguration he had pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations. In June he announced his intent to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation. He also unwound Obama-era protections for some undocumented immigrants. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? He, and Republicans in Congress, made repealing the Affordable Care Act, which increased government regulation of health insurance markets, a central (albeit largely unsuccessful) focus of his first-year legislative agenda. He's re-imposed sanctions and travel restrictions on Cuba, rescinded proposed controls on power-plant emissions, fuel efficiency standards for new cars and other environmental regulations, and backed repeal of some Obama-era controls on financial institutions. ""With the Paris climate deal dead, the Iran nuclear deal on life support, and Obamacare eviscerated, Obama's only real legacy at this point is the presidency of Donald Trump,""writes,externalSean Davis of the conservative website The Federalist. And that, it seems, is just the way Mr Trump wants it. When Mr Trump first ran for president, he was not nearly as critical of the Iran deal as he is now. While saying he thought it was a mistake and poorly negotiated, he suggested that he may be open to keeping the US commitments. ""It's very hard to say, 'We're ripping it up,'"" then-candidate Trump said duringan NBC interview,externalin August 2015. ""I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance,"" he said. ""As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract."" His shift to a more vehemently anti-deal view tracks closely with Mr Trump's full-throated support of Benjamin Netanyahu and the hard-line Israeli side of Middle East peace negotiations, after earlier suggesting he could be a impartial ""deal-maker"" in the region. ""It doesn't help if I start saying I'm very pro-Israel,"" Mr Trumpsaid,externalin a Republican candidate debate in February 2016, when he was sharply criticised by Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for his professed neutrality in Arab-Israeli negotiations. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal By the following month, Mr Trumptold an audience,externalat the American Israel Public Affairs Committee annual conference that his ""number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran"" - outlining what he saw as the agreement's failure to address the nation's destabilising influence in the region and the development of its ballistic missile programme. He said there was no ""moral equivalency"" between the Israelis and Palestinians in peace negotiations and that ""the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end"" when he becomes president. And since becoming president, Mr Trump has begun the process of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, threatened new sanctions against Palestinians, continued his condemnations of the Iranian government and now abandoned the nuclear arms agreement with that nation - citing, in part, evidence presented by Mr Netanyahu. Reality Check: Has Iran's economy benefited from the nuclear deal? John Bolton is known for his hardline views on Iran Mr Trump had made motions toward, and then backed away from, formally pulling out of the Iran deal several times over the first year of his presidency. He was reportedly counselled against abandoning the agreement by senior advisers in his administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor HR McMaster and Secretary of Defence James Mattis. Mr Mattis is the only man left standing, and his influence appears to be waning. The other two have been replaced by Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively, and both are considered Iran hawks. Where once the president may have been counselled to be cautious in abandoning US commitments to Iran, this time his instincts - an innate distrust of multilateralism in general and Iran in particular - appear to have been enthusiastically supported. After 15 months Mr Trump has built a foreign policy team that is largely on the same page - his page.

"One of the three men who have been reportedly relocated, Kim Dong-chul, was sentenced to 10 years' hard labour after appearing before the media to confess in March 2016 Three Americans detained in North Korea are on their way home after being released in what is likely to be a goodwill gesture ahead of unprecedented talks between the leaders of US and North Korea. US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting."" Their release came after a meeting between Mr Pompeo and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Just asking! Trump floats Korea border idea The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? A White House statement said the three men appeared to be in good health and were able to walk on to their plane unassisted. The only other US prisoner to be released by North Korea under Donald Trump's presidency was university student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the US in a coma and died days later. Two of the newly released detainees were jailed in 2017, after Mr Trump became president. Here is what we know about the three men. Kim Hak-song worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST)and was held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" on 6 May 2017. He was reportedly detained while in Pyongyang Station. The university, which mostly teaches the children of North Korea's elite, was founded in 2010 by a Korean-American Christian entrepreneur, with much of the costs funded by US and South Korea Christian charities. Several foreign lecturers are thought to teach there. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Kim Hak-song had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at PUST, Reuters news agency reported, citing an online post by Mr Kim. He is, reports say, an ethnic Korean born just across the North Korean border in China who emigrated to the US in the 1990s. He is said to have gone on to study agriculture in Yanbian, a Chinese prefecture which borders North Korea, before moving to Pyongyang. Two weeks before Kim Hak-song was arrested, Kim Sang-duk - also known as Tony Kim -was detained on espionage charges. He was trying to leave the country after spending a month working at PUST. South Korean media said he was 55 and had been involved in humanitarian work in the North. ""Some officials at PUST told me his arrest was not related to his work at PUST,"" the chancellor of the university, Chan-Mo Park, told Reuters news agency. Tony Kim was detained on espionage charges ""He had been involved with some other activities outside PUST, such as helping an orphanage."" Mr Kim studied accounting at two American universities and had worked as an accountant in the US for more than a decade, his Facebook page says. He had also taught in Yanbian. A South Korea-born US citizen, Kim Dong-chul is a pastor in his early 60s. He was detained in 2015 on spying chargesand sentenced to 10 years' hard labour in 2016. Before his trial, he was presented at a government-arranged press conference, where he apparently confessed to stealing military secrets in collusion with South Korea - a claim rejected by Seoul. In an interview with CNN in January 2016,external, Mr Kim said he lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He said he used to run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone near the border zone in north-east North Korea. He told CNN he had left a wife and two daughters behind in China, but had had no contact with them since his detention.

"In 2015, Iran agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with a group of world powers known as the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. It came after years of tension over Iran's alleged efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insisted that its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, but the international community did not believe that. Underthe accord,external, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. Here is what was meant to happen according to the plan, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300kg for 15 years Uranium can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched. This is achieved by increasing the content of its most fissile isotopes, U-235, through the use of centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. In July 2015, Iran had two uranium enrichment plants - Natanz and Fordo - and was operating almost 20,000 centrifuges. Under the JCPOA, the country was limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at Natanz until 2026 - 10 years after the deal's ""implementation day"" in January 2016. Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was also reduced by 98% to 300kg (660lbs), a figure that must not be exceeded until 2031. It must also keep the stockpile's level of enrichment at 3.67%. In addition, research and development must take place only at Natanz and be limited until 2024. No enrichment is permitted at Fordo until 2031, and the underground facility must be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. The 1,044 centrifuges left at the site are allowed to produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. Iran is redesigning the Arak reactor so it cannot produce any weapons-grade plutonium Iran had been building a heavy-water nuclear facility near the town of Arak. Spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb. World powers had originally wanted Arak dismantled because of the potential military use. Under an interim nuclear deal in 2013, Iran agreed not to commission or fuel the reactor. Under the JCPOA, Iran said it would redesign the reactor so it could not produce any weapons-grade plutonium, and that all spent fuel would be sent out of the country as long as the modified reactor existed. Iran must also not build additional heavy-water reactors or accumulate any excess heavy water until 2031. Iran is required to allow IAEA inspectors to access any site they deem suspicious At the time of the agreement, then-US President Barack Obama's administration expressed confidence that the JCPOA would prevent Iran from building a nuclear programme in secret. Iran, it said, had committed to ""extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection"". Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the global nuclear watchdog, were tasked with continuously monitoring Iran's declared nuclear sites and verifying that no fissile material is moved covertly to a secret location to build a bomb. Iran also agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to their IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which allows inspectors to access any site anywhere in the country they deem suspicious. Until 2031, Iran will have 24 days to comply with any IAEA access request. If it refuses, an eight-member Joint Commission - including Iran - will rule on the issue. It can decide on punitive steps, including the reimposition of sanctions. A majority vote by the commission suffices. A UN ban on the import of ballistic missile technology will remain in place for up to eight years Before July 2015, Iran had enough enriched uranium and centrifuges to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the then Obama administration. US experts estimated at the time that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""break-out time"". The Obama administration said the JCPOA would remove the key elements Iran would need to create a bomb and increase its break-out time to one year or more. Iran also agreed not to engage in activities, including research and development, which could contribute to the development of a nuclear bomb. In December 2015, the IAEA's board of governors voted to end its decade-long investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear programme. The agency's then-director-general, Yukiya Amano, said the report concluded that until 2003 Iran had conducted ""a co-ordinated effort"" on ""a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"". Iran continued with some activities until 2009, but after that there were ""no credible indications"" of weapons development, he added. Iran also agreed to the continuation of a UN ban on its imports and exports of conventional arms until 2020. Restrictions on its import of ballistic missile technology will remain in place until 2023. The nuclear deal allowed Iran to sell crude oil again on the international market Sanctions previously imposed by the UN, US and EU in an attempt to force Iran to halt uranium enrichment crippled its economy, costing the country more than $160bn (Â£119bn) in oil revenue from 2012 to 2016 alone. Under the deal, all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran were lifted and the country was able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. It also gained access to more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas. However, in May 2018, then-US President Donald Trump abandoned the JCPOA, calling it ""defective at its core"". He reinstated all US sanctions on Iran that November as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to compel the country to negotiate a replacement that would also curb its ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran refused and saw its economy plunge into recession and the value of its currency fall to record lows, which in turn caused inflation to soar to the highest level in decades. When the sanctions were tightened in 2019, Iran began breaching the deal's restrictions, arguing that the JCPOA allowed one party to ""cease performing its commitments... in whole or in part"" in the event of ""significant non-performance"" by others. By November 2021, Iran had amassed a stockpile of enriched uranium that was many times larger than permitted, including at least 17.7kg (39lb) of material enriched to 60% purity - just below the level needed for a bomb. It had also resumed enrichment activity at Fordo; installed more centrifuges, and of a more advanced type, than allowed; and taken steps in the production of enriched uranium metal, which is a key material in nuclear weapons. Iran had also significantly curtailed access for international inspectors by ceasing implementation of the Additional Protocol of its IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Talks to save the JCPOA and bring Iran back into compliance began in May 2021, after Joe Biden succeeded Mr Trump as US president. He says the US will rejoin and lift the sanctions if Iran reverses its breaches. His Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, says the US must make the first move. If the negotiations were to fail and Iran was confirmed to have violated the deal, all UN sanctions would  automatically ""snap back"" in place for 10 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension.

"Parental Bereavement Bill debated in Commons Georgina Pattinson The PM sets up two working parties in a bid to hammer out differences over customs plans. Parental Bereavement Bill clears the Commons House of CommonsParliament A bill to
guarantee bereavement leave and pay for those who lose a child has made it through its stages in the Commons. The Parental Bereavement (Leave and
Pay) Bill, which aims to create a legal entitlement of at least two weeks leave
and pay for parents, cleared its final Commons hurdle with unanimous support. The private member's bill will now undergo further scrutiny in the Lords before it becomes law. It was brought forward by Conservative Kevin Hollinrake in consultation
with his Conservative colleague Will Quince, whose son was stillborn at full
term in October 2014. The draft legislation had been dubbed ""Will's Bill"" in honour of the
campaigning by Mr Quince, but he said it should be referred to as
""Robert's Bill"" in honour of his son. He said: ""When members of the public, who in some cases have a bit of disdain
for politicians, say 'You MPs you do nothing, what do you do for us?', well
today we're doing something for tens of thousands of bereaved parents up and
down this country. ""We know the good this bill will do."" The government offered its support to the bill along with Labour and other
opposition parties. Representation of the People (Young People's Enfranchisement) Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill now being debated aims to reduce the voting age to 16 in parliamentary and other elections and to make
provision about young people's education in citizenship and the constitution. The MP taking the bill through the Commons is Labour MP Peter Kyle. This private member's bill was listed second on Commons business and is unlikely to secure enough time for its second reading debate as MPs
devoted their attention to the parental bereavement bill. Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill passes third reading and will now make its way to the Lords.

Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Karen Lee, who lost her daughter to cancer, explains the
importance of support at work after a bereavement. The Lincoln MP says: ""I know every business is different but it is so
important when you go back, your world has been turned upside down and you can't
just walk back in and pretend everything's the way it was the day that you left,
so that is really vital."" SNP MP Patricia Gibson says parents should have
greater flexibility over when they can take the leave, which would enable them
to grieve but also potentially attend an inquest or court case linked to the
death. The draft law specifies the leave must be within 56 days of the child's death. She says: ""I fear that for the minority of employers who are perhaps
not as sympathetic as they might be, bereaved parents may face losing their jobs
as well as losing their child."" Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament The Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which has government and
opposition support, brings forward proposals to create a legal entitlement for
parental bereavement leave and pay of at least two weeks. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake has brought this bill forward, with his Conservative colleague Will Quince, whose son
was stillborn at full term in October 2014. Tory MP Kevin Foster tells the Commons he ""fully supported"" the ideas behind
the legislation as he debated a series of amendments he proposed at report
stage. He says: ""A reasonable employer will clearly behave in a very different way to
the type of person we're having to aim this legislation at. ""We're bluntly aiming this legislation at the sort of person who adopts the
employment practices of Scrooge and Marley."" The Torbay MP lent his name to 21 amendments to the bill.

MPs are debating the final stages of the Parental Bereavement Bill. This bill makes provision about leave and pay for employees whose children have died. What happened in the Commons today? The government has apologised to Libyan Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who say an MI6 tip-off led to their capture and his torture by Colonel Gaddafi's forces. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the settlement with the couple included a Â£500,000 payment to Ms Boudchar. Mr Belhaj says MI6 helped the US kidnap him in Thailand in 2004 to return him and his wife to Libya. UK actions had contributed to the couple's capture, Mr Wright said. Mr Belhaj had not sought and would not receive financial compensation, Mr Wright added. A leading opponent of the then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Mr Belhaj says he was abducted in Bangkok - along with his wife, then five-months pregnant - while attempting to fly to London to claim asylum in the UK. Now a politician in Libya, Mr Belhaj spent six years in prison upon his return to the country, while Moroccan-born Ms Boudchar was released shortly before giving birth. What happened? House of CommonsParliament An urgent question on how the government is dealing with (or not dealing with) money resolutions for private member's bills saw MPs from both sides claiming thatthe bill in question,externalhas been approved by the House, and must now be given authorisation through a money resolution. The Attorney General announced that the government has paid Â£500,000 in damages to the wife of a Libyan dissident and issued a formal apology after alengthy litigation process. Abdul Hakim Belhaj will receive no compensation himself, as the Attorney General said he has never sought any, just an apology. A sombre mood descended on the Commons for two backbench debates, the first on people affected by financial misconduct, in particular theGlobal Restructuring Group within RBS. The second was on compensation forthe victims of Libyan-sponsored IRA terrorism. The government stated in both cases that more does need to be done: in the case of RBS, it is waiting for the result of a review from the Financial Conduct Authority, and in the case of Libya/IRA terrorism, is unable to do anything further at the moment. The Commons has adjourned for the day, and will return at 9:30am tomorrow. Head of research services at House of Lords library tweets Allow Twitter content?

Libyan-IRA terrorism debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt says that the government is in no doubt Semtex and other materials supplied to the IRA and distributed in Ireland and the UK were supplied by the Libyan regime and ""responsible for IRA-based terror"". On compensation, he says: ""If it was straightforward and simple it would have been sorted. It isn't."" ""The government has the greatest sympathy for the victims and their families,"" he says, many of whom still live with the effects of the attacks. The government attaches ""great importance"" to finding a solution on this. He adds that the government has helped in seeking compensation for the Lockerbie bombing, in these cases, there was no doubt of direct Libyan involvement, he states. ""It is a priority matter for the UK government,"" he says. The advice he has is that there is ""no lawful basis"" under which the UK could use Libyan assets to compensate victims, and says that the UN has deemed that this money should eventually be returned to the country for the benefit of the Libyan people. Using this money for compensation would be a ""violation of international law"", he states. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Theresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened. Brexit this week - as Jeremy Corbyn made repeated attempts to get Theresa May to say what her government's policy is on customs arrangements with the EU when Britain leaves in 10 months time. The Labour leader began - as is rapidly becoming his habit - with a short, punchy question. Did she agree with her Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, that one of the options being considered by the government, a ""customs partnership"", is ""crazy""? Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May listed all the things she wanted from a post-Brexit customs policy - frictionless trade, no hard border in Ireland etc - before launching an attack on Mr Corbyn's past views on the EU, saying he had opposed the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Labour's policy on the customs union, she claimed, would mean signing up to TTIP. Cue a puzzled shake of the head from the Labour leader. Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, standing in for John Bercow, who is attending the funeral of his predecessor, Lord Martin of Springburn, in Glasgow, reminded the PM that it was not her job to set out Labour policies. Mr Corbyn continued to hammer away at Mrs May's unwillingness to say which customs option she prefers, quoting the Remain-supporting business secretary Greg Clark, who had warned on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday that not signing up to a customs partnership would cost jobs. Mrs May trumpeted the government's record on employment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Corbyn quoted Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory Europhile and longest-serving MP, who told the BBC's Newsnight that Mrs May had to control the ""wild right-wing people"" in her cabinet who he said were pushing her towards a hard Brexit. Mr Clarke offered a wry smile from the backbenches. The PM offered another broad restatement of the government's Brexit aims and another attack on Labour, who she accused of going back on their manifesto promise to come out of a customs union. Surely, after 23 months of negotiations the government can do better than this, said Mr Corbyn. Why don't they heed the advice of the CBI and the TUC and accept Labour's policy of a new customs union? When will MPs get to debate the much-delayed trade bill? What is her preferred customs option and when it will be ready to be implemented? This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""These negotiations are in a shambles"" Mrs May said progress had been made in Brussels and she had set out two customs options. ""Questions have been raised about both of those options and further work continues,"" she explained. And that was much as we were going to get. ""He has spent an entire career opposing a customs union, now when the British people want to come out he wants to stay in,"" she told the Labour leader. Mr Corbyn said the Brexit talks were in a ""shambles"" because the government is ""divided"" - how can they get a good deal for the UK when they can't agree among themselves and are more interested in furthering their own careers? Mrs May ended the exchanges with a standard defence of her government's record on jobs - and a swipe at Labour over their failure to take target councils in Thursday's local elections. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""He has spent an entire career opposing a customs union"" What else came up? The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford raised the other major talking point at Westminster - Donald Trump's decision for the US to leave the Iran nuclear deal - and efforts by UK, France and Germany to hold it together.

Here's the BBC's Mark D'Arcy's take on it: A clear win for Jeremy Corbyn. OK, the government's visible divisions over a post-Brexit customs union presented him with an open goal, but you still have to score. He did. The PM had to fall back on formulaic holding answers and boilerplate attacks on Labour, mixed with a bit of local election crowing. And most telling of all were the muted ""hear hears"" she extracted from her troops. Both pro and anti Tory factions on Brexit are uneasy at the moment - and the mainstream MPs, who would back the PM more or less whatever she did, are aching for a clear lead. Jeremy Corbyn's call for the Trade Bill to be brought back before MPs for its long-delayed Report Stage was a well-targeted reminder that the government seems to believe it can't win a vote on the customs union issue with its current policy. Lindsay Hoyle did a good job presiding over a quiet-ish PMQs - and while some on twitter have been contrasting his approach to John Bercow's, he didn't have to deal with any serious outbreak of disorder, or any major bouts of backbench ranting. Only once did he have to shut down a prolix questionerâ¦. Which he did fairly clinically. He got through the list of questioners in less than 40 minutes, which the PM will probably be grateful for. A 3.5 for artistic impression, for understated elegance; a 4.0 for technical merit, for keeping PMQs a bit closer to time. What pundits are saying on Twitter Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Analysis: What's next for the Iran deal? Barbara Plett Usher explains France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says the Iranian nuclear deal is ""not dead"" despite US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw. The 2015 agreement curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions that had been imposed by the UN, US and EU. But Mr Trump argued that the deal was ""defective at its core"", saying he would pull out and reimpose sanctions. Other signatories to the nuclear accord say they remain committed to it. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. It was struck under Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. Is there a Plan B? Why Trump ditched the deal Iran said it would try to salvage the agreement, but would restart uranium enrichment if it could not. In a statement, President Hassan Rouhani said: ""If we achieve the deal's goals in co-operation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place."" This video can not be played There was fury in Iran's parliament following the announcement But the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was sceptical, saying he did not trust Britain, France or Germany, and would need ""guarantees"" before continuing the nuclear deal. ""I said many times from the first day: don't trust America,"" he said in comments carried on his official website. In his comments to French radio, Mr Le Drian said ""the deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there"". He said there would be a meeting between France, Britain, Germany and Iran on Monday. Johnson: UK won't walk away from Iran deal Russia said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Mr Trump's decision while China expressed regret. But the move has been welcomed by Iran's major regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a prominent critic of the accord, said he ""fully supports"" Mr Trump's withdrawal from a ""disastrous"" deal. In his address on Tuesday, President Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. The US Treasury said the sanctions would target industries mentioned in the deal, including Iran's oil sector, aircraft manufacturers exporting to Iran and Iranian government attempts to buy US dollar banknotes. Major European and US companies are likely to be hit. Some exemptions are due to be negotiated but it is not yet clear what. US National Security Adviser John Bolton is reported as saying that European companies doing business in Iran will have to stop doing so within six months or face US sanctions. Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent The deal was not perfect. It did not cover a range of worrying Iranian activities from its missile programme to its regional behaviour. The inconvenient truth for Donald Trump is that, as far as it goes, the nuclear deal was working. Despite this, Mr Trump presented it in stark and frankly erroneous terms - for leaving out things that it was never supposed to cover in the first place. He has put US diplomacy on a collision course with some of Washington's closest allies. And some fear that he may have brought a new and catastrophic regional war in the Middle East that much closer. Read more from Jonathan Is there a Plan B? The JCPOA saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who on Wednesday again said Iran was honouring its commitments. What is the nuclear accord? President Rouhani has warned that Iran could resume ""industrial-scale"" uranium enrichment if the agreement collapses. After the deal was implemented, it was estimated it would take Iran at least 12 months to gather enough highly-enriched uranium or plutonium to build a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so. But experts say that it could still take Iran years to acquire a working nuclear arsenal.

"Left to right: Kim Hak-song, Kim Dong-chul, Tony Kim North Korea has freed three US citizens from prison, according to a tweet from US President Donald Trump. It is viewed as a goodwill gesture ahead of a historic summit between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Mr Trump said he would greet the men when they return with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been in Pyongyang to arrange the planned talks. Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul boarded the plane ""without assistance"", the White House said. They had been jailed for anti-state activities and placed in labour camps. Mr Trump announced the release of the men in a tweet on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""They seem to be in good health,"" he wrote, adding that a date and location had been set for talks after Mr Pompeo held a ""good meeting"" with Kim Jong-un. Reporters travelling with Mr Pompeo said their meeting lasted about 90 minutes. In his tweet, Mr Trump added that he would personally greet the detainees,externalwhen they arrive at Andrews Air Force Base at 02:00 EDT (06:00GMT) on Thursday. In later remarks, Mr Trump said that the location for the talks would be announced ""within three days"". This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies He added that they will not take place in the demilitarised border zone between North and South Korea known as the DMZ. Kim Hak-songwas held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" in May 2017.  He had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) Tony Kim,also known as Kim Sang-duk, also worked at PUST. He was detained in April 2017 on espionage charges. According to South Korean media, he had been involved in humanitarian work in the North. Kim Dong-chul, a pastor in his early 60s, was detained in 2015 on spying charges, and was then sentenced to 10 years hard labour. Who are North Korea's American detainees? One of the detainees was jailed in 2015, the other two have been in prison for just over a year. Their convictions have been widely condemned as political and an abuse of human rights. Ahead of his visit, the second to North Korea in under six weeks, the secretary of state said that he hoped North Korea would ""do the right thing"" and release the detainees. Allow Twitter content?

The fate of the detainees has been a key factor in the build up to the Trump-Kim meeting. South Korea's presidential Blue House welcomed the release of the Americans, saying it would have a ""positive effect"" for upcoming negotiations. Blue House spokesman Yoon Young-chan also called upon the North to release six South Korean prisoners. Mike Pompeo, the top US diplomat, has met the North Korean leader twice in under six weeks ""In order to reinforce reconciliation between South Korea and North Korea and to spread peace on the Korean peninsula, we wish for a swift repatriation of South Korean detainees,"" Mr Yoon said. In a statement provided to the BBC,external, the family of Tony Kim said they ""want to thank all of those who have worked toward and contributed to his return home"". ""We also want to thank the President for engaging directly with North Korea,"" the family said. Can SouthKorea achieve the same? Analysis byLaura Bicker, BBC News, Seoul The US has made progress where South Korea has not. President Moon Jae-in raised the issue of six South Koreans held in the North during his historic meeting with Kim Jong-un at the border. But there is no homecoming for them. A statement from the Presidential palace in Seoul states that they hope they will be returned soon given the ""atmosphere of peace that has begun on the Korean peninsula"". Since the end of the Korean War, 3,835 South Koreans have been taken by the North. Of those, 3,319 were allowed to return or escaped, according to a study by the Asan Institute in Seoul. That means there are 516 people whose fate in North Korea is not known. North Korea maintains many of those from the South remain of their own free will. But their families disagree and call for independent verification. Then there are the divided families. Divided by lines drawn to separate the two Koreas after war or divided because some in the family chose to defect to the South. I met one teenager who hasn't seen her mother since January 2011. She remembers the exact time they said goodbye. The start of the peace process has seen the reunification of three Korean American families. As the negotiations continue, the hope here in South Korea is that there will be many more reunions to come. What are NorthKorean prisons like? Some 120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in North Korea without due process, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK). People can be jailed by the regime for almost anything, activists say, with crimes ranging from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect from the country. Political prisoners are often sent to separate prisons - usually brutal labour camps, which involve difficult physical work such as mining and logging. How harsh is prison in North Korea? Warmbier died less than a year after his tearful confession in Pyongyang American missionary Kenneth Bae, who was sentenced to hard labour, was himself forced to work on a farm six days a week despite being in poor health. Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier?

"A potential new cure for baldness has been discovered using a drug originally intended to treat osteoporosis. Researchers found the drug had a dramatic effect on hair follicles in the lab, stimulating them to grow. It contains a compound which targets a protein that acts as a brake on hair growth and plays a role in baldness. Project leader Dr Nathan Hawkshaw told the BBC a clinical trial would be needed to see if the treatment was effective and safe in people. Only two drugs are currently available to treat balding (androgenetic alopecia): minoxidil, for men and women finasteride, for men only Neither is available on the NHS and both have side-effects and are not always very effective, so patients often resort to hair transplantation surgery instead. I had a transplant after hairstyle made me go bald Too young to go bald Behind the scenes of a hair transplant Early baldness higher heart disease risk factor than obesity, says study Baldness research 'creates a new hair follicle' The research, published inPLOS Biology,external, was done in a lab, with samples containing scalp hair follicles from more than 40 male hair-transplant patients. The researchers, from the University of Manchester, first latched onto an old immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine A, used since the 1980s to prevent transplant organ rejection and reduce symptoms of autoimmune disease. The scientists found that the drug reduced the activity of a protein called SFRP1, a key growth regulator that affects many tissues including hair follicles. But because of its side effects, CsA was unsuitable as a baldness treatment. The team went on to look for another agent that targeted SFRP1 and found that WAY-316606 was even better at suppressing the protein. Dr Hawkshaw said the treatment could ""make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss"". Hair loss is a daily occurrence and generally nothing to worry about. Some types are temporary and some are permanent. You should see a doctor because of: sudden hair loss developing bald patches losing hair in clumps head itching and burning worry about hair loss Source:NHS Choices,external A British Association of Dermatologists spokesman told the BBC: ""This is a very interesting study. ""As the researchers say, hair loss is a common disorder and it can cause considerable damage to emotional health, including loss of self-esteem and confidence. ""That said, more research will need to be done before it can be used by people with hair loss. ""For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss. There isn't one which is universally effective. ""For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.""

"This video can not be played ""It was a nightmare, it wasnât safe enough to drive"" BMW is extending a UK recall of its cars after the BBC's Watchdog found that vehicles could cut out completely while they are being driven. It is recalling 312,000 vehicles: the BMW 1 Series, the 3 Series, the Z4 and its X1 petrol and diesel models made between March 2007 and August 2011. BMW initially recalled 36,410 petrol cars last year over safety issues. It said it now recognised there may have been similar problems in cars not covered by the first recall. The German carmaker initially recalled cars in the UK after Narayan Gurung, who was travelling with his wife on Christmas Day in 2016, died when their Ford Fiesta crashed into a tree to avoid a broken-down BMW in Guildford, Surrey. BMW advert 'promoted dangerous driving' The BMW had suffered an electrical fault, causing its brake lights to fail and resulting in the vehicle stalling on a dark A-road. An investigation by Watchdog has found that the fault could affect a wider number of cars. Narayan Gurung was killed on Christmas Day in 2016 when his car swerved to avoid a stalled BMW One BMW owner, Mwape Kambafwile, told the BBC how his BMW 3 Series car had cut out completely while he was driving in December 2016. ""I just thought to myself if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous,"" he said. Mr Kambafwile said he took his car to BMW who called the next day to say that they had found the fault, which looked like ""the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box"". BMW allowed Mr Kambafwile to take the car home without any warning not to use it, he said. He refused to drive the car and was furious to later discover that petrol versions of the same vehicle had been recalled for the same fault. It recently emerged that BMW had failed to tell the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency about the electrical fault in some of its cars that led to the death of Mr Gurung. BMW said it had worked with the DVSA and rejected suggestions it had ignored instructions or provided incorrect information. An inquest revealed that the carmaker had received complaints of an electrical issue that caused a total power failure as early as 2011. BMW recalled 500,000 cars in the US in 2013, as well as in Australia, Canada and South Africa. Commenting on Watchdog's investigation, BMW said: ""We now recognise that there may have been some cases of similar power supply issues in vehicles not covered by the original recall. ""In order to reassure customers with concerns about the safety of their vehicles, we are voluntarily extending the recall. ""We are therefore announcing today that we will take the proactive step of expanding the existing UK recall to cover all vehicles potentially affected by the power supply issue.""

"Katy Perry has sent Taylor Swift an actual olive branch, seemingly ending the beef between the two megastars. Swifty, who is about to start her Reputation tour, shared a video of the package she received from Katy - which appeared to include a note with the words ""miscommunications"" and ""deeply sorry"" written on it. The olive branch is a symbol of peace. The pair reportedly fell out in a row over backing dancers, before writing songs about each other. Taylor's Bad Blood is thought to be about Katy, while Swish Swish is said to be about Taylor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Greggs shares tumbled on Wednesday after the bakery chain said that March's cold snap had hit sales. The Beast from the East forced the temporary closure of several stores and added to overall weaker trading in early spring. Like-for-like sales slowed to 1.3% in the first 18 weeks of the year, down from 3.5% for the same period in 2017. Although sales this month had rebounded, Greggs warned that full-year profits could be flat as a result. The company's failure to keep delivering annual profit growth sparked an investor exodus, with shares sliding almost 15% to Â£10.78, valuing it at Â£1.1bn. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, commented: ""The overall message is that, despite tight cost control, underlying profits for the year are now likely to be only flat compared to last year, which is obviously a bit disappointing."" Before Wednesday's trading update, analysts had forecast annual pretax profit before one-off items of Â£87.1m - up from Â£81.8m this year - according to Reuters data. Greggs driver delivers food to stranded motorists Greggs Valentine's Day meal attracts Newcastle couples Greggs said the year began well, with sales rising 3.2% in January and February, but the combination of the bad weather, fewer people going into its shops and cautious consumer conditions led to the March slump. Demand for its food-to-go range was particularly badly hit during that period. ""Trading conditions in March and April have been very difficult in the market generally and Greggs is no exception to that,"" said chief executive Roger Whiteside. Sales in May had started more strongly but still lagged the growth recorded in January and February. ""Those customers that are coming are spending more ... but there are just fewer of them out shopping and consumer spending underlying trends appear to be under pressure,"" Mr Whiteside added. Because of the uncertainties about footfall, Greggs said it was being cautious about the outlook for sales for the rest of the year: ""Taking into account trading conditions in the year to date, and our more cautious outlook, we currently believe that underlying profits for the year are likely to be at a similar level to last year.""

"Parental Bereavement Bill debated in Commons Georgina Pattinson The PM sets up two working parties in a bid to hammer out differences over customs plans. Parental Bereavement Bill clears the Commons House of CommonsParliament A bill to
guarantee bereavement leave and pay for those who lose a child has made it through its stages in the Commons. The Parental Bereavement (Leave and
Pay) Bill, which aims to create a legal entitlement of at least two weeks leave
and pay for parents, cleared its final Commons hurdle with unanimous support. The private member's bill will now undergo further scrutiny in the Lords before it becomes law. It was brought forward by Conservative Kevin Hollinrake in consultation
with his Conservative colleague Will Quince, whose son was stillborn at full
term in October 2014. The draft legislation had been dubbed ""Will's Bill"" in honour of the
campaigning by Mr Quince, but he said it should be referred to as
""Robert's Bill"" in honour of his son. He said: ""When members of the public, who in some cases have a bit of disdain
for politicians, say 'You MPs you do nothing, what do you do for us?', well
today we're doing something for tens of thousands of bereaved parents up and
down this country. ""We know the good this bill will do."" The government offered its support to the bill along with Labour and other
opposition parties. Representation of the People (Young People's Enfranchisement) Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill now being debated aims to reduce the voting age to 16 in parliamentary and other elections and to make
provision about young people's education in citizenship and the constitution. The MP taking the bill through the Commons is Labour MP Peter Kyle. This private member's bill was listed second on Commons business and is unlikely to secure enough time for its second reading debate as MPs
devoted their attention to the parental bereavement bill. Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill passes third reading and will now make its way to the Lords.

Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Karen Lee, who lost her daughter to cancer, explains the
importance of support at work after a bereavement. The Lincoln MP says: ""I know every business is different but it is so
important when you go back, your world has been turned upside down and you can't
just walk back in and pretend everything's the way it was the day that you left,
so that is really vital."" SNP MP Patricia Gibson says parents should have
greater flexibility over when they can take the leave, which would enable them
to grieve but also potentially attend an inquest or court case linked to the
death. The draft law specifies the leave must be within 56 days of the child's death. She says: ""I fear that for the minority of employers who are perhaps
not as sympathetic as they might be, bereaved parents may face losing their jobs
as well as losing their child."" Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament The Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which has government and
opposition support, brings forward proposals to create a legal entitlement for
parental bereavement leave and pay of at least two weeks. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake has brought this bill forward, with his Conservative colleague Will Quince, whose son
was stillborn at full term in October 2014. Tory MP Kevin Foster tells the Commons he ""fully supported"" the ideas behind
the legislation as he debated a series of amendments he proposed at report
stage. He says: ""A reasonable employer will clearly behave in a very different way to
the type of person we're having to aim this legislation at. ""We're bluntly aiming this legislation at the sort of person who adopts the
employment practices of Scrooge and Marley."" The Torbay MP lent his name to 21 amendments to the bill.

MPs are debating the final stages of the Parental Bereavement Bill. This bill makes provision about leave and pay for employees whose children have died. What happened in the Commons today? The government has apologised to Libyan Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who say an MI6 tip-off led to their capture and his torture by Colonel Gaddafi's forces. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the settlement with the couple included a Â£500,000 payment to Ms Boudchar. Mr Belhaj says MI6 helped the US kidnap him in Thailand in 2004 to return him and his wife to Libya. UK actions had contributed to the couple's capture, Mr Wright said. Mr Belhaj had not sought and would not receive financial compensation, Mr Wright added. A leading opponent of the then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Mr Belhaj says he was abducted in Bangkok - along with his wife, then five-months pregnant - while attempting to fly to London to claim asylum in the UK. Now a politician in Libya, Mr Belhaj spent six years in prison upon his return to the country, while Moroccan-born Ms Boudchar was released shortly before giving birth. What happened? House of CommonsParliament An urgent question on how the government is dealing with (or not dealing with) money resolutions for private member's bills saw MPs from both sides claiming thatthe bill in question,externalhas been approved by the House, and must now be given authorisation through a money resolution. The Attorney General announced that the government has paid Â£500,000 in damages to the wife of a Libyan dissident and issued a formal apology after alengthy litigation process. Abdul Hakim Belhaj will receive no compensation himself, as the Attorney General said he has never sought any, just an apology. A sombre mood descended on the Commons for two backbench debates, the first on people affected by financial misconduct, in particular theGlobal Restructuring Group within RBS. The second was on compensation forthe victims of Libyan-sponsored IRA terrorism. The government stated in both cases that more does need to be done: in the case of RBS, it is waiting for the result of a review from the Financial Conduct Authority, and in the case of Libya/IRA terrorism, is unable to do anything further at the moment.

"Parental Bereavement Bill debated in Commons Georgina Pattinson The PM sets up two working parties in a bid to hammer out differences over customs plans. Parental Bereavement Bill clears the Commons House of CommonsParliament A bill to
guarantee bereavement leave and pay for those who lose a child has made it through its stages in the Commons. The Parental Bereavement (Leave and
Pay) Bill, which aims to create a legal entitlement of at least two weeks leave
and pay for parents, cleared its final Commons hurdle with unanimous support. The private member's bill will now undergo further scrutiny in the Lords before it becomes law. It was brought forward by Conservative Kevin Hollinrake in consultation
with his Conservative colleague Will Quince, whose son was stillborn at full
term in October 2014. The draft legislation had been dubbed ""Will's Bill"" in honour of the
campaigning by Mr Quince, but he said it should be referred to as
""Robert's Bill"" in honour of his son. He said: ""When members of the public, who in some cases have a bit of disdain
for politicians, say 'You MPs you do nothing, what do you do for us?', well
today we're doing something for tens of thousands of bereaved parents up and
down this country. ""We know the good this bill will do."" The government offered its support to the bill along with Labour and other
opposition parties. Representation of the People (Young People's Enfranchisement) Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill now being debated aims to reduce the voting age to 16 in parliamentary and other elections and to make
provision about young people's education in citizenship and the constitution. The MP taking the bill through the Commons is Labour MP Peter Kyle. This private member's bill was listed second on Commons business and is unlikely to secure enough time for its second reading debate as MPs
devoted their attention to the parental bereavement bill. Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament The bill passes third reading and will now make its way to the Lords.

Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Karen Lee, who lost her daughter to cancer, explains the
importance of support at work after a bereavement. The Lincoln MP says: ""I know every business is different but it is so
important when you go back, your world has been turned upside down and you can't
just walk back in and pretend everything's the way it was the day that you left,
so that is really vital."" SNP MP Patricia Gibson says parents should have
greater flexibility over when they can take the leave, which would enable them
to grieve but also potentially attend an inquest or court case linked to the
death. The draft law specifies the leave must be within 56 days of the child's death. She says: ""I fear that for the minority of employers who are perhaps
not as sympathetic as they might be, bereaved parents may face losing their jobs
as well as losing their child."" Parental Bereavement Bill House of CommonsParliament The Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which has government and
opposition support, brings forward proposals to create a legal entitlement for
parental bereavement leave and pay of at least two weeks. Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake has brought this bill forward, with his Conservative colleague Will Quince, whose son
was stillborn at full term in October 2014. Tory MP Kevin Foster tells the Commons he ""fully supported"" the ideas behind
the legislation as he debated a series of amendments he proposed at report
stage. He says: ""A reasonable employer will clearly behave in a very different way to
the type of person we're having to aim this legislation at. ""We're bluntly aiming this legislation at the sort of person who adopts the
employment practices of Scrooge and Marley."" The Torbay MP lent his name to 21 amendments to the bill.

MPs are debating the final stages of the Parental Bereavement Bill. This bill makes provision about leave and pay for employees whose children have died. What happened in the Commons today? The government has apologised to Libyan Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, who say an MI6 tip-off led to their capture and his torture by Colonel Gaddafi's forces. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the settlement with the couple included a Â£500,000 payment to Ms Boudchar. Mr Belhaj says MI6 helped the US kidnap him in Thailand in 2004 to return him and his wife to Libya. UK actions had contributed to the couple's capture, Mr Wright said. Mr Belhaj had not sought and would not receive financial compensation, Mr Wright added. A leading opponent of the then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Mr Belhaj says he was abducted in Bangkok - along with his wife, then five-months pregnant - while attempting to fly to London to claim asylum in the UK.

"This video can not be played ""It was a nightmare, it wasnât safe enough to drive"" BMW is extending a UK recall of its cars after the BBC's Watchdog found that vehicles could cut out completely while they are being driven. It is recalling 312,000 vehicles: the BMW 1 Series, the 3 Series, the Z4 and its X1 petrol and diesel models made between March 2007 and August 2011. BMW initially recalled 36,410 petrol cars last year over safety issues. It said it now recognised there may have been similar problems in cars not covered by the first recall. The German carmaker initially recalled cars in the UK after Narayan Gurung, who was travelling with his wife on Christmas Day in 2016, died when their Ford Fiesta crashed into a tree to avoid a broken-down BMW in Guildford, Surrey. BMW advert 'promoted dangerous driving' The BMW had suffered an electrical fault, causing its brake lights to fail and resulting in the vehicle stalling on a dark A-road. An investigation by Watchdog has found that the fault could affect a wider number of cars. Narayan Gurung was killed on Christmas Day in 2016 when his car swerved to avoid a stalled BMW One BMW owner, Mwape Kambafwile, told the BBC how his BMW 3 Series car had cut out completely while he was driving in December 2016. ""I just thought to myself if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous,"" he said. Mr Kambafwile said he took his car to BMW who called the next day to say that they had found the fault, which looked like ""the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box"". BMW allowed Mr Kambafwile to take the car home without any warning not to use it, he said. He refused to drive the car and was furious to later discover that petrol versions of the same vehicle had been recalled for the same fault. It recently emerged that BMW had failed to tell the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency about the electrical fault in some of its cars that led to the death of Mr Gurung. BMW said it had worked with the DVSA and rejected suggestions it had ignored instructions or provided incorrect information. An inquest revealed that the carmaker had received complaints of an electrical issue that caused a total power failure as early as 2011. BMW recalled 500,000 cars in the US in 2013, as well as in Australia, Canada and South Africa. Commenting on Watchdog's investigation, BMW said: ""We now recognise that there may have been some cases of similar power supply issues in vehicles not covered by the original recall. ""In order to reassure customers with concerns about the safety of their vehicles, we are voluntarily extending the recall. ""We are therefore announcing today that we will take the proactive step of expanding the existing UK recall to cover all vehicles potentially affected by the power supply issue."" BMW said that it will open a customers' complaints line and will contact affected owners directly.

"The HPV vaccine routinely offered to teenage girls in the UK is safe and protects against a virus that can cause cancer of the cervix, an independent review has found. The analysis by theCochrane Group,externalprovides solid evidence that should reassure parents considering having their daughters immunised, say experts. It looked at 26 trials involving more than 73,000 girls and women. Serious side-effects following the vaccine were rare. Campaigners maintain the vaccine can cause harm and say this needs to be explored more fully. Some parents say their daughters have become unwell after being immunised. TheEuropean Medicines Agency,external,The World Health Organization,externaland now Cochrane have looked at the evidence and say HPV vaccination is safe and worthwhile. Would you know if you had HPV? Doctors paying for sons to have HPV jab Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: ""This study adds to the wealth of growing evidence from around the world which shows that the HPV vaccine is the most effective way for young girls to protect themselves against cervical cancer. ""Most women aged 15 to 25 years in the UK have now received the HPV vaccine."" Robert Music, from Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said although uptake of the vaccine in the UK is high, it is slipping. ""We cannot afford to get complacent. We must strive to reduce the myths and stigma around the vaccine."" Vaccine safety is kept under constant review and the Cochrane Group says that more data is required to provide greater certainty about very rare side-effects. Girls can get it free from the NHS from the age of 12 up to 18. It is designed to stop them getting infected with a virus - Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) - which can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix or neck of the womb that, if untreated, can lead to cancer. The jab used by the NHS is called Gardasil and it protects against four strains of HPV - 16, 18, 6 and 11. Types 16 and 18 are the ""high risk"" ones linked to cervical cancer. Girls are offered the vaccine ideally before they become sexually active, meaning they are unlikely to have come into contact with the virus at that time. HPV infections are very common and don't usually cause any symptoms, meaning most people won't know they're infected. They can be caught by any close skin-to-skin sexual contact with another person who already has one. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own and doesn't cause any health issues. But some women with the high risk strains won't clear it and may develop cancer. Untreated, a third of high-grade cellular changes will lead to cervical cancer, which is why the NHS offers HPV jabs and smear tests to prevent or detect and treat any abnormalities. In some countries, boys are also routinely offered an HPV jab - to protect them and their future partners. HPV can cause anal and penile cancer, as well as oral cancer. In the UK,the vaccine is recommended for men who have sex with men. The jab should be given before someone has come into contact with HPV. The NHS does not offer the vaccine to women over the age of 18. All women between the ages of 25 and 64 should still attend for regular smears even if they have been immunised. The smear test can be used to check for HPV infection and to look for any pre-cancerous cell changes that might need treating.

"A potential new cure for baldness has been discovered using a drug originally intended to treat osteoporosis. Researchers found the drug had a dramatic effect on hair follicles in the lab, stimulating them to grow. It contains a compound which targets a protein that acts as a brake on hair growth and plays a role in baldness. Project leader Dr Nathan Hawkshaw told the BBC a clinical trial would be needed to see if the treatment was effective and safe in people. Only two drugs are currently available to treat balding (androgenetic alopecia): minoxidil, for men and women finasteride, for men only Neither is available on the NHS and both have side-effects and are not always very effective, so patients often resort to hair transplantation surgery instead. I had a transplant after hairstyle made me go bald Too young to go bald Behind the scenes of a hair transplant Early baldness higher heart disease risk factor than obesity, says study Baldness research 'creates a new hair follicle' The research, published inPLOS Biology,external, was done in a lab, with samples containing scalp hair follicles from more than 40 male hair-transplant patients. The researchers, from the University of Manchester, first latched onto an old immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine A, used since the 1980s to prevent transplant organ rejection and reduce symptoms of autoimmune disease. The scientists found that the drug reduced the activity of a protein called SFRP1, a key growth regulator that affects many tissues including hair follicles. But because of its side effects, CsA was unsuitable as a baldness treatment. The team went on to look for another agent that targeted SFRP1 and found that WAY-316606 was even better at suppressing the protein. Dr Hawkshaw said the treatment could ""make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss"". Hair loss is a daily occurrence and generally nothing to worry about. Some types are temporary and some are permanent. You should see a doctor because of: sudden hair loss developing bald patches losing hair in clumps head itching and burning worry about hair loss Source:NHS Choices,external A British Association of Dermatologists spokesman told the BBC: ""This is a very interesting study. ""As the researchers say, hair loss is a common disorder and it can cause considerable damage to emotional health, including loss of self-esteem and confidence. ""That said, more research will need to be done before it can be used by people with hair loss. ""For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss. There isn't one which is universally effective. ""For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.""

"London can offer top universities, museums and culture, despite the ""eye-watering"" cost of living London has been ranked as the best city in the world for university students. The top 30 rankings for student cities, produced by the QS higher education data analysts, has previously put Montreal and Paris in first place. The ratings are based on factors such as the number of top universities in a city, the local jobs market, the diversity of the culture and the quality of life. But London ranked poorly on one of the measures - affordability. Theranking of university cities,external, rather than the quality of institutions, is produced by the QS higher education group, which publishes the annual World University Rankings. The comparisons, which include a survey of the views of 50,000 students, are an attempt to quantify some of the attractions and disadvantages of cities for students. For students in London there is a higher concentration of world-class institutions than in any other city, including Imperial College, University College London, the London School of Economics and King's College. Students also have access to the cultural life of museums, theatres, cinemas and restaurants. Students put a high value on cities feeling ""welcoming"", says a survey of prospective applicants It is also seen as a good place to connect with employers and get a job. London achieved a high rating for being a very international city, with high levels of tolerance and diversity, so that overseas students would not feel isolated or excluded. But when it comes to cost of living and affordability, London does badly, being seen as expensive and difficult for student budgets. Ben Sowter, research director at QS, says the results show that London ""remains a great place to study, despite eye-watering costs"". In second place is Tokyo in Japan, which does very well in terms of the ""desirability"" of the city. This measures factors such as safety, pollution and quality of living. Across all cities, Toronto in Canada is rated highest for this desirability, ahead of Tokyo and Amsterdam. Tokyo scored highly for being seen as a ""desirable"" city to live in Australia has been pushing for a growing slice of the international market in overseas students and Melbourne is ranked as the third best city for students and Sydney is ninth. Both the Australian cities perform highly in being outward looking and allowing students to mix, with Canadian and New Zealand institutions scoring highly on this measure. Edinburgh is Scotland's highest ranked university city in 16th place. In the academic World University Rankings, US universities dominate, taking all four of the top places in a league table headed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But there are no US cities in the top 10 student cities, compared with two in Germany, Berlin and Munich. And there are only two US cities in the top 30, Boston and New York. Paris, which for several years was the top-rated city, has been ranked fifth. Melbourne scored highly for being an open city with a good quality of life In terms of the most affordable student cities, Budapest in Hungary is rated top, followed by Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. A separate annual study, published this week by another part of the QS group, says the two top factors for overseas students were the perceived quality of teaching and whether university locations were seen as ""welcoming"". TheInternational Student Survey,external, based on 67,000 prospective applicants, also warns that 39% of EU students thought that Brexit ""has made me less interested in studying in the UK"". They feared that Brexit would make UK universities more expensive and ""less welcoming"" to students from EU countries. London's success in the rankings is likely to raise the long-running debate about the UK's attitude towards overseas students and visa requirements. A study earlier this year from the Higher Education Policy Institute foundinternational students were worth Â£20bn per yearto the UK economy. London alone gains Â£4.6bn, said the analysis - with Sheffield the biggest beneficiary in proportion to the size of its local economy. The think tank said the findings supported calls to remove international students from immigration targets. The Home Office has argued that there is no limit on the numbers of legitimate students.

""Most women aged 15 to 25 years in the UK have now received the HPV vaccine."" Robert Music, from Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said although uptake of the vaccine in the UK is high, it is slipping. ""We cannot afford to get complacent. We must strive to reduce the myths and stigma around the vaccine."" Vaccine safety is kept under constant review and the Cochrane Group says that more data is required to provide greater certainty about very rare side-effects. Girls can get it free from the NHS from the age of 12 up to 18. It is designed to stop them getting infected with a virus - Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) - which can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix or neck of the womb that, if untreated, can lead to cancer. The jab used by the NHS is called Gardasil and it protects against four strains of HPV - 16, 18, 6 and 11. Types 16 and 18 are the ""high risk"" ones linked to cervical cancer. Girls are offered the vaccine ideally before they become sexually active, meaning they are unlikely to have come into contact with the virus at that time. HPV infections are very common and don't usually cause any symptoms, meaning most people won't know they're infected. They can be caught by any close skin-to-skin sexual contact with another person who already has one. In most cases, HPV goes away on its own and doesn't cause any health issues. But some women with the high risk strains won't clear it and may develop cancer. Untreated, a third of high-grade cellular changes will lead to cervical cancer, which is why the NHS offers HPV jabs and smear tests to prevent or detect and treat any abnormalities. In some countries, boys are also routinely offered an HPV jab - to protect them and their future partners. HPV can cause anal and penile cancer, as well as oral cancer. In the UK,the vaccine is recommended for men who have sex with men. The jab should be given before someone has come into contact with HPV. The NHS does not offer the vaccine to women over the age of 18. All women between the ages of 25 and 64 should still attend for regular smears even if they have been immunised. The smear test can be used to check for HPV infection and to look for any pre-cancerous cell changes that might need treating.

"As a result of Owen Scott's actions, one of his daughters will be wheelchair-dependent for the rest of her life A man who tried to kill his three children and step-daughter in a hammer attack before crashing his car at 92mph has had his jail term increased. Owen Scott had been jailed for life for four counts of attempted murder and dangerous driving after the crash near Penistone, South Yorkshire. Scott, 29, of Hampshire, had his minimum term increased by the Court of Appeal from 14 to 24 years. The children were inside the car when he crashed it into a pub last August. Read more stories from across Yorkshire Two girls, aged seven and eight, and two boys, aged 21 months and nine months, were seriously injured with all four youngsters suffering brain damage in the crash. As a result of her injuries, one of his daughters will be wheelchair-dependent for the rest of her life. Challenging the original sentence, Solicitor General Robert Buckland said the 14-year term for Scott, from Fawley, had been unduly lenient. The crash happened at the junction of Bower Hill, Coates Lane and the A629 He said a series of aggravating factors, including the gross abuse of trust and the vulnerability of the young victims, meant the case fell outside normal sentencing guidelines. Lord Justice Treacy, sitting with two other judges, said: ""Four young lives have been grievously affected, their mother's life has been blighted and the level of harm which has been done is very high indeed. ""It follows from that analysis that the sentence imposed below was unduly lenient."" Scott had been in a cocaine-induced psychotic episode, when he deliberately crashed into the Travellers Inn, near Penistone, early on 23 August last year. The court heard he had collected the children from his former partner's home in Southampton on the pretext of taking them on a shopping trip. Scott then drove to the Isle of Wight, Liverpool and Greater Manchester before arriving in Huddersfield ahead of the crash, which he claims to have no memory of. The judge said: ""It is clear that some of the children were old enough to understand what the offender was doing whilst those attacks were taking place."" Defence barrister Michelle Colborn further stressed Scott had little recollection of what happened.

"Tests and high stakes exams are a major source of anxiety: Drawings by children in counselling Sally, now 20, believes her mental distress should have been spotted years before she received treatment that helped her. She says she became ill when she first started secondary school. Teachers noticed, describing her as ""an odd child"", but in the end it was Sally herself who had to ask her doctor for help and she was 16 and on the edge of suicide before she got any effective treatment. The charity Young Minds says it is not uncommon for families to have to wait 18 months even to get an assessment for their child, let alone treatment. In December, the government announced plans to overhaul children's mental health care in England, with proposals limiting waiting time to four weeks and allowing children to access mental health support in schools. Now a report from MPs has branded the strategy ""unambitious"", providing no help to most of the children who need it. But ministers reject the suggestion, saying their proposals will transform the system. The plans include: far shorter waiting times for specialist support new mental health support teams in schools mental health awareness training in primary and secondary schools one in four schools to have the provision in place by 2022 Sally says by the age of 12 she had very poor attendance and was self harming. At 15 she Googled her symptoms and made herself an appointment with her GP. But she says she had too little emotional intelligence or vocabulary to explain herself clearly to medical staff. One nurse even accused her of being manipulative for crying and a doctor asked her if she was self diagnosing when she said she thought she might be depressed. She says she got no effective treatment until she was 16 and found herself no longer able to tell what was real and what wasn't. She was suicidal and was eventually admitted to hospital and began the struggle towards recovery. Now she is well enough to be taking a degree, holding down a part time job to help fund her studies. ""There are some absolute angels working in services and some really skilled people,"" she says. ""And there also some people who have clearly never had a collaborative conversation with a young person in their lives."" Of her treatment she says: ""What I have got has been good. It's just that it's been so bitty."" MPs on the Education Select Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee say the government's plans risk leaving hundreds of thousands without proper care. They are particularly concerned at the long time frame: ""Rolling out the plans to only 'a fifth to a quarter of the country by 2022-23' is not ambitious enough,"" they argue. They worry that health and education workforces lack capacity to meet the proposed additional demands and fear the government could have underestimated the level of need as the proposals are based on out-of-date figures on demand for mental health services among children and young people. They also say there is too little emphasis on: early intervention pressures such as social media or the current exam system helping groups more prone to mental distress - such as children in care or in the criminal justice system Dr Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, called for services to be joined up ""in a way which places children and young people at their heart and that improves services to all children rather than a minority"". Rob Halfon, chair of the Education Committee, called for urgent action by government ""to address the mental health issues  which children and young people face today"". Poppy was just five when she started scratching herself until she bled in frustration and anger. She was also lashing out at her mother and at her elder sister. But while she was violent and angry at home, she was quiet and compliant at school. The family and their GP were bewildered. But Poppy was lucky as her school is among just over 200 to have onsite counselling from the charity Place2Be. Poppy had weekly appointments with a counsellor and so did her mother, Caroline. After six months Caroline says she gained ""an understanding of my child which I had never had before"". ""It was a moment which transformed her life and our life as a family."" Poppy's distress stemmed from a highly sensitive awareness of what was going on around her and an inability to filter much of it out. She finds change very hard to handle and can very easily feel a failure as she has very high expectations of herself. She did her best to behave perfectly throughout the school day but, according to Caroline, ""it would all come to pieces at home"". While Poppy, now seven, hasn't changed as a person, her family now understand how to help her cope. Caroline believes the outcome would have been very different without the charity's quick and effective intervention. ""It would have carried on getting worse and I dread to think where we would potentially have ended up. ""We were incredibly lucky."" Place2Be says it wants to see all schools with enough dedicated funding, support and training to be able to run services like theirs. But school leaders warn that funding for professional mental health services in schools has ""plummeted"". ""There are not enough resources there already,"" said Paul Whiteman general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. ""Teachers aren't the ones who should be treating mental health. We should leave that to the experts in that field."" Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds said: ""If the government is serious about improving children's mental health services it needs to guarantee increased long term funding and place more emphasis on preventing mental health problems from developing."" And Dr Andrew Moldynski of the British Medical Association said: ""Rather than diverting funds from schools which are already struggling with their own limited resources, the government must provide the urgent funding required to ensure that Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services has a universal reach and staff are adequately supported to oversee meaningful change."" But a government spokeswoman said the proposals would ""transform mental health services for children and young people, including the first ever waiting time standards for those with the most serious problems"". ""This will be supported by a new workforce - larger than the entire current workforce - and backed by Â£300m of additional funding that will also provide significant additional resources for all schools. This builds on what good schools are already doing, without adding unnecessarily to teachers' workloads. ""We agree that every young person should be able to access mental health support - however we need to ensure we get this right, which is why we will pilot this approach to make sure services are correct.""

"Stephen Heaney pictured on the morning of the Belfast Marathon A runner from Limavady who died after collapsing during the Belfast marathon has been named. Stephen Heaney, 50, collapsed at the Sydenham bypass, five miles into the race. The event's organisers said two ambulances were quickly at the scene to take the man to the Royal Victoria Hospital. It's understood it was his first marathon, although he was a regular runner. Mr Heaney's family have requested privacy. About 17,000 people took part in Monday's Belfast Marathon Mr Heaney was among 17,000 runners taking part in the 37th annual Belfast City Marathon. Former Belfast Lord Mayor Alderman Brian Kingston told the BBC that the runner's death was ""terrible news"". Mr Kingston is also a marathon runner. ""It's a day all about fitness, achievement, about people wanting to push themselves that bit extra, to achieve a great physical feat,"" he said. ""That a man has died is the worst possible news."" He said a fatality was ""a rare event"" and had not happened at the Belfast marathon for nearly 30 years. ""This very much overshadows everything that has happened on the day and everyone will want to convey condolences to the family,"" he said. Pulse Fitness in Limavady posted a tribute on Facebook on the day of the marathon stating: ""Our day started with so much excitement but unfortunately ended with broken hearts. ""Today we lost our special friend, who will always be remembered forever. RIP Stephen."" DUP councillor Alan Robinson said: ""The Limavady community is stunned at the dreadful news that began to filter through yesterday.

"This video can not be played Listen to the song of the South Georgia Pipit - free now from predation by rats They have gone, or so it seems. The biggest rat eradication programme ever undertaken appears to have rid South Georgia island in the South Atlantic of its pest problem. A survey of the British Overseas Territory has found no trace of the rodents that had been attacking the local birdlife. The outcome is a triumph for theSouth Georgia Heritage Trust,external, the Scottish charity that led the Â£10m campaign to protect the biodiversity hotspot. Helicopters were used to systematically drop poison pellets across the island's coastal fringes in three phases starting in 2010/11. But international best practice had required the extermination team to wait two years after the last distribution of rodenticide before assessing its work. That has just now been completed with experts combing the island with sniffer dogs. Traps were also set, along with enticing ""chew sticks"" pasted with peanut butter. But there is not a jot of evidence to suggest any live rats are still present. South Georgia's giant ice history Counting South Georgia's whales New map traces Shackleton's footsteps This video can not be played Prof Mike Richardson: ""The brown rat is a voracious predator in the wrong place"" Prof Mike Richardson, the chair of the restoration project steering committee, said it had been a nerve-wracking wait for the survey's result to come through. ""We've been on tenterhooks; would there be a remnant enclave somewhere? But I'm pleased to say over the last six months, not a single sign of a rodent has been found. And so to the best of our knowledge, this island is now rodent-free,"" he told reporters. First visited by the great explorer James Cook in 1775, the UK overseas territory is rightly famed for its wildlife. Thousands of tourists flock to the 170km-long island each year to see its seals, penguins, and albatrosses. Indeed, millions of birds, representing more than 30 different species, breed on this sub-Antarctic landmass - and all of them must nest either on the ground or just below it in burrows because there are no trees. And it is this behaviour that exposed them to predation from the invasive rodents that got on to the territory when sealers and whalers started using it as a base in the 19th and 20th Centuries. This video can not be played Alison Neil: ""It's taken a decade of work to get to this point"" The rats and mice were voracious, eating birds alive - albatrosses, petrels, prions; anything they could get their teeth into, and that included chicks that were often several times their own size. Of particular concern, though, was the plight of the South Georgia Pipit (Anthus antarcticus), the world's most southerly songbird; and a duck - the South Georgia Pintail (Anas georgica georgica). These two land birds live nowhere else on the planet. The good news is that their numbers are already bouncing back in the absence of the rats. More than 300 tonnes of poison bait were spread across the island One can never say never, but the chances of a rodent being alive on South Georgia today are very, very slim. Dickie Hall, the director of the restoration project, paid tribute to his team. Over the past six months, the group monitored more than 1,500 sites. And in their search for any hangers-on, the three detection dogs in the party walked an extraordinary combined total of 2,420km. ""Dogs have an incredible sense of smell,"" Mr Hall said. ""They can detect rodent scent from several metres, or even tens of metres if conditions are right. So by walking through a piece of habitat, we can be very confident with these dogs of finding rodents if there are any present."" Sniffer dogs took part in the survey - they picked up no scents Alison Neil, the chief executive of the Dundee-based SGHT, also lauded those who worked in the field. In addition, she thanked the trust's many financial donors, including the tourists who go to the island. ""We get something like 9,000 of them a year on South Georgia. They all really contributed and we actually raised about Â£200,000 a season from the cruise ship passengers."" Ordinarily, extermination on the scale seen in South Georgia would be very difficult to achieve - but for one factor. The sub-Antarctic island is covered by numerous glaciers and these effectively divided up the territory into convenient killing zones. With rodents unwilling to cross ice fields, the project team knew it could clear areas and have confidence they would not be re-infested from places yet to be baited. Glaciers have blocked the spread of rodents, but these ice fields are now in rapid retreat All this is knowledge that bears down heavily now on the future. Climate change has put the glaciers into rapid retreat. When this ice is gone, it will be much more difficult to tackle any future invasion - maybe even impossible. A big responsibility rests on current biosecurity protocols. Already, tourist ships are not allowed to dock in port; passengers come ashore on inflatables after inspection of their clothing and bags. Government and navy vessels that are permitted to tie up have had their cargo baited and fumigated. Sweeping ships with rat-detecting dogs is also being trialled. ""Invasive non-native species continue to be one of the biggest environmental threats to biodiversity,"" said Lord Gardiner, a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). ""As the minister responsible for biosecurity, it's absolutely essential that all of this work is not put in jeopardy by one loose connection,"" he told BBC News. And Prof Richardson added: ""Even one pregnant rat getting back on to South Georgia could restart this whole cycle.""

"Drug users in Scotland consume the most cocaine in a single session, according to a worldwide survey of drug-taking habits. The 2018 Global Drug Survey looked at the recreational drug use of 130,000 people across 44 countries. In Scotland the amount of the drug consumed per session was more than double the global average. Researchers, who quizzed 15,000 cocaine users, said thedrug can be delivered ""more quickly than a pizza"" in Glasgow,external. The survey, which is self-selecting and conducted anonymously, found 36.7% of users in the city reported delivery of the drug ""within 30 minutes"". For users in England that figure rises slightly to 36.8% - placing them fifth in the world rankings. Scots were found on average to consume 1.2g of cocaine in a single session, signifcantly higher than both the figure in England (0.7g) and the worldwide average (0.5g). Some drugs experts have suggested cocaine in Scotland might be less pure. Scotland also fared badly in the survey when it came to problem drinking The survey also looked at alcohol use, and found Scotland had the highest proportion of respondents (4.2%) who sought emergency medical care after a drinking session. The report said: ""This is double the level of English drinkers seeking medical treatment after drinking (2.1%), highlighting how entrenched a problem drinking is north of the border."" Prof Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, and founder of the survey, said: ""The 2018 Global Drug Survey highlights how much more work there is to do with alcohol messaging in the UK. ""It is clear that the link between alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk is a message that is still not reaching UK drinkers and where it does, many chose to react to the message with scepticism. He said the regularity of people ending up in accident and emergency departments was ""truly alarming"". Prof Winstock added: ""That both England and Scotland are in the top five global nations needing emergency treatment after alcohol consumption is truly concerning. ""This is another finding that shows how much more work is required to drive home the message of responsible drinking."" Katy MacLeod of Scottish Drugs Forum said the true weight of a drug sold as a ""gram"" can vary and seems to be lower in Scotland than elsewhere. She said: ""The low purity of cocaine supplied in Scotland suggests that bulking agents have been used to dilute the drug and so the same weight in Scotland will have less cocaine than in other countries. ""Using with alcohol may mean that people are using cocaine to allow them to keep drinking alcohol and so it is alcohol that is driving this behaviour. ""Mixing alcohol with other drugs adds to the potential for harm to users and others.""

The Met's Gang Violence Matrix was set up in 2012 in response to the London riots Figures from July 2016 showed 78% of the people listed were black. Police figures show 27% of those prosecuted for youth violence are black. About 13% of London's population is black. The matrix uses various intelligence including history of violent crime, entries on social media and information from bodies including local councils to identify gang members. They are then given a score assessing the risk they posed. Around 40% of those on the list have a ""harm score"" of zero, the report found. Those with a zero score may be in custody and therefore not currently offending. Being on the matrix could affect access to housing, education and job centre services, the report claimed. The Met Police said the matrix was used ""to reduce gang-related violence and prevent young lives being lost"" The charity's UK director, Kate Allen, said: ""There is clearly a huge problem with knife crime violence at the moment in London, but the gangs matrix is not the answer. ""The entire system is racially discriminatory, stigmatising young black men for the type of music they listen to or their social media behaviour, and perpetuating racial bias with potential impacts in all sorts of areas of their lives. Individuals identified on the matrix are offered support to divert them away from both offending and becoming a victim of violence, Scotland Yard said. The Met said it was working with Tottenham MP David Lammy, Amnesty International and the ICO to ""help understand the approach taken"". It is understood that officers in Manchester and Birmingham gather similar information on gang links. Have you been affected by any of the issues raised in this article?

"The new unit will take over the work of the Historical Enquiries Team Cabinet ministers have raised concerns over plans to introduce a new body that would investigate unsolved killings from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Introducing a new ""Historical Investigations Unit"" was a major part of the 2014 Stormont House agreement. It was agreed then to create a new independent body to deal with killings where there had been no prosecutions. But several ministers told colleagues on Tuesday that the proposal was unacceptable in its current form. In what has been described as a ""spat"", Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson is understood to have raised concerns that military veterans might not have enough protections under the proposed system. Another minister who expressed worries said there had not been a huge argument, but that it had been made clear to the government that it had to do more to make sure that former military personnel weren't unfairly targeted, or dragged through the courts. No 'amnesty' in NIO legacy document New police unit to investigate past One cabinet source told the BBC: ""This has got catastrophe written all over it for the government and will carry very little sympathy with the majority of the British public who won't be able to get their heads round us not getting behind our veterans."" But others familiar with the process said that the new HIU would ""end the current witch hunt"" where veterans and former police officers are already hit disproportionately, providing a new system that is fair, independent and proportionate. Figures obtained by the BBC challenge the claim that investigations areunfairly focused on the security forces. The defence secretary is understood to have raised objections It is hoped the proposed unit would be able to investigate terrorist killings more vigorously than under the current piecemeal system. The plan was also included in the Tories' Northern Irish election manifesto. A source said: ""We want to find a way forward and we believe that the right way is to consult on this. Leaving the status quo as it exists is to let down our armed forces, as the current system it hits our armed forces disproportionately."" They suggested the idea of providing a statute of limitation for veterans would be legally impossible. A Number 10 source said it was hoped the consultation would be carried out ""expeditiously"" although they would not be drawn on a date. The Northern Ireland Office has circulated a draft consultation document on ""legacy"" matters to the main Stormont parties. It is understood the draft does not contain a controversial suggestion for a so-called statute of limitations. It would have prevented the prosecution of former soldiers for offences connected to the Troubles.

"Stormy Daniels says she was paid by Mr Cohen to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with Mr Trump A company used by President Donald Trump's personal lawyer to pay off porn star Stormy Daniels also received $500,000 (Â£368,000) from a firm tied to a Russian oligarch, US media report. The firm, Columbus Nova, acknowledged the payment but said it was a consultancy fee. It was one of several businesses - including major corporations - which paid a shell company set up by Michael Cohen after the 2016 election. Mr Cohen is yet to comment. Last month the FBI seized papers from Mr Cohen's officefollowing a request from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mr Cohen's company, Essential Consultants LLC, last year received half a million dollars from Columbus Nova, a New York-based investment company affiliated with a firm controlled by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg,according to the New York Times.,external The Associated Press also said it had reviewed financial documents,externalthat appeared to support the claims first made by Ms Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, in a memo posted online that described details of payments but did not provide a source. A lawyer for Columbus Nova said late on Tuesday that the payment to Essential Consultants  was a business consulting fee related to potential investments and had nothing to do with Mr Vekselberg. ""Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved in or provided any funding for Columbus Nova's engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue,"" Richard Owens said in a statement. Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, alleges she had a sexual relationship with Mr Trump in 2006 - a claim the president has denied. Who is Michael Cohen? The president and the porn star: Why this matters Mr Cohen paid Ms Daniels $130,000 (Â£92,000) during the 2016 presidential campaign in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement. The payment was made via Essential Consultants. The documents reportedly show that Essential Consultants also received a $200,000 payment from AT&T as the corporation sought approval from the Trump administration for its planned acquisition Time Warner. AT&T confirmed to CNN a payment for an undisclosed amount,externalfor ""insights into understanding the new administration"". ""Essential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,"" the company said on Tuesday.

"Drug users in Scotland consume the most cocaine in a single session, according to a worldwide survey of drug-taking habits. The 2018 Global Drug Survey looked at the recreational drug use of 130,000 people across 44 countries. In Scotland the amount of the drug consumed per session was more than double the global average. Researchers, who quizzed 15,000 cocaine users, said thedrug can be delivered ""more quickly than a pizza"" in Glasgow,external. The survey, which is self-selecting and conducted anonymously, found 36.7% of users in the city reported delivery of the drug ""within 30 minutes"". For users in England that figure rises slightly to 36.8% - placing them fifth in the world rankings. Scots were found on average to consume 1.2g of cocaine in a single session, signifcantly higher than both the figure in England (0.7g) and the worldwide average (0.5g). Some drugs experts have suggested cocaine in Scotland might be less pure. Scotland also fared badly in the survey when it came to problem drinking The survey also looked at alcohol use, and found Scotland had the highest proportion of respondents (4.2%) who sought emergency medical care after a drinking session. The report said: ""This is double the level of English drinkers seeking medical treatment after drinking (2.1%), highlighting how entrenched a problem drinking is north of the border."" Prof Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and addiction medicine specialist, and founder of the survey, said: ""The 2018 Global Drug Survey highlights how much more work there is to do with alcohol messaging in the UK. ""It is clear that the link between alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk is a message that is still not reaching UK drinkers and where it does, many chose to react to the message with scepticism. He said the regularity of people ending up in accident and emergency departments was ""truly alarming"". Prof Winstock added: ""That both England and Scotland are in the top five global nations needing emergency treatment after alcohol consumption is truly concerning. ""This is another finding that shows how much more work is required to drive home the message of responsible drinking."" Katy MacLeod of Scottish Drugs Forum said the true weight of a drug sold as a ""gram"" can vary and seems to be lower in Scotland than elsewhere. She said: ""The low purity of cocaine supplied in Scotland suggests that bulking agents have been used to dilute the drug and so the same weight in Scotland will have less cocaine than in other countries. ""Using with alcohol may mean that people are using cocaine to allow them to keep drinking alcohol and so it is alcohol that is driving this behaviour. ""Mixing alcohol with other drugs adds to the potential for harm to users and others.""

"This video can not be played Listen to the song of the South Georgia Pipit - free now from predation by rats They have gone, or so it seems. The biggest rat eradication programme ever undertaken appears to have rid South Georgia island in the South Atlantic of its pest problem. A survey of the British Overseas Territory has found no trace of the rodents that had been attacking the local birdlife. The outcome is a triumph for theSouth Georgia Heritage Trust,external, the Scottish charity that led the Â£10m campaign to protect the biodiversity hotspot. Helicopters were used to systematically drop poison pellets across the island's coastal fringes in three phases starting in 2010/11. But international best practice had required the extermination team to wait two years after the last distribution of rodenticide before assessing its work. That has just now been completed with experts combing the island with sniffer dogs. Traps were also set, along with enticing ""chew sticks"" pasted with peanut butter. But there is not a jot of evidence to suggest any live rats are still present. South Georgia's giant ice history Counting South Georgia's whales New map traces Shackleton's footsteps This video can not be played Prof Mike Richardson: ""The brown rat is a voracious predator in the wrong place"" Prof Mike Richardson, the chair of the restoration project steering committee, said it had been a nerve-wracking wait for the survey's result to come through. ""We've been on tenterhooks; would there be a remnant enclave somewhere? But I'm pleased to say over the last six months, not a single sign of a rodent has been found. And so to the best of our knowledge, this island is now rodent-free,"" he told reporters. First visited by the great explorer James Cook in 1775, the UK overseas territory is rightly famed for its wildlife. Thousands of tourists flock to the 170km-long island each year to see its seals, penguins, and albatrosses. Indeed, millions of birds, representing more than 30 different species, breed on this sub-Antarctic landmass - and all of them must nest either on the ground or just below it in burrows because there are no trees. And it is this behaviour that exposed them to predation from the invasive rodents that got on to the territory when sealers and whalers started using it as a base in the 19th and 20th Centuries. This video can not be played Alison Neil: ""It's taken a decade of work to get to this point"" The rats and mice were voracious, eating birds alive - albatrosses, petrels, prions; anything they could get their teeth into, and that included chicks that were often several times their own size. Of particular concern, though, was the plight of the South Georgia Pipit (Anthus antarcticus), the world's most southerly songbird; and a duck - the South Georgia Pintail (Anas georgica georgica). These two land birds live nowhere else on the planet. The good news is that their numbers are already bouncing back in the absence of the rats. More than 300 tonnes of poison bait were spread across the island One can never say never, but the chances of a rodent being alive on South Georgia today are very, very slim. Dickie Hall, the director of the restoration project, paid tribute to his team. Over the past six months, the group monitored more than 1,500 sites. And in their search for any hangers-on, the three detection dogs in the party walked an extraordinary combined total of 2,420km. ""Dogs have an incredible sense of smell,"" Mr Hall said. ""They can detect rodent scent from several metres, or even tens of metres if conditions are right. So by walking through a piece of habitat, we can be very confident with these dogs of finding rodents if there are any present."" Sniffer dogs took part in the survey - they picked up no scents Alison Neil, the chief executive of the Dundee-based SGHT, also lauded those who worked in the field. In addition, she thanked the trust's many financial donors, including the tourists who go to the island. ""We get something like 9,000 of them a year on South Georgia. They all really contributed and we actually raised about Â£200,000 a season from the cruise ship passengers."" Ordinarily, extermination on the scale seen in South Georgia would be very difficult to achieve - but for one factor. The sub-Antarctic island is covered by numerous glaciers and these effectively divided up the territory into convenient killing zones. With rodents unwilling to cross ice fields, the project team knew it could clear areas and have confidence they would not be re-infested from places yet to be baited. Glaciers have blocked the spread of rodents, but these ice fields are now in rapid retreat All this is knowledge that bears down heavily now on the future. Climate change has put the glaciers into rapid retreat. When this ice is gone, it will be much more difficult to tackle any future invasion - maybe even impossible. A big responsibility rests on current biosecurity protocols. Already, tourist ships are not allowed to dock in port; passengers come ashore on inflatables after inspection of their clothing and bags. Government and navy vessels that are permitted to tie up have had their cargo baited and fumigated. Sweeping ships with rat-detecting dogs is also being trialled. ""Invasive non-native species continue to be one of the biggest environmental threats to biodiversity,"" said Lord Gardiner, a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). ""As the minister responsible for biosecurity, it's absolutely essential that all of this work is not put in jeopardy by one loose connection,"" he told BBC News. And Prof Richardson added: ""Even one pregnant rat getting back on to South Georgia could restart this whole cycle.""

"This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out President Donald Trump wasn't always so dead against the Iran deal and it's not a big issue for voters, so why is he pulling out now? It was a move that had been telegraphed for months, despite last-ditch attempts by US allies and domestic backers of the agreement to convince the president to stick with the status quo. In his announcement, the president said that he was open to renewed negotiations, putting trust in his ability as a deal-maker to succeed. ""A constructive deal could have easily been struck at the time,"" Trump said of the 2015 negotiations. ""But it wasn't."" Now the president will have his chance to show he can do better. But why withdraw now? Opinion pollsshow a majority of Americans are in favour of staying,externalin the deal, and, while Mr Trump has said he's simply keeping another promise, this was never an issue that motivated his base the way immigration, trade and the economy did. Here are three reasons why he grew to hate the deal and made this move. Mr Trump has, at times, framed his opposition to the Iran deal on very personal terms. He has repeatedly mocked former Secretary of State John Kerry, one of the architects of the agreement, including cracks about a bicycle accident that left him with a broken leg. According to one report, Mr Kerry's efforts to reach out to Iranians in recent days helped push the president further toward abandoning the deal. The president tweeted about it earlier on Tuesday, so the topic was certainly on his mind. ""John Kerry can't get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it!""Trump wrote,external. ""Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country!"" Iran nuclear deal: Key details Global reaction to pull-out Since his inauguration, Mr Trump has taken aim at practically every one of his predecessor's signature achievements. Within a week of his inauguration he had pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations. In June he announced his intent to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation. He also unwound Obama-era protections for some undocumented immigrants. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? He, and Republicans in Congress, made repealing the Affordable Care Act, which increased government regulation of health insurance markets, a central (albeit largely unsuccessful) focus of his first-year legislative agenda. He's re-imposed sanctions and travel restrictions on Cuba, rescinded proposed controls on power-plant emissions, fuel efficiency standards for new cars and other environmental regulations, and backed repeal of some Obama-era controls on financial institutions. ""With the Paris climate deal dead, the Iran nuclear deal on life support, and Obamacare eviscerated, Obama's only real legacy at this point is the presidency of Donald Trump,""writes,externalSean Davis of the conservative website The Federalist. And that, it seems, is just the way Mr Trump wants it. When Mr Trump first ran for president, he was not nearly as critical of the Iran deal as he is now. While saying he thought it was a mistake and poorly negotiated, he suggested that he may be open to keeping the US commitments. ""It's very hard to say, 'We're ripping it up,'"" then-candidate Trump said duringan NBC interview,externalin August 2015. ""I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance,"" he said. ""As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract."" His shift to a more vehemently anti-deal view tracks closely with Mr Trump's full-throated support of Benjamin Netanyahu and the hard-line Israeli side of Middle East peace negotiations, after earlier suggesting he could be a impartial ""deal-maker"" in the region. ""It doesn't help if I start saying I'm very pro-Israel,"" Mr Trumpsaid,externalin a Republican candidate debate in February 2016, when he was sharply criticised by Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for his professed neutrality in Arab-Israeli negotiations. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal By the following month, Mr Trumptold an audience,externalat the American Israel Public Affairs Committee annual conference that his ""number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran"" - outlining what he saw as the agreement's failure to address the nation's destabilising influence in the region and the development of its ballistic missile programme. He said there was no ""moral equivalency"" between the Israelis and Palestinians in peace negotiations and that ""the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end"" when he becomes president. And since becoming president, Mr Trump has begun the process of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, threatened new sanctions against Palestinians, continued his condemnations of the Iranian government and now abandoned the nuclear arms agreement with that nation - citing, in part, evidence presented by Mr Netanyahu. Reality Check: Has Iran's economy benefited from the nuclear deal? John Bolton is known for his hardline views on Iran Mr Trump had made motions toward, and then backed away from, formally pulling out of the Iran deal several times over the first year of his presidency. He was reportedly counselled against abandoning the agreement by senior advisers in his administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor HR McMaster and Secretary of Defence James Mattis. Mr Mattis is the only man left standing, and his influence appears to be waning. The other two have been replaced by Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, respectively, and both are considered Iran hawks. Where once the president may have been counselled to be cautious in abandoning US commitments to Iran, this time his instincts - an innate distrust of multilateralism in general and Iran in particular - appear to have been enthusiastically supported. After 15 months Mr Trump has built a foreign policy team that is largely on the same page - his page.

"This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out US President Donald Trump says he will withdraw the US from an Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran. Calling it ""decaying and rotten"", he said the deal was ""an embarrassment"" to him ""as a citizen"". Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. In response, Iran said it was preparing to restart uranium enrichment, key for making both nuclear energy and weapons. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said: ""The US has announced that it doesn't respect its commitments. ""I have ordered the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran to be ready for action if needed, so that if necessary we can resume our enrichment on an industrial level without any limitations."" He said he would ""wait a few weeks"" to speak to allies and the other signatories to the nuclear deal first. ""If we achieve the deal's goals in cooperation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place,"" he said. Could the Iran deal collapse? What is the nuclear accord? UK and European allies ""committed to deal"" The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions that had been imposed by the UN, US and EU. This video can not be played President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will ""wait and see how others react"" Mr Trump had previously complained that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period; had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles; and had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£74bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East. ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal,"" Mr Trump said. ""The Iran deal is defective to its core."" Former President Barack Obama, who signed the deal on behalf of the US three years ago, called Mr Trump's announcement ""misguided"". The US Treasury said economic sanctions would not be reimposed on Iran immediately, but would be subject to 90-day and 180-day wind-down periods. In a statement on its website, it said sanctions would be reimposed on the industries mentioned in the 2015 deal, including Iran's oil sector, aircraft exports, precious metals trade, and Iranian government attempts to buy US dollar banknotes. Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Three reasons behind Trump ditching Iran deal US National Security Advisor John Bolton is reported as saying that European companies doing business with Iran will have to finish within six months or face US sanctions. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent With a stroke of his pen President Trump has jeopardised the one agreement - good or bad -that seeks to constrain Iran's nuclear ambitions. He launched a scathing assault on the deal and its deficiencies, but he offered no alternative policy to put in its place. He has put US diplomacy on a collision course with some of Washington's closest allies. And some fear that he may have brought a new and catastrophic regional war in the Middle East that much closer. Read more: What happens next? France, Germany and the UK - whose leaders had tried to change Mr Trump's mind - have said they ""regret"" the American decision. The foreign ministry of Russia, another signatory, said it was ""deeply disappointed"". The European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, said the EU was ""determined to preserve"" the deal. Former PresidentObama said on Facebook that the deal was working,externaland was in US interests. ""Walking away from the JCPOA turns our back on America's closest allies, and an agreement that our country's leading diplomats, scientists, and intelligence professionals negotiated. ""At a time when we are all rooting for diplomacy with North Korea to succeed, walking away from the JCPOA risks losing a deal that accomplishes - with Iran - the very outcome that we are pursuing with the North Koreans,"" he said. The United Nations secretary general's spokesman said Antonio Guterres was ""deeply concerned"" at the announcement and called on the other signatories to abide by their commitments. But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he ""fully supports"" Mr Trump's ""bold"" withdrawal from a ""disastrous"" deal. And Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival, says it ""supports and welcomes"" Mr Trump's moves towards pulling out of the deal. The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted.

"This video can not be played Analysis: What's next for the Iran deal? Barbara Plett Usher explains France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says the Iranian nuclear deal is ""not dead"" despite US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw. The 2015 agreement curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions that had been imposed by the UN, US and EU. But Mr Trump argued that the deal was ""defective at its core"", saying he would pull out and reimpose sanctions. Other signatories to the nuclear accord say they remain committed to it. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. It was struck under Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. Is there a Plan B? Why Trump ditched the deal Iran said it would try to salvage the agreement, but would restart uranium enrichment if it could not. In a statement, President Hassan Rouhani said: ""If we achieve the deal's goals in co-operation with other members of the deal, it will remain in place."" This video can not be played There was fury in Iran's parliament following the announcement But the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was sceptical, saying he did not trust Britain, France or Germany, and would need ""guarantees"" before continuing the nuclear deal. ""I said many times from the first day: don't trust America,"" he said in comments carried on his official website. In his comments to French radio, Mr Le Drian said ""the deal is not dead. There's an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there"". He said there would be a meeting between France, Britain, Germany and Iran on Monday. Johnson: UK won't walk away from Iran deal Russia said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by Mr Trump's decision while China expressed regret. But the move has been welcomed by Iran's major regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a prominent critic of the accord, said he ""fully supports"" Mr Trump's withdrawal from a ""disastrous"" deal. In his address on Tuesday, President Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as it is formally known - a ""horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made"". He said he would work to find a ""real, comprehensive, and lasting"" deal that tackled not only the Iranian nuclear programme but its ballistic missile tests and activities across the Middle East. This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out Mr Trump also said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. The US Treasury said the sanctions would target industries mentioned in the deal, including Iran's oil sector, aircraft manufacturers exporting to Iran and Iranian government attempts to buy US dollar banknotes. Major European and US companies are likely to be hit. Some exemptions are due to be negotiated but it is not yet clear what. US National Security Adviser John Bolton is reported as saying that European companies doing business in Iran will have to stop doing so within six months or face US sanctions. Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent The deal was not perfect. It did not cover a range of worrying Iranian activities from its missile programme to its regional behaviour. The inconvenient truth for Donald Trump is that, as far as it goes, the nuclear deal was working. Despite this, Mr Trump presented it in stark and frankly erroneous terms - for leaving out things that it was never supposed to cover in the first place. He has put US diplomacy on a collision course with some of Washington's closest allies. And some fear that he may have brought a new and catastrophic regional war in the Middle East that much closer. Read more from Jonathan Is there a Plan B? The JCPOA saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel, but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. Iran limited its sensitive nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who on Wednesday again said Iran was honouring its commitments. What is the nuclear accord? President Rouhani has warned that Iran could resume ""industrial-scale"" uranium enrichment if the agreement collapses. After the deal was implemented, it was estimated it would take Iran at least 12 months to gather enough highly-enriched uranium or plutonium to build a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so. But experts say that it could still take Iran years to acquire a working nuclear arsenal.

"Feltham A manages young people on remand and those who have been sentenced by the courts Levels of violence at a young offenders institution dropped after teenagers were given sweets for good behaviour, inspectors found. Inmates at YOI Feltham, in west London, can select confectionery items from a ""merit shop"", inspectors found. They said the new ""behaviour management philosophy"", focusing on incentives rather than punishment, had helped to reduce violence. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the results were ""encouraging"". A report by the prison inspectorate said boys who behave well are given ""immediate rewards"" under the new regime, and were also allowed to eat some meals together. Previously they ate alone in their cells. Commenting on the recent findings, Peter Clarke, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: ""Last year we reported how the focus had been on sanctions and regime restrictions, there was a cycle of violence and punitive responses, with no obvious strategy in place to break it. ""This had changed, and we found a new focus on rewards and incentives for good behaviour."" Inspectors noted, however, that a large number of children at Feltham did not always receive the support to which they were entitled from local authorities, in particular in ensuring suitable accommodation on release had been secured. The report also urged the prison to tackle a problem with some boys getting into debt through gambling. Penal reform charity Howard League said ""damning inspection reports on Feltham for decades have proven that you cannot punish children into good behaviour."" ""When staff are kind to the children and being positive with them, it at least makes some difference"", Frances Crook, the charity's chief executive said. ""I am worried, however, that sweets are being used to supplement the boys' diet because they are not given enough food."" During the last six months there has been 161 violent incidents, which was lower than the 200 recorded the pervious year An earlier report found boys were kept in their cells for ""too long"" and sanctioned for ""petty"" misdemeanours. Feltham A holds 140 boys aged 16-17. Dr Phillip Lee, of the MoJ, said: ""It's encouraging to see the progress Feltham has made under very challenging circumstances and I am determined to see similar improvements across the youth estate."" 'Super Prix' set to return to Birmingham Potential new cure found for baldness 'I sat across the table from Mum's killer' In 2017, inspectors said the ""punitive"" regime at Feltham had contributed to a cycle of violence. It also found the prison was""not safe for either staff or boys""after finding levels of ""very serious"" violence had risen.
