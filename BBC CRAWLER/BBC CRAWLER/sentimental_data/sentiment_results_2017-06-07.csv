"A launderette in Oxford has been turned into a temporary polling station for the election Voting is coming to an end in the UK general election. Polls opened at 07:00 BST on Thursday at more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, with counting starting once voting ends at 22:00 BST. A total of 650 Westminster MPs will be elected, with about 46.9 million people registered to vote. That is up from the last general election, in 2015, when there were 46.4 million registered voters. The turnout in 2015 was 66.4%. Latest updates Guide: How to vote Find your constituency and candidates What CAN'T you do in a polling station? Manifesto guide on where the parties stand How to follow results night and what to watch for Some votes had already been cast, through postal voting, which accounted for 16.4% of the total electorate at the 2015 general election. People with an undelivered postal vote can still deliver it by hand to their local polling station. Overall turnout in 2015, when the Conservatives won 331 out of 650 seats, was 66.4%, up from 2010.

Police have increased security at polling stations, including patrols by armed officers in some areas, following the recent terror attacks. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May cast their votes on Thursday after a seven-week campaign Lib Dem leader Tim Farron looked cheerful despite the rain after voting in Kendal, Cumbria Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas voted with her husband Richard Savage in Brighton UKIP leader Paul Nuttall cast his ballot in Congleton, Cheshire In Glasgow, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon voted at a local community hall Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood went to vote in Penygraig A handful of seats are expected to be declared by midnight, with the final results expected on Friday afternoon. Unusually, no local elections are taking place at the same time, so results might come through earlier than in recent general elections. In 2015 the first seat to declare was Houghton and Sunderland South, at 22:48 BST. To form a majority in the House of Commons one party must win 326 seats - in 2015 a Conservative majority was not confirmed until 13:34 BST. The weather forecast is for some rain in south-west England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales on Thursday, with south-east England remaining cloudy and dry. Dogs at polling stations have become a familiar sight Polls close at 22:00 BST, but officials say anyone in a polling station queue at this time should be able to cast their vote. The BBC's main election programme, fronted by David Dimbleby, starts at 21:55 BST, with live coverage from scores of counts. Dimbleby, fronting his 10th election night broadcast, will be joined by Mishal Husain, Emily Maitlis, Jeremy Vine. David Dimbleby will front BBC television coverage Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will have their own overnight programmes but will join Huw Edwards from 07:00 BST on 9 June.

"A parking ticket was left on an Audi which was abandoned on Borough High Street Traffic wardens slapped tickets on cars which were left abandoned inside a police cordon during the London terror attack. Penalty charge notices were issued to a number of vehicles left near Borough Market, where several people were stabbed on Saturday. Enforcement officers were seen putting penalty charge notices on windscreens after some streets reopened earlier. Transport for London (TfL) said the fines ""should never have been issued"". It apologised for the ""insensitive mistake"" and said the charges, which can be up to Â£130, will be cancelled. TfL have said all parking fines issued will be cancelled Victims of the London Bridge attack Ex-wife 'numbed' by attacker's actions Several vehicles were abandoned in the area when Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market. Police have said the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight, while 29 patients remain in hospital, with 10 in a critical condition. It is understood there will be wardens on patrol in the area for the rest of the week but no cars left parked within the police cordon will be given tickets.

"A diamond ring bought at a car boot sale for Â£10 has been sold for Â£656,750 at auction in London. The jewel was expected to fetch Â£350,000, but went for almost double that at Sotheby's on Wednesday. The owner believed the ""exceptionally-sized"" stone was a piece of costume jewellery when she bought it at West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth, west London, in the 1980s. Unaware it was a 26 carat diamond, she wore it daily for decades. The cushion-shaped white diamond is thought to have been from the 19th Century. Diamond earrings sell for world record $57.4m Hoard of gold discovered in piano Ahead of the sale, the head of the auction house's London jewellery department, Jessica Wyndham, said: ""The owner would wear it out shopping, wear it day-to-day. It's a good looking ring. ""No-one had any idea it had any intrinsic value at all. They enjoyed it all this time."" Ms Wyndham said the owner - who does not want to be identified - assumed it was not a genuine gemstone because it was in a ""filthy"" mount and it did not have the sparkle of a diamond. It wasn't until after 30 years of wearing the ring that the owners took it to Sotheby's and a jeweller told them it may be valuable. This video can not be played Jessica Wyndham from Sotheby's tries the boot-sale ring on The base of the vase was damaged, but it still sold for more than double its estimated price After paying Â£10 for a floral vase at a car boot sale, the Hampshire-based owner decided to sell it on eBay. When bids soared to Â£10,000, he withdrew it - and sought professional help in identifying just what he'd bought. The Â£10 pot was, in fact, a rare enamel ""two quails"" vase, thought to have been made at Beijing's Imperial Palace at least 220 years ago. John Axford, Asian art expert at Woolley & Wallis auctioneers, confirmed the ""excellent investment"" bore the four-character mark of Qianlong - the sixth emperor of the Qing dynasty - and would have been made in the palace workshop between 1736 and 1795. The firm sold the vase in Salisbury in November 2016, where it made Â£61,000, including buyer's premium. That was double its guide price of Â£30,000.

It was worn the day she offered her resignation as Prime Minister to the Queen. With its geometric chevron design, the brooch was eventually sold for Â£81,250, having been estimated to fetch up to Â£35,000. Mrs Thatcher wore the brooch on the day she left Downing St Proceeds from that sale will be donated to charity. Ms Wyndham said: ""It was a thrill to bring the hammer down on two objects which have been the subject of so much interest and attention over the last few weeks and to see that attention translate into such strong bidding competition.""

"This video can not be played The shape of a Jebel Irhoud skull (L) is almost identical to ours (R) The idea that modern people evolved in a single ""cradle of humanity"" in East Africa some 200,000 years ago is no longer tenable, new research suggests.Â Fossils of five early humans have been found in North Africa that showHomo sapiensemerged at least 100,000 years earlier than previously recognised.Â It suggests that our species evolved all across the continent, the scientists involved say.Â Their work ispublished in the journal Nature,external. Prof Jean-Jacques Hublin, of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, told me that the discovery would ""rewrite the textbooks"" about our emergence as a species.Â ""It is not the story of it happening in a rapid way in a 'Garden of Eden' somewhere in Africa.Â Our view is that it was a more gradual development and it involved the whole continent. So if there was a Garden of Eden, it was all of Africa.""Â A reconstruction of the earliest known Homo sapiens skull based on scans of multiple original fossils Prof Hublin was speaking at a news conference at the College de France in Paris, where he proudly showed journalists casts of the fossil remains his team has excavated at a site in Jebel Irhoud in Morocco.Â The specimens include skulls, teeth, and long bones.Â Earlier finds from the same site in the 1960s had been dated to be 40,000 years old and ascribed to an African form of Neanderthal, a close evolutionary cousin ofHomo sapiens.Â But Prof Hublin was always troubled by that initial interpretation, and when he joined the MPI he began reassessing Jebel Irhoud. And more than 10 years later he is now presenting new evidence that tells a very different story.Â The latest material has been dated by hi-tech methods to be between 300,000 and 350,000 years old. And the skull form is almost identical to modern humans. The few significant differences are seen in a slightly more prominent brow line and smaller brain cavity.Â Prof Hublin's excavation has further revealed that these ancient people had employed stone tools and had learned how to make and control fire. So, not only did they look likeHomo sapiens, they acted like them as well.Â The Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco was recognised for its fossils from the 1960s Until now, the earliest fossils of our kind were from Ethiopia (from a site known as Omo Kibish) in eastern Africa and were dated to be approximately 195,000 years old.Â ""We now have to modify the vision of how the first modern humans emerged,"" Prof Hublin told me with an impish grin.Â Before our species evolved, there were many different types of primitive human species, each of which looked different and had its own strengths and weaknesses. And these various species of human, just like other animals, evolved and changed their appearance gradually, with just the occasional spurt.Â They did this over hundreds of thousands of years.Â By contrast, the mainstream view has been thatHomo sapiensevolved suddenly from more primitive humans in East Africa around 200,000 years ago; and it is at that point that we assumed, broadly speaking, the features we display now.Â What is more, only then do we spread throughout Africa and eventually to the rest of the planet.Â Prof Hublin's discoveries would appear to shatter this view.Â A lower jaw from a Homo sapiens individual excavated at the Jebel Irhoud site Jebel Irhoud is typical of many archaeological sites across Africa that date back 300,000 years. Many of these locations have similar tools and evidence for the use of fire. What they do not have is any fossil remains.Â Because most experts have worked on the assumption that our species did not emerge until 200,000 years ago, it was natural to think therefore that these other sites were occupied by an older, different species of human.Â But the Jebel Irhoud finds now make it possible that it was actuallyHomo sapiensthat left the tool and fire evidence in these places.Â A selection of the stone tools recovered by Prof Hublin's team. The Jebel Irhoud individuals not only looked like us they did things typical of Homo sapiens ""We are not trying to say that the origin of our species was in Morocco - rather that the Jebel Irhoud discoveries show that we know that [these type of sites] were found all across Africa 300,000 years ago,"" said MPI team member Dr Shannon McPhearon.Â Prof Chris Stringer from the Natural History Museum in London, UK, was not involved in the research. He told BBC News: ""This shows that there are multiple places in Africa whereHomo sapienswas emerging. We need to get away from this idea that there was a single 'cradle'."" And he raises the possibility thatHomo sapiensmay even have existed outside of Africa at the same time: ""We have fossils from Israel that are probably the same age and they show what could be described as proto-Homo sapiensfeatures.""Â Prof Stringer says it is not inconceivable that primitive humans who had smaller brains, bigger faces, stronger brow ridges and bigger teeth - but who were nonethelessHomo sapiens- may have existed even earlier in time, possibly as far back as half a million years ago.Â This is a startling shift in what those who study human origins believed not so long ago.Â ""I was saying 20 years ago that the only thing we should be callingHomo sapiensare humans that look like us. This was a view thatHomo sapienssuddenly appeared in Africa at some point in time and that was the beginning of our species. But it now looks like I was wrong,"" Prof Stringer told BBC News.

"Francie Munoz (centre) with her mother Pamela (right) and sister Yasmine. Toronto police are investigating after two officers were caught on camera calling a woman with Down's syndrome ""disfigured"" and ""different"". Police had pulled over Pamela Munoz for running a red light, but did not realise their microphones were on. When Mrs Munoz obtained the recording to contest her ticket, she watched them mock her 29-year-old daughter Francie. Now Francie says she is hoping a public apology will help people ""be better"" around people like her. A police video recording shows that after pulling Mrs Munoz over for allegedly running a red light, two police officers began to mock her and her two daughters who were also in the car once they were out of earshot. They can be heard saying there were only ""two and a half"" people in the car because the ""young girl in the back"" is a ""little disfigured"". Francie (second from right) pictured with her family ""Artistic... that's gonna be my new codeword for 'different',"" said one police officer, laughing. Mrs Munoz told the BBC that when she listened to the recording, at first she couldn't believe what she was hearing. ""I was livid, I was angry, mamma tiger came out,"" Mrs Munoz told the BBC. ""I was just extremely upset for Francie, and everyone who is like her."" Francie told the BBC that when she heard the comments herself, she  was ""sad and hurt"" that they would say such a thing. Things people with Down's syndrome are tired of hearing Teen with Down's syndrome speaks at UN Active in her community, Francie already appears in several campaigns aimed at raising people's awareness about Down's syndrome. Both the city's mayor and Toronto police chief Mark Saunders have personally apologised to the family. Chief Saunders visited the family for over an hour to try and make amends, Francie said. ""He was great, he came over to apologise,"" Francie said. Mrs Munoz said she does not want the police officers to lose their jobs, but she wants a public apology so that this can become a learning opportunity. ""We can't have policemen acting in this way, they should be held to a higher standard of conduct and compassion,"" she said. She said she hopes the police force increases training for officers on how to interact with civilians with disabilities. ""We are sure that if they ever met Francie or any of her friends, they would realise what wonderful human beings (they are),"" she said. ""It's just ignorance.""

"Ex-FBI chief James Comey is facing a Congress hearing where he is expected to say that President Donald Trump asked him for his ""loyalty"". In his opening statement, Mr Comey will testify the president asked him to drop an inquiry into fired National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. He says Mr Trump called the probe ""a cloud"" over him, but confirms saying the president was not under scrutiny. The opening statements from senators on the committee are under way. Mr Comey's testimony before a Senate panel is expected to last three hours. After his opening statement, which was released on Wednesday evening, attention will turn to the former ex-FBI chief's responses to questions from senators. Major TV networks are covering the hearing live, an indication that they expect a big public audience. Follow the latest updates It is being compared to major Congressional hearings such as the 1973 Watergate scandal and the 1987 Iran-Contra affair. Bars across the UShave opened early for the event, with some even serving special cocktails for the occasion. Key quotes in Comey statement Trump v Comey: Who said what The Trump-Russia story - in 200 words Two national security officials, NSA Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, a day earlier testified to senators thatthey never felt pressured by the White Houseto do anything illegal. But in Thursday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Mr Comey will detail how Mr Trump made him uncomfortable during a series of encounters leading up to the FBI director's firing on 9 May. It is one of several congressional panels that, along with the Justice Department, is investigating US intelligence assessments that Russian hackers meddled in last November's presidential election in an effort to help Mr Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The inquiries are also investigating whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the alleged Kremlin plot, which Moscow has repeatedly denied. Covfefe cocktail? US bars gear up for spectacle Mr Comey will say his first meeting with the president occurred on 6 January in a conference room at Trump Tower, where Mr Comey briefed him alone on ""salacious and unverified"" allegations about him. A dossier compiled by a former British intelligence official had claimed the Russian security services possessed compromising material on Mr Trump, including that he had been recorded consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Comey will testify the president ""expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them"" during a subsequent meeting. That denial came in a one-to-one dinner on 27 January at the White House, Mr Comey will say, adding that he had a ""very awkward conversation"" with the president that evening. It's like a sneak preview of a blockbuster movie - this opening statement should be preceded with a ""Spoiler Alert!"" warning. Mr Comey is going to largely confirm all the reports that were circulating in the media about what took place during his private meetings with the president - the talk of loyalty, the pressure on the FBI to ease off its Flynn investigation, the multiple requests for public confirmation that the FBI was not targeting Mr Trump himself. While Mr Comey casts the president in a less-than-flattering light, he does shy away from directly accusing the president of obstruction of justice. Much will be made of how the two men may have interpreted the phrase ""honest loyalty"" differently. In addition, Mr Comey viewed the president's Flynn request as only relating to his conversations with the Russian ambassador and not the investigation as a whole. That may not matter much, however. Large portions of the former director's account is in direct contradiction to Mr Trump's version of their meetings. It sets up a ""he-said, he-said"" situation - but Mr Comey has memos and conversations with other FBI officials to buttress his case. What's more, if recent polls are any indication, the American public trusts him more than the president. Mr Comey's performance under questioning - particularly if Mr Trump responds angrily via Twitter - could further sour the public mood. Four takeaways from Comey's testimony Mr Trump asked the FBI director during the discussion in the Green Room whether he wanted to stay in his job, Mr Comey will say. He will explain he found this ""strange"" because Mr Trump had already told him twice in earlier conversations that he hoped he would not step down. The former FBI director will say the question ""concerned me greatly"" because he felt the dinner was an effort to ""create some sort of patronage relationship"". James Comey: From 'brave' to fired Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded The former FBI director will testify: ""A few moments later, the president said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" In testimony, the former FBI director will detail his next encounter with Mr Trump, during a meeting attended by intelligence chiefs at the White House on 14 February. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year The president asked Mr Comey to stay at the end of the Oval Office meeting and told him: ""I want to talk about Mike Flynn."" Mr Trump accepted Mr Flynn's resignation as national security adviser just 24 days into the job after he misled the White House about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Mr Comey will say Mr Trump told him: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy."" The former FBI director will testify that he offered no such assurance. Mr Comey also will say the president phoned him on 30 March and said the Russia investigation was ""a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country"". The former FBI director will tell the Senate panel that Mr Trump ""said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia"". Mr Comey will say he assured Mr Trump during their discussions on 6 January, 27 January and 30 March that the president himself was not under investigation. He will say that Mr Trump told him during the 30 March phone call: ""We need to get that fact out."" This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe The former FBI director will say Mr Trump phoned him again on 11 April to press him on this matter. It was the last time they spoke. Mr Comey also will testify he told the president the White House should contact the Department of Justice. The former FBI director notes that he spoke with President Barack Obama only twice during the more than three years that their time in office overlapped. But he can recall nine one-on-one conversations with Mr Trump in four months, three in person and six on the phone.

"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are stressing core themes as they and other party leaders criss-cross the UK in a last push for general election votes. The Tory leader said she was the only person who could ""deliver for Britain"" and negotiate the right Brexit deal. Warning of ""five more years of Tory austerity"", Labour's leader promised more spending on health and education. The Lib Dems are focusing on Remain-voting target seats while UKIP says only it can stop Brexit ""backsliding"". In Scotland, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned that a vote for Labour risks ""handing the keys of No 10"" to Theresa May, while leaders in Wales and Northern Ireland are also making their last pitch for votes. General election: Live rolling updates Laura Kuenssberg: Election conclusions Diane Abbott: I will rejoin fray soon Manifesto guide: What the parties are promising Everything you need to know the general election campaign Reality check: How weather affects turnout After a week dominated by security issues since the terror attack in London, the prime minister returned to her central message on Brexit - the reason she gave for calling Thursday's election 50 days ago. Mrs May said that money which has until now been spent on EU projects could deliver ""huge benefits"" across the UK after its withdrawal, due in 2019. This video can not be played Mrs May says there are challenges ahead In an eve of poll interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs May said: ""Brexit is the basis of everything. We need to secure our economy for the future, we need to ensure we are getting more jobs, better paid jobs, more opportunities for young people in this country. We can do that if we get the Brexit negotiations right."" She also stressed the big differences between her and Mr Corbyn on a range of issues, including response to the terror threat: ""I support the police shooting to kill terrorists. Jeremy Corbyn does not."" Jeremy Corbyn addressing supporters at his final rally in Islington Lib Dem leader Tim Farron found time for a spot of breakfast in Solihull The PM's day started in London, where she chatted to butchers at Smithfield meat market in the City. She was accompanied by her husband, Philip, who was also at her side as she visited Southampton and Norwich. Speaking in Norwich, she said a Labour government would ""wreck the economy"" while she wanted to build a country that was ""more confident in itself and in which no community was left behind"". Mrs May, who will end the day in the West Midlands, said that negotiations with the EU would begin in less than a fortnight and the question for voters was about who they trusted to deliver the best deal for Britain. But emphasising Labour's plan to invest billions on public services, to be paid for by higher taxes on business and top earners, Mr Corbyn said the NHS could not afford ""five more years of underfunding, understaffing and privatisation"". Green Party leader Caroline Lucas says she wants the final say on Brexit to ""come back"" to the people The UKIP leader has been talking about the boost that Brexit could bring The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has been touring Scotland during the campaign Leanne Wood said a strong Plaid Cymru team was needed at Westminster Addressing activists in Runcorn, he said the election was ""all about the kind of society we want to live in"", saying: ""Never before has there been a clearer choice between the parties... a choice quite simply between hope and fear."" He said: ""The re-election of a Theresa May government will mean five more years of cuts to the NHS, five more years of increases in waiting times, five more years of more and more people waiting for social care and five more years of austerity."" Instead, Mr Corbyn - who has also addressed crowds in Glasgow and Colwyn Bay - urged people to reject this ""arid road"" and back Labour's ""positive and inclusive"" vision. On Wednesday evening, he told supporters in Harrow that commentators who had written off Labour weeks ago ""may just have made a very big mistake"". Rounding off his campaign with a rally in Islington, he said Labour was now the ""new political mainstream"". Human rights won't stop terror fight - May Farron: Lib Dems can stop Tory landslide UKIP's Nuttall in final push for votes The Labour leader has had to reshuffle his top team on the eve of the election after announcing shadow home secretary Diane Abbott would be taking a break because of ill health. Ms Abbott pulled out of a number of media engagements on Tuesday and the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Lyn Brown, the shadow police minister and candidate for West Ham, had been asked to stand in for her indefinitely. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has urged Labour supporters to ""send a message"" to Theresa May on issues such as Brexit and social care by supporting his party in seats where they are the Tories' main challengers. Endorsing tactical voting on campaign stops in Solihull, St Albans and Twickenham, he said: ""This was undoubtedly an election called in the interests of the Conservative Party and it hasn't quite turned out the way she expected because Theresa May's made some very poor decisions, that have shown weakness and a level of heartlessness."" The shadow home secretary is taking a break from her duties because of illness Former Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party offered an alternative to the continuing austerity proposed by the Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn's ""Venezuelan-style socialism"". Campaigning in Edinburgh, the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said re-electing SNP MPs would ensure Scotland retained a ""strong voice"" in Westminster and deny the Conservatives the ""crushing majority"" they were expecting. Corbyn sidesteps Dugdale referendum row Welsh leaders begin final push Starmer: Labour IRA comments 'regrettable' ""People in Scotland should not risk waking up to Tory MPs who can hand Theresa May a majority and then rubber stamp anything she wants,"" she said. ""Instead, voters should take the opportunity to stand up for Scotland's schools, hospitals, public services, pensioners and jobs by rejecting the Tories' extreme and dangerous plans."" This video can not be played Do you remember Brenda and these other moments from the general election campaign? At their final election rally, the Green Party called on people to ""vote with their hearts"". ""I'm calling on people across the UK to vote not just for the MP they want, but the kind of country they want,"" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said, emphasising his party's opposition to the Trident nuclear deterrent and support for a universal weekly basic income. Visiting Great Yarmouth, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said only his party could keep the pressure on the next government to deliver a ""real Brexit"" - with lower immigration, exclusive fishing rights for British trawlers within UK territorial waters and no ""divorce bill"". And Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said a re-elected Conservative government with an increased majority would pose a ""threat"" to Wales and her party would stand up for Welsh interests in the run-up to Brexit and afterwards.

"Millions of people are heading to polling stations across the UK to cast their vote. But what can and can't you do in there? Most British people are familiar with what goes on inside a polling station. You march in, possibly brandishing your polling card, you give your name and address, someone finds you on a list and gives you a ballot paper. You then head off to a booth to use your stubby pencil to mark your X. In 2015 we published a guide to what was and wasn't allowed in the polling station. But some issues have arisen since then so here's an update. There's nothing in the law that specifically bans taking photos, but the Electoral Commission very strongly discourages any photography inside a polling station, primarily because of complex laws about maintaining the secrecy of the ballot. For instance, it's illegal to reveal how someone else has voted, which could happen inadvertently via a sloppy selfie. In addition, taking a photo of a ballot paper's unique identification number is against the rules. The key is a law against releasing any information ""obtained in a polling station"", which is in order to protect the integrity of the poll. The Electoral Commission says: ""Due to the potential breach of the law, intentionally or not, we strongly advise against any form of photography taken inside a polling station. However, if a voter would like to highlight their participation in the elections, we suggest this is done outside the polling station before or after they vote."" Consequently, you will see ""no photography"" signs inside many polling stations. There are strict penalties for breaches of the law. At the European elections in 2014 people were warned that they could face a fine of Â£5,000 or six months in prison if they revealed how someone else voted, even accidentally. In practice, election staff might ask anyone taking a picture to delete it rather than go straight to the police. ""It would depend on exactly what they were taking a photograph of,"" one electoral services manager says. Pop star Justin Timberlake landed himself in hot water when he posted a picture on Instagram of himself voting in the US election in Memphis, Tennessee - where it is illegal to take photos inside polling locations. But the authorities decided not to take any action. Justin Timberlake in election voting selfie gaffe The Electoral Commission warns against doing it inside the polling station, even if it's about your own vote. Elsewhere you are free to publicise your vote. However, as above, there are strict laws against revealing someone else's vote, including influencing whether they publish it themselves. Under Section 66 of the Representation of the People Act it is a criminal offence to communicate information about the way someone has voted or is about to vote, and specifically to ""directly or indirectly induce a voter to display his ballot paper after he has marked it so as to make known to any person the name of the candidate for whom he has or has not voted"". Dogs may not yet be entitled to vote but they are allowed to come and watch as long as they don't disrupt the vote. In cases where a voter has two or more dogs and will struggle to control them while casting their ballot, polling station staff may be able to hold the dogs' leads. But the Electoral Commission advises that while voters are welcome to bring their dogs, unless they're an assistance dog, they may have to be left outside. During the EU referendum last year and at the local elections earlier this year, many tweeted pictures of their dogs under the hashtag #DogsAtPollingStations. Rural constituencies might have cases of voters riding to the polling station. In such instances, horses and ponies should be tethered up outside. There is no guidance on other animals such as rabbits, ferrets or pot-bellied pigs, so any decision will be at the discretion of presiding officers. #DogsAtPollingStations: Exercising paws and voting rights People shouldn't wear party political clothing. Voters dressed in party T-shirts will not be able to enter the polling station as it may be intimidating. Political figures in the wider sense may be fine, for instance a T-shirt of Che Guevara would be acceptable. The onus is on encouraging people to vote. Yes. It's true that polling station staff are on the lookout for people trying to vote twice by impersonating someone else on the register. But there's no requirement for voters to show their face. Yes. Polling station staff cannot refuse a voter simply because they are drunk or under the influence of drugs. Only if the voter is disruptive will they be asked to return when they have sobered up. No. The only people permitted to wear a rosette are the candidates and their polling agents. The rosette must be plain and not refer to the candidate or bear a slogan. No. Political discussion is banned inside the polling station. Polling station staff will intervene if people are heard to be discussing the merits of different candidates or parties - it may unsettle other voters. Neither can one ask someone whom they are voting for as this will compromise the secrecy of the poll. If you want to debate the pros and cons of a certain candidate you must do so outside. Neither can people distribute party leaflets or other literature in the polling station. Anyone seen doing so will be asked to take them outside. Technically even the Queen could vote. But she ""has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters"" and is ""unable to vote or stand for election"",according to the official website of the monarchy,external. Only if it doesn't disrupt other people. If you are listening to music on headphones you'll need to remove them when being addressed by polling station staff. They will want to confirm your name and other details. If your personal music player is playing at high volume in the polling booth you'll be asked to turn it down or leave. The same goes for loud mobile phone conversations. No, if you prefer you can use a pen, even if it's your own. While a cross is usually called for, you could theoretically mark the box with a tick instead. The important thing is that your voting intention is clear. Yes, providing you haven't already posted your ballot paper in the box. Return to the desk and tell staff what has happened. They'll be able to cancel your ballot paper and issue you with a new one. You're welcome to enter the polling station with a friend if they are also eligible to vote there. But voting is a private matter so you must be alone when you go into the polling booth. If the friend is not registered to vote there then they will not be allowed inside the polling station. If you have a disability, or are unable to read the ballot, and cannot vote on your own, you may come with a companion. The presiding officer can also help. The Electoral Commission says the best way to make sure your vote is counted is to mark an X in a box. But a smiley face or anything which is interpreted by a returning officer as an expression of preference ""must not be rejected if the voter's intention is clear"", its guidance to Returning Officers says. Of course. Polling station staff are expected to be welcoming to under-18s so as not to put off the voters of tomorrow. In exceptional cases where there are large numbers of young people in the station, presiding officers have the power to ask them to wait outside. If someone has several young children, a member of the polling station staff can look after them while the parent or guardian votes. A child is not allowed to write the X for an adult. You can but it may mean your vote won't be counted. There's a tradition of deliberately spoiling your ballot. ""None of the above"" is one of the more polite ways of showing you are not apathetic, just contemptuous of the candidates on offer. These votes are included in the overall turnout. However, if you wish to vote for a candidate you should avoid writing comments in the margin. It might confuse the counters and lead to your vote being deemed doubtful and subsequently rejected. People do occasionally sign their ballots. If the name is identifiable your vote will not count. They are considered rejected ballots because the voter has revealed their identity and breached the rules of a secret ballot. Signing your ballot paper was fairly common in the 19th Century when candidates would pay people to vote for them. Under that system it was possible for the candidate to check up later who had voted for them by looking for signatures, and pay out accordingly. Today, however innocent the motive, a signature renders a ballot ""rejected"". Guide: How to vote Find your constituency and candidates Manifesto guide on where the parties stand How to follow results night and what to watch for With about 50,000 polling stations dotted across the country, general elections are a huge logistical undertaking.

"Diane Abbott has insisted she is not being asked to stay away from the TV and radio studios Diane Abbott says she will be back in action soon after it was announced she was ""taking a break"" from campaigning. The shadow home secretary tweeted: ""Touched by all the messages of support. Still standing! Will rejoin the fray soon. Vote Labour!"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced earlier that Ms Abbott ""was not well"" and was taking a break. Shadow minister Lyn Brown is to stand in for Ms Abbott, who pulled out of two media appearances on Tuesday. BBC Election Live: Rolling updates Listen: Woman's Hour's election phone-in Last push for votes in election campaign Asked how long Ms Abbott would be taking a break, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'll be talking to her later on today."" He said: ""Of course Diane is somebody that works extremely hard and represents her community very well and I have to say has received totally unfair levels of attack and abuse not just recently - over many years."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Ms Abbott's break would be ""indefinite"" and political correspondent Iain Watson said friends of Ms Abbott had told him she was moved without consultation, not at her own request. Labour's international trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said he had been told by Labour Party officials that Ms Abbott was suffering from a long-term illness. ""Diane is clearly not well and I understand that it is a condition which has been diagnosed and is long-term,""Mr Gardiner told TalkRadio,external. ""I think anybody who has seen her in the past couple of weeks would realise that she was showing that she was not well, in the way in which she had been operating."" He added: ""Everybody is aware that Diane didn't perform well in a couple of programmes, but what we didn't know was why and I think that has now become clear."" Mr Gardiner later told the Press Association it was a matter for Ms Abbott to decide what details of her health should be made public. Ms Abbott had been scheduled to appear on a special election edition of Radio 4's Woman's Hour alongside Home Secretary Amber Rudd and other political rivals on Tuesday. But shortly before transmission, it was announced that shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry would take her place. Ms Abbott had downplayed claims Labour wanted her to adopt a lower profile after several faltering performances. During an appearance on Sky News on Monday, Ms Abbott rejected suggestions that the party leadership regarded her as a liability after an LBC interview earlier in the campaign when she failed to put an accurate cost on the party's plans to fund 10,000 new police officers. She said she was appearing regularly in the media and it would be ""strange"" if she was not doing so at a time of heightened concern about security and policing after the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Lyn Brown, 57, was first appointed to Labour's shadow home affairs team when Mr Corbyn named his first frontbench team in 2015. But she was among a slew of MPs who resigned the following year following a vote of no confidence in his leadership. She said then that Labour should seek a new leader ""for the good of the party and the country"". She rejoined the front bench three months later as minister for policing. MP for West Ham since 2005, she is fighting Thursday's election in the ultra-safe east London seat, which she held with a majority of almost 28,000 in 2015. She was a Labour whip under Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, before being appointed shadow minister for communities and local government in 2013 and then shadow home office minister two years later. The Conservatives said Labour were ""hiding"" Ms Abbott away from voters as she was ""not trusted"" by Mr Corbyn, a close ally and friend of hers, and other colleagues.

"Mr Comey is due to testify on Thursday in his first congressional appearance since his dismissal Former director of the FBI James Comey is due to testify to Congress on Thursday. Here are the key parts of his opening statement, published a day ahead of time by the Senate intelligence committee. The highly-anticipated hearing will be the first time the public hears from Mr Comey about his firing by US President Donald Trump. He is also due to discuss the alleged ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and the dismissal of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. ""I discussed with the FBI's leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on President-elect Trump's reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance. ""6 January 2017 Trump and Comey met shortly after his inauguration as US president ""The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to."" ""My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretence that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship."" ""I added that I was not on anybody's side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense... A few moments later, the President said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.'

"Elizabeth Hotson picked up some charisma tips Whether or not I am charismatic was not a question I had ever asked myself until very recently. ""I want you to go on a charisma master class,"" said my editor one morning, out of the blue. Immediately sensing my awkward bewilderment, he quickly explained that he didn't think I needed help. Instead he had a job for me - he wanted me to explore whether it is possible to be taught to become more charismatic. That's how I found myself trotting down to Mayfair in central London to see a psychologist called Richard Reid. Nicknamed ""Mr Charisma"", he runs regular sessions teaching people how to be more charismatic. Increasingly in demand, his clients range from businessmen and women who want to be better leaders, to grooms preparing for their wedding speeches, and people who simply want to be more successful with the opposite sex. While I'm naturally chatty, enjoy public speaking and smile quite a bit, I wouldn't describe myself as charismatic. But as I walked into his office, what would Mr Reid think of me? And what exactly is charisma? Among other things, Richard Reid says maintaining eye contact is key to being charismatic ""First impressions are that you have lots of positive attributes,"" he says. ""You have a likeable energy, and I feel energetic being around you."" Better than I was expecting, but then came the inevitable ""but"". ""That energy needs to be tempered slightly, slowing down and pausing..."" Sensing that I was about to interrupt, Mr Reid adds: ""And allow the other person to engage in the conversation. ""When people express themselves they feel good about themselves, and they're more likely to feel well disposed towards you."" Mr Reid goes on to talk about the importance of making eye contact, and asking people questions. ""By using open-ended questions you're showing far more interest in that person and you'll engender trust and enthusiasm."" He adds: ""Charisma is about the [positive] feeling you engender in other people. A true sign of charisma is being able to connect with someone on a deeper level."" After spending an hour with Mr Reid I'm interested to hear what successful business leaders think about charisma, and whether they believe it can be taught. So back at the office I start by calling Lord Digby Jones, a former UK minister for trade and investment. ""I'd say charisma is the confidence to constantly communicate and articulate a positive message,"" he says. Lord Jones says he works very hard to try to make things look easy ""People are kind enough to say I'm a good communicator, that I speak in a language they understand. ""And I have a reputation for always answering a question, not ducking it. If you do that and articulate with consistency and fluidity, people listen."" But does Lord Jones think you can learn to be more charismatic? ""You can become better [at it],"" he says. ""People who make things look easy work harder, prepare more, and take nothing for granted. ""I can make a speech and people think I just stood up and did it, because I never use notes. They don't know that for an hour sometime that day I've quietly sat on my own thinking, 'How am I going to structure this, what does my audience look like?'"" Across town I meet Lady Barbara Judge, chairman of the Institute of Directors business organisation. A formidable woman, her unique style seems to be an amalgam of Tudor monarch and steely grande dame of commerce. I'm rather taken aback when she says: ""For me, charisma is about smiling, you need to smile a lot."" Lady Judge insists that she is less formidable than she can appear ""Charisma is about body language, making people feel included. It's not about you, it's about the people you're talking to and leading. ""If you can make people feel important, you can carry them with you."" More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at quirky or unusual business topics from around the world: Does selling up mean selling out? 'I turned my dad's erotic novel into a hit podcast' Would you carry something abroad for a stranger? Nine-month stretch: The rise of prenatal exercise classes Lady Judge adds that you have to believe in what you are saying. ""If you want people to think you're strong, you have to look strong. ""I'm very thin-skinned, my feelings get hurt easily, and I'm kind of a marshmallow,"" she says. ""You have to get over that: look strong, sound strong, act strong."" So does she believe you can teach charisma? ""I would like to think you can,"" she says, adding that as a younger women she received training in public speaking. ""If I can go from being terrible to reasonable by being taught, I'd like to think you can teach charisma."" However, not everyone agrees. One such naysayer is psychologist Prof Richard Wiseman, who like Mr Reid is an expert on charisma. ""I have never tried to train it [charisma], but my guess is that it would be very tricky,"" says Prof Wiseman. Mr Reid says the Dalai Lama and Oprah Winfrey are both naturally charismatic ""Charisma depends on a unique mix of passion, an ability to transmit that passion to others, the ability to convey a message in a simple way that people get, etc. ""My guess is that it is very tricky to teach charisma without it sounding terrible."" While there are other such sceptics, Mr Reid continues to run charisma classes for a host of businesses including accountancy group Ernst & Young, and IT firms Sophos and Cap Gemini. He has also worked with the City of London Police and the UK Ministry of Defence. ""Generally it's people who are looking for a promotion, or looking to get to grips having stepped up in role. Or people who are running businesses and organisations, who are looking to influence and steer the people who work under them,"" he says. When it comes to who Mr Reid thinks are some of the world's most charismatic people, he is quick to cite Oprah Winfrey and the Dalai Lama. He says that Oprah has ""the whole package"", while the Dalai Lama is ""humble, approachable and warm"".

"Sir Roger Moore died on 23 May at the age of 89 Did Sir Roger Moore invent the Magnum? That was one of the more curious rumours to emerge about the British actorfollowing his death last month. According to journalist Chrissy Iley, the James Bond star once said in the 1960s his one wish would be for ice cream company Wall's to produce a choc ice on a stick. The company apparently sent him a version of his wish, and many years later they went on to launch the Magnum in 1989. The ice cream on a stick is now the world's top-selling ice cream brand. Wall's themselves claim to have no knowledge of his purported involvement,telling the Daily Mirror,externalit was no more than ""a brilliant story"". But if Sir Roger did have a hand in its making, he would not be the first celebrity to have come up with a great idea or marketable product. He's a singer, a talent show judge and an occasional actor. Yet Harry Connick Jr can also lay claim to be the inventor of a valuable tool for orchestras. While touring in the '90s, the popular crooner was so frustrated with his sheet music blowing away that he devised a machine capable of displaying music digitally. One of the unforeseen benefits was the way it allowed him to make adjustments to his band's sheet music without generating reams of amended paper. ""Oh man, it's made my life easier,""he told the New York Times in 2002,external. ""I can write a new score in the morning and everyone has it on his computer screen in the afternoon."" The Halloween star was one of cinema's most famous scream queens before going on to show her comedic chops in A Fish Called Wanda. But the 58-year-old star of Trading Places and True Lies also holds the patent for a modified nappy with a waterproof pocket for baby wipes. ""It's called Dipe 'N Wipe,""she revealed last year,externalin an interview on America's National Public Radio. ""Before you take off the diaper, you peel off the tape, reach in, pull out the wipes, undo the diaper, check out whatever's going on, take the wipes, boom, boom, boom, Bob's your uncle, done."" The billionaire mogul owed much of his fortune to the Hughes Rock Eater, a self-sharpening drill bit designed by his dad. Like father, like son? Kind of. Where Hughes Sr made machinery for oil wells, his offspring devoted his energies to a prototype push-up bra. Designed for 1943 western The Outlaw, the cantilevered garment was intended to enhance the already prodigious bust of leading lady Jane Russell. Russell, though, found the brassiere uncomfortable and insisted on using her own instead. The late pop legend was famous for many things, from popularising the moonwalk to owning a chimpanzee called Bubbles. What many don't know is that he helped create one of his most dazzling illusions - the gravity-defying, 45-degree lean he and his dancers pulled off while performing Smooth Criminal. The feat was achieved with the help of a specially designed shoe, with a heel that locked into a retractable peg built into the stage. Patented in 1992, the mechanism worked perfectly - apart from one time in 1996 when one of the heels came loose, sending Jackson flying. Drawings from Michael Jackson's patent application The actress born Hedwig Kiesler in Vienna in 1914 became a Hollywood star in the 1930s and '40s after appearing scandalously nude in German film Ecstasy. Her most lasting achievement, however, took place away from the silver screen. During World War Two, she helped invent a new means of guiding radio-controlled torpedoes that neutered the threat of their signals being jammed. The technology, known as frequency hopping, is still used today to operate cellular phones, GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi. The youngest of the Marx brothers spent much of his brief time on screen being overshadowed by flashier siblings Chico, Groucho and Harpo. Yet he achieved far greater success as an inventor of a wristwatch that monitored the pulse rate of heart patients and emitted an alarm when their heartbeats became irregular. Zeppo also founded Marman Products, an aerospace manufacturer that made the clamps that held the atomic bomb released on 9 August 1945 above the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Similar clamps would be employed in 1962 on the Friendship 7 mission that saw the lateJohn Glennbecome the first American to orbit the Earth. Famous for playing Catwoman in the 1960s Batman series, Julie Newmar proudly declares herselfon her website,externalto be ""an 11th generation American and a Mayflower descendant"". But there is no mention of the pantyhose she patented in the 1970s that were marketed under the name ""Nudemar"" and were said to offer ""cheeky derriere relief"". ""They make your derriere look like an apple instead of a ham sandwich,""she told People magazine,externalin 1977. The US actress and singer, now 83, also patented a brassiere with hidden straps.

"The Dutch victory was celebrated in paintings, many of which are on display in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam It was a battle that set a river on fire, caused panic across London, and left England nursing the wounds of one of its worst ever military defeats. Yet not many people today have heard of the Battle of Medway. Why? The whiff of gunsmoke, burning timber, pitch and tar. Warships ablaze, flames shooting through gunports, the smoke visible for miles along the north Kent coastline. This is the scene that would have greeted eyewitnesses following the Dutch raid along the River Medway in June 1667. Carried out over several days, it targeted the English fleet at Chatham, leaving a large section of the Royal Navy either captured or destroyed. There were few casualties, but the loss of the realm's largest warships brought humiliation to the country and damaged the personal reputation of King Charles II. It was the third in a trio of disasters to befall the nation following on from theGreat Plague,externalandGreat Fire of London,external. It created such panic in London that people sent their most valued possessions out of the city, fearing imminent occupation by Dutch forces. Yet despite this, the raid is little remembered in the UK today. A full programme of commemorations is being held over the coming weeks in an effort to raise awareness of its 350th anniversary. ""Everyone knows about the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London, but even people locally don't know about the Battle of Medway,"" said Richard Holdsworth, of the Historic Dockyard Chatham, where a series of commemorations are set to take place. The English forces were totally unprepared for the Dutch assault on Chatham. Dutch forces captured Sheerness fort and forced the Unity, a 42-gun guardship, to retreat towards Chatham. They then broke through a defensive iron chain on the Medway, allowing them to attack the fleet at its base. Finding the ships unmanned they attacked them again, leaving many ablaze. Most humiliating of all, the flagship Royal Charles - as well as the Unity - were captured and towed back to the Netherlands as a prize. Britannica - Anglo-Dutch-Wars,external The Historic Dockyard Chatham - Battle of Medway,external The cause of this English amnesia is perhaps due to the fact that they lost. As with most nations, the English do not like talking about their defeats, even 350 years on. Jeroen van der Vliet, a curator at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam which holds a large collection of objects related to the raid, said it was an important battle in the history of both nations. It was one of the last times England was invaded by an enemy force while in the Netherlands it is regarded as the ""high water mark of Dutch naval power"". Over the next fortnight, a series of events marking the anniversary will take place, including a dramatisation of the raid screened against the backdrop of Upnor Castle. An exhibition at the dockyard has gathered artefacts on loan from organisations including the National Maritime Museum, the Rijksmuseum and British Library. Full two-week programme of events,external The organisers hope it will help raise awareness of a battle that is arguably still relevant to our modern times. ""The problem is that our naval history inevitably focuses on the wars we won and the great heroes who fought in them,"" said historian Dr David Davies. ""By any criterion, it's one of the worst British defeats of all time. ""Personally, I'd say it's important to know about it in this country as an antidote to triumphalism - the idea that English, and then British, history has been a largely unbroken succession of victories. ""Nothing brings home that message more clearly than an attack which brought enemy ships right into the heart of the country's main naval base, and which saw the fleet flagship towed away as a trophy.""

"Beyonce needed seven air freighters just to get her stage kit to the UK What do Beyonce, the Rolling Stones, U2, AC/DC and Lady Gaga have in common? They all use one London-based specialist logistics firm to move their equipment round the globe. Last year, when Beyonce came to the UK with her Formation world tour it took seven Boeing 747 air freighters and a fleet of more than 70 trucks to get her stage set and other gear to the venues. And that didn't include the backstage staff, musicians, performers - or Beyonce herself. ""It was the biggest move we've ever done,"" says Martin Corr, the managing director of rock and roll transport firm Sound Moves. More firms are choosing to use air freight to get their goods to market, from diamonds to car parts, even though it is six times more expensive than sending them by sea - and rock superstars depend on it too. Heathrow is key for the firm's operations, says Sound Moves' Martin Corr The company is one of the biggest logistics firms in the music industry Whileair freight,externalmakes up just 1% of UK imports and exports in terms of tonnage shipped, it accounts for 40% of imports and exports in terms of their value. In the UK, Heathrow Airport is the dominant player in this trade with Â£101bn worth of goods passing through in a year. That's more than the value of goods passing through the country's biggest container ports, Felixstowe and Southampton, combined. Despite air cargo's expense, using planes instead of ships cuts down dramatically on the time it takes to get goods to market. ""We use Heathrow for most of our air freight. It is close to London, has great road connections, frequent flights and capacity,"" says Martin Corr. Sound Moves - based in west London close to Heathrow's cargo terminal - is one of the biggest logistics firms in the music industry with an annual turnover of Â£17m. Beyonce's stage show took up a lot of luggage space... ...and needed two airports to take the air freighters, and a fleet of trucks to unload it and move it Over the past 20 years they have worked with everyone from David Bowie and the Rolling Stones to Lady Gaga and now Beyonce. ""I left school with little or no qualifications, and was living with my parents lying on the sofa when my mum told me to go out and get a job,"" says Martin. ""Living in west London, Heathrow airport was the obvious place."" After working with a general freight company learning his trade, he then moved into the specialised business of moving rock groups and their equipment. In 1996 he started Sound Moves with two colleagues. ""Our first tour was for the Rolling Stones, we started with a bang!"" says Martin Sound Moves' warehouse is stacked with pre-packaged kit Martin himself is an AC/DC fan, and an Angus Young Gibson guitar signed by all the members of the band takes pride of place in his office. ""But no I don't play it, I never wanted to be a musician,"" he says. ""I am a freight-forwarder through and through - it's what I do."" Inside his warehouse, he points out the pallets of sound equipment and music merchandise ready to be shipped anywhere in the world. ""You can be in London on a Monday and doing a show in Los Angeles on a Wednesday or Thursday. Air freight can bring in significant earnings for airlines - even on their passenger flights ""We used to have a very seasonal business that was busy up to Christmas, and then from Easter to September with the summer festivals, but now artists tour 12 months a year."" Touring is what brings in the merchandise and ticket sales, he says, ""and that gets the guys on the road and that's where we come in, we support them on the road"". More stories from the BBC's global trade series looking at trade from an international perspective: The country losing out in the breakfast juice battle Why a $1.6bn car plant has been left to decay 'You don't have to be a squillionaire to buy art' The slimming pills that put me in hospital How Scottish salmon conquered the world Read more global trade series here. When Beyonce arrived last year, Sound Moves had to use Doncaster and Prestwick airports rather than Heathrow due to the London airport's lack of flexibility. ""It was a rush to get the aircraft unloaded. There's lots of draws on an artist's time. They still want to be seen by the public but in the shortest possible time,"" he says. Heathrow is already operating at near-maximum capacity The fact that Sound Moves couldn't use Heathrow for Beyonce's tour is significant, says Nick Platts, head of cargo at Heathrow Airport. ""I remember having chats with Martin over several days working out how we could help him, but we couldn't offer him the flexibility he needed."" The airport is working at almost maximum capacity and he says there is little room for further growth in cargo traffic. ""We are pushing traffic away from us. ""We need to expand and build a third runway just to satisfy the pent-up demand that is out there, let alone cope with future growth,"" he says. Both Heathrow and Gatwick are seeing an increase in the amount of air freight they handle - but Gatwick's growth rate is significantly higher. ""Our booming long-haul routes have driven a huge cargo increase,"" says Gatwick Airport's chief executive officer, Stewart Wingate. Perhaps surprisingly only a fraction of air cargo is actually carried in specialised air freighters. Most of it - 95% at Heathrow - is carried in the bellies of passenger aircraft and that can boost an airline's revenues between 5-20%. ""Take that away and the route may not be viable,"" says Heathrow's Nick Platts. Shipping still accounts for the bulk of goods traded ""The reason Heathrow is successful is not because we are moving people - it is because we are moving car parts, Scottish salmon, blood plasma products and other medicines, jewellery and precious stones. That is what air freight is good for,"" he says. Back at Sound Moves, Martin Corr is getting ready for U2's Joshua Tree tour. ""It's all planned and organised, they'll be coming into the UK by air over one weekend in July - it's a very tight schedule."" ""U2 are long-standing clients,"" says Martin Corr He's keen to dispel any idea that his industry is glamorous. ""We don't get to hang out at backstage parties or fly on private jets, that's not what we do. ""For us there is no day off until the tour is over."" Mind you, he does keep one bottle of champagne in his office fridge. ""Well it wouldn't be rock and roll without champagne, would it?"" he laughs.

"Donald Trump says he is a man of ""impeccable credentials"" President Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, Christopher Wray, has been described by a lawyers' ranking guide as a man who ""will give you straight answers without blowing smoke"". As a former assistant attorney general and head of the justice department's criminal division during the George W Bush administration, he pursued major cases of corporate fraud, including at energy giant Enron. If confirmed by the Senate, he will join the US federal investigation agency from King & Spalding, a top white collar law firm based in Washington DC and Atlanta, where he works as a criminal defence lawyer. Mr Trump said the Yale Law School graduate was a man of ""impeccable credentials"". But he could face tough questioning over a recent client - Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor and a man close to Mr Trump who headed his presidential transition team for a period. Christopher Wray represented him in the 2013 ""Bridgegate"" scandal. Two of Mr Christie's former aides were convicted of plotting to close lanes of traffic on a New York City bridge as revenge against a Democratic mayor who would not endorse the governor. Mr Christie denied any knowledge of the plan and was not charged. ""I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director,"" Mr Christie recently said, according to news site NorthJersey.com. Comey 'asked not to be alone with Trump' Seven big questions James Comey faces The Trump-Russia story - in 199 words Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Despite the Christie connection, the New York Times describes him as a ""safe, mainstream pick"" that is ""likely to allay the fears of FBI agents who worried that Mr Trump would try to weaken or politicise the FBI"". Mr Wray would take over the FBI from acting director Andrew McCabe, who was appointed on an interim basis after the president dramatically dismissed James Comey as director last month. He will take the reins of the agency as investigations continue into possible collusion between Trump campaign figures and Russia, which is accused of cyber-hacks to influence the result. James Comey had allegedly come under pressure from the US president to end the investigation into now sacked national security adviser Mike Flynn, and a special counsel is currently overseeing the FBI inquiry to protect its independence. Interestingly, Mr Wray has worked closely with all the major players before,on the Enron case,external. James Comey, former FBI director Robert Mueller (the special counsel) and Andrew Weissman,who is reported to have joined Mr Mueller's team,external, were all part of that effort 15 years ago. Given Christopher Wray has worked as a private lawyer specialising in white collar crime since 2005, lawmakers may question his counterterrorism and management experience, says the BBC's Barbara Plett-Usher in Washington. However she points out that they did want a career law enforcement professional rather than a politician.

"Al Jazeera launched in 1996, and soon attracted large audiences for its dynamic coverage of the Arab world Qatar's Al Jazeera media network has undoubtedly put the tiny Gulf state on the international map. It is the showpiece of the oil- and gas-rich nation's efforts to turn its financial largesse into outsized global influence and visibility, a two-decades long effort that includes its successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. But there are growing fears that the current diplomatic crisis in Qatar could place the high-profile network's future in jeopardy. Al Jazeera's broadcasting has caused controversy and drawn anger in various Arab states, not least in Egypt after the fall of Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring and the subsequent ousting of the elected president, Mohammed Morsi - a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. It has already been caught up in the current crisis, with its website blocked by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain in late May. Those nations all severed ties with Qatar on 5 June, accusing the country of supporting extremism. Saudi Arabia has closed Al Jazeera's offices and withdrawn its broadcast licence, saying it promotes terrorist ""plots"", supports Houthi militias that Saudi Arabia is fighting in Yemen, and has attempted to ""break the Saudi internal ranks"". Al Jazeera says it is ""not partisan to any ideology, group or government"". Qatar crisis: What's it about? Qatar travel: What does it mean for me? Qatar now finds itself isolated and vulnerable. It denies backing terrorist groups but will be pressed for concessions in order to resolve the tense situation, which left its international airport, a key hub, virtually deserted, and residents stocking up on food supplies. Al Jazeera has been accused by Egypt of being biased towards supporters of deposed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi BBC Arabic's Feras Kilani, in Doha, says sources tell him that media reforms will be a key condition placed on Qatar. Al Jazeera might not be closed but its editorial policies will have to change, he says, while the newer Qatari Al-Araby TV network, based in London, could be shuttered. ""For many years Al Jazeera has been a bone of contention for the Gulf states and Egypt, even before its heyday of rolling news coverage during the Arab Spring,"" writes the Emirati commentator Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi. He points out that in 2002, Saudi Arabia was angered over coverage of its peace plan for the Israel-Palestinian conflict and recalled its ambassador from Qatar as a result. An ambassador was only sent back in 2008. In 2014, Qatar promised to stop ""interfering"" in its Gulf neighbours' domestic politics to resolve another diplomatic spat that saw Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain withdraw their ambassadors This time around, Qatar's neighbours in the Gulf ""will demand the complete shuttering of the Al-Jazeera TV network before any mediation can take place"",Mr Qassemi predicts.,external That would have major consequences for the country's media ambitions, and for the network's 3,000-plus staff in Doha and around the world. Muslim Brotherhood: From rapid rise to sharp decline Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? Qatar's ""current crisis represents a new challenge and new circumstances"" for Al Jazeera, said Giles Trendle, the acting managing director of Al Jazeera English. ""But Al Jazeera remains committed to continue its pioneering and courageous journalism around the world in a professional, balanced and objective manner."" He added that ""only those who want to see one side of the story told"" would consider the network biased towards the Muslim Brotherhood or any other group. Arabic-language news channel launched in 1996, with Qatar's emir pledging to let journalists ""report the news as they see it"" Attracted large audiences - soon in the tens of millions - with dynamic coverage and criticism of Arab leaders Came to global prominence by airing video messages from Osama Bin Laden after 9/11 Set up English-language channel in 2006, which has won many awards and broadcasts to more than 100 countries ""If you follow coverage on both channels, you wouldn't believe this is the same brand,"" says Arab media expert Noha Mellor Spent huge sums to launch Al Jazeera America in 2013 to break into US market butthe channel foldedin 2016 Reported to have lost large audiences in Egypt after coverage of the Arab Spring. Al Jazeera Arabic and its local channel Mubasher Misr(later suspended)was accused of serving as mouthpiece of Muslim Brotherhood supporters, which it denied Qatar finds itself in a delicate position, says H A Hellyer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council. It is perceived as a ""loose cannon"" over coverage of the Muslim Brotherhood, he says, and its relationship with Saudi Arabia's chief rival for regional influence, Iran. US President Donald Trump, a key ally, has meanwhile praised Qatar's isolation. The country has little wiggle room, and any deal to bring Qatar's foreign policy closer in line with Saudi Arabia's will probably involve changes to its influential media networks - including Al Jazeera - and possibly the end of Al-Araby Al Jadeed (The New Arab), an outlet part of the same company as Al-Araby,Mr Hellyer writes,external. Three Al Jazeera journalists were convicted in Egypt of ""spreading false news"" in 2015, in a case that drew global condemnation David Roberts, a Qatar expert at King's College London, agrees that Al Jazeera will probably be on the Gulf countries and Egypt's ""shopping list"" of concessions they want from Qatar. ""But this is a negotiation and there is no certainty that Qatar would capitulate on this point,"" he told the BBC. He says that Al Jazeera Arabic, although it has toned down its coverage, ""is still prickly towards Egypt in particular"". But the channel did stop ""going after"" Saudi Arabia close to a decade ago - around the time the ambassador was returned. It has been reported that in late 2007, Qatar's government assured Saudi Arabia that its coverage of the kingdom would be mellowed as it moved to reset relations as Iran's nuclear ambitions grew. ""Orders were given not to tackle any Saudi issue without referring to the higher management,"" a newsroom employeetold the New York Times,external. ""All dissident voices disappeared from our screens."" Others aren't convinced that the end of Al Jazeera will be a specific demand made of Qatar, but agree its foreign policy will undoubtedly have to change if it wants to bring an end to its current isolation. This means changes to the tone and coverage of government-funded media networks like Al Jazeera would follow, says Professor Noha Mellor, a pan-Arab media expert at the University of Bedfordshire. ""They might just tone down their media discourse in line with their foreign policy, because [Qatar's] foreign policy will have to tone down, in style and ambition."" Al Jazeera's Arabic channel was strongly supportive of the 2011 Arab uprisings and it has veered towards an overtly pro-Islamist line amid the upheavals that have engulfed the region since. With that shift, the channel has come to be perceived as a pillar of Qatar's foreign policy and a reflection of its ambitions in a changing Arab world. Al Jazeera was at the forefront of tensions that strained relations between Egypt and Qatar after the toppling of Mohammed Morsi in 2013. In Syria and Iraq, Al Jazeera's coverage of the so-called Islamic State (IS) militant group has differed from other outlets. In referring to the group, Al Jazeera uses the expression ""the state organisation"", which is not very far removed from what IS calls itself, as opposed to the pejorative Arabic acronym ""Daesh"" used by Saudi media, including Al Jazeera competitor Al-Arabiya. In 2015, Al Jazeera used the positive term ""Sunni revolutionaries"" to refer to Sunni fighters, including IS militants, who took control of Iraq's key city of Mosul.

"Christopher Hutcheson admitted plotting to steal information from the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's father-in-law has been jailed for six months for conspiring to hack a computer system relating to the celebrity chef's business interests. Christopher Hutcheson, 68, and his sons Adam, 46, and Christopher, 37, admitted plotting to unlawfully access Gordon Ramsay Holdings Limited's system. The two younger men were both given four month jail terms, suspended for two years, at the Old Bailey. The judge described the conspiracy as ""unattractive and unedifying"". Gordon and Tana Ramsay have been married since 1996 The court heard Hutcheson senior was involved in a public falling out with Mr Ramsay during which he tried to break into the chef's emails and find financial details and other information. Having been sacked as CEO of Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd, he conspired with his sons to access company systems almost 2,000 times between 23 October 2010 and 31 March 2011. The Old Bailey was told some of the material might have given the Hutchesons the upper hand during a legal battle heard at the High Court. Stories about a ""hair transplant"" and a ""fishing trip"" also later appeared in the newspapers. After their actions were discovered, Hutcheson senior sent an email to his son saying: ""Guess we have been rumbled. Bit late though."" Adam Hutcheson and his brother Chris were given four month jail terms, suspended for two years Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC told the court the hack was intended ""to obtain material that might embarrass Mr Ramsay or be useful in the ongoing dispute with him"". He said items including photos were ""provided to the press which led to considerable intrusion into the privacy of the family"". But Hutcheson senior's lawyer Michael Borrelli said his client denied leaking or authorising the leaking of material to the papers. He also said Hutcheson senior had already paid the chef more than Â£1m in damages and legal costs, plus his own legal fees of around Â£1m from the civil case. Neither Gordon Ramsay or his wife Tana were in court to hear the sentencing. Mr Christopher said since the civil case had ended the families had reconciled and the pair did not support the criminal prosecution. The judge said in spite of this, the seriousness of the crime meant immediate imprisonment was appropriate. Hutcheson senior, of Earlsfield, Hutcheson junior, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, and Adam Hutcheson, from Sevenoaks, in Kent, all previously admitted conspiring to cause a computer to access programmes and data without authority in April.

"Andy Cunningham played handyman Simon Bodger Andy Cunningham, the creator of children's TV show Bodger and Badger, has died from cancer at the age of 67. He also starred in the BBC show, in which he played handyman Simon Bodger and provided the voice for the beret-wearing badger that loved mashed potato. Mr Cunningham died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton on Monday. His sister Tessa said he ""lived to be loved and to make people laugh, starting with me, his little sister"". Mr Cunningham, who read English at Cambridge, gave comedian Julian Clary his first job when he was writing and directing for the Covent Garden Community Theatre Group, and he worked as a puppeteer in the Star Wars film Return of the Jedi. ""He had a quicksilver brain, a rebellious attitude, boundless compassion particularly for the underdog, unstinting levels of generosity and, of course, a passion for mashed potato,"" Ms Cunningham said. ""I adored him and, long before he found fame, was immensely proud to have the funniest, cleverest big brother in the universe."" Mr Cunningham's former partner and close friend Jane Bassett was with him when he died, along with his sister and nieces. Ms Bassett played Mousey in Bodger and Badger, which ran on the BBC from 1989 to 1999. Tributes have been paid on Twitter to Mr Cunningham.

"This video can not be played People were evacuated from the parliament building Twin attacks on the Iranian parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in the capital, Tehran, have killed at least 12 people and injured many more. After hours of intermittent gunfire, officials said both incidents were over and the attackers were dead. The Islamic State (IS) group has said it carried out the attacks, which would be a first in Iran. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards accused Saudi Arabia and the US of being behind the attacks. ""This terrorist action, coming one week after the meeting of the president of the United States with the leader of the one of the region's reactionary governments (Saudi Arabia)... shows they are involved in this savage action,"" it said in a statement. The US state department condemned the attack, saying ""the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful civilised world"". President Hassan Rouhani said Iran's message was that ""terrorism is a global problem"", and he called for ""regional and international co-operation and unity"". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attacks would have ""no effect"" on the country. In a statement, IS warned of further attacks against Iran's Shia Muslim majority. Gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs entered the parliament on Wednesday morning. Images from the scene showed a major security operation as forces surrounded the building. Iran attacks will boost flagging IS morale #PrayforTehran: Solidarity after attacks Heavy gunfire could be heard. Iranian authorities denied that there had been a hostage situation inside the parliament building. Reports said the gunmen had entered parliament via a public entrance, dressed as women. Security forces surrounded the parliament, and TV footage showed people, including children, escaping from windows. Iranian media later reported that four attackers inside the parliament building had been killed by security forces. At the mausoleum in southern Tehran, which is dedicated to the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, attackers began their assault by opening fire. The governor of Tehran said one attacker there had detonated a suicide vest and another had been killed by security forces, state broadcaster Irib reports. Iran attacks: As it happened Images from the scene showed grenades and magazines for automatic weapons, apparently recovered from the body of an attacker. The suicide attacker was a woman, reports suggested. This image, posted by Fars News, shows an explosion taking place outside the mausoleum It is not clear whether the death toll of 12 includes the attackers, or whether the victims were killed at both incidents or solely at the parliament. About 40 people were injured in the two attacks, according to emergency services chief Pir Hossein Kolivand. Iranian officials say they managed to foil a third attack. IS said it had carried out the attack and later posted a video which showed what it claimed was footage from inside the parliament building. A voice is heard saying, in Arabic: ""We're not going anywhere. We're staying forever."" An Iranian MP later confirmed that the video showed his office and one of his employees lying dead. BBC Persian's Jenny Norton says that despite Iran's active involvement in fighting IS in both Iraq and Syria, the Sunni group has not until now carried out any attacks inside Iran, and appears to have little support in this predominantly Shia country. Iranian forces take cover as they surround the parliament building However, our analyst says, in recent months the group has stepped up its Farsi-language propaganda efforts - targeting Iran's restive Sunni minority. An IS documentary-style video in March featured militants who were introduced as Iranian fighters in IS ranks based in Iraq. Speaking in Farsi, they denounced the Iranian government and the religious establishment, including the country's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian intelligence agencies claim to have foiled a number of IS-inspired plots. But by mounting a successful attack, IS could claim a major coup against a traditional foe that other Sunni jihadist groups, including its rival al-Qaeda, have failed to target in the past. This is the most serious terrorist violence in Tehran since the turbulent early years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It will come as a huge shock to ordinary Iranians, who have got used to living in a country which is generally far more stable and safe than most of its neighbours, our analyst says. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani downplayed the events, describing them as a ""minor issue"". However, officials announced a nationwide state of emergency in response to the attacks. Later, the Revolutionary Guards said the fact that IS had claimed the attacks ""proved"" that Saudi Arabia was behind them. ""This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the US President [Donald Trump] and the [Saudi] backward leaders who support terrorists,"" a statement said. Iran's ally Russia condemned the attacks. ""The continuation of a series of terror attacks again underlines the need for co-ordinated actions in the fight against terror and IS,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. France also condemned the attacks, but some Western countries have appeared slow to react. Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.

"When choosing a password, we're generally advised to use one upper case letter, an unusual character and a number. Singer Grimes and tech billionaire Elon Musk have gone one step further and applied these rules to choosing a baby name. The couple have apparentlynamed their first child togetherX Ã A-12 Musk. Musk revealed the name via Twitter on Wednesday - although nobody's quite sure if he's being serious or just trolling us all. If it's real, it's not entirely clear how it should be pronounced, or indeed what it means. Grimes has since stepped in to try to explain. Allow Twitter content?

Grimes and Musk may have won a fierce battle to be the celebrity couple with the most unusual name for their child, but they have plenty of competition. Here are eight other examples. ""A is for Apple"" is a very familiar phrase indeed to parents trying to teach their kids the alphabet, but it also proved inspirational to Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow. The pair, who""consciously uncoupled""in 2014, have a 15-year-old daughter by the name of Apple. The name caused Robbie Williams to get into a bit of a verbal tangle during one encounter with the family, as hetold Graham Norton,externalin 2012. During a party he was throwing, the singer asked Paltrow at the buffet: ""Does Melon want some Apple?"" Beyonce and Jay-Z made headlines in 2012 when they named their first born daughter Blue Ivy Carter. They eventried to trademarkthe name, but the rights had already been granted to Boston-based wedding firm Blue Ivy Events. There's a theory that Ivy was chosen because of the couple's fondness for the number four, which is IV in Roman numerals. Blue was actually a more common name at one stage - famous Blues include author Blue Balliett, born in 1955, and NBA player Blue Edwards, born 1965, though both are nicknames. And while Beyonce and Jay-Z may have given the name a new lease of life, they weren't the first celebrity couple to choose the colourful name for their offspring. U2's The Edge chose the name Blue Angel for his daughter, who is now 31. ""You know who gives kids a bad name? Posh and Becks."" That joke won comedian Stewart Francis the title offunniest joke at the Edinburgh Fringein 2012. And you can see his point - the couple's unusual choices have included Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz for their sons and Harper Seven for their daughter. Brooklyn in particular was singled out by Katie Hopkins as an example of a children's name she really disliked in herfamous This Morning interview,externalon the subject in 2013. Brooklyn is far from the only celebrity child to be named after a geographical location. We'd be here all day if we started listing the celebrities who name their children after countries and capitals, so let's just single out a couple of examples. Shakira welcomed the first of her two sons with FC Barcelona player Gerard Pique in 2013, whom the couple named Milan. Then there's Michael Jackson's daughter Paris, Bono's daughter Memphis, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger's daughter Ireland and Alicia Keys's son Egypt. Ramsgate is still available, should any stars out there still be on the lookout. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their first baby in 2013. Fans speculated for months about what the pair would name their first-born, bearing in mind that the child would probably take Kanye's surname. The couple delivered a name better than anyone could have hoped for - North. Which makes their daughter's full name North West. News of the name was particularly welcomed by those in Lancashire. Kardashian's motherKris Jenner said,externalafter the birth: ""The way Kim explained it to me was North means 'highest power', and she says that North is [Kim and Kanye's] highest point together. And I thought that was really sweet."" The Wests followed it up by naming their next three children Saint, Chicago and Psalm. Bear may not be too out of the ordinary - but it is certainly a name you remember. And, as Liam explained in 2017, that's precisely why he and Cheryl chose it, although not without a bit of debate. ""I wanted a more traditional name and she wanted a name that was more unusual,"" he said. ""And the reason she chose Bear in the end was because Bear is a name that when you leave a room, you won't forget. And I like that."" It probably also helps that Liam is a big fan of Bear Grylls, who hedescribed,externalas ""a boss"" on Twitter after the birth. Princess may be a term of endearment many parents use for their daughter, but fewer choose it as an actual name.

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Comey's testimony Fired FBI director James Comey told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president, US media report. It is one of a slew of allegations relating to Donald Trump and an investigation into alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 US election. It comes ahead of the former FBI chief's testimony to the Senate on Thursday. ""I wish him luck,"" Mr Trump said of Mr Comey, as he met with Republicans. Separately, Mr Sessions himself has offered to resign, reports said. The relationship between the attorney general and the president has grown increasingly tense since Mr Sessions recused himself from any involvement in the Russia investigation, articles in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and Politico said. Mr Trump has refused the resignation offer, they reported. Mr Comey's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee is set to grip Washington, as he is likely to be asked about his private discussions with Mr Trump regarding the investigation and his campaign, and the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Seven big questions James Comey faces The Trump-Russia story - in 199 words Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake In another report likely to raise tensions at the White House, the Washington Postsays,externalMr Trump had asked Dan Coats, his Director of National Intelligence, to try to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into Mr Flynn. Mr Coatshimself gave evidence to the committeeon Wednesday. This video can not be played How Michael Flynn became entangled in Russia probe The claim that Mr Comey told Mr Sessions he did not want to be left alone again with the president was published bythe New York Times,externalandthe Associated Press,external. The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, the NYT said. Mr Comey believed the attorney general should protect the FBI from White House influence, officials told the paper. The White House shocked Washington by announcing on 9 May that Mr Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"". James Comey is due to be grilled by Senators on Thursday It was only the second time the head of the FBI had been dismissed. While the White House said Mr Comey's handling of the inquiry into defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails was the reason for his dismissal, Mr Trump has subsequently said Mr Comey ""wasn't doing a good job"" and was ""a showboat"". Comey fired: The shifting explanations Did Trump fire Comey as part of a cover-up? Mr Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday will be his first public comments since he was ignominiously pushed from office. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the president would have a ""very, very busy day"" on Thursday. There has been speculation that Mr Trump would offer a live commentary on Mr Comey's testimony via Twitter.

"Queensland woman Sara Zelenak is missing, her family says Two Australians were killed in the London Bridge terror attack, the government in Canberra has said. South Australian nurse Kirsty Boden, 28, died while running towards danger to help victims on the bridge, her family said. Nanny Sara Zelenak was the other Australian to die. In a statement, the family of the 21-year-old Queenslander said they were ""deeply saddened at the tragic loss of our beautiful daughter and sister"". They added: ""Sara's family and friends are devastated."" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she was ""deeply saddened"" to confirm that two Australians had been killed. ""The Australian government has remained in close contact with the families who have requested privacy,"" she said on Wednesday. Victims of the attack What we know so far Ms Boden was from a town called Loxton, about 250km (155 miles) from Adelaide, and had been working in the UK as a senior staff nurse. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that she had been killed by ""cowardly, vicious terrorists"". Her family said she was adored by her family, friends and boyfriend. Kirsty Boden was killed trying to help other victims, her family said ""She was the most outgoing, kind and generous person who loved to help people,"" their statement said. ""We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life. Kirsty - we love you and we will miss you dearly."" Ms Zelenak, from Brisbane, was working as an au pair in London. Mr Turnbull said she was seen fleeing from the knifemen during the attack. Her aunt described her niece as ""the girl next door, very special and a kindred spirit"". She had reportedly been due to babysit on Saturday night, but the child's grandmother stepped in, which meant she could go out with friends. Her father on Facebook posted a video of his daughter and commented: ""I really miss that funny little laugh."" Friend Elle Bishop said she would ""find solace in the fact that the hate that saw you taken from us, you have never felt inside, making you a remarkable young woman"". Two more Australians, Candice Hedge from Brisbane and Andrew Morrison from Darwin, were among the injured.

"Christopher Wray served in the Bush administration 2003-05 US President Donald Trump has said he is nominating lawyer Christopher Wray to become the new director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The post has been empty for the past month after Mr Trump fired James Comey from the key law enforcement role. Mr Wray served under George W Bush as an assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005. Mr Trump described Mr Wray as ""a man of impeccable credentials"" ina tweet,externalon Wednesday. The appointment will have to be approved by the Senate. Who is Trump's FBI pick Christopher Wray? Intelligence boss 'not pressed' by Trump President Trump tweeted the announcement The Yale Law School graduate is currently a partner at King & Spalding law firm in its offices in Washington DC and Atlanta. While at the Department of Justice (DOJ), he headed the criminal division, overseeing major corporate fraud scandals, including thecrisis at energy giant Enron,external. ""Mr Wray was also integral to the DOJ's response to the 9/11 attacks and played a key role in the oversight of legal and operational actions in the continuing war on terrorism,"" says the King & Spalding website. Comey 'asked not to be alone with Trump' Seven big questions James Comey faces The Trump-Russia story - in 199 words Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake He was also a lawyer representing New Jersey Governor - and Trump ally - Chris Christie after a 2013 scandal dubbed Bridgegate. Two of Mr Christie's former aides were convicted of plotting to close lanes of traffic on a New York City bridge as revenge against a Democratic mayor who did not endorse the governor. Mr Christie denied any knowledge of the plan and was not charged. ""I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director,"" Mr Christie said last week, according to news site NorthJersey.com. The New York Times described,externalMr Wray as a ""safe, mainstream pick"" after the president had said he might have opted to appoint a politician for the role. The post has historically been non-political. Christopher Wray seems tough enough to be FBI director - he's been a federal prosecutor and worked for the justice department after the 2001 terror attacks. He also has two degrees from Yale (undergraduate and law). Most importantly, though, the president trusts him. Democrats on the Hill, however, said they were not sure about Mr Wray. They said they were still learning about his background. They're also worried about the timing of the announcement, which some see as a way to distract people from the James Comey hearing. Christopher Wray seems like a strong candidate but many Democrats have been unhappy with the way the president has treated Mr Comey and the bureau - and could slow down Mr Wray's appointment to get their message across. President Trump's nomination decision comes the day before Mr Comey is set to testify before the Senate intelligence committee. James Comey, He is expected to be asked about private discussions with Mr Trump regarding the investigation into alleged links between the president's administration and Russia. He will give a public testimony, which will be broadcast on TV and online, and he will also answer ""sensitive"" questions from senators in a private hearing. ""I wish him luck,"" Mr Trump said of Mr Comey, as he met Republicans on Wednesday. US media has reported that Mr Comey told Attorney General Jeff Sessionsthat he did not want to be left alone with the presidentwhen they met. The Washington Post has also reported,externalthat the president had asked Dan Coats, his director of national intelligence, to try to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who resigned in February following concern about his Kremlin contacts. Mr Coats will give evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing later on Wednesday. Mr Comey was fired in early May. It was only the second time the head of the FBI had been dismissed.

"This video can not be played People were evacuated from the parliament building Twin attacks on the Iranian parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in the capital, Tehran, have killed at least 12 people and injured many more. After hours of intermittent gunfire, officials said both incidents were over and the attackers were dead. The Islamic State (IS) group has said it carried out the attacks, which would be a first in Iran. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards accused Saudi Arabia and the US of being behind the attacks. ""This terrorist action, coming one week after the meeting of the president of the United States with the leader of the one of the region's reactionary governments (Saudi Arabia)... shows they are involved in this savage action,"" it said in a statement. The US state department condemned the attack, saying ""the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful civilised world"". President Hassan Rouhani said Iran's message was that ""terrorism is a global problem"", and he called for ""regional and international co-operation and unity"". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attacks would have ""no effect"" on the country. In a statement, IS warned of further attacks against Iran's Shia Muslim majority. Gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs entered the parliament on Wednesday morning. Images from the scene showed a major security operation as forces surrounded the building. Iran attacks will boost flagging IS morale #PrayforTehran: Solidarity after attacks Heavy gunfire could be heard. Iranian authorities denied that there had been a hostage situation inside the parliament building. Reports said the gunmen had entered parliament via a public entrance, dressed as women. Security forces surrounded the parliament, and TV footage showed people, including children, escaping from windows. Iranian media later reported that four attackers inside the parliament building had been killed by security forces. At the mausoleum in southern Tehran, which is dedicated to the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, attackers began their assault by opening fire. The governor of Tehran said one attacker there had detonated a suicide vest and another had been killed by security forces, state broadcaster Irib reports. Iran attacks: As it happened Images from the scene showed grenades and magazines for automatic weapons, apparently recovered from the body of an attacker. The suicide attacker was a woman, reports suggested. This image, posted by Fars News, shows an explosion taking place outside the mausoleum It is not clear whether the death toll of 12 includes the attackers, or whether the victims were killed at both incidents or solely at the parliament. About 40 people were injured in the two attacks, according to emergency services chief Pir Hossein Kolivand. Iranian officials say they managed to foil a third attack. IS said it had carried out the attack and later posted a video which showed what it claimed was footage from inside the parliament building. A voice is heard saying, in Arabic: ""We're not going anywhere. We're staying forever."" An Iranian MP later confirmed that the video showed his office and one of his employees lying dead. BBC Persian's Jenny Norton says that despite Iran's active involvement in fighting IS in both Iraq and Syria, the Sunni group has not until now carried out any attacks inside Iran, and appears to have little support in this predominantly Shia country. Iranian forces take cover as they surround the parliament building However, our analyst says, in recent months the group has stepped up its Farsi-language propaganda efforts - targeting Iran's restive Sunni minority. An IS documentary-style video in March featured militants who were introduced as Iranian fighters in IS ranks based in Iraq. Speaking in Farsi, they denounced the Iranian government and the religious establishment, including the country's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian intelligence agencies claim to have foiled a number of IS-inspired plots. But by mounting a successful attack, IS could claim a major coup against a traditional foe that other Sunni jihadist groups, including its rival al-Qaeda, have failed to target in the past. This is the most serious terrorist violence in Tehran since the turbulent early years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It will come as a huge shock to ordinary Iranians, who have got used to living in a country which is generally far more stable and safe than most of its neighbours, our analyst says. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani downplayed the events, describing them as a ""minor issue"". However, officials announced a nationwide state of emergency in response to the attacks. Later, the Revolutionary Guards said the fact that IS had claimed the attacks ""proved"" that Saudi Arabia was behind them. ""This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the US President [Donald Trump] and the [Saudi] backward leaders who support terrorists,"" a statement said. Iran's ally Russia condemned the attacks. ""The continuation of a series of terror attacks again underlines the need for co-ordinated actions in the fight against terror and IS,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. France also condemned the attacks, but some Western countries have appeared slow to react. Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.

"Australian Sara Zelenak was working in London The family of London attack victim Sara Zelenak have paid tribute to their ""beautiful daughter and sister,"" as police say the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight. Relatives of the 21-year-old Australian, an au pair, said they were ""deeply saddened at the tragic loss"". All of those who died have now been named. Earlier, police searching for French national Xavier Thomas, 45, said they had recovered a body from the Thames. Scotland Yard said the body was pulled from the river near Limehouse at 19:44 BST on Tuesday. Xavier Thomas was listed as missing after being on London Bridge at the time of the attack Mr Thomas's next of kin have been told, police said, but formal identification has not yet taken place. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Spain said Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, who died defending a woman with his skateboard, should be given a posthumous award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. Mr EcheverrÃ­a was from Madridand was working for HSBC bank in London. Another victim was named as Sebastien Belanger, from France. Mr Belanger worked at the Coq d'Argent near Bank. He had been watching the Champions League final football match with friends at a nearby pub before the attack. Read more about the victims of the attack London attack: What we know so far Who were the attackers? Analysis: What new powers could be used? Full story: London Bridge attack The others killed in the attack have been named as Australian Kirsty Boden, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, from Hackney, London, and French national Alexandre Pigeard. NHS England said 29 patients remain in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the London Bridge attackers Police have named Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man who lived in east London, Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, and Rachid Redouane, 30, who also lived in Barking, as the men who carried out the attack. They drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market. Redouane's ex-wife, Charisse O'Leary,said she was ""deeply shocked, saddened and numbed""by his actions. ""My thoughts and efforts now are with trying to bring up my daughter with the knowledge that, someday, I will have to try and explain to her why her father did what he did."" Speaking at her house in Bologna, Italy,Zaghba's mother told the BBCshe believed her son was radicalised in the UK. She said he was under surveillance when he was in Italy and questioned why this was not the case in the UK. An Italian police source confirmed to the BBC that Zaghba had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries, including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped Zaghba at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. The BBC understands he was not prosecuted but was listed on the Schengen Information System, an EU-wide database which includes details of potential suspects. In pictures: Tributes to victims How are UK extremists radicalised? When Zaghba entered Britain, staff at passport control should automatically have been alerted by the Schengen system, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. ""One unconfirmed report suggests that did happen, apparently when Zaghba arrived at Stansted Airport in January - but that border staff still let him in,"" he said. Police have made an arrest at a house in Ilford, east London A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terror offences as detectives raided an address in Ilford, east London, in the early hours of Wednesday. On Wednesday night, detectives arrested two more men in Ilford - aged 27 and 29 - on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts. On Tuesday a 27-year-old man was arrested in Barking on Tuesday in connection with the investigation. A man was arrested in Limerick, in the Irish Republic, on Tuesday over the discovery of ID documents in Redouane's name. He was later released without charge. A second man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Tuesday evening, with the Garda saying it was also related to Redouane. He is being held in Wexford. Islamic scholar reported London attacker.

Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.

"Lauren Child said children's books were seen as ""a poor relation"" to adult literature Boys don't like reading books that have girls as the main characters - and that ""makes it harder for girls to be equal"", says the new Children's Laureate Lauren Child. Child, who wrote the Charlie and Lola and Clarice Bean series, was speaking after her appointment was announced in Hull. She is the 10th person to be the official champion of children's books. Child will hold the title for two years and takes over fromChris Riddell. While girls are happier to read about boys, she is worried about why most boys are more reluctant to read books or watch films about girls. ""I don't know if it's just in our culture, or whether it's a boy thing, that they find it very hard to pick up a book or go to a film if a girl is the central character,"" she told BBC News. ""I don't know where that comes from but it worries me because it makes it harder for girls to be equal."" Child also illustrates her characters like Charlie and Lola (left) and Clarice Bean Sales figures back up the notion that books with girls as main characters are less popular than those about boys, she said. Child has just published the last Ruby Redfort book. Ruby began as a character in her Clarice Bean series, but Child decided to give the fictional spy her own spin-offs after getting ""a lot of letters from girls - and some from boys"". She said: ""You could quite easily change Ruby's name to a boy's name and just changing a few details in the book and it would work just the same. ""But still parents will come up to me and say, 'Do you write books for boys as well?' Thisisa book for boys. We do still have those problems. It does concern me."" Girl Power: How can books empower young girls? Teaching girls to rebel Child will receive a Â£15,000 bursary The Children's Laureate role is intended to ""promote and encourage children's interest in books, reading and writing"". But what have others actually done with the position? Read more Another problem is the fact there are so few Asian and black children on the covers of picture books and on screen, she said. ""They're not present enough. And if they don't feel they're represented in a book, or a film, or a TV programme, then how can they feel an equal part of society? ""That really is important. I see it more and more because I have a daughter adopted from Mongolia and we're watching all kinds of programmes and the characters are mainly white Caucasian. ""It's that look - it's very often long blonde hair, blue eyes. She's not seeing herself. And very often, if you do see a child, it's about an issue. It's not about just being a child."" Child was appointed Waterstones Children's Laureate at a ceremony in Hull, which is UK City of Culture 2017. The Laureate is chosen by a panel of judges from the book world, who also consider names put forward by children who can vote online. The author said she wanted to use the position to ""shine a light on children's books and illustration"", which she said is always seen as ""a poor relation"" to adult literature. She also voiced concerns about library closures. Child said: ""There are many children who don't have access to books and they don't have access to books in their schools because a lot of schools don't have libraries. ""If we value literacy as much as we say we do and as much as we should, then children need that opportunity. So I worry about the haves and have-nots and giving children the opportunity to try things out.""

"Australian Sara Zelenak was working in London The family of London attack victim Sara Zelenak have paid tribute to their ""beautiful daughter and sister,"" as police say the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight. Relatives of the 21-year-old Australian, an au pair, said they were ""deeply saddened at the tragic loss"". All of those who died have now been named. Earlier, police searching for French national Xavier Thomas, 45, said they had recovered a body from the Thames. Scotland Yard said the body was pulled from the river near Limehouse at 19:44 BST on Tuesday. Xavier Thomas was listed as missing after being on London Bridge at the time of the attack Mr Thomas's next of kin have been told, police said, but formal identification has not yet taken place. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Spain said Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, who died defending a woman with his skateboard, should be given a posthumous award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. Mr EcheverrÃ­a was from Madridand was working for HSBC bank in London. Another victim was named as Sebastien Belanger, from France. Mr Belanger worked at the Coq d'Argent near Bank. He had been watching the Champions League final football match with friends at a nearby pub before the attack. Read more about the victims of the attack London attack: What we know so far Who were the attackers? Analysis: What new powers could be used? Full story: London Bridge attack The others killed in the attack have been named as Australian Kirsty Boden, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, from Hackney, London, and French national Alexandre Pigeard. NHS England said 29 patients remain in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the London Bridge attackers Police have named Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man who lived in east London, Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, and Rachid Redouane, 30, who also lived in Barking, as the men who carried out the attack. They drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market. Redouane's ex-wife, Charisse O'Leary,said she was ""deeply shocked, saddened and numbed""by his actions. ""My thoughts and efforts now are with trying to bring up my daughter with the knowledge that, someday, I will have to try and explain to her why her father did what he did."" Speaking at her house in Bologna, Italy,Zaghba's mother told the BBCshe believed her son was radicalised in the UK. She said he was under surveillance when he was in Italy and questioned why this was not the case in the UK. An Italian police source confirmed to the BBC that Zaghba had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries, including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped Zaghba at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. The BBC understands he was not prosecuted but was listed on the Schengen Information System, an EU-wide database which includes details of potential suspects. In pictures: Tributes to victims How are UK extremists radicalised? When Zaghba entered Britain, staff at passport control should automatically have been alerted by the Schengen system, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. ""One unconfirmed report suggests that did happen, apparently when Zaghba arrived at Stansted Airport in January - but that border staff still let him in,"" he said. Police have made an arrest at a house in Ilford, east London A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terror offences as detectives raided an address in Ilford, east London, in the early hours of Wednesday. On Wednesday night, detectives arrested two more men in Ilford - aged 27 and 29 - on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts. On Tuesday a 27-year-old man was arrested in Barking on Tuesday in connection with the investigation. A man was arrested in Limerick, in the Irish Republic, on Tuesday over the discovery of ID documents in Redouane's name. He was later released without charge. A second man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Tuesday evening, with the Garda saying it was also related to Redouane. He is being held in Wexford. Islamic scholar reported London attacker.

"The woman was attacked in Hermon Hill A nursery school worker has been taken to hospital with a ""slash wound"" after reports of a stabbing in east London, police have said. The victim, who is in her 30s, was attacked in Hermon Hill, Wanstead, on her way to work at about 09:30 BST. Nursery manager Karrien Stevens said the woman told her she was slashed by three Asian women dressed in black. Counter-terrorism police have been informed but are not treating it as a terrorist incident. Ms Stevens, who runs Little Diamonds nursery in Hermon Hill, said the woman told her that she was attacked while on her way to work from Wanstead High Street. The attackers slashed her arm from the wrist upwards before running off down the street, she said, and shouted out ""something to do with Allah and the Koran"". The victim's injuries are not life threatening but she was taken to an east London hospital as a precaution, the Metropolitan Police said. In a statement, the force added: ""The suspects fled the scene prior to police arrival in an unknown direction. ""No arrests have been made. Enquiries continue.

"Key questions about general election results, and how the BBC reports them, are answered below. By winning more seats in the House of Commons than all the other parties put together. If a party does that, it has what is known as amajority. There are 650 seats available, which means 326 seats are needed to win an overall majority. However, an effective majority could be smaller as the Speaker and his deputies, although MPs, do not usually vote. Also, Sinn Fein, which won four seats in Northern Ireland in 2015, traditionally refuses to swear allegiance to the Queen, and is not entitled to vote as a consequence. Also called aseat, in a general election, this is where the political battles are fought. Voters in each constituency choose just one MP. No. But a reduction in the number of MPs from650 to 600and changes to some constituency boundaries was proposed in September 2016 and is now under public consultation. Final proposals are expected to be made in 2018. The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election as Speaker in his, or her, constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker however some parties, such as UKIP and the Green Party do. The current Speaker,John Bercow, is standing for election in Buckingham. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Mr Bercow is no longer a member of the Conservative Party as he was before his election to the role (by parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Mr Bercow's seat is regarded as being a Conservative constituency, as he won it for the party in 1997, 2001 and 2005 before being elected speaker. If Mr Bercow wins again, the result inBuckinghamwill be described as ""Speaker hold"" - and his seat will be added to the Conservative total. The BBC follows the same principle at every general election. What matters most is how many ""seats"" each party wins, and for things to change political parties need to win seats from each other. Because winning seats from each other is so important, a special language is used to show this. Seats that are won can mainly fall into two categories:holdorgain. Hold:If a party wins a seat that it won in 2015, this is described as a ""hold"" Gain:If a party wins a seat that it did not win in 2015, this is called a ""gain"" Win:Where there has been a by-election since the 2015 election and that by-election resulted in a different party gaining the seat compared with the general election result Clearly these are really important to the opposition parties. If they are to form a new government, they need to win seats from the existing government and other parties to make ""gains"", while they retain or ""hold"" all the seats they had last time. By-elections are one-off elections in seats where, for example, the sitting MP has stood down or died.  There have been 10 by-elections since 2015. When the BBC reports general election results, all of these interim by-elections are ignored, to allow for straightforward comparison with 2015's seats. The BBC uses slightly different terminology to describe results where seats have changed hands in by-elections. For example:  in 2016 Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney wonRichmond Parkfrom Conservative Zac Goldsmith. If Zac Goldsmith regains the seat on 8 June, the result will be described as a ""Conservative Win"". It will not appear as a net gain in the Conservatives' overall UK seat tally. However, if an entirely different party wins a by-election seat, that result will be described as a ""gain"" from whichever party won the seat in 2015. The BBC adopts this policy in recognition of the very particular circumstances which often shape the outcome of by-elections. Comparing seat change from 2015 represents a fairer way of representing how the political expression of voters has altered from general election to general election. To win an election, a party must win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government.  To do that simply one party needs to get one more seat than all the others added together. That is called anoverall majority, but in the shorthand language of elections it is just called amajority. There are 650 seats in Parliament, so to get one more than everyone else put together a party must get 326 or more to get a ""majority"". Of course it makes things much easier for a government if they have many more MPs than all the others put together. That number is called thesize of the majority. So, if one party were to win 326 seats, then all the other parties added together would be 324. The majority is therefore 326 minus 324: two. So the smallest majority possible is not one seat but two. Another quick way of working this out is to take away 325 from the number of seats that the winning party has got and double the result. For example: If the winning party has 350 seats what is the majority? 350-325=25 25x2=50 So the majority is 50. A tip for any office sweepstake on the size of the majority is never bet on an odd number. A hung parliament happens when no single party wins a majority. A party can stay in power without an absolute majority by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create acoalition government. Alternatively, it can aim to reach agreements with smaller parties to support it in parliament in the event of aconfidence motionaimed at bringing down the government. Another possibility is for the biggest party to form aminority governmentwith no agreements with other parties, and just try to form majorities in favour of each individual bill as it comes up - an arrangement sometimes calledconfidence and supply. If no party is prepared to go down one of these paths then parliament will be dissolved again and there will be another election. The general election in 2010 ended in a hung parliament, with the Conservatives the largest party. After negotiation, a coalition government was formed between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Anexit pollis conducted by approaching voters as they leave polling stations and asking them to fill in a mock ballot paper to indicate how they have just voted. The exit poll is carried out by polling companies GfK and Ipsos Mori for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. The results of the exit poll will allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won. When polls close at 22:00 BST, the BBC will broadcast the results of the exit poll.  The projected seats for the top five parties based on the exit poll will be displayed in the summary graphic as grey bars. When the first results are declared, around an hour later, parties will begin to be ordered left to right by number of seats won at that time. As the night progresses, the summary results graphic will always display the top five parties according to seats won. All other parties' seats will be amalgamated into ""Others"". The BBC's 2015 results summary graphic Full results are always available via the link to the results homepage, which contains a listings and breakdown of seats, votes and vote share by party. When all results are known, the summary graphic will conclude by displaying the top five parties by seats won in the new Parliament. In the event of a tie in the top five - eg two parties have two seats  - the party with the most votes will be named. There are no seat predictions available for parties in Northern Ireland, as the exit poll is carried out in Great Britain (GB) only. The technology has changed, but the principles remain To appear as a named party in either the overall UK scoreboard or a nation scoreboard, a party must fulfil one of the following criteria: Standing in one-sixth of seats in any UK nation Fielding more than five candidates either across the UK or in a single nation Achieved greater than 1% of the vote at UK or nation level at the last general election Had a sitting MP in the last parliament All parties which do not meet these criteria are amalgamated into a group called Others. An aggregated tally of votes for the 191 independent candidates is also shown on the main UK scoreboard. Each constituency page will always name every party and independent standing in that constituency. The BBC only recognises parties which are registered as political parties by the Electoral Commission. On election night, the BBC calculates percentage turnout by dividing the number of valid votes cast for all candidates by the number of people eligible to vote (known as the electorate) Spoilt or rejected ballots are not included. The UK and nations turnout figures update through the night, based on electorates divided by valid votes of all constituencies declared so far.

A new rover built by Nasa and named Perseverance will land on Mars in February 2021 using the ""sky crane"" method. A giant parachute and rocket motors will slow the mission's descent before the rover is lowered to the surface using cables. Perseverance - a six-wheeled robotic machine with 23 cameras and a drill - will seek signs of ancient life in a large crater called Jezero. It will collect rock and soil samples that look like they may have been altered by contact with micro-organisms. The rover will store its samples in metal canisters - but leave them behind on the Martian surface to continue its mission. Perserverance's plutonium-based power supply could keep the rover trundling around Mars for 10 years or more. Later this decade - after 2026 - a second, smaller rover, to be built by the European Space Agency (Esa), will arrive on Mars. This ""fetch rover"" will travel across the surface picking up the sample canisters left behind by Perseverance. The canisters will be loaded into a protective container and placed into a small rocket - the Mars Ascent Vehicle or MAV. This will blast into the sky, placing the container into orbit around Mars. The sample container will be met in orbit and caught by a European satellite. This ""return orbiter"" will act like a cargo ship, bringing the precious rock and soil specimens back to Earth. We don't expect the satellite to arrive home until at least 2031, by which time the sample container will have been packaged in a heavily protected capsule, to be sent into Earth's atmosphere to land in North America. Scientists will then study the rocks and soil using advanced techniques, including some that have yet to be invented because there should be enough material to investigate for decades ahead. The samples will shed light on Mars' history and whether it has ever supported microbial lifeforms.

"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are stressing core themes as they and other party leaders criss-cross the UK in a last push for general election votes. The Tory leader said she was the only person who could ""deliver for Britain"" and negotiate the right Brexit deal. Warning of ""five more years of Tory austerity"", Labour's leader promised more spending on health and education. The Lib Dems are focusing on Remain-voting target seats while UKIP says only it can stop Brexit ""backsliding"". In Scotland, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned that a vote for Labour risks ""handing the keys of No 10"" to Theresa May, while leaders in Wales and Northern Ireland are also making their last pitch for votes. General election: Live rolling updates Laura Kuenssberg: Election conclusions Diane Abbott: I will rejoin fray soon Manifesto guide: What the parties are promising Everything you need to know the general election campaign Reality check: How weather affects turnout After a week dominated by security issues since the terror attack in London, the prime minister returned to her central message on Brexit - the reason she gave for calling Thursday's election 50 days ago. Mrs May said that money which has until now been spent on EU projects could deliver ""huge benefits"" across the UK after its withdrawal, due in 2019. This video can not be played Mrs May says there are challenges ahead In an eve of poll interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs May said: ""Brexit is the basis of everything. We need to secure our economy for the future, we need to ensure we are getting more jobs, better paid jobs, more opportunities for young people in this country. We can do that if we get the Brexit negotiations right."" She also stressed the big differences between her and Mr Corbyn on a range of issues, including response to the terror threat: ""I support the police shooting to kill terrorists. Jeremy Corbyn does not."" Jeremy Corbyn addressing supporters at his final rally in Islington Lib Dem leader Tim Farron found time for a spot of breakfast in Solihull The PM's day started in London, where she chatted to butchers at Smithfield meat market in the City. She was accompanied by her husband, Philip, who was also at her side as she visited Southampton and Norwich. Speaking in Norwich, she said a Labour government would ""wreck the economy"" while she wanted to build a country that was ""more confident in itself and in which no community was left behind"". Mrs May, who will end the day in the West Midlands, said that negotiations with the EU would begin in less than a fortnight and the question for voters was about who they trusted to deliver the best deal for Britain. But emphasising Labour's plan to invest billions on public services, to be paid for by higher taxes on business and top earners, Mr Corbyn said the NHS could not afford ""five more years of underfunding, understaffing and privatisation"". Green Party leader Caroline Lucas says she wants the final say on Brexit to ""come back"" to the people The UKIP leader has been talking about the boost that Brexit could bring The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon has been touring Scotland during the campaign Leanne Wood said a strong Plaid Cymru team was needed at Westminster Addressing activists in Runcorn, he said the election was ""all about the kind of society we want to live in"", saying: ""Never before has there been a clearer choice between the parties... a choice quite simply between hope and fear."" He said: ""The re-election of a Theresa May government will mean five more years of cuts to the NHS, five more years of increases in waiting times, five more years of more and more people waiting for social care and five more years of austerity."" Instead, Mr Corbyn - who has also addressed crowds in Glasgow and Colwyn Bay - urged people to reject this ""arid road"" and back Labour's ""positive and inclusive"" vision. On Wednesday evening, he told supporters in Harrow that commentators who had written off Labour weeks ago ""may just have made a very big mistake"". Rounding off his campaign with a rally in Islington, he said Labour was now the ""new political mainstream"". Human rights won't stop terror fight - May Farron: Lib Dems can stop Tory landslide UKIP's Nuttall in final push for votes The Labour leader has had to reshuffle his top team on the eve of the election after announcing shadow home secretary Diane Abbott would be taking a break because of ill health. Ms Abbott pulled out of a number of media engagements on Tuesday and the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Lyn Brown, the shadow police minister and candidate for West Ham, had been asked to stand in for her indefinitely. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has urged Labour supporters to ""send a message"" to Theresa May on issues such as Brexit and social care by supporting his party in seats where they are the Tories' main challengers. Endorsing tactical voting on campaign stops in Solihull, St Albans and Twickenham, he said: ""This was undoubtedly an election called in the interests of the Conservative Party and it hasn't quite turned out the way she expected because Theresa May's made some very poor decisions, that have shown weakness and a level of heartlessness."" The shadow home secretary is taking a break from her duties because of illness Former Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party offered an alternative to the continuing austerity proposed by the Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn's ""Venezuelan-style socialism"". Campaigning in Edinburgh, the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said re-electing SNP MPs would ensure Scotland retained a ""strong voice"" in Westminster and deny the Conservatives the ""crushing majority"" they were expecting. Corbyn sidesteps Dugdale referendum row Welsh leaders begin final push Starmer: Labour IRA comments 'regrettable' ""People in Scotland should not risk waking up to Tory MPs who can hand Theresa May a majority and then rubber stamp anything she wants,"" she said. ""Instead, voters should take the opportunity to stand up for Scotland's schools, hospitals, public services, pensioners and jobs by rejecting the Tories' extreme and dangerous plans.""

At their final election rally, the Green Party called on people to ""vote with their hearts"". ""I'm calling on people across the UK to vote not just for the MP they want, but the kind of country they want,"" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said, emphasising his party's opposition to the Trident nuclear deterrent and support for a universal weekly basic income. Visiting Great Yarmouth, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said only his party could keep the pressure on the next government to deliver a ""real Brexit"" - with lower immigration, exclusive fishing rights for British trawlers within UK territorial waters and no ""divorce bill"". And Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said a re-elected Conservative government with an increased majority would pose a ""threat"" to Wales and her party would stand up for Welsh interests in the run-up to Brexit and afterwards.

Corbett's chair and four candles - famous from his sketch show The Two Ronnies - were placed at the front of Westminster Abbey. The entertainer died aged 85 last year. In an emotional tribute, Brydon said it was ""truly one of the great pleasures"" of his life to become friends with ""this remarkable man"". He added: ""To walk down the street with Ronnie Corbett was to witness something really rather wonderful. ""Faces would light up with joy like shop windows when they saw him. Here was that man, that friend, who had entertained us for so long."" Brydon choked up when he talked about how he had kept many of the star's answerphone messages. He continued: ""In these horribly dark and troubled times we're living through, he's brought us all together and once again we've laughed and we've smiled as we remember and celebrate him. ""On behalf of us all, I say thank you Ron. We will never forget you."" Lumley, who gave a Bible reading, said Corbett ""would be absolutely delighted and amazed"" at the service of thanksgiving.

"The woman was attacked in Hermon Hill A nursery school worker has been taken to hospital with a ""slash wound"" after reports of a stabbing in east London, police have said. The victim, who is in her 30s, was attacked in Hermon Hill, Wanstead, on her way to work at about 09:30 BST. Nursery manager Karrien Stevens said the woman told her she was slashed by three Asian women dressed in black. Counter-terrorism police have been informed but are not treating it as a terrorist incident. Ms Stevens, who runs Little Diamonds nursery in Hermon Hill, said the woman told her that she was attacked while on her way to work from Wanstead High Street. The attackers slashed her arm from the wrist upwards before running off down the street, she said, and shouted out ""something to do with Allah and the Koran"". The victim's injuries are not life threatening but she was taken to an east London hospital as a precaution, the Metropolitan Police said. In a statement, the force added: ""The suspects fled the scene prior to police arrival in an unknown direction. ""No arrests have been made. Enquiries continue.

"Michelle Carter, 20, is being tried in juvenile court A 20-year-old US woman, whose boyfriend took his own life nearly three years ago, has gone on trial for allegedly urging him to kill himself. Michelle Carter is charged with involuntary manslaughter for her role in the suicide of Conrad Roy III. Prosecutors allege Ms Carter drove the Massachusetts 18-year-old to his death to attract sympathy. She has asked a judge to rule on the case, rather than a jury of her peers. ""You need to do it, Conrad,"" Ms Carter texted him on the morning of 12 July, according to records presented by the Bristol County District Attorney's Office. ""You're ready and prepared. All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy,"" she wrote. Mr Roy had been due to attend university in the autumn She told him in another message: ""You're finally going to be happy in heaven. No more pain. It's okay to be scared and it's normal. I mean, you're about to die."" As he expressed doubts, she kept pushing. ""I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and you're ready â¦  just do it babe,"" she said. ""No more pushing it off. No more waiting,"" she went on. Mr Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his vehicle at a Kmart car park in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, on 13 July 2014. Texts show he wavered in his plan to follow through with the suicide, at one point getting out of his pick-up truck. The court heard that Ms Carter, who was then 17, replied: ""Get the f*** back in the car."" After his death, she fundraised for mental health awareness and led a charity softball event in his honour. Ms Carter reportedly texted Mr Roy that his parents would ""get over"" his suicide Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, told the court on Tuesday she had no warning of her son's suicide. She said: ""I thought he was a little depressed."" On the day of his death, Mr Roy went to the seaside in Westport, Massachusetts, with his mother and sisters, according to prosecutors. He bought his sisters ice cream, joked about bathing suits and spoke of a scholarship he had just won, while making other plans for the future. Ms Carter sent texts to Mrs Roy after her son's death, telling her that his spirit lived on. One text read: ""I loved him, Lynn. I know I'm young, but I saw the rest of my life with him."" Does Facebook's Safety Check really help in emergencies? More speak up as the stigma of mental illness subsides 'What I'd change for mental health services' How can Japanese companies stop employees from working themselves to death? As arguments began on Tuesday, images of his text exchanges with Ms Carter were broadcast on the courtroom wall. ""She used Conrad as a pawn,"" said Assistant District Attorney Maryclare Flynn, adding that the accused had wanted to gain attention as the ""grieving girlfriend"". ""She talked him out of his doubts point-by-point, assured him that his family would understand why he did it, researched logistics and reassured him that he was likely to succeed, and pushed him to stop procrastinating and get on with it, mocking his hesitation,"" said the prosecutor. Lawyers had requested the case be dismissed on the grounds of right to free speech. But a juvenile court judge ruled that encouraging suicide was not protected under the US constitution. Defence lawyer Joseph Cataldo argued that Mr Roy had been motivated to kill himself for some time, and that his depression was spurred by family troubles. He told the court that Ms Carter had previously talked her boyfriend out of suicide attempts. Recently unsealed documents show Mr Roy attempted to take his own life several times before, and had spent time researching methods online. Defence lawyer Mr Cataldo said in court: ""My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months"". According to local media reports, Ms Carter had also texted Mr Roy that his parents would ""get over"" his suicide. ""You've hit that point and I think your parents know you've hit that point,"" the accused texted. ""You said your mom saw a suicide thing on your computer and she didn't say anything. I think she knows it's on your mind and she's prepared for it."" She added: ""They will always carry you in their hearts."" Mr Roy replied: ""Aww. Thank you, Michelle.""

"Diane Abbott has insisted she is not being asked to stay away from the TV and radio studios Diane Abbott says she will be back in action soon after it was announced she was ""taking a break"" from campaigning. The shadow home secretary tweeted: ""Touched by all the messages of support. Still standing! Will rejoin the fray soon. Vote Labour!"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced earlier that Ms Abbott ""was not well"" and was taking a break. Shadow minister Lyn Brown is to stand in for Ms Abbott, who pulled out of two media appearances on Tuesday. BBC Election Live: Rolling updates Listen: Woman's Hour's election phone-in Last push for votes in election campaign Asked how long Ms Abbott would be taking a break, Mr Corbyn said: ""I'll be talking to her later on today."" He said: ""Of course Diane is somebody that works extremely hard and represents her community very well and I have to say has received totally unfair levels of attack and abuse not just recently - over many years."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Ms Abbott's break would be ""indefinite"" and political correspondent Iain Watson said friends of Ms Abbott had told him she was moved without consultation, not at her own request. Labour's international trade spokesman Barry Gardiner said he had been told by Labour Party officials that Ms Abbott was suffering from a long-term illness. ""Diane is clearly not well and I understand that it is a condition which has been diagnosed and is long-term,""Mr Gardiner told TalkRadio,external. ""I think anybody who has seen her in the past couple of weeks would realise that she was showing that she was not well, in the way in which she had been operating."" He added: ""Everybody is aware that Diane didn't perform well in a couple of programmes, but what we didn't know was why and I think that has now become clear."" Mr Gardiner later told the Press Association it was a matter for Ms Abbott to decide what details of her health should be made public. Ms Abbott had been scheduled to appear on a special election edition of Radio 4's Woman's Hour alongside Home Secretary Amber Rudd and other political rivals on Tuesday. But shortly before transmission, it was announced that shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry would take her place. Ms Abbott had downplayed claims Labour wanted her to adopt a lower profile after several faltering performances. During an appearance on Sky News on Monday, Ms Abbott rejected suggestions that the party leadership regarded her as a liability after an LBC interview earlier in the campaign when she failed to put an accurate cost on the party's plans to fund 10,000 new police officers. She said she was appearing regularly in the media and it would be ""strange"" if she was not doing so at a time of heightened concern about security and policing after the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Lyn Brown, 57, was first appointed to Labour's shadow home affairs team when Mr Corbyn named his first frontbench team in 2015. But she was among a slew of MPs who resigned the following year following a vote of no confidence in his leadership. She said then that Labour should seek a new leader ""for the good of the party and the country"". She rejoined the front bench three months later as minister for policing. MP for West Ham since 2005, she is fighting Thursday's election in the ultra-safe east London seat, which she held with a majority of almost 28,000 in 2015. She was a Labour whip under Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, before being appointed shadow minister for communities and local government in 2013 and then shadow home office minister two years later. The Conservatives said Labour were ""hiding"" Ms Abbott away from voters as she was ""not trusted"" by Mr Corbyn, a close ally and friend of hers, and other colleagues.

"The court heard Jolyon Marshall ""corrupted"" other staff members Thirteen people have been convicted after an inquiry into ""organised and systemic"" abuse at two care homes for adults with learning disabilities. Residents at Vielstone near Bideford, in Devon, were routinely punished by being held in empty rooms without food, heating or a toilet, a court heard. Staff imprisoned them in the rooms, often overnight, during 2010 and 2011, as an abusive culture developed. Manager Jolyon Marshall was jailed for 28 months. Twelve other people, including other staff members and Marshall's wife, were convicted after a series of trials at Bristol Crown Court. During the trials, the directors and staff were accused of creating a culture whereby residents were left in the rooms more than 1,000 times with no furniture or a television for hours at a time. The incidents took place at both Vielstone and its sister home Gatooma near Holsworthy. Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC said staff tried to correct residents' behaviour as if they would train an animal. This video can not be played He spent 195 sessions in a 'quiet room', including 13 overnight stays He said: ""The prosecution say that each of them was effectively imprisoned in that room against their will. ""It was not a one-off but organised and systemic abuse of people with learning disabilities - vulnerable members of society who were residents in homes that were meant to care for them."" The rooms were known as either the ""garden room"" or the ""quiet room"". Mr Langdon said: ""Whatever the original purpose, these two rooms were used by staff to control - perhaps to even punish - residents at a time that was not only unacceptable by professional standards of care but was also quite unnecessarily cruel."" One man, who cannot be named, spent 195 sessions in the ""quiet room"", including 13 overnight stays. His mother said the treatment was ""barbaric, disgusting and unnecessary,"" and that she tried to flag up the problems. Residents were held in punishment rooms at Vielstone care home Timeline of events: 1993: Paul Hewitt starts building care homes as the director of firm Atlas Project team 2004: Gatooma care home opens with capacity for five residents.

One found not guilty 13 December 2016: Third trial ends - two workers are found guilty of one charge each of false imprisonment. Four others found not guilty One former employee at Vielstone told the BBC  the atmosphere was like an ""ice block"". ""There was no warmth, nothing - it was almost like a prison kind of regime,"" he said. ""They were treated like third class citizens the best part of the time."" Judge William Hart told Marshall: ""You were the moving force at Vielstone after Paul Hewitt (company founder) moved back. You had control and power. The buck stops with you. You can't be a director and manager and then blame someone else. ""Rather than care in the community it became lack of care in the community. ""Those two rooms cast a dark shadow over people's lives."" Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the Care Quality Commission, welcomed the sentences. ""No-one should be subject to the degrading abuse people experienced and I am glad that the perpetrators have been recognised for the criminals they are,"" she said. ""The end of these trials is a chilling reminder that we must all remain vigilant to support and protect people in vulnerable circumstances who have every right to live their lives to the full, free from fear and treated with dignity and respect."" Ten men and 14 women were prosecuted during four trials at Bristol Crown Court, which can now be reported.

"Australian Sara Zelenak was working in London The family of London attack victim Sara Zelenak have paid tribute to their ""beautiful daughter and sister,"" as police say the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight. Relatives of the 21-year-old Australian, an au pair, said they were ""deeply saddened at the tragic loss"". All of those who died have now been named. Earlier, police searching for French national Xavier Thomas, 45, said they had recovered a body from the Thames. Scotland Yard said the body was pulled from the river near Limehouse at 19:44 BST on Tuesday. Xavier Thomas was listed as missing after being on London Bridge at the time of the attack Mr Thomas's next of kin have been told, police said, but formal identification has not yet taken place. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Spain said Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, who died defending a woman with his skateboard, should be given a posthumous award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. Mr EcheverrÃ­a was from Madridand was working for HSBC bank in London. Another victim was named as Sebastien Belanger, from France. Mr Belanger worked at the Coq d'Argent near Bank. He had been watching the Champions League final football match with friends at a nearby pub before the attack. Read more about the victims of the attack London attack: What we know so far Who were the attackers? Analysis: What new powers could be used? Full story: London Bridge attack The others killed in the attack have been named as Australian Kirsty Boden, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, from Hackney, London, and French national Alexandre Pigeard. NHS England said 29 patients remain in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the London Bridge attackers Police have named Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man who lived in east London, Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, and Rachid Redouane, 30, who also lived in Barking, as the men who carried out the attack. They drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market. Redouane's ex-wife, Charisse O'Leary,said she was ""deeply shocked, saddened and numbed""by his actions. ""My thoughts and efforts now are with trying to bring up my daughter with the knowledge that, someday, I will have to try and explain to her why her father did what he did."" Speaking at her house in Bologna, Italy,Zaghba's mother told the BBCshe believed her son was radicalised in the UK. She said he was under surveillance when he was in Italy and questioned why this was not the case in the UK. An Italian police source confirmed to the BBC that Zaghba had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries, including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped Zaghba at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. The BBC understands he was not prosecuted but was listed on the Schengen Information System, an EU-wide database which includes details of potential suspects. In pictures: Tributes to victims How are UK extremists radicalised? When Zaghba entered Britain, staff at passport control should automatically have been alerted by the Schengen system, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. ""One unconfirmed report suggests that did happen, apparently when Zaghba arrived at Stansted Airport in January - but that border staff still let him in,"" he said. Police have made an arrest at a house in Ilford, east London A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terror offences as detectives raided an address in Ilford, east London, in the early hours of Wednesday. On Wednesday night, detectives arrested two more men in Ilford - aged 27 and 29 - on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts. On Tuesday a 27-year-old man was arrested in Barking on Tuesday in connection with the investigation. A man was arrested in Limerick, in the Irish Republic, on Tuesday over the discovery of ID documents in Redouane's name. He was later released without charge. A second man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Tuesday evening, with the Garda saying it was also related to Redouane. He is being held in Wexford. Islamic scholar reported London attacker.

"Caveat, caveat, caveat, and in case you haven't realised the point I'm trying to make yet, here is another caveat. Elections matter because they determine all our futures based on the decisions made by millions of people in the privacy of the polling booth. The results are not based on what the pollsters say, nor entirely on what happens in the rough and tumble of election campaigns, nor what any journalist or pundit says. Nor is the outcome in a time of political volatility predictable in any traditional sense. So, anyone now making guesses about the final outcome of the election is doing just that, guessing, even if those guesses are of the most informed kind. With those caveats in mind though, we have spent the last few weeks travelling the country with political leaders, talking to voters, and also talking to dozens of candidates who have been on the doorstep trying to secure the vote for their parties. And it is worth exploring the broad conclusions that many of them share. BBC Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Last push for votes in election campaign Manifesto guide: Where the parties stand More from Laura: May ups the ante on terror The first point worth making is that generally, most of them share the same view of the big picture. Irrespective of the Tories' dispiriting campaign, irrespective of the very obvious enthusiasm shown by many thousands of Jeremy Corbyn's supporters, experienced campaigners across the political spectrum believe the Conservatives are almost inevitably going to be the largest party. Even the inner core of Mr Corbyn's supporters don't really believe the overall outcome is very likely to be different. And the London Bridge attacks make it difficult for any of the political parties to shift the debate beyond security or Brexit, or build new momentum in these closing hours. One cabinet minister did suggest privately, ""it is possible"" that they might not end up being the largest overall party, but ""when you get down to Brexit it's a yes, and it's all down to Theresa May"". Without question though, there has been a hardening of what had felt like a super soft Labour vote. The local election results suggested that it wasn't just UKIP voters likely to make the switch to the Conservatives, but normal Labour voters who were willing to make the jump straight across. Again and again, whether in Wales, or the Midlands, or the North East, we heard voters say ""I'm normally Labour, butâ¦"" contemplating voting Conservative for the first time. That was certainly partly down to the public perception of Jeremy Corbyn. Labour campaigners reported a vitriolic reaction to Jeremy Corbyn in many places. One candidate texted in shock to say, ""you can't overestimate how unpopular he is on the doorsteps"". Labour, Tory, SNP, or Lib Dem we heard this time and again. Whatever the picture the national polls suggest, some Labour candidates still believe their party could be looking at a dreadful set of results with the party crashing to well below 200 seats. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron campaigning in Wales SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has been touring Scotland ahead of Thursday Will UKIP voters from 2015 switch to other parties? Most we've spoken to believe the party will go backwards, the question is by how much.  There has been a hardening of the Labour vote since the opening days of this battle, but as one source puts it the party's view was ""we started 90 seats behind"".  Another senior source says ""the scale of the drop in our support feels bigger than the scale of the recent increase, while the Tory vote has grown and the Lib Dems have disappeared"". But one look at the thousands of rain soaked supporters in Gateshead, students climbing up trees to see the Labour leader over the crowds in Leeds, queues outside so many of the venues where he has appeared, tells you that he has massively enthused some voters, particularly students and the young. Over the course of the campaign it's been Labour with most of the momentum, the more enthusiastic crowds, and the more radical agenda. Nearly every private conversation with candidates reveals this too. There's been surprise in Tory ranks that the overall  tone of the campaign has been a positive for Mr Corbyn, rather than the onslaught they expected and sought to promote with highly personalised attacks from the get go. Jeremy Corbyn has been drawing large crowds Theresa May campaigning in Slough, which is currently Labour And for the large number of Labour doubters, there's been disbelief at how he has performed. For many of his supporters however, this is what they always believed could happen. When his policies got more exposure, and more people saw him in the context of a campaign, more and more voters would be drawn to his radical offer. But excited crowds don't translate directly into election victories. In the Scottish referendum for example, it was those campaigning for independence who had the excitement, the energy, the visible drive, yet they lost by 10 points. At this point in the General Election in 2015, it was Labour campaigners with hope in their eyes, Ed Miliband's team joking privately about giving out invites to Chequers. Yet the party went backwards. What do the parties themselves really think is going on? Remember they have their own huge swathes of data gathered door-knock by door-knock that informs their decisions. The most basic of all - where it is worth turning up to campaign. Parties don't traditionally send their leaders to places where they think they have no chance of winning, or where they don't think they are in danger of losing. Essentially, leaders only go to seats that are in play. So consider the pattern of where Mr Corbyn has been visiting - the huge crowds have often been in Labour-held seats. For perhaps the biggest clue in this election look at the trail of the leaders' visits themselves. Jeremy Corbyn has been to 63 seats - 27 Labour including 20 safe seats, 34 Tory seats, 1 SNP and 1 Liberal Democrat. By contrast, Theresa May has visited 62 seats - 41 of them Labour, 15 Tory, 5 SNP and 1 Liberal Democrat. She has been to no safe Tory seat other than her own constituency. The heavy hint from those choices tell you who is playing an attack game, and who is trying to defend their ground. Indeed one source at the top of the Labour Party told me there are only two seats they believe that are seriously in contention as Labour gains. That is hardly the position of a party that really believes it is in the ascendance. The party's ultimate vote share is a separate question. But in a first-past-the-post system, if Labour wants to inflict damage on the Tories they need to protect seats in the North and make gains in the Midlands. Beyond what the national polls suggest, there is not much convincing evidence that suggest that is what's going on. One senior source suggests Mr Corbyn has sewn up the ""trendy left"". But it's hard to identify how far his appeal has really stretched beyond that in the places where it counts. General election: What you need to know Poll tracker: How the parties compare Focus: Where the party leaders have travelled to Quiz: How well do you know your constituency? Still, last night in Birmingham, we've witnessed what was probably one of the biggest political events in decades. Jeremy Corbyn speaking to a crowd in Birmingham, cheered again and again, watched on live screens by many more thousands of voters in five other cities around the country. Just as when he won the leadership of the Labour Party, his candidacy, and his promises have excited voters for whom the standard political offer of recent years has come up woefully short. For Labour candidates who see this election and its expected result as an opportunity to end his control of the party that enthusiasm is a genie that may be extremely hard to wrangle back into the bottle. Remember that, as with Mr Corbyn's election to the Labour leadership first time round, and the European referendum, we are living through times where traditional political rules are certainly frayed. And if young people defy expectation and turn out to vote in unprecedented numbers any result is possible. One cabinet minister told me today that if the Tories don't win, the polls are ""bonkers"" and voters on the doorsteps have been ""deceitful"" when reporting, whether enthusiastically or grudgingly, that they will put their cross in their box. Yet perhaps either way, the events of this campaign will be felt across the spectrum for years to come.

"This video can not be played People were evacuated from the parliament building Twin attacks on the Iranian parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in the capital, Tehran, have killed at least 12 people and injured many more. After hours of intermittent gunfire, officials said both incidents were over and the attackers were dead. The Islamic State (IS) group has said it carried out the attacks, which would be a first in Iran. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards accused Saudi Arabia and the US of being behind the attacks. ""This terrorist action, coming one week after the meeting of the president of the United States with the leader of the one of the region's reactionary governments (Saudi Arabia)... shows they are involved in this savage action,"" it said in a statement. The US state department condemned the attack, saying ""the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful civilised world"". President Hassan Rouhani said Iran's message was that ""terrorism is a global problem"", and he called for ""regional and international co-operation and unity"". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attacks would have ""no effect"" on the country. In a statement, IS warned of further attacks against Iran's Shia Muslim majority. Gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs entered the parliament on Wednesday morning. Images from the scene showed a major security operation as forces surrounded the building. Iran attacks will boost flagging IS morale #PrayforTehran: Solidarity after attacks Heavy gunfire could be heard. Iranian authorities denied that there had been a hostage situation inside the parliament building. Reports said the gunmen had entered parliament via a public entrance, dressed as women. Security forces surrounded the parliament, and TV footage showed people, including children, escaping from windows. Iranian media later reported that four attackers inside the parliament building had been killed by security forces. At the mausoleum in southern Tehran, which is dedicated to the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, attackers began their assault by opening fire. The governor of Tehran said one attacker there had detonated a suicide vest and another had been killed by security forces, state broadcaster Irib reports. Iran attacks: As it happened Images from the scene showed grenades and magazines for automatic weapons, apparently recovered from the body of an attacker. The suicide attacker was a woman, reports suggested. This image, posted by Fars News, shows an explosion taking place outside the mausoleum It is not clear whether the death toll of 12 includes the attackers, or whether the victims were killed at both incidents or solely at the parliament. About 40 people were injured in the two attacks, according to emergency services chief Pir Hossein Kolivand. Iranian officials say they managed to foil a third attack. IS said it had carried out the attack and later posted a video which showed what it claimed was footage from inside the parliament building. A voice is heard saying, in Arabic: ""We're not going anywhere. We're staying forever."" An Iranian MP later confirmed that the video showed his office and one of his employees lying dead. BBC Persian's Jenny Norton says that despite Iran's active involvement in fighting IS in both Iraq and Syria, the Sunni group has not until now carried out any attacks inside Iran, and appears to have little support in this predominantly Shia country. Iranian forces take cover as they surround the parliament building However, our analyst says, in recent months the group has stepped up its Farsi-language propaganda efforts - targeting Iran's restive Sunni minority. An IS documentary-style video in March featured militants who were introduced as Iranian fighters in IS ranks based in Iraq. Speaking in Farsi, they denounced the Iranian government and the religious establishment, including the country's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian intelligence agencies claim to have foiled a number of IS-inspired plots. But by mounting a successful attack, IS could claim a major coup against a traditional foe that other Sunni jihadist groups, including its rival al-Qaeda, have failed to target in the past. This is the most serious terrorist violence in Tehran since the turbulent early years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It will come as a huge shock to ordinary Iranians, who have got used to living in a country which is generally far more stable and safe than most of its neighbours, our analyst says. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani downplayed the events, describing them as a ""minor issue"". However, officials announced a nationwide state of emergency in response to the attacks. Later, the Revolutionary Guards said the fact that IS had claimed the attacks ""proved"" that Saudi Arabia was behind them. ""This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the US President [Donald Trump] and the [Saudi] backward leaders who support terrorists,"" a statement said. Iran's ally Russia condemned the attacks. ""The continuation of a series of terror attacks again underlines the need for co-ordinated actions in the fight against terror and IS,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. France also condemned the attacks, but some Western countries have appeared slow to react. Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.

"Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba carried out the London Bridge attacks One of the London Bridge attackers was able to enter the UK, despite being placed on an EU-wide watch list. Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man who lived in east London, was named as the third attacker. He was stopped at an Italian airport on his way to Syria last year and was put on an EU-wide database but was not prosecuted, reports say. Zaghba, Khuram Butt and Rachid Redouane killed seven people and injured 48 others during the attack on Saturday. So far four of those killed in the attack have been named: Australian Kirsty Boden, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, from Hackney, and French national Alexandre Pigeard. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian confirmed on Wednesday that a second French citizen had died. The three attackers drove a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge at 21:58 BST before stabbing people in the area around Borough Market. Armed officers killed all three within eight minutes of receiving a 999 call. London attack: What we know so far Victims of the attack Who were the attackers? Analysis: What new powers could be used? Australia confirms deaths of two citizens Full story: London Bridge attack Speaking at her house in Bologna, Italy, Zaghba's mother told the BBC that she believed her son was radicalised in the UK. She claimed her son was under surveillance when he was in Italy, but she questioned why this was not the case in the UK. An Italian police source has confirmed to the BBC that Zaghba had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries, including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped Zaghba at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. The BBC understands he was not prosecuted but was listed on the Schengen Information System, an EU-wide database which includes details of potential suspects. When Zaghba entered Britain, staff at passport control should automatically have been alerted by the Schengen system, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. ""One unconfirmed report suggests that did happen, apparently when Zaghba arrived at Stansted Airport in January - but that border staff still let him in,"" he said. When asked if this was the case, Work and Pensions Secretary Damien Green, a former Home Office minister, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethat if someone's passport comes up on the Schengen system the person should be stopped at the border. ""I obviously don't know what happened in this case,"" he said. ""It would be wrong to comment on an individual case while there is a very serious continuing police investigation going on."" This video can not be played Dr Usama Hasan describes how he rowed with Khuram Butt On Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terror offences in Ilford, east London. On Tuesday a 27-year-old man was arrested in Barking on Tuesday in connection with the investigation. Scotland Yard has been criticised for the way it handled intelligence about Butt, who had been investigated by police and MI5 and featured in a Channel four documentary on extremism. Police said Pakistan-born Butt, 27, from Barking, had been subject to an investigation in 2015, but there had been no suggestion an attack was being planned. Redouane, 30, was a chef who also used the name Rachid Elkhdar and police said he claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan. He married a British woman in Dublin in 2012 and lived in the city's Rathmines area. A man was arrested in Limerick, in the Irish Republic on Tuesday over the discovery of ID documents in Redouane's name. He was later released without charge. A second man, who is in his 30s, was arrested on Tuesday evening, with the Garda saying it was also related to Redouane. He is being held in Wexford. In pictures: Tributes to victims How are UK extremists radicalised? Entering the final day of election campaigning, Theresa May said she willchange human rights lawsif they ""get in the way"" of tackling suspected terrorists. The PM said she would make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects and ""restrict the freedom and movements"" of those that present a threat. This video can not be played Khuram Butt was shown in a documentary about extremists Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013, said existing human rights laws did not stand in the way of taking action against suspected terrorists. ""If we start throwing away our adherence to human rights... we are throwing away the very values at the heart of our democracy,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme. Former SAS commander Col Tim Collins has said intelligence ""isn't good enough"", adding that police needed to recruit informants from within the Muslim community and appoint Muslim officers. ""MI5 and the police have to recruit sources, informants,"" he told Today. ""Intelligence from within the community is improving, but there's a lot more to be gleaned."" James McMullan, Chrissy Archibald and Kirsty Boden were all killed in the attack Four of those killed in the attack have been named. Australian Kirsty Boden, 28, worked as a senior staff nurse at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London. Her family have described her in a statement as an ""outgoing, kind and generous person"". ""We are so proud of Kirsty's brave actions which demonstrate how selfless, caring and heroic she was, not only on that night, but throughout all of her life,"" they added. The hospital said that Ms Boden was ""an outstanding nurse and a hugely valued member of the staff team in Theatres Recovery, described by her colleagues as 'one in a million' who always went the extra mile for the patients in her care"". Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Herfamily said she had died in her fiancÃ©'s armsafter being struck by the attackers' speeding van. The family of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, say they believe he also died. Mr McMullan's sister said he was believed to be amongthose who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene. Two French nationals were also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The BBC understands one of them to be Alexandre Pigeard, 27. Manager of the Boro Bistro, Vincent Le Berre, told the Brittany news outlet Le Telegramme how his colleague was attacked in a bar near Borough Market. ""I managed to escape him, but my friend Alexandre did not have that chance,"" he said. ""He was hit in the neck with a knife."" Mr Le Drian confirmed on Wednesday that a second French citizen had been ""identified among those who have died"". The identity of the victim has not been released. The Met have set up a casualty bureau on0800 096 1233and020 7158 0197for people concerned about friends or relatives. More on the victims Islamic scholar reported London attacker.

"Breton High School in rural Alberta has about 125 students between Grade 7 and 12 A note posted in a Canadian village school telling girls to ""value the male education and dress conservatively"" has sparked a sexism row. The sign in the hallway of a school in the province of Alberta also told girls not to dress ""like a THOT"", an acronym for ""that ho over there"". It was posted in response to a female students' note saying the dress code was ""shaming girls for their bodies"". The principal said neither sign reflected the opinions of school staff. It began when female students at Breton High School posted a sign in a school bathroom mirror. It read: ""When you interrupt a girl's school day to force her to change clothes, or send her home because her shorts are too short or her bra straps are visible, you are telling her that making sure boys have a 'distraction-free' learning environment is more important than her education."" ""Instead of shaming girls for their bodies, teach boys that girls are not sexual objects!!!"" This video can not be played Podiatrist, Emma Supple, tells radio 4's Today that gender shouldn't dictate your work wear Wild Rose School Division superintendent Brad Volkman told the BBC the sign was taken down almost immediately. But a few hours later, another one appeared, this one apparently posted by male students. ""When you wear little to no clothing and dress provocatively because it's 'too hot out' or because you think it's 'attractive,' you are putting boys at risk of having a distracting working environment and saying 'Your clothing is more important than their education.' Instead of dressing like a THOT, value the male education and dress conservatively."" Belgium university tells female grads to wear low-cut tops BC bans high-heels dress code US prom dress code lambasted for body shaming Mr Volkman told the BBC: ""It's not uncommon for students to start to push on those (dress code) boundaries. ""But it cannot be done in any way with inappropriate language."" The offensive term ""thot"" caused outrage. Grade nine student Julie Steeves told Global News: ""I just couldn't believe it. ""Lots of girls were really disgusted, sad and mad about this."" Breton High School principal Lara Jollymore told parents ""thot"" was an ""inappropriate acronym"" that would not be tolerated. She said the school would continue to enforce the dress code, which bans short skirts and states that ""cleavage"", ""navels"" and ""bra straps"" must be covered.

"Kirsty Bonney says she believes the vaccine should be available to all adolescents A doctor is calling for boys to receive a vaccine currently only given to girls to protect against cancer. The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) jab is offered to teenage girls in the UK to protect against cervical cancer. A health committee was expected to meet later to review whether boys should also get the jab, which can protect against throat and penile cancers. Dr Kirsty Bonney, from Devon, paid privately for her sons Zak, 13 and Finn, 11 to be immunised. She made the decision after working on a chemotherapy unit, where she looked after two young men with HPV-related throat cancers. She said she wants to see boys ""equally protected"" with the HPV vaccine rather than risk cancer in later life. ""I could never really understand why we weren't vaccinating boys and then I discovered we could have it done privately,"" she explained. ""I'd be much happier knowing all the boys' friends were equally protected. ""I wouldn't want to be seeing one of their friends in my surgery in a few years time [with cancer] because they hadn't been vaccinated. ""[The jab] is certainly not cheap [at Â£540 for both boys] but the cost of that compared to the thought of them getting a throat cancer puts it into perspective."" Australia, USA, Italy and Canada are among the countries that recommend vaccinating girls and boys The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advises UK health departments on immunisation and is considering extending the programme to include boys. It said there was increasing evidence on links between HPV infection and other cancers. It will discuss the matter at a meeting later and has asked Public Health England to look at the cost effectiveness of such a change. Why should boys be vaccinated against HPV? About 15% of UK girls eligible for vaccination are currently not receiving both doses, a figure which is much higher in some areas Men may have sex with women too old to have had the HPV vaccination Men may have sex with women from other countries with no vaccination programme Men who have sex with men are not protected by the girls' programme The cost of treating HPV-related diseases is high -  treating anogenital warts alone in the UK is estimated to cost Â£58.44 million a year, while the additional cost of vaccinating boys has been estimated at about Â£20 million a year Source: HPV Action Gary Tanner, from Somerset, was diagnosed with HPV-related throat cancer in 2013. He has undergone chemotherapy, radiotherapy and had his voice box removed. The 64-year-old said vaccinating girls alone made no sense. ""I am still living with cancer and most certainly my wife and I are living with the fear of cancer.  We know it has shortened my life expectancy. ""There are vaccines available to prevent to protect people against this.  I think they should be used on all available members of the public.""

""The deal they get - or don't get - will shape our future for decades."" Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says: ""In many ways it does remind us of a kind of politics that went some time ago because the gulf between the two main parties - between Labour and the Tories  - is the biggest contrast we have seen for many years. ""It is a wide choice and we've seen people around the country responding to that. Whatever the result, in the last few elections we have seen a splintering of the control of the main two parties. ""But I suspect we will see the biggest share for the two main parties that we've seen for quite some time - a return for the two ""tribes"" is something that has developed over the last couple of weeks. ""There's a sense of something quite retro about this campaign even in this 21st Century volatility. ""Labour have had a better time than was expected.

Mr Corbyn returns to his message that politics is about a choice - to re-elect a Tory government which will continue austerity and continue the tax relief and giveaways to the richest in our society. The Labour government will do things very differently, he says, repeating a pledge that 95% will pay no more in taxes and 5% will be asked to pay a little bit more. Voting Labour tomorrow is voting to look at things the other way round, he continues. For the interests of all of the people, not the very few, he adds, almost drowned out by cheering supporters.

"The front pages of the Times, the Telegraph and the Daily Mirror all feature the same photograph of Youssef Zaghba, who has been named as the third London Bridge attacker.

A security source has told The Times thatpan-European databases,externalare not being used to their potential - ""particularly by the UK."" The paper says MI5 will be told to overhaul its system for assessing suspects if Theresa May wins the election. The Guardian highlights Tuesday night'spledge by Theresa May,externalto change human rights laws, to make it easier to tackle terror suspects.  It sees the move as a ""last-ditch intervention"" - designed to ""gain control over the security agenda"" ahead of the election. According to the Daily Mail, the proposed measures would marka return to a system,externalcloser to the restrictive control orders, which were scrapped in 2011.

Meanwhile, former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has told the Daily Mirror that Mrs May facessome ""hard questions"",externalabout what Britain should do to tackle terrorism. She believes Mrs May made a ""mistake"" by scrapping Labour's control orders when she was in charge of the Home Office, and says it is ""so shocking"" that she won't rule out further cuts to the police.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Asked about the scale of challenge facing the government, Laura Kuenssberg says: ""It's not a very tempting inbox. ""A lot of people are anxious - living standards, wages are sluggish, there are huge uncertainties around the world, whoever is in charge will have to watch the pennies carefully. ""Above all the other issues, how will they take us out of the EU? Whoever ends up in Number 10 will be the one negotiator up against 27 other countries. ""The deal they get - or don't get - will shape our future for decades."" Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says: ""In many ways it does remind us of a kind of politics that went some time ago because the gulf between the two main parties - between Labour and the Tories  - is the biggest contrast we have seen for many years. ""It is a wide choice and we've seen people around the country responding to that. Whatever the result, in the last few elections we have seen a splintering of the control of the main two parties. ""But I suspect we will see the biggest share for the two main parties that we've seen for quite some time - a return for the two ""tribes"" is something that has developed over the last couple of weeks. ""There's a sense of something quite retro about this campaign even in this 21st Century volatility. ""Labour have had a better time than was expected. Watching both parties on the road today, the Tories appeared to have recovered some of their sheen of their early self-confidence."" Tim Farron goes on to tell the Oxford rally that if you vote for Theresa May she will assume ""you meant you are OK with the dementia tax, with schools sacking teachers, with cripplingly low police numbers"". He says: ""If you are someone who has traditionally voted Conservative and you're not OK with that, vote Lib Dem.

Mr Corbyn returns to his message that politics is about a choice - to re-elect a Tory government which will continue austerity and continue the tax relief and giveaways to the richest in our society. The Labour government will do things very differently, he says, repeating a pledge that 95% will pay no more in taxes and 5% will be asked to pay a little bit more. Voting Labour tomorrow is voting to look at things the other way round, he continues. For the interests of all of the people, not the very few, he adds, almost drowned out by cheering supporters.

"This video can not be played People were evacuated from the parliament building Twin attacks on the Iranian parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in the capital, Tehran, have killed at least 12 people and injured many more. After hours of intermittent gunfire, officials said both incidents were over and the attackers were dead. The Islamic State (IS) group has said it carried out the attacks, which would be a first in Iran. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards accused Saudi Arabia and the US of being behind the attacks. ""This terrorist action, coming one week after the meeting of the president of the United States with the leader of the one of the region's reactionary governments (Saudi Arabia)... shows they are involved in this savage action,"" it said in a statement. The US state department condemned the attack, saying ""the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful civilised world"". President Hassan Rouhani said Iran's message was that ""terrorism is a global problem"", and he called for ""regional and international co-operation and unity"". Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attacks would have ""no effect"" on the country. In a statement, IS warned of further attacks against Iran's Shia Muslim majority. Gunmen armed with Kalashnikovs entered the parliament on Wednesday morning. Images from the scene showed a major security operation as forces surrounded the building. Iran attacks will boost flagging IS morale #PrayforTehran: Solidarity after attacks Heavy gunfire could be heard. Iranian authorities denied that there had been a hostage situation inside the parliament building. Reports said the gunmen had entered parliament via a public entrance, dressed as women. Security forces surrounded the parliament, and TV footage showed people, including children, escaping from windows. Iranian media later reported that four attackers inside the parliament building had been killed by security forces. At the mausoleum in southern Tehran, which is dedicated to the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, attackers began their assault by opening fire. The governor of Tehran said one attacker there had detonated a suicide vest and another had been killed by security forces, state broadcaster Irib reports. Iran attacks: As it happened Images from the scene showed grenades and magazines for automatic weapons, apparently recovered from the body of an attacker. The suicide attacker was a woman, reports suggested. This image, posted by Fars News, shows an explosion taking place outside the mausoleum It is not clear whether the death toll of 12 includes the attackers, or whether the victims were killed at both incidents or solely at the parliament. About 40 people were injured in the two attacks, according to emergency services chief Pir Hossein Kolivand. Iranian officials say they managed to foil a third attack. IS said it had carried out the attack and later posted a video which showed what it claimed was footage from inside the parliament building. A voice is heard saying, in Arabic: ""We're not going anywhere. We're staying forever."" An Iranian MP later confirmed that the video showed his office and one of his employees lying dead. BBC Persian's Jenny Norton says that despite Iran's active involvement in fighting IS in both Iraq and Syria, the Sunni group has not until now carried out any attacks inside Iran, and appears to have little support in this predominantly Shia country. Iranian forces take cover as they surround the parliament building However, our analyst says, in recent months the group has stepped up its Farsi-language propaganda efforts - targeting Iran's restive Sunni minority. An IS documentary-style video in March featured militants who were introduced as Iranian fighters in IS ranks based in Iraq. Speaking in Farsi, they denounced the Iranian government and the religious establishment, including the country's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian intelligence agencies claim to have foiled a number of IS-inspired plots. But by mounting a successful attack, IS could claim a major coup against a traditional foe that other Sunni jihadist groups, including its rival al-Qaeda, have failed to target in the past. This is the most serious terrorist violence in Tehran since the turbulent early years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It will come as a huge shock to ordinary Iranians, who have got used to living in a country which is generally far more stable and safe than most of its neighbours, our analyst says. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani downplayed the events, describing them as a ""minor issue"". However, officials announced a nationwide state of emergency in response to the attacks. Later, the Revolutionary Guards said the fact that IS had claimed the attacks ""proved"" that Saudi Arabia was behind them. ""This terrorist attack happened only a week after the meeting between the US President [Donald Trump] and the [Saudi] backward leaders who support terrorists,"" a statement said. Iran's ally Russia condemned the attacks. ""The continuation of a series of terror attacks again underlines the need for co-ordinated actions in the fight against terror and IS,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. France also condemned the attacks, but some Western countries have appeared slow to react. Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.

"Mr Trump (R) met Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Than in May but on Tuesday accused the country via Twitter of funding extremism US President Donald Trump has called the king of Saudi Arabia to urge Gulf unity amid an escalating dispute over Qatar's alleged support for militants. Earlier, he said the Saudis' move to isolate Qatar could mark the ""beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". Several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar on Monday. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism. The rift has affected oil prices, travel and shipping, and has raised fears of food shortages. The emir of Kuwait is mediating in the dispute and the president of Turkey has also offered to help, saying isolation and sanctions will not resolve the crisis. ""His [Mr Trump's] message was that we need unity in the region to fight extremist ideology and terrorist financing,"" a US official told Reuters news agency. Why this row has erupted I'm flying through the Gulf: How will this affect me? Food, flights and football at risk Five things you may not know about Qatar Mr Trump hadearlier claimed creditfor the pressure placed on Qatar, saying his recent visit to Saudi Arabia was ""already paying off"". In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump accused Qatar of funding terrorism, saying: ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" In his phone call to King Salman, he was quoted by Reuters as saying: ""It's important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region,"" Separately, the Pentagon thanked Qatar for hosting the largest US air force base in the Middle East. Should Trump take a bow for Qatar row? The Qatar diplomatic crisis explained Saudi Arabia's foreign minister called on Qatar to cut ties with Palestinian group Hamas in the occupied territories, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, if it wanted to end its isolation in the Gulf region. Hamas is an Islamist Palestinian group whose flag is green Adel Al-Jubeir said: ""Nobody wants to hurt Qatar. It has to choose whether it must move in one direction or another direction."" Speaking in Paris, he said the economic measures should put pressure on Qatar to act ""like a normal country"". He name-checked ""support of extremist groups"", ""hostile media"" and ""interference in affairs of other countries"" as things Qatar would have to change if it wished to restore ties. He added that Qatar was undermining the Palestinian Authority and Egypt by supporting Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and said stopping these policies would ""contribute to stability in the Middle East"". Hamas is the largest of several militant Islamist Palestinian groups, and was the first Islamist group in the Arab world to win election at the ballot box, before it took power in Gaza after a battle 10 years ago. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is another Islamist group that became politically active. Some countries designate both as terrorist groups. Profile: Hamas Palestinian movement Muslim Brotherhood: From rapid rise to sharp decline The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington says Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have all funded extremists in Syria but pulled back under US pressure, while Qatar, which likes to see itself as a neutral player and potential intermediary, has dealings that are arguably murkier than the others'. This video can not be played Qatari foreign minister: 'No evidence we support radical Islamists' But Qatar's Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Than, said: ""There is no single evidence that the Qatar government is supporting radical Islamists."" On Monday, several countries withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, Qatar's capital, while some cut transport links and gave Qatari nationals two weeks to leave their territory. Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have revoked the licences of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to close. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times.

"Uber has fired more than 20 people, and is taking other actions against staff, after a harassment investigation. The taxi-app firm said the sackings related to sexual harassment, bullying and issues about poor company culture. Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leadinghim to saythat he needed ""leadership help"". Susan Fowler, who wrote the criticalblog post,externalabout Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point. So as well as detailing what it has done to address those existing complaints, Uber will now have to be very clear about how it will handle such issues in future. Crucially, the lessons from this report should not be heeded by Uber alone. As many people have pointed out to me since we began reporting this story, this is a problem that affects the technology industry across the board.

"Marriage appears to be good for your health, boosting your survival chances if you have a major heart risk factor such as high cholesterol, say researchers. A loving spouse might spur you on to look after yourself better, they told a heart conference, based on their study of nearly a million UK adults. All of these people had high blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes. The married ones fared much better than those who were single. Dr Paul Carter and colleagues at Aston Medical School, who carried out the work, havealready shown that marriage is linked to a better chance of surviving a heart attack,external. Their latest research, presented at theBritish Cardiovascular Society conference,external, hints at why this might be. They suspect marriage helps buffer against big heart disease risk factors, including cholesterol and high blood pressure. The study looked at deaths from all causes, including heart disease. Men and women in their 50s, 60s and 70s with high cholesterol were 16% more likely to be alive at the end of the 14-year ACALM study if they were married rather than single. The same was true for diabetes and high blood pressure, with married people having a survival advantage. The picture was less clear for people cohabiting, separated, divorced or widowed. Also, the researchers did not test if the wedded people were in happy marriages. They suspect having someone special in your life is what's important, rather than simply getting hitched. Dr Carter said: ""We need to unpick the underlying reasons a bit more, but it appears there's something about being married that is protective, not only in patients with heart disease but also those with heart disease risk factors. ""We're not saying that everyone should get married though. ""We need to replicate the positive effects of marriage and use friends, family and social support networks in the same way."" Dr Mike Knapton, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""The take-home message is that our social interactions, as well as medical risk factors such as high blood pressure, are important determinants of both our health and wellbeing. ""Whether you are married or not, if you have any of the main risk factors for heart disease, then you can call upon loved ones to help you to manage them."" smoking high blood pressure high blood cholesterol diabetes being overweight/obese being physically inactive family history of heart disease age (risk goes up with age) Worried well 'might boost heart risk' 'Heart attack risk' for painkillers Stress risk to heart 'starts in brain' British Cardiovascular Society Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?
