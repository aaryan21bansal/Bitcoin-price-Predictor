"Labour has called for an investigation into whether Boris Johnson ""misled"" the public over Russian involvement in the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier implied the foreign secretary had exaggerated the findings of the UK's defence laboratory, Porton Down. Mr Johnson responded that Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""lamentable"". Meanwhile, the international chemical weapons body has rejected Russian calls for a joint inquiry into the case. Former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in hospital after being poisoned by a nerve agent on 4 March. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russian spy: What we know so far Labour said in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But on Tuesday the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Labour called on the prime minister to launch an investigation into whether Mr Johnson broke the ministerial code. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson had ""serious questions to answer"". ""He clearly previously indicated that Porton Down had told him 'categorically' that Russia was the source of the nerve agent,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the foreign secretary had ""egg on his face for the statement he made on German television"". ""Either the foreign secretary has information that he's not sharing with Porton Down or it was a bit of exaggeration,"" he added. Mr Johnson hit back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

""It is lamentable that Jeremy Corbyn is now playing Russia's game and trying to discredit the UK over Salisbury attack,"" he wrote, setting out what he said were the ""key facts"". He added: ""28 other countries have been so convinced by UK case they have expelled Russians.  In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn chooses to side with the Russian spin machine."" The UK has said that identifying the substance at Porton Down was ""only one part of the intelligence picture"". It comes as Russia has also sought to discredit the UK's accusations. Russia pointed to a now-deleted tweet by the Foreign Office which suggested Porton Down had ""made clear"" the nerve agent was ""produced in Russia"". Allow Twitter content?

It had sought a joint inquiry after the UK blamed it for being the source of the Novichok nerve agent used. Russia accused the UK of blocking access to an investigation being carried out by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But it lost by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Following the verdict, Mr Johnson said Russia had failed in its attempts to ""obscure the truth"" and ""derail the proper international process"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia has said the comments from Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead reveal the UK's case to be ""nothing but assumptions"". The Foreign Office said the deleted tweet had been part of a real-time account of a speech by the UK's ambassador in Moscow and was deleted because it ""did not accurately report our ambassador's words"". It added: ""None of this changes the fact that it is our assessment that Russia was responsible for this brazen and reckless act and, as the international community agrees, there is no other plausible explanation. ""No other country has a combination of the capability, the intent, and the motive to carry out such an act."" BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Johnson's ""loose language"" plus the deleted tweet represented a ""self-inflicted wound"" by the UK. This had ""muddied the waters"" and allowed Russia to cast doubt on the UK's assessment, he said - but he added that the ""international alliance"" supporting the UK's position was ""still holding"".

"Kim Jong-un is ruthless but rational, say MPs North Korea will almost certainly be able to reach UK shores with an intercontinental ballistic missile within six to 18 months, MPs have said. However, the Commons' Defence Select Committee report said there was as yet no evidence that North Korea could arm these missiles with nuclear warheads. MPs, who have been investigating the threat posed by North Korea, added that such a strike seemed ""highly unlikely"". They described the country's ruler, Kim Jong-un, as ""ruthless but rational"". He was ""ruthless, like other Communist dictators before him, but he is rational"" and could be ""dissuaded from the use of nuclear weapons, by means of a policy of deterrence and containment"", the report said. North Korea has carried out six nuclear tests, and has a ballistic missile that experts believe could put the whole of the US in striking range. In doing so, Pyongyang said it had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state. However, last month, after months of mutual hostility, Mr Kim was said to be ""committed to denuclearisation"" as he and US President Donald Trump agreed to talks, in an unprecedented move. Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim North Korea crisis in 300 words What missiles does North Korea have? Despite the developments, the MPs' report said North Korea was unlikely to abandon its weapon programme and would achieve its goal of posing a nuclear threat to its opponents soon. The committee said a North Korean nuclear strike against the UK seemed ""highly unlikely"", given its focus on threatening the US. ""It is obvious to North Korea that launching such weapons would lead inescapably to devastating military consequences,"" the report goes on. If there were conflict in the region, the UK was unlikely to stand aside and would assist the US, it said. North Korea tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile last July The MPs' report issued a further warning that the UK could be the target of cyber attacks from the regime. North Korea was believed to be behind last May's WannaCry attack, which affected NHS hospitals, businesses and banks across the world causing billions of dollars of damage. Committee chairman Julian Lewis said the threats posed by the regime were typical of the intensifying dangers confronting the UK and underlined the need to spend more on defence. He told the BBC he wanted to see spending increased from 2% of GDP to nearer 3% to cope with new cyber and nuclear threats, as well as older ones.

"Ray Wilkins was capped 84 times by England Former England and Chelsea midfielder Ray Wilkins has died in hospital at the age of 61. Wilkins, who also played for Manchester United, AC Milan, Rangers and QPR,was being treated at St George's Hospitalin London following cardiac arrest. His family thanked ""Ray's friends, colleagues and members of the public"" for the many messages of goodwill. Chelsea said they were ""devastated to learn of the passing of our former player, captain and assistant coach"". The club added: ""Rest in peace, Ray, you will be dreadfully missed."" Wilkins' family said: ""It is with great sadness we announce that Raymond Colin Wilkins passed away this morning. ""Ray leaves behind his loving wife, Jackie, daughter Jade, son Ross, and his beautiful grandchildren, Oliver, Frankie, Ava, Freddie, Jake and Archie. ""We are asking for privacy at this very difficult time."" This video can not be played 'Wilkins was a wonderful human being' Wilkins, who had been working as a TV and radio pundit, had suffered poor health in recent years and had double bypass heart surgery in July 2017. He also admitted struggling with alcohol problems in the past and went through a five-week rehabilitation programme in the Priory Hospital in Woking in 2016 following a four-year ban for drink-driving. As a player he made 84 appearances for England and captained his country 10 times, while he won the FA Cup with Manchester United in 1983 and the Scottish league title with Rangers in 1989. Wilkins had spells as manager of QPR, Fulham and the Jordan national team. He was also Chelsea assistant coach from 1998-2000 and then 2008 until 2010, when he worked alongside Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti. Wilkins was remembered at Wednesday's Milan derby BeforeWednesday evening's Milan derby,former AC Milan team-mate Franco Baresi led a minute's applause in honour of Wilkins, and laid a bouquet of flowers and a 'Wilkins 8' Milan shirt in front of the famous Curva Sud stand. The EFL said a period of applause will be held before Sunday's Checkatrade Trophy final at Wembley Stadium between Lincoln City and Shrewsbury Town and that it would offer its ""full support for any proposed marks of respect"" from any clubs. Ray Wilkins' playing career Chelsea Crystal Palace Manchester United Wycombe Wanderers AC Milan Hibernian Paris St-Germain Millwall Rangers Leyton Orient QPR BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Wilkins' career was characterised by maturity and dignity, which was recognised early in his time at Chelsea, where he made his debut as a 17-year-old in October 1973 before being awarded the captaincy at just 18 by then manager Eddie McCreadie. He went on to make his England debut in the Bicentennial Tournament against Italy in New York City in May 1976 and had a burgeoning reputation as one of the young pin-up boys of English football, as well as one of its most promising talents. Wilkins led a group of emerging Chelsea youngsters back into the top flight, but once they were relegated again it became inevitable that top-flight clubs would pounce. So it proved as he signed for Manchester United in August 1979. He acquired an unfair reputation for a conservative playing style, with one cruel nickname of 'The Crab' mocking his supposed preference for sideways passes. Those who actually played with Wilkins thought differently and spoke of an elegant, visionary midfield player and leader whose abilities were underrated, as evidenced by the calibre of clubs who were always keen to secure his services. READ MORE:Farewell to a footballing nomad and an 'absolute gentleman' England manager Gareth Southgate, who played alongside Wilkins at Crystal Palace:""When he played with us you could immediately see that his technical ability to play the ball was phenomenal. ""In the modern game, those attributes would have been appreciated far more than they were at that time, so he really was a top, top player. ""He would have been one of the earliest to go abroad and play in the Italian league. At the time, it was at a really high level so being able to transition into a club like AC Milan and be as popular as he was there speaks volumes for his ability. ""It was really sad when I heard what happened at the weekend. It's happened so suddenly and it's tragic for Jackie and his family. ""Ray was a great ambassador for the game, a proud Englishman who loved playing for his country and an absolute gent - a class act."" Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:""Ray was a great football man who was well respected and liked by all who knew him and he always had a kind word and time for people. ""Ray was an impressive football talent and had a fantastic career representing some of the biggest clubs in the world. He will be missed by us all."" Former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard:""Devastated to hear the news that Ray Wilkins has passed away. He was a great player and an even greater man. Full of kindness and humility, with impeccable manners at all times. He had respect and time for everyone and to me he was a mentor and a friend. I'm not sure they make them like Ray anymore. You will be sorely missed fella."" Ex-Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson:""Was only two weeks ago I was with Ray in Brighton... Feel Empty - Much love to all the Family... Life is Cruel... RIP BUD..."" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore:""His passion for the game was second to none and his pleasure in sharing it never diminished. He will be missed by all of us."" Former AC Milan defender Franco Baresi:""In these moments you never know what to say, but it was an honour to have you as a companion, you were special, a gentleman on the field and out. Thank you Ray Wilkins RIP."" Ex-England striker Gary Lineker:""Deeply saddened to hear that Ray Wilkins has passed away. A wonderful footballer and a delightful man. It was a pleasure to have played alongside him with England. No team-mate was more helpful and supportive. I'll be forever grateful. Thoughts are with his family. #RIPRay."" Former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel:""Sad and choked to hear of the passing of Ray Wilkins. A true football person with a totally underestimated contribution to our sport. One of the best I've seen. My thoughts are with his family. Rest in peace."" Ex-England winger Chris Waddle:""So sorry to hear about Ray Wilkins a great player and a true gentleman RIP."" Former England and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer:""So sad to hear the news about Ray Wilkins. He lived for and loved football. I was lucky enough to have worked with him and he was always a true gentleman. He will be sorely missed by so many. #RIPRay."" Former Manchester United team-mate Mickey Thomas on BBC Radio Wales:""He was a great guy, one unbelievable man. ""He became an instant star at Chelsea and when he went to Old Trafford in a big money move there was a lot of pressure on him. He found it difficult initially but he won the fans over and became a legend there - he became a legend wherever he played. ""In today's game, money couldn't buy him - he was a gifted individual, such a talented footballer."" League Managers Association chairman Howard Wilkinson:""Ray lived and breathed football his whole career. As a player, he was a leader on the pitch and he instilled his beliefs and values into his coaching, helping a vast number of players understand what it meant to win games of football at the highest level. ""Ray has been a stalwart of the LMA for many years. His energy and love of the game were his biggest strengths. As well as being a manager in his own right, he became one of the most supportive and trusted assistant managers in the Premier League, providing a sounding board to many managers in the past 20 years and achieving great successes with his boyhood club, Chelsea. ""Many things come to mind when I think of Ray but, above all, no matter what the circumstances he remained a true gentleman."" Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish:""So upset to hear the news of Ray Wilkins. RIP Ray. Even when Ray left Villa, he was always ringing me offering advice and telling me what I could do to improve. A true gentleman and one of the nicest guys I've ever met."" Former England and Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand:""RIP Ray Wilkins. Always so humble & softly spoken whenever I saw him. Genuine lovely guy. Watched him live at Loftus Road many times for QPR. What a great passer & teacher of the game for any young kids who watched him."" Ex-Rangers defender and team-mate John Brown:""It was a privilege to have played alongside Ray and to have known him as a true friend and gentleman.""

"Oxford and Cambridge fared badly in a new equality ranking When it comes to equal access for poorer students less prestigious universities beat elite institutions, suggests new analysis. Calculations for the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) putHull University,externaltop for admitting a balanced intake of rich and poor students. Institutions like Cambridge, St Andrews, Bristol and Oxford were placed near the bottom of the table. Cambridge welcomed ""different interpretations of the data"". However, a spokesman for the university pointed out that the HEPI analysis relies on a single measure, adding ""widening participation in higher education is a complex issue"". I missed out on university but my son won't Wealthy students tighten university grip Last year the charity Teach First compared official child poverty figures with university participation rates and found young people in some of the wealthiest areas of England were18 times more likelyto go to university than those in the poorest. Another analysis showedfour fifths of students accepted at Oxford and Cambridgebetween 2010 and 2015 had parents in top professional and managerial jobs. Each year,admissions figures,external, known as Participation of Local Areas (Polar), divide neighbourhoods into five groups, according to the proportion of young people going to university. In a perfect world each university would take a fifth of its students from each group, says HEPI. For this study, statisticians used the 2016 Polar data to rank each of the UK's 132 universities in terms of how near they came to this target. The resulting table turns the usual university rankings upside down. Hull Derby Edge Hill Chester Plymouth College of Art York St John Leeds Beckett Worcester Anglia Ruskin Cardiff Metropolitan Cambridge St Andrews Bristol Oxford Aberdeen Edinburgh UCL Durham Robert Gordon LSE Prof Iain Martin, report author and Anglia Ruskin vice-chancellor, said that despite ongoing efforts to boost equal access to higher education: ""We do not have an educational level playing field."" Nick Hillman, director of HEPI, added: ""This analysis reveals which universities reflect our society best and those which have further to travel."" He said learning outcomes were better when students from diverse backgrounds studied alongside each other. ""The best way to deliver fairer access to selective institutions is the same as the best way to deliver widening participation overall, which is to provide more places,"" he added. Cambridge University said the Polar data takes no account of household income or access to education and  ""effectively assumes that people living on the same street have the same likelihood of entering higher education as their neighbours"". The spokesman said Cambridge: Runs outreach programmes across the UK to raise aspirations among under-represented and disadvantaged groups Uses multiple measures to assess every applicant's educational and socio-economic background In 2017 had the highest level (63%) of state school applicants for 35 years and over 20% of students describe themselves as being from an ethnic minority. A spokesman for the Russell Group, which represents several institutions near the bottom of the table, said members were ""fully committed to encouraging students from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter and succeed in higher education"".

"Jason Wakefield-Jones, 50, appeared at Llandudno Magistrates' Court on Wednesday A man has appeared in court on a race-hate charge after a woman complained about a golliwog doll in his window. Jason Wakefield-Jones, of Bastion Road, Prestatyn, is accused of intending to cause harassment, alarm or distress and that the offence was racially aggravated. Mr Wakefield-Jones appeared at Llandudno Magistrates' Court. The 50-year-old denied the sole charge against him and was bailed until a trial before magistrates next month. The court heard the alleged incident took place on 4 January. Defending solicitor Roger Thomas said the item was a toy in a first-floor window and only one person had complained. The golliwog is a fictional character created by Florence Kate Upton that appeared in children's books in the late 19th Century, usually depicted as a type of rag doll. It has become controversial for its perceived racist connotations.

"Alfie Evans suffers from an undiagnosed condition The Pope hastweeted,externalhis support for sick toddler Alfie Evans whose parents lost a legal fight to stop his life support machine being switched off. Pope Francis said he hoped ""everything may be done to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans"". Last month the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) rejected the case of his parents Tom Evans and Kate James. The Merseyside couple wanted to take the 22-month-old to Rome for treatment. Pope Francis said he hoped the ""deep suffering"" of Alfie's parents would be heard, adding: ""I am praying for Alfie, for his family and for all who are involved."" Alfie's parents had taken their fight to keep him alive to the Supreme Court last month but judges upheld an original High Court ruling that he should only receive palliative care. The toddler is in a ""semi-vegetative state"" in the Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. He has a rare degenerative neurological condition that has not been definitively diagnosed by doctors. The Pope also sent a message of support last year to the parents of Charlie Gard His parents from Liverpool wanted to explore further treatment options, hoping that specialists at the Bambino Gesu Paediatric Hospital - which has links to the Vatican - would be able to pinpoint what is wrong with Alfie. The Popeexpressed support last yearfor another British child when he tweeted his support for the parents of Charlie Gard, whose family lost a similar legal case against Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

"The segment featuring treehouses in West Papua was misleading, the BBC has admitted The BBC has said a scene in its Human Planet series, which featured a tribe from West Papua, in Indonesia, was not accurate. In the 2011 episode, the Korowai people were shown moving into a treehouse as a real home. But during recent filming for a different programme, the tribe said the houses were ""commissioned for filming"". The BBC said it ""breached editorial standards"" and had since revised its guidelines. The error was discovered as producers made BBC Two's upcoming series, My Year With The Tribe. The corporation said a member of the tribe told presenter Will Millard the very high treehouses were built for ""the benefit of overseas programme makers"". Human Planet: The challenges and joys of filming In the new programme, Millard tells viewers: ""This is not where they live, this is total artifice"". A BBC spokeswoman said: ""The BBC has reviewed a sequence in Human Planet depicting this [the treehouses] and found that the portrayal of the tribe moving into the treehouse as a real home is not accurate. ""Since this programme was broadcast in 2011, we have strengthened our mandatory training for all staff in editorial guidelines, standards and values.""

"The Stephensons - Maryanne, Adam, Sheralyn and Bryan - were all killed in the crash Tributes have been paid to four members of a British family killed in a car crash in Florida. The Stephensons - Adam, 30, Maryanne, 29, Bryan 66, and Sheralyn, 56, all from Bristol -died in the crashbetween their sedan and a pick-up truck near the city of Titusville on Monday. They were returning to their rental home after visiting the nearby Kennedy Space Centre. Bryan Stephenson's brother, John, said the family was ""devastated"". He added: ""We are devastated at the loss of the four family members Bryan, Sherry, Adam and Maryanne, in such tragic circumstances. ""Our thoughts are with our nephew Sean, wife Sarah and their family, and getting them home as soon as possible so we can love and support them through this very difficult time."" Police said Adam Stephenson drove the rented vehicle into the path of a pick-up truck Bryan Stephenson's employers, Emery Brothers building contractors in Bath, said staff were ""deeply shocked and saddened"" by the news. ""Bryan was a valued member of our team and a friend to many of us, he will be sorely missed,"" a statement added. Titusville Police Department said a preliminary investigation found Adam Stephenson drove the rented vehicle into the path of the truck on the SR 405 at the junction with Sisson Road. It found GPS in the vehicle was instructing a ""U-turn"" at an intersection ""most likely because of an earlier crash with road blockage"".

"Sure Start was aimed at families with pre-school age children As many as 1,000 Sure Start children's centres in England may have closed since August 2009, research for the Sutton Trust suggests. In the remaining centres, services for families are ""hollowed out"" and no longer within ""pram-pushing distance"". The report says there were 3,632 centres in 2009, with official data showing 509 of these have now closed - but it says this is an ""underestimate"". The government says it is determined to improve early years provision. The Sure Start children's centre initiative was introduced in 1998 by the then Labour government, with the aim of bringing services for young children and their parents together under one roof. Initially the scheme was focused on the most disadvantaged areas of England, but it was later extended to all areas. Children's centres 'being undermined' The Sutton Trust's report,Stop Start,external, carried out by academics at Oxford University, says that while a national database records a 14% drop (from 3,632 to 3,123) in centre numbers, this ""understates the true picture"". It says its own research data is ""more up-to-date and complete than the official figures"" because it draws on a detailed survey of local authorities and takes into account that some centres are satellite sites. It says: ""There is no clear definition of a children's centre, with a large number of 'linked sites' counted by some authorities but not by others. ""Many closures announced locally were not yet reflected in the database: our survey showed a 16% drop. ""If we only count 'registered centres', the drop since 2009 was more than 30%, suggesting that more than 1,000 centres nationally might have closed."" The report also says closure rates vary across the country, creating a postcode lottery of provision, with more local authorities preparing to make cuts in the coming financial year. The researchers asked local authorities why provision had been cut back and found 84% cited financial pressures. It says the situation means there has been a move away from the original concept of an open access neighbourhood centre, ""shifting the balance too far towards referred children and families"". The research also calls for a review of children's centres, promised by the Department for Education, to be completed. Lead report author Professor Kathy Sylva said: ""Our national survey of local authorities found wide variation in level of closures and in number of services on offer. ""At a time of increasing pressure on poor families with young children, there is an urgent need for evidence-based services to support them."" The Department for Education says local authorities will have received Â£200bn for local services, including children and young people, in the four years up to 2019-20. ""It is right that we give councils the freedom to decide what services they provide for their communities as they are best placed to understand local needs and how best to meet them, whether through a children's centre building, a family hub, or another model,""  said a spokeswoman. The founder of the Sutton Trust, Sir Peter Lampl, said: ""Good quality early years provision makes a substantial difference in the development of children, especially those who come from the poorest homes. ""It is a serious issue that the services that Sure Start centres offer are much more thinly spread than they were a decade ago."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: ""If the government is truly committed to supporting disadvantaged and vulnerable families, it simply must ensure that children's centre services are adequately supported. ""This means not only greater investment, but also a much clearer policy on what children's centres are meant to achieve, and how the government intends to support them to do so."" Head of campaigns at the charity Action for Children, Rossanna Trudgian, added: ""This analysis provides yet more evidence that the government has turned its back on children's centres - lifeline services that support families who are struggling.""

"The Duke of Edinburgh is ""comfortable and in good spirits"" after a successful hip replacement operation, Buckingham Palace has said. Prince Philip is said to be ""progressing satisfactorily at this early stage"" after surgery at the King Edward VII's Hospital in London. He is expected to remain in the private hospital for several days. The 96-year-old retired from royal duties last August, after decades spent supporting the Queen. BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said the duke was an ""intensely private man"" and even at the best of times, the palace would not provide a running commentary. His condition came to light after his absence from the Easter service at Windsor was attributed to a hip problem. He also did not attend two other recent events at Windsor Castle - the Royal Maundy Service at St George's Chapel on 29 March, and a parade on 22 March to mark Prince Andrew's appointment as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. Prince Philip's decades of royal duty Philip honoured on wedding anniversary The operation comes ahead of a busy time for the royal family, with the Duchess of Cambridge due to give birth to her third child this month, and the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May. The Queen, who is at Windsor Castle for the traditional Easter Court, is being kept up-to-date on the duke's condition. By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond When he first met the then-Princess Elizabeth, he is said to have showed off by leaping over the tennis court nets at Dartmouth Naval College. His spin bowling was so good that the Australian cricketing legend Sir Don Bradman said he should play for England. In the 1960s he was one of the top four polo players in Britain. When he gave up polo, he took up carriage driving. And all the while he encouraged others to lead a sporting and active life, as president of the National Playing Fields Association, a patron of Outward Bound and through the establishment of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. Much of that activity has come to an end as age has taken its toll. The duke is 96. But in early March he was seen carriage driving at Windsor. Incapacity will be a torment to a man so used to activity. His doctors will want him up and about as soon as possible after the operation, to kick-start the healing process. They will find it difficult to restrain him. The duke announced his retirement in May 2017. A month later he was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as ""a precautionary measure"" following an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. His final solo engagement was on 2 August last year, when he reviewed a parade of Royal Marines outside Buckingham Palace in his capacity as Captain General of the corps. He has since appeared several times at engagements alongside the Queen and was seen with other members of the royal family at the Christmas Day service at Sandringham. Prince Philip carried out his last solo engagement in August But he has appeared in public with other royals since King Edward VII's Hospital, in Marylebone, was founded in 1899 and has treated other senior members of the royal family, including the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. Prince Philip has spent much of his life in good health, but was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection a year later. In June 2013 he spent 11 nights at the London Clinic, another private hospital in central London, where he underwent exploratory abdominal surgery. In May 2014, he had a ""minor procedure"" on his right hand, with the treatment carried out inside Buckingham Palace. By BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher A hip replacement completely rebuilds the hip joint. The top of the thigh bone is removed and replaced with a metal stem that has a smooth ball on the end. Part of the pelvis is also hollowed out and fitted with a socket for the ball to move in. Recovery will depend on the individual patient but, in general, doctors get patients on their feet as quickly as possible and discharge them three to five days after the procedure. There will be physiotherapy exercises to do at home and crutches are needed for about four to six weeks. Patients tend to feel back to normal after about three months. Most hip replacements are carried out on patients between the ages of 60 and 80 but overall fitness is a bigger factor than age in any decision to operate. Figures for the UK, excluding Scotland, show 851 people over 90 had a hip replacement in 2016. In the 1990s, the Queen Mother underwent two successful hip operations, aged 95 and 97.

"A forensic tent has been set up outside Richard Osborn-Brooks' home in Hither Green A 78-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a suspected burglar was stabbed to death. The man, named locally as Richard Osborn-Brooks, discovered two intruders in South Park Crescent, Hither Green, south-east London, at about 00:45 BST. One suspect, armed with a screwdriver, forced the man into his kitchen where a struggle ensued and he was stabbed, Scotland Yard said. The 38-year-old was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 03:40. The suspected burglar was found collapsed in Further Green Road, south-east London The homeowner discovered two intruders in his house in South Park Crescent Mr Osborn-Brooks, who suffered bruising to his arms, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody at a south London police station. The other intruder remains at large. The CPS and police urge people to always call the police first - if you are able. But according toofficial guidance,external, anyone can use reasonable force to protect themselves. As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and the fear felt, the more force you can lawfully use in self-defence. The law doesn't require you to wait to be attacked before using defensive force, but does not protect you if, for example, your action is over-the-top or calculated revenge. You are given greater protection under the law if force is used to protect yourself or others when dealing with a burglar or trespasser on your property. The CPS says if you have acted in reasonable self-defence, as described above, and the intruder dies you will still have acted lawfully. Police said they were called to the property over reports of a burglary when they found the man collapsed in nearby Further Green Road with a stab wound to the upper body. One man who lives on the street said there had been a recent spate of burglaries in the area and his home had been broken into in recent months. ""I was renovating the house and they broke in and took a laptop. I know this has happened to others recently,"" he said. Adam Lake, another local resident, said he ""wasn't surprised"" to hear about the burglary. ""We've even had to put up CCTV at home because we didn't feel safe,"" he said. ""I feel terrible for the man that was burgled. He doesn't deserve to be punished for defending himself,"" he said. Forensic officers are carrying out investigations at the scene Keith Doyle, BBC News For now, the streets are cordoned off as police in blue boiler suits search gardens and bins for anything that will help their investigation. Neighbours say there have been quite a few burglaries in this area recently - this is a relatively well-off part of south east-London with streets of semi-detached houses. The chair of the residents' association told me it is trying to make the area safer, working with police and the council to close off alleyways. At the same time it has been trying to bring the community together with street parties and other events. The dead man's next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination would take place ""in due course"", the Met said. Local ward Councillor Mark Ingleby described the killing as a ""tragedy"" and said it had come ""out of the blue"". He said there had been a ""definite improvement"" on tackling burglaries in the area thanks to an active Neighbourhood Watch scheme. New security gates had also been installed to prevent trespassers accessing alleyways behind houses, he said.

"Salah has now scored 38 goals for Liverpool this season Liverpool took a firm grip on their Champions League quarter-final as Manchester City were torn apart by a three-goal burst from Jurgen Klopp's side in the first 31 minutes at Anfield. City's only Premier League defeat as they move to the brink of the title has been a 4-3 loss at Anfield in January - and they were made to suffer once more in the face of Liverpool's pressing, aggression and potent attack. Mohamed Salah pounced in the area to score his 38th goal of the season after 12 minutes and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain doubled their lead eight minutes later when he unleashed a fierce shot past Ederson from 20 yards. And the third goal that gives Liverpool such a commanding advantage to take to Etihad Stadium next Tuesday came just after the half-hour when Sadio Mane rose to head home Salah's cross. Liverpool, potentially crucially, emerged from the second half without conceding an away goal, although an injury that forced Salah off will be a concern. Anfield was at its most hostile - but there were unsavoury incidents before kick-off when fans outside the ground attacked and damaged the Manchester City team coach on its way into the stadium, prompting an ""unreserved"" apology from Liverpool and an investigation from Merseyside Police. This video can not be played We didn't expect the bus to be destroyed - Guardiola Analysis: 'Liverpool expose Man City's hidden flaws' Like a swarm of bees - how Liverpool took control against Man City Man City 'must convince ourselves we can still win' Guardiola 'does not understand' bus attack Relive Liverpool's stunning win against Manchester City Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp had the better of his head-to-head meetings with Pep Guardiola before this game with six wins from 12 games - and he outmanoeuvred his illustrious counterpart once more here. Klopp took this game, if not the entire tie, out of Guardiola's reach by sticking strictly to his instincts and the fiercely intense pressing style that so unsettled City in their only league defeat of the season. Liverpool, in Klopp's trademark style, never took a backward step and have uncovered an approach that rattles City in a manner that has escaped pretty much all of Guardiola's opponents in this stellar season for his side. They never allowed City to relax into their passing style, with the likes of David Silva in particular simply not afforded the time and space that has seen teams picked apart in their runaway league campaign. And Klopp also has the attacking weapons that make Liverpool a team to fear in the shape of the potent triumvirate of Salah, Mane and the underrated Brazilian Roberto Firmino, a trio good enough to expose City's defensive flaws. It was Firmino who picked City apart for the opening goal for Salah, while the Egyptian turned provider for Mane's header to put Liverpool three up before half-time. This video can not be played Liverpool 3-0 Man City: Klopp and Guardiola reaction Guardiola, meanwhile, had a rare night when his tactics went awry and his team selection was questionable. Aymeric Laporte's selection on the left side of City's defence against Salah was always heavily laden with risk and so it proved as he struggled desperately to contain a series of Liverpool raids down his flank. He may have played with comfort against Everton's limp attack on Saturday but this was a different league. Most contentious of all was the exclusion of Raheem Sterling, in such wonderful form, to accommodate Ilkay Gundogan in midfield. Sterling has suffered on previous visits to Anfield since his Â£49m move from Liverpool, becoming a target for sustained abuse from his former supporters. Guardiola perhaps had that in mind when he made this surprise choice but City were left looking unbalanced. Gundogan, a fine player, was peripheral and it was no surprise when he was eventually replaced by Sterling. This was not a good night for Manchester City or Guardiola. They will need a faultless one next Tuesday. All of Manchester City's shots (red arrows) went wide of goal. It is the first time this season they have failed to manage a single shot on target Manchester City started well and in composed fashion as they attempted to douse the flames of a fiery Anfield atmosphere - but it all went wrong from the moment they conceded the first goal to the prolific Salah. City's defence, so rarely put under stress this season, was a mess as Ederson saved from Firmino, Kyle Walker clearing the ball back into the Brazilian's path to set up Salah, whose finish was a formality given his form and confidence. It gave Liverpool the perfect start and they doubled that advantage eight minutes later when James Milner nicked possession and City's rearguard inexplicably stood off Oxlade-Chamberlain, offering an open invitation he accepted by rifling a powerful rising finish past Ederson. There must also be questions about how the diminutive Mane was allowed to rise with ease between Walker and Vincent Kompany to head Liverpool's third just after the half-hour. City's normally precise attacking play was beyond them in the second half when they did finally claim the share of possession they craved as they attacked The Kop end. They were able to fashion several dangerous positions but were sloppy and wasteful as Liverpool avoided any moments of serious anxiety. Klopp celebrated the win passionately but said after the final whistle that it is ""only half-time"" in the tie Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was in celebratory mood after the final whistle as he applauded The Kop and whirled his fists in front of Anfield's giant Main Stand. It was easy to see why - but Liverpool will be taking nothing for granted against a side of City's quality and attacking threat. Liverpool, however, have secured the sort of result they would have dreamed of before kick-off with a three-goal lead to take into the second leg and that vital clean sheet to act as added insurance. And, significantly, Liverpool have just the sort of attack to punish a team pushing for goals, as City will need to do next Tuesday. Guardiola, whose team could clinch the title if they beat Manchester United at Etihad Stadium on Saturday, will not be giving this one up yet but City will need to be flawless in all the areas they were flaky here if they are to mount one of the great Champions League comebacks. Roberto Firmino has had a hand in 11 goals in the Champions League this season (7 goals, 4 assists), a haul only Cristiano Ronaldo can better (17) Liverpool are unbeaten at home in European competition since October 2014 (0-3 vs Real Madrid) and have extended their run without defeat to 15 European games at Anfield (W10 D5). Manchester City failed to direct a single shot on target in a game for the first time since 26 October 2016 (v Man Utd in the League Cup). Pep Guardiola has enjoyed just one win in his past six meetings with Jurgen Klopp in all competitions (D2 L3), with Klopp registering more wins against the Spaniard than any other manager (6). Liverpool are the top-scoring side in the Champions League this season with 31 goals. Indeed, that 31-goal haul is the Reds' biggest tally ever in a single campaign in the competition. 18% of the goals Manchester City have conceded this season in all competitions have been scored by Liverpool (7/38). Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in nine goals in his nine Champions League appearances this season (7 goals, 2 assists). Overall, Salah has bagged 38 goals in all competitions this season; of players in Europe's big five leagues, only Cristiano Ronaldo can better that tally (39). James Milner has registered seven assists in the Champions League this season, three more than any other player. There is no shortage of big games coming up for these two sides.

"A dozen black holes may lie at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, researchers have said. A new analysis provides support for a decades-old prediction that ""supermassive"" black holes at the centres of galaxies are surrounded by many smaller ones. However, previous searches of the Milky Way's centre, where the nearest supermassive black hole is located, have found little evidence for this. Detailsappear in the journal Nature.,external Charles Hailey from Columbia University in New York and colleagues used archival data from Nasa's Chandra X-ray telescope to come to their conclusions. They report the discovery of a dozen inactive and low-mass ""binary systems"", in which a star orbits an unseen companion - the black hole. The supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is surrounded by a halo of gas and dust that provides the perfect breeding ground for the birth of massive stars. These stars live, die and could turn into black holes there. In addition, black holes from outside the halo are believed to fall under the influence of Sgr A* as they lose their energy, causing them to be pulled into its vicinity, where they are held captive by its force. Some of these bind - or ""mate"" - to passing stars, forming binary systems. Previous attempts to detect this population of black holes have looked for the bright bursts of X-rays that are sometimes emitted by black hole binaries. ""The galactic centre is so far away from Earth that those bursts are only strong and bright enough to see about once every 100 to 1,000 years,"" said Prof Hailey. Instead, the Columbia University astrophysicist and his colleagues decided to look for the fainter but steadier X-rays emitted when these binaries are in an inactive state. ""Isolated, unmated black holes are just black - they don't do anything,"" said Prof Hailey. ""But when black holes mate with a low mass star, the marriage emits X-ray bursts that are weaker, but consistent and detectable."" A search for the X-ray signatures of low-mass black hole binaries in the Chandra data turned up 12 within three light-years of Sgr A*. By extrapolating from the properties and distribution of these binaries, the team estimates that there may be 300-500 low-mass binaries and 10,000 isolated low-mass black holes surrounding Sgr A*. Prof Hailey said the finding ""confirms a major theory"", adding: ""It is going to significantly advance gravitational wave research because knowing the number of black holes in the centre of a typical galaxy can help in better predicting how many gravitational wave events may be associated with them."" Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time. They were predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and detected by the Ligo experiment in 2015. One way these ripples arise isthrough the collision of separate black holes.

"Israel Ogunsola was stabbed to death in Link Street, Hackney, just before 20:00 BST Two boys have been arrested after an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death in an east London street. Police officers found Israel Ogunsola wounded in Link Street, Hackney, after they were alerted by a motorist just before 20:00 BST on Wednesday. He was given first aid, but died at the scene. He was initially thought to be aged in his 20s. Less than two miles away a 53-year-old man earlier died at a bookmakers following reports of an assault. It takes the number of people killed in the capital to more than 50 this year. The faces of those killed in London Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales On Thursday, a man in his mid-20s was stabbed in Walthamstow, in Billet Road near Chingford Road, at about 12:50. It is understood his injuries are not considered to be life-threatening. The Hackney stabbing victim was found injured in Link Street, the Met Police said Meanwhile, a man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after three boys were taken to hospital following a stabbing in east London. London Ambulance Service said it treated the patients after being called to Grove Road, Mile End, shortly after 18:00 on Thursday. Police said one boy has minor injuries, but the condition of the other two, both aged 15, is unknown. Flowers and tributes have been left on Link Street near where the 18-year-old was killed The deaths in Hackney follow two fatal shootings on Monday and thefatal stabbing of a suspected burglar on Wednesday. Sixteen-year-oldAmaan Shakoor, from Leyton, was left critically illand died on Tuesday after he was shot in the face in Walthamstow. A 15-year-old boy was stabbed in the same incident but survived. Amaan's death followed that of a17-year-old girl, named locally as Tanesha Melbourne, who was shot and killed in Tottenham. Amaan Shakoor was shot and another boy stabbed in Walthamstow, east London The 17-year-old girl shot and killed in Tottenham has been named locally as Tanesha Melbourne Following the Hackney stabbing, two boys, both aged 17, were arrested on suspicion of murder late on Wednesday night. The dead man's next of kin have been informed. Mark Easton, BBC Home Editor The deliberate killing of one human being by another is a crime that defies easy characterisation. Among the more than 50 tragedies that make up the current spike in homicides in the capital this year are some that may be premeditated or gang-related, but most will be unpredictable acts of violence in moments of mental anguish, involving a victim and a perpetrator who are well known to each other. By far the most likely year of life in which we might be unlawfully killed is not in our teens or early 20s but our first year - babies aged under one are more than twice as likely to be murdered as a 20-year-old.

"This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? UK companies have submitted their gender pay figures ahead of Wednesday's midnight deadline. Just over 10,000 companies did so ahead of the deadline, with more than 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. The median pay gap among all companies that have reported is 9.7%. Of those that have submitted their figures, 78% pay men more than women, 14% pay women more and 8% said they had no gender pay gap, based on the median measure. Firms with more than 250 staff must state the average difference between male and female employees. Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap?

Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here,external. One of the biggest names among the worst offenders so far is Ryanair, which reported a 71.8% gender pay gap. Meanwhile, High Street brands KFC, Matalan, Starbucks, Costa, McDonald's and Primark reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. In terms of bonus gaps, several NHS trusts have some of the highest figures, with Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust General Purposes Charity revealing a figure of 99.4%. Some have criticised the exercise, which also applies to charities and public sector bodies, as a crude mechanism open to misinterpretation. However, gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society says it represents an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn. Sam Smethers, the society's chief executive, said gender pay gap reporting was a game-changer in terms of workplace culture and practices. ""Finally women are realising that they have a right to talk about pay and they cannot be silenced,"" she said. ""By finding out what their colleagues earn, they are then in a position to challenge any pay inequality; it is much more common than people realise."" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said gender pay gap reporting was a chance for companies for businesses to bring about change. However, she warned that companies could not close the gap by themselves. ""Many of the causes of the gender pay gap lie outside the workplace and will require a partnership between companies and government if we are to dliver long-term, lasting change."" Ms Fairbairn said knowing the average pay difference between men and women would help companies develop more inclusive workplaces and support the rise of more women into senior roles. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. Research conducted by Business in the Community found 92% of female respondents would use gender pay gap data to choose between two potential employers. It also found more than than half of women would favour the company with the smallest pay gap or the one that was doing to most to close it. Chloe Chambraud, gender equality director at Business in the Community, said bosses had to understand the factors driving their pay gaps and the groups of women who were most affected. ""Employers must address the root causes of inequality, from reducing bias and increasing transparency in recruitment, appraisal and promotion processes to normalising flexible working, for men and women, and offer financially viable parental leave packages,"" she said. ""Only then we will ensure that men and women have equal lives at work and home."" Data as of 4pm on 4 April. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"This video can not be played How the attack on YouTube's HQ in San Bruno unfolded The suspect in a shooting at YouTube HQ visited a local shooting range just hours before the attack in San Bruno on Tuesday, police said. Nasim Aghdam, who made videos on the platform, legally owned the semi-automatic handgun used in the shooting, police chief Ed Barberini said. She was found dead at the scene, apparently of a self-inflicted wound. Police said the motive for the shooting appeared to be that Aghdam was ""upset with the policies"" of YouTube. Earlier reports suggested the 39-year-old believed YouTube was filtering her videos, and reducing the money she could make on the platform. Three people with gunshot wounds were transported to hospital. Two were released on Tuesday night, but one victim, a man in his 30s, remains in serious condition. ""At this point, we have no indication that she was selecting individuals to fire at,"" Mr Barberini said. ""There's absolutely no link or relationship that we've identified."" Vegan who 'railed against YouTube' YouTube shooting: fake news spreads Mr Barberini said police were trying to access Aghdam's social media accounts ""in order to further comprehend"" her motive. Nasim Aghdam railed against YouTube on her personal website He added that no other suspects were found at the scene, and that police were not searching for anyone else. Mr Barberini also responded to US media reports that Aghdam's family had warned police she might go to YouTube because she ""hated the company."" ""We did not have any information, and we're not aware of any information passed on to any other agency,"" he told reporters. Mr Barberini said Aghdam appeared to have accessed the YouTube campus through a parking area, but said police were still investigating what security, if any, she had bypassed. Local police had previously provided YouTube with ""critical incident"" training, he said. Nasim Aghdam lived in San Diego in southern California. Police have revealed few details about her, but US media said she ran a number of channels and a website, posting videos on a variety of subjects including those highlighting animal cruelty. The channels have now been deleted. Aghdam has been variously described as a vegan bodybuilder, artist and rapper. This video can not be played Police chief Ed Barberini said his officers found a ""chaotic"" scene In January 2017 she posted a video complaining that YouTube was filtering her content, leading to fewer views. On her website she also ranted about the firm, saying: ""Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated, so that people can hardly see their videos."" She also quotes Adolf Hitler, saying: ""Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it."" She also wrote: ""There is no equal growth opportunity on YouTube or any other video sharing site. Your channel will grow if they want [it] to!"" Allow Twitter content?

Aghdam's father, Ismail, told local US media she was angry because YouTube had stopped paying her for videos. He said Aghdam had been reported missing on Monday after not answering calls for two days. Police later found her sleeping in her car in Mountain View, 25km (15 miles) south of the YouTube offices and reported this to her family, but they did not detain her. Her father told police she might go to YouTube as she ""hated the company"", local media said. YouTube terminated her account following the shooting. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have also been removed. How YouTube shooting unfolded online The suspect is reported to have approached an outdoor patio and dining area at the offices in San Bruno, near San Francisco, at about lunchtime on Tuesday and opened fire with a handgun. San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said officers arrived at the offices at 12:48 (19:48 GMT) local time to find a ""chaotic scene"", with numerous people fleeing. Fire officials also said they responded to a fire alarm set off at the same time - though it is not clear if Aghdam or an employee triggered the alarm. Employees were seen leaving with their hands raised, forming a queue to be individually frisked by police. Inside the complex officers then found the body of Nasim Aghdam, killed by a self-inflicted wound. Some 1,700 people work at the YouTube HQ. The company is owned by Google and is the area's biggest employer. Such ""active shooter"" incidents are overwhelmingly carried out by men - an FBI report found thatout of 160 incidents between 2000-2013, only six of the people who opened fire were women,external.

"Mr Zuckerberg has seen shares in his company fall steeply since the start of the Cambridge Analytica scandal Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is to testify before the US House Commerce Committee regarding the firm's use and protection of user data. Facebook has faced criticism after it emerged it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from about 50 million of its users. He will testify before the committee on Wednesday, 11 April. Committee chairman Greg Walden and member Frank Pallone welcomed the decision by Mr Zuckerberg. ""This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online,"" the pair said. Facebook is facing scrutiny over its data collection following allegations that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, obtained data on tens of millions of Facebook users to try to influence elections. Cambridge Analytica worked for US President Donald Trump's campaign. The company, funded in part by Trump supporter and billionaire financier Robert Mercer, paired consumer data with voter information. Cambridge Analytica files spell out election tactics Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Facebook privacy settings revamped after scandal Cambridge Analytica gathered the data through a personality test app, called This Is Your Digital Life, that was downloaded by fewer than 200,000 people. However, the app gave researchers access to the profiles of participants' Facebook friends, allowing them to collect data from millions more users. Mr Walden and Mr Pallone said last month that they wanted to hear directly from Mr Zuckerberg after senior Facebook executives failed to answer questions during a private briefing with congressional staff about how Facebook and third-party developers use and protect consumer data. Facebook has also published new versions of itsterms of service,externalanddata use policy,external. The firmsaid the documents,externalwere longer than the previous versions in order to make their language clearer and more descriptive. The data policy now states: ""We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will."" However, this does not prevent the firm from using the data to let advertisers target their promotions. It will also continue to share anonymised analytics and insights with third-parties. Facebook will now carry out aweek-long consultation,externalbefore finalising the text and adopting it. Facebook, which has two billion users, is now one of the main ways politicians connect with voters. It has been looking to repair its public image and restore users' trust since the Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged. Facebook said last month that it had hired forensic auditors to examine if Cambridge Analytica still had the data. Mr Zuckerberg has apologised for a ""breach of trust"", and taken out full-page advertisements in several UK and US Sunday newspapers. He has also said he welcomes more regulation. The US Senate commerce and judiciary committees also have requested that Mr Zuckerberg appear in front of them. And the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook engaged in unfair acts that caused substantial injury to consumers.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia's proposal for a new, joint investigation into the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in England has been voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hague. Russia has accused Britain of blocking access to an investigation being carried out by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Britain earlier said Russia's call for an inquiry with the UK was ""perverse"". Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. China, Azerbaijan, Sudan, Algeria and Iran were among the countries that backed Russia's motion at the OPCW executive council, Reuters reported. Russia called the meeting to challenge the UK, which has blamed Moscow for the March 4 poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, southern England. Russia has strongly denied any involvement and in a press conference after the vote said what happened in Salisbury looked like a ""terrorist attack"". It strongly criticised the US and EU countries for siding with the UK. The votes backing Russia and the abstentions showed that more than half of the council ""refused to associate themselves with the West's point of view,"" said Russia's ambassador to the OPCW Aleksander Shulgin, He said the UK had told the council ""a dirty flow of complete lies... outright Russophobia"". At the Hague meeting, UK acting representative John Foggo had said the victim of a chemical weapons' attack was not required to work with the ""likely perpetrator"".Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson later accused Russia of trying to undermine the watchdog's work,externaland said the international community had ""seen through these tactics"". Row over Johnson's Salisbury response Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. On Tuesday the UK's Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used in Salisbury, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The comments were seized upon by Russia to discredit the UK's accusations. It has requested that the UN Security Council meet on Thursday to discuss the situation for a second time. At The Hague on Wednesday,the European Union offered its full support to Britain and reiterated that it backed the UK's assessment,externalthat it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was responsible. British envoy Mr Foggo told the emergency OPCW meeting,externalthat the UK had blamed Russia based on: the identification of the nerve agent used knowledge that Russia ""has produced this agent and remains capable of doing so"" Russia's record of conducting state sponsored assassinations The assessment that Russia ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"" He said that Russia had offered more than 24 ""contradictory and changing counter-narratives"" about the attack, including ""preposterous"" suggestions that Sweden, the US or Britain itself could have been responsible. This video can not be played UK Security Minister: It is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" Russia is responsible Russia's President Putin, speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara, said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail. Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russia called the meeting to confront Britain and to propose a new joint investigation with the UK into the Salisbury attack. Western powers portrayed the bid as an attempt to undermine the OPCW's existing investigation. The global watchdog is analysing samples from Salisbury in order to identify the nerve agent used. It was asked to do so by the UK, and Russia was not invited to participate. A team believed to be from the OPCW carry out tests in Salisbury The OPCW expects to receive the results of its independent laboratory tests within a week. Russia has signalled it will reject the results of the investigation if its experts are prohibited from taking part. The watchdog does not have the power to attribute blame, but it could ask the Kremlin to grant its inspectors access to former Soviet Union production facilities to check all of their chemical weapons stockpiles have been destroyed. Analysis by the BBC's David Shukman The only way that scientists can be totally sure who made the Novichok agent is to compare it with another sample of the substance made in the same lab. That's what happened when Sarin was used by Saddam Hussein in Iraq and more recently by President Assad in Syria. Experts already knew which clues to look for, and that allowed them to lay the blame definitively. Novichok is much less well known. The traces of it gathered in Salisbury will have been put through detailed scientific screening and that would reveal the ingredients of the chemical and maybe also its basic structure. That could be matched with whatever is known about Novichok, maybe from lab notes handed over by defectors. And for Porton Down to describe it as ""military grade"" suggests a sophisticated state producer, not an amateur, though that itself is not categorical proof of Russian involvement. That leaves another scenario in this secretive world of smoke and mirrors - that Britain did already have a sample of Novichok and was able to compare it to the agent used on the Skripals but does not want to reveal the fact, to protect a valuable source of intelligence. What are Novichok nerve agents? Questions arose about whether the UK had been too quick to point the finger at Russia after the Porton Down laboratory said that it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent. Porton Down dismissed Russian claims the nerve agent might have come from the laboratory The laboratory said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"" but that it was not its job to say where the agent was manufactured. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. On Twitter, the Russian Embassy highlighted a now-deleted tweet by the UK Foreign Office which suggested Porton Down had said the nerve agent had been produced in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

"Labour has called for an investigation into whether Boris Johnson ""misled"" the public over Russian involvement in the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier implied the foreign secretary had exaggerated the findings of the UK's defence laboratory, Porton Down. Mr Johnson responded that Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""lamentable"". Meanwhile, the international chemical weapons body has rejected Russian calls for a joint inquiry into the case. Former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in hospital after being poisoned by a nerve agent on 4 March. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russian spy: What we know so far Labour said in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But on Tuesday the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Labour called on the prime minister to launch an investigation into whether Mr Johnson broke the ministerial code. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson had ""serious questions to answer"". ""He clearly previously indicated that Porton Down had told him 'categorically' that Russia was the source of the nerve agent,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the foreign secretary had ""egg on his face for the statement he made on German television"". ""Either the foreign secretary has information that he's not sharing with Porton Down or it was a bit of exaggeration,"" he added. Mr Johnson hit back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? UK companies have submitted their gender pay figures ahead of Wednesday's midnight deadline. Just over 10,000 companies did so ahead of the deadline, with more than 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. The median pay gap among all companies that have reported is 9.7%. Of those that have submitted their figures, 78% pay men more than women, 14% pay women more and 8% said they had no gender pay gap, based on the median measure. Firms with more than 250 staff must state the average difference between male and female employees. Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap? What happens to companies that don't publish? Want to find out the gender pay gap at your company? Try the calculator below. Sorry, your browser does not support this lookup       If you can't see the calculator,click here,external. One of the biggest names among the worst offenders so far is Ryanair, which reported a 71.8% gender pay gap. Meanwhile, High Street brands KFC, Matalan, Starbucks, Costa, McDonald's and Primark reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. In terms of bonus gaps, several NHS trusts have some of the highest figures, with Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust General Purposes Charity revealing a figure of 99.4%. Some have criticised the exercise, which also applies to charities and public sector bodies, as a crude mechanism open to misinterpretation. However, gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society says it represents an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn. Sam Smethers, the society's chief executive, said gender pay gap reporting was a game-changer in terms of workplace culture and practices. ""Finally women are realising that they have a right to talk about pay and they cannot be silenced,"" she said. ""By finding out what their colleagues earn, they are then in a position to challenge any pay inequality; it is much more common than people realise."" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said gender pay gap reporting was a chance for companies for businesses to bring about change. However, she warned that companies could not close the gap by themselves. ""Many of the causes of the gender pay gap lie outside the workplace and will require a partnership between companies and government if we are to dliver long-term, lasting change."" Ms Fairbairn said knowing the average pay difference between men and women would help companies develop more inclusive workplaces and support the rise of more women into senior roles. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. Research conducted by Business in the Community found 92% of female respondents would use gender pay gap data to choose between two potential employers. It also found more than than half of women would favour the company with the smallest pay gap or the one that was doing to most to close it. Chloe Chambraud, gender equality director at Business in the Community, said bosses had to understand the factors driving their pay gaps and the groups of women who were most affected. ""Employers must address the root causes of inequality, from reducing bias and increasing transparency in recruitment, appraisal and promotion processes to normalising flexible working, for men and women, and offer financially viable parental leave packages,"" she said. ""Only then we will ensure that men and women have equal lives at work and home."" Data as of 4pm on 4 April. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

The issues faced by disabled flyers wererecently highlighted by the BBC's Frank Gardner, whose wheelchair was lost at Heathrow Airport. The government said it wants to ensure a ""positive"" flying experience. Ministers are also talking to the aviation industry about developing priority storage for wheelchairs so that they can be returned to their owners quickly upon arrival.

By Lucy Webster, BBC News The issues these measures attempt to allay are all too common. As a wheelchair user, I have experienced so many problems that the mere thought of air travel causes a twinge of anxiety. More often than not, my wheelchair is damaged.I have seen my precious motor (detachable, as the airlines like it) be flung with great force onto a pile of luggage, as if it were a bag of clothes and not my only means of independent movement.

"Public Health England (PHE) has suggested a link between areas of social deprivation and drug misuse Seaside resort towns are among those with the highest rates of death from heroin and morphine, figures show. The rate in Blackpool, which topped the list, is twice as high as anywhere else in England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Its survey,externalalso shows that, of the 14 places with the highest such death rates, 10 are coastal communities. The ONS said many seaside towns struggled as foreign holidays increased in popularity. Public Health England (PHE) has suggested a link between areas of social deprivation and drug misuse. Why don't we go to the beach any more? Why is heroin killing so many people? As well as Blackpool; Hastings, Neath Port Talbot, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Thanet, Swansea, Barrow-in-Furness, Gosport and Scarborough all have more than 4.5 heroin and opiate deaths per 100,000 people. This compares with the national average of 1.7 in England and 2.3 in Wales. Away from the coast, Burnley, Hyndburn, Blackburn and Reading had the highest death rates from heroin and morphine. According to government figures, nine out of the 10 most deprived neighbourhoods in England are seaside communities, a list also topped by Blackpool. PHE said low rates of employment, poor quality housing and deprivation are associated with substance abuse. These social factors can reduce the success of drug treatment, it said. The British Hospitality Association has previously said it wants a ""Seaside Tsar"" to create ""coastal powerhouses"" and boost the appeal of run-down, dated and poverty-stricken resort towns. A general increase in death rates from heroin and morphine misuse occurred between 1993 (when data was first collected) and 1996, the ONS said. Since then they levelled out and remain at around 80% of all opiate deaths. According to the report, the rise has been linked to the so-called ""Trainspotting generation"" which became addicted to heroin in the 1980s and 90s. It said this generational addiction may also explain why the highest rate of death from drugs misuse in 2016 was among 40 to 49-year-olds. For the first time, that age group had more deaths than the group aged 30 to 39 years. Opiate-linked death rate rises in Wales Why is heroin killing so many?

"This video can not be played How the attack on YouTube's HQ in San Bruno unfolded The suspect in a shooting at YouTube HQ visited a local shooting range just hours before the attack in San Bruno on Tuesday, police said. Nasim Aghdam, who made videos on the platform, legally owned the semi-automatic handgun used in the shooting, police chief Ed Barberini said. She was found dead at the scene, apparently of a self-inflicted wound. Police said the motive for the shooting appeared to be that Aghdam was ""upset with the policies"" of YouTube. Earlier reports suggested the 39-year-old believed YouTube was filtering her videos, and reducing the money she could make on the platform. Three people with gunshot wounds were transported to hospital. Two were released on Tuesday night, but one victim, a man in his 30s, remains in serious condition. ""At this point, we have no indication that she was selecting individuals to fire at,"" Mr Barberini said. ""There's absolutely no link or relationship that we've identified."" Vegan who 'railed against YouTube' YouTube shooting: fake news spreads Mr Barberini said police were trying to access Aghdam's social media accounts ""in order to further comprehend"" her motive. Nasim Aghdam railed against YouTube on her personal website He added that no other suspects were found at the scene, and that police were not searching for anyone else. Mr Barberini also responded to US media reports that Aghdam's family had warned police she might go to YouTube because she ""hated the company."" ""We did not have any information, and we're not aware of any information passed on to any other agency,"" he told reporters. Mr Barberini said Aghdam appeared to have accessed the YouTube campus through a parking area, but said police were still investigating what security, if any, she had bypassed. Local police had previously provided YouTube with ""critical incident"" training, he said. Nasim Aghdam lived in San Diego in southern California. Police have revealed few details about her, but US media said she ran a number of channels and a website, posting videos on a variety of subjects including those highlighting animal cruelty. The channels have now been deleted. Aghdam has been variously described as a vegan bodybuilder, artist and rapper. This video can not be played Police chief Ed Barberini said his officers found a ""chaotic"" scene In January 2017 she posted a video complaining that YouTube was filtering her content, leading to fewer views. On her website she also ranted about the firm, saying: ""Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated, so that people can hardly see their videos."" She also quotes Adolf Hitler, saying: ""Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.""

"Labour has called for an investigation into whether Boris Johnson ""misled"" the public over Russian involvement in the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier implied the foreign secretary had exaggerated the findings of the UK's defence laboratory, Porton Down. Mr Johnson responded that Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""lamentable"". Meanwhile, the international chemical weapons body has rejected Russian calls for a joint inquiry into the case. Former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in hospital after being poisoned by a nerve agent on 4 March. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russian spy: What we know so far Labour said in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But on Tuesday the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Labour called on the prime minister to launch an investigation into whether Mr Johnson broke the ministerial code. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson had ""serious questions to answer"". ""He clearly previously indicated that Porton Down had told him 'categorically' that Russia was the source of the nerve agent,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the foreign secretary had ""egg on his face for the statement he made on German television"". ""Either the foreign secretary has information that he's not sharing with Porton Down or it was a bit of exaggeration,"" he added. Mr Johnson hit back on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

The UK has said that identifying the substance at Porton Down was ""only one part of the intelligence picture"". It comes as Russia has also sought to discredit the UK's accusations.

It had sought a joint inquiry after the UK blamed it for being the source of the Novichok nerve agent used. Russia accused the UK of blocking access to an investigation being carried out by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But it lost by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Following the verdict, Mr Johnson said Russia had failed in its attempts to ""obscure the truth"" and ""derail the proper international process"". Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia has said the comments from Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead reveal the UK's case to be ""nothing but assumptions"". The Foreign Office said the deleted tweet had been part of a real-time account of a speech by the UK's ambassador in Moscow and was deleted because it ""did not accurately report our ambassador's words"". It added: ""None of this changes the fact that it is our assessment that Russia was responsible for this brazen and reckless act and, as the international community agrees, there is no other plausible explanation. ""No other country has a combination of the capability, the intent, and the motive to carry out such an act."" BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Johnson's ""loose language"" plus the deleted tweet represented a ""self-inflicted wound"" by the UK. This had ""muddied the waters"" and allowed Russia to cast doubt on the UK's assessment, he said - but he added that the ""international alliance"" supporting the UK's position was ""still holding"".

"Rupali Meshram (left) took a selfie with her mother soon after the attack A young Indian woman was lucky to survive, doctors say, after she fought off a tiger which attacked her goat. Rupali Meshram, 23, said when she heard the goat scream she ran out of her house in western Maharashtra state. She picked up a stick and hit the tiger, which then attacked her. Her mother, who was also injured, saved her by pulling her inside the house. They both sustained only minor injuries and have now been discharged from hospital. The goat did not survive. Ms Meshram took a selfie of her bloodied face soon after the attack, which happened last week but has only just come to light. A doctor who treated her praised her ""exemplary courage"" in fighting off the tiger, but said she was lucky not to have been bitten by the animal. Ms Meshram suffered injuries to her head, waist, legs and hands, but they were only superficial and she has been able to make a full recovery. Her hospital discharge note records a ""wild animal attack"" Because of her head injury she was given a CT scan and kept under observation. ""I thought my daughter was going to die,"" her mother Jijabhai told BBC Hindi's Sanjay Tiwari, adding that she had been horrified to see her blood-stained daughter trying to fend off the tiger with a stick.

"Prince Philip was once described by the Queen as ""my strength and stay all these years"" and his lifetime of public service is testimony to that. When the Duke of Edinburgh does finally stand down from his royal duties this autumn, it will bring to a close the decades of him being at Her Majesty's side at all kinds of events at home and abroad. And that is not to mention the 22,191 solo engagements he has undertaken in his role as the longest-serving consort in British history. He is involved with more than 780 different organisations. When he reached the grand old age of 90, his only concession to his passing years was that he gave up his connections to about a dozen of them. One of the most successful associations has been with the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, a youth self-improvement scheme, which began in 1956. But in an interview withthe BBC's Fiona Bruce when he turned 90,the Duke said he could not take credit for the highly successful scheme. ""I don't run it - I've said it's all fairly second-hand the whole business. I mean, I eventually got landed with the responsibility or the credit for it. ""I've got no reason to be proud of it. It's satisfying that we've set up a formula that works - that's it."" His reluctance to claim credit for that scheme resonates with what the Queen said of him in a speech when celebrating their golden wedding anniversary in 1997. She described him as ""someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know"". In 1961 the duke became the first president of the World Wildlife Fund UK, but then faced criticism over his shooting of a tiger while in India that same year. He eventually became the organisation's international president in 1981. Part of Prince Philip's distinguished naval career was spent in Malta The Greek-born prince's life of service to the UK began when he joined up with the Royal Navy in 1939. He saw active service in World War Two, from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean, being mentioned in despatches for his service on battleship HMS Valiant in 1941. By that time he had met his distant cousin, Princess Elizabeth. Their friendship blossomed into love and they married in 1947, at which point he renounced his Greek title to become a naturalised British subject, and was made Duke of Edinburgh by King George VI. Prince Philip's naval career, which saw the newly-married couple stationed in Malta,  ended when George VI died in February 1952, and the princess became Queen. Now Prince Philip had a new role, accompanying Her Majesty around the world, on Commonwealth tours, state visits and trips across the UK. That globetrotting has seen him visit 143 countries in an official capacity in the decades that followed. And the prince is credited with helping to save engineering in Britain in the 1970s, being described as playing a vital role in creating a national engineering academy. In 2015 he told the BBCthat after World War Two the UK was ""completely skint - it seemed to me that the only way we were going to recover was through engineering"". The prince has been at the Queen's side for nearly 70 years When talking about a footman training programme which he began at the Palace, he said: ""I tried to find useful things to do."" And he oversaw the modernisation of Buckingham Palace, as well as reorganising the Balmoral and Sandringham estates and becoming ranger of Windsor Great Park. He played polo regularly until 1971 and then took up four-in-hand carriage driving, representing Britain at several European and world championships. He competed at international level carriage events until the age of 85. And he became a qualified pilot, gaining his RAF wings in 1953, helicopter wings in 1956 and private pilot's licence in 1959. He also kept up his love for the sea, competing regularly at Cowes Regatta. His public statements have been rare over the years and even rarer has been any direct dealings with the media. When he did agree to take part in an ITV documentary last year to mark 60 years of the Duke of Edinburgh's award, he only spent a very small amount of time on screen with host Phillip Schofield and famously asked ahead of their last meeting ""How many more times have we got to do this?"".

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia's call for a joint inquiry into the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in England is ""perverse"", the UK has told the international chemical weapons watchdog in the Hague. The victim of an attack is not required to work with the ""likely perpetrator"", UK acting representative John Foggo told the OPCW's executive council. Russia called the meeting to challenge the UK, which has blamed Moscow for the March 4 poisoning. It has strongly denied any involvement. The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, southern England. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. On Tuesday the UK's Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used in Salisbury, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The comments were seized upon by Russia to discredit the UK's accusations. On Wednesday,the European Union re-iterated that it backed the UK's assessment,externalthat it was highly likely that Russia was responsible. Row over Johnson's Salisbury response Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility In the Hague, Mr Foggo told the emergency OPCW meeting,externalthat the UK had blamed Russia based on: the identification of the nerve agent used knowledge that Russia ""has produced this agent and remains capable of doing so"" Russia's record of conducting state sponsored assassinations The assessment that Russia ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"" He said that Russia had offered more than 24 ""contradictory and changing counter-narratives"" about the attack, including ""preposterous"" suggestions that Sweden, the US or Britain itself could have been responsible. This video can not be played UK Security Minister: It is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" Russia is responsible The EU delegation offered its full support to Britain, saying Russia had unleashed ""a flood of insinuations targeting its member states"" in the aftermath of the poisoning. Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russia's President Putin, speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara, said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail. Russia called the meeting because, among other things, it wants to know what kind of evidence the UK has provided to the OPCW - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; which inspectors visited the site of the attack in Salisbury, who they met and where the samples are being analysed. A team believed to be from the OPCW carry out tests in Salisbury Diplomats at the OPCW said the Russian proposal for a joint inquiry - seen by Western powers as an attempt to undermine the OPCW's existing investigation - was unlikely to be approved by the 41-nation executive council. The OPCW expects to receive the results of its own independent laboratory tests within a week. It does not have the power to attribute blame, but it could ask the Kremlin to grant its inspectors access to former Soviet Union production facilities to check all of their chemical weapons stockpiles have been destroyed. The EU has said it is very concerned that Russia might reject the results of the investigation. Earlier, Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said in Moscow that the poisoning was a ""grotesque provocation... that was crudely concocted by the British and American security services"" to implicate Russia. ""It is appropriate to say that the dark times of the Cold War are back,"" he said. Analysis by the BBC's David Shukman The only way that scientists can be totally sure who made the Novichok agent is to compare it with another sample of the substance made in the same lab. That's what happened when Sarin was used by Saddam Hussein in Iraq and more recently by President Assad in Syria. Experts already knew which clues to look for, and that allowed them to lay the blame definitively. Novichok is much less well known. The traces of it gathered in Salisbury will have been put through detailed scientific screening and that would reveal the ingredients of the chemical and maybe also its basic structure. That could be matched with whatever is known about Novichok, maybe from lab notes handed over by defectors. And for Porton Down to describe it as ""military grade"" suggests a sophisticated state producer, not an amateur, though that itself is not categorical proof of Russian involvement. That leaves another scenario in this secretive world of smoke and mirrors - that Britain did already have a sample of Novichok and was able to compare it to the agent used on the Skripals but does not want to reveal the fact, to protect a valuable source of intelligence. What are Novichok nerve agents? Questions arose about whether the UK had been too quick to point the finger at Russia after the Porton Down laboratory said that it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent. Porton Down dismissed Russian claims the nerve agent might have come from the laboratory The laboratory, which had previously identified the Novichok nerve agent, said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"" but said it was not its job to say where the agent was manufactured. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. On Twitter, the Russian Embassy highlighted a now-deleted tweet by the UK Foreign Office which suggested Porton Down had said the nerve agent had been produced in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

""Unlike Russia, we allow the media to come and meet our scientists and question the science,"" he said. ""That's important. That's why we have this debate today: we have nothing to hide.""

"For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need. Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room. The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her. Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says. So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps. There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique. A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community. More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool: Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking. The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated. Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness."" Indian woman fights off tiger with stick Malaysians roast MasterChef over chicken rendang Parents find lost daughter after 24-year search Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped. By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem. Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous. ""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone."" When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families. The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions. Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services. For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help. She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal. Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having. ""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it."" Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?"" TheShanti Project,external, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham. Others include a volunteer-ledSikh Helpline,external, theDerby Recovery Network,external,BAC-IN,external, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband. Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home. But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on."" Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him. ""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen."" Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed. If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this article, please see the resources listed onBBC Action Line.

"The Duke of Edinburgh is to have surgery on his hip under general anaesthetic at a London hospital. Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital in Marylebone on Tuesday afternoon for the planned procedure. The 96-year-old retired from royal duties last August. Exact details of the duke's condition have not been issued but his absence at the Easter service at Windsor was said to have been because of a hip problem. He also did not attend two other recent events at Windsor Castle - the Royal Maundy Service at St George's Chapel on 29 March and a parade on 22 March to mark Prince Andrew's appointment as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. Prince Philip's decades of royal duty Philip honoured on wedding anniversary A statement released by Buckingham Palace to announce the treatment said: ""Further updates will be issued when appropriate."" The surgery comes ahead of a busy time for the royal family, with the Duchess of Cambridge due to give birth to her third child this month, and the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May. The duke announced his retirement in May 2017, after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. Prince Philip made his final solo engagement in August But he has continued to accompany the Queen at events A month later he was admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital as ""a precautionary measure"" following an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. His final solo engagement was on 2 August last year, when he reviewed a parade of Royal Marines outside Buckingham Palace in his capacity as Captain General of the corps. He has since appeared several times at engagements alongside the Queen and was seen with other members of the royal family at the Christmas Day service at Sandringham. By BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond When he first met the then-Princess Elizabeth, he is said to have showed off by leaping over the tennis court nets at Dartmouth Naval College. His spin bowling was so good that the Australian cricketing legend Sir Don Bradman said he should play for England. In the 1960s he was one of the top four polo players in Britain. When he gave up polo, he took up carriage driving. And all the while he encouraged others to lead a sporting and active life, as president of the National Playing Fields Association, a patron of Outward Bound and through the establishment of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. Much of that activity has come to an end as age has taken its toll. The Duke is 96. But in early March he was seen carriage driving at Windsor. Incapacity will be a torment to a man so used to activity. His doctors will want him up and about as soon as possible after the operation, to kick-start the healing process. They will find it difficult to restrain him. King Edward VII's Hospital was founded in 1899 and has treated other senior royals including the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. Prince Philip has spent much of his life in good health, but was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection a year later. In June 2013 he spent 11 nights at the London Clinic, another private hospital in central London, where he underwent exploratory abdominal surgery. In May 2014, he had a ""minor procedure"" on his right hand, with the treatment carried out inside Buckingham Palace. By BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher Surgery at any stage of life carries risks. But patients are not ruled out of surgery based on their age alone. For patients like Prince Philip, overall fitness is a bigger factor than how old they are. This will be a decision between patient and surgeon assessing the benefits and the risks of the planned procedure. In general, frailty increases with age and does increase the risks of major surgery. We do not know what type of hip operation Prince Philip is having. Most hip replacement operations in the UK take place on patients between the ages of 60 and 80. However, such operations do take place even later in life. Back in 1995, the Queen Mother had a successful hip replacement at the age of 95.

"Labour has called for an investigation into whether Boris Johnson ""misled"" the public over Russian involvement in the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier implied the foreign secretary had exaggerated the findings of the UK's defence laboratory, Porton Down. Mr Johnson responded that Mr Corbyn's remarks were ""lamentable"". Meanwhile, the international chemical weapons body has rejected Russian calls for a joint inquiry into the case. Former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in hospital after being poisoned by a nerve agent on 4 March. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow.

But on Tuesday the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Labour called on the prime minister to launch an investigation into whether Mr Johnson broke the ministerial code. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, said Mr Johnson had ""serious questions to answer"". ""He clearly previously indicated that Porton Down had told him 'categorically' that Russia was the source of the nerve agent,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said the foreign secretary had ""egg on his face for the statement he made on German television"".

"This video can not be played UK car industry 'will get good Brexit deal' says minister Vauxhall's French parent company PSA has announced an investment in its Luton van-making plant which could eventually see Peugeot and Citroen-branded vans made in the UK. PSA said Vauxhall's next Vivaro van would be built at the Luton plant. The investment, which PSA said it made ""despite Brexit uncertainties"", secures 1,400 jobs beyond 2030. However, the Unite union said there was still ""a cloud hanging over"" Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant. The government said the investment is worth more than Â£100m in total. The Unite union estimates that figure to be up to Â£170m. It was secured after a negotiation with the Unite union and a financial contribution from the government thought to be about Â£9m. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's decision is a vote of confidence in Vauxhall's high-skilled workforce and the UK's world leading automotive sector."" In 2017, the Luton plant produced 70,000 Vauxhall Vivaro-branded vans. The next-generation model will be based on PSA's Citroen and Peugeot technology, and the company hopes to produce up to 100,000 vans a year, which could include some under the Peugeot and Citroen brands. The life-cycle of commercial vehicles is between 10 and 15 years. If demand for the vehicles means that target is hit, then additional jobs will be created in Luton. PSA bought General Motors' European business last year, and there has been intense speculation about the future of both Luton and Ellesmere port, where the Vauxhall Astra is made. Group chief executive Carlos Tavares said: ""This is a major milestone for the future of the Luton plant and a key enabler to serve our ambitions in the commercial vehicle market."" Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""The investment into Luton is very welcome, but we do expect to hear of similar plans for Ellesmere Port, where the workforce has been just as loyal and is just as deserving of a secure future but continues to live with a cloud hanging over it."" Peugeot and Citroen have made inroads into the light commercial vehicle market, and accounted for half the increase in the total van market in Europe, which is why the company is looking to increase production capacity. Company officials said it had the choice of Germany or Poland to base the new plant, but neither of those plants are equipped with a paint facility suitable for vans, and installing one would come at enormous cost. Vauxhall employs 1,400 people at its Luton plant, which produces Vivaro vans There has been a plant at Luton building vehicles since 1905 The firm has 1,300 employees at its Ellesmere Port plant, where the Vauxhall Astra is built The Ellesmere Port plant has been running since 1962 Vauxhall has 3,400 employees overall Brexit: 'No deal' would hurt car industry First fall in UK car production in 8 years UK car production falls in November Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Four Amazon adverts for electronic devices have been banned for ""misleading"" customers over potential savings. The adverts, all from July 2017, highlighted savings of up Â£300 compared with recommended retail prices (RRPs). But complaints the RRPs were misleading and unsubstantiated were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority. Amazon admitted one advert was an ""error"" but said the other RRPs were in line with listings on other sites. The adverts flagged up savings of Â£220 on an LG smart TV, Â£193 on a ViewSonic monitor, Â£300 on an MSI laptop and Â£185 on a Philips electronic toothbrush. Each listing received one complaint. Amazon said the saving for the TV had been calculated incorrectly but argued that the RRPs used in the other three adverts were similar to prices displayed on other retail websites or by sellers on Amazon Marketplace. Tom Daley swimming pool selfie ad banned ASA considers inquiry into Amazon Prime Six universities told to change advertising claims Amazon's argument was rejected by the advertising regulator and the complaints that all four adverts were ""misleading"" and unsubstantiated were upheld. The ASA said that consumers would understand the reference to an RRP to mean that the advertised product was generally sold at the stated price across the market. However, the ASA checked the prices that the monitor - listed with an RRP of Â£752 but available for Â£559 - had been sold at over the previous six weeks. They found it had been sold at the higher price for nine days, then at a lower price for 14 days, then again at the higher price for two days, and after that, at a lower price for 16 days. The ASA said the price fluctuations ""did not demonstrate that Amazon usually sold the product at the higher price of Â£752"". Similar inconsistencies were found in the RRPs for the other products. An ASA statement read: ""We told Amazon to ensure that future references to RRPs reflected the price at which the products concerned were generally sold, and to ensure that they held adequate evidence to substantiate their savings claims."" An Amazon spokesman said: ""Our customers come to Amazon and expect to find low prices and incredible deals, and we work hard to provide both all year long."" Amazon was one of three companies criticised last yearby consumer group Which? after a year-long investigation into ""Black Friday"" prices found that many deals advertised on the day were cheaper or the same price at other times of year. Which? advised shoppers to ""look at the price, not the 'saving'.""

"Ray Wilkins was capped 84 times by England Former England and Chelsea midfielder Ray Wilkins has died in hospital at the age of 61. Wilkins, who also played for Manchester United, AC Milan, Rangers and QPR,was being treated at St George's Hospitalin London following cardiac arrest. His family thanked ""Ray's friends, colleagues and members of the public"" for the many messages of goodwill. Chelsea said they were ""devastated to learn of the passing of our former player, captain and assistant coach"". The club added: ""Rest in peace, Ray, you will be dreadfully missed."" Wilkins' family said: ""It is with great sadness we announce that Raymond Colin Wilkins passed away this morning. ""Ray leaves behind his loving wife, Jackie, daughter Jade, son Ross, and his beautiful grandchildren, Oliver, Frankie, Ava, Freddie, Jake and Archie. ""We are asking for privacy at this very difficult time."" This video can not be played 'Wilkins was a wonderful human being' Wilkins, who had been working as a TV and radio pundit, had suffered poor health in recent years and had double bypass heart surgery in July 2017. He also admitted struggling with alcohol problems in the past and went through a five-week rehabilitation programme in the Priory Hospital in Woking in 2016 following a four-year ban for drink-driving. As a player he made 84 appearances for England and captained his country 10 times, while he won the FA Cup with Manchester United in 1983 and the Scottish league title with Rangers in 1989. Wilkins had spells as manager of QPR, Fulham and the Jordan national team. He was also Chelsea assistant coach from 1998-2000 and then 2008 until 2010, when he worked alongside Guus Hiddink and Carlo Ancelotti. Wilkins was remembered at Wednesday's Milan derby BeforeWednesday evening's Milan derby,former AC Milan team-mate Franco Baresi led a minute's applause in honour of Wilkins, and laid a bouquet of flowers and a 'Wilkins 8' Milan shirt in front of the famous Curva Sud stand. The EFL said a period of applause will be held before Sunday's Checkatrade Trophy final at Wembley Stadium between Lincoln City and Shrewsbury Town and that it would offer its ""full support for any proposed marks of respect"" from any clubs. Ray Wilkins' playing career Chelsea Crystal Palace Manchester United Wycombe Wanderers AC Milan Hibernian Paris St-Germain Millwall Rangers Leyton Orient QPR BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Wilkins' career was characterised by maturity and dignity, which was recognised early in his time at Chelsea, where he made his debut as a 17-year-old in October 1973 before being awarded the captaincy at just 18 by then manager Eddie McCreadie. He went on to make his England debut in the Bicentennial Tournament against Italy in New York City in May 1976 and had a burgeoning reputation as one of the young pin-up boys of English football, as well as one of its most promising talents. Wilkins led a group of emerging Chelsea youngsters back into the top flight, but once they were relegated again it became inevitable that top-flight clubs would pounce. So it proved as he signed for Manchester United in August 1979. He acquired an unfair reputation for a conservative playing style, with one cruel nickname of 'The Crab' mocking his supposed preference for sideways passes. Those who actually played with Wilkins thought differently and spoke of an elegant, visionary midfield player and leader whose abilities were underrated, as evidenced by the calibre of clubs who were always keen to secure his services. READ MORE:Farewell to a footballing nomad and an 'absolute gentleman' England manager Gareth Southgate, who played alongside Wilkins at Crystal Palace:""When he played with us you could immediately see that his technical ability to play the ball was phenomenal. ""In the modern game, those attributes would have been appreciated far more than they were at that time, so he really was a top, top player. ""He would have been one of the earliest to go abroad and play in the Italian league. At the time, it was at a really high level so being able to transition into a club like AC Milan and be as popular as he was there speaks volumes for his ability. ""It was really sad when I heard what happened at the weekend. It's happened so suddenly and it's tragic for Jackie and his family. ""Ray was a great ambassador for the game, a proud Englishman who loved playing for his country and an absolute gent - a class act."" Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson:""Ray was a great football man who was well respected and liked by all who knew him and he always had a kind word and time for people. ""Ray was an impressive football talent and had a fantastic career representing some of the biggest clubs in the world. He will be missed by us all."" Former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard:""Devastated to hear the news that Ray Wilkins has passed away. He was a great player and an even greater man. Full of kindness and humility, with impeccable manners at all times. He had respect and time for everyone and to me he was a mentor and a friend. I'm not sure they make them like Ray anymore. You will be sorely missed fella."" Ex-Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson:""Was only two weeks ago I was with Ray in Brighton... Feel Empty - Much love to all the Family... Life is Cruel... RIP BUD..."" Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore:""His passion for the game was second to none and his pleasure in sharing it never diminished. He will be missed by all of us."" Former AC Milan defender Franco Baresi:""In these moments you never know what to say, but it was an honour to have you as a companion, you were special, a gentleman on the field and out. Thank you Ray Wilkins RIP."" Ex-England striker Gary Lineker:""Deeply saddened to hear that Ray Wilkins has passed away. A wonderful footballer and a delightful man. It was a pleasure to have played alongside him with England. No team-mate was more helpful and supportive. I'll be forever grateful. Thoughts are with his family. #RIPRay."" Former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel:""Sad and choked to hear of the passing of Ray Wilkins. A true football person with a totally underestimated contribution to our sport. One of the best I've seen. My thoughts are with his family. Rest in peace."" Ex-England winger Chris Waddle:""So sorry to hear about Ray Wilkins a great player and a true gentleman RIP."" Former England and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer:""So sad to hear the news about Ray Wilkins. He lived for and loved football. I was lucky enough to have worked with him and he was always a true gentleman. He will be sorely missed by so many. #RIPRay."" Former Manchester United team-mate Mickey Thomas on BBC Radio Wales:""He was a great guy, one unbelievable man. ""He became an instant star at Chelsea and when he went to Old Trafford in a big money move there was a lot of pressure on him. He found it difficult initially but he won the fans over and became a legend there - he became a legend wherever he played. ""In today's game, money couldn't buy him - he was a gifted individual, such a talented footballer."" League Managers Association chairman Howard Wilkinson:""Ray lived and breathed football his whole career. As a player, he was a leader on the pitch and he instilled his beliefs and values into his coaching, helping a vast number of players understand what it meant to win games of football at the highest level. ""Ray has been a stalwart of the LMA for many years. His energy and love of the game were his biggest strengths. As well as being a manager in his own right, he became one of the most supportive and trusted assistant managers in the Premier League, providing a sounding board to many managers in the past 20 years and achieving great successes with his boyhood club, Chelsea. ""Many things come to mind when I think of Ray but, above all, no matter what the circumstances he remained a true gentleman."" Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish:""So upset to hear the news of Ray Wilkins. RIP Ray. Even when Ray left Villa, he was always ringing me offering advice and telling me what I could do to improve. A true gentleman and one of the nicest guys I've ever met."" Former England and Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand:""RIP Ray Wilkins. Always so humble & softly spoken whenever I saw him. Genuine lovely guy. Watched him live at Loftus Road many times for QPR. What a great passer & teacher of the game for any young kids who watched him."" Ex-Rangers defender and team-mate John Brown:""It was a privilege to have played alongside Ray and to have known him as a true friend and gentleman.""

"This video can not be played How the attack on YouTube's HQ in San Bruno unfolded The suspect in a gun attack at YouTube's HQ in California had expressed anger over its treatment of her video postings, media reports say. Police have named Nasim Aghdam, 39, as the suspect but say they are still investigating a motive. US media say Aghdam was angry that YouTube was filtering her videos and reducing the money she could make. Tuesday's attack left a man and two women injured with gunshot wounds. The attacker shot herself dead. Police in San Bruno, California, say there is no evidence yet that the attacker knew the victims,external, a 36-year-old man said to be in a critical condition, and two women aged 32 and 27. Nasim Aghdam lived in San Diego in southern California. Vegan bodybuilder with a vast online presence Police have revealed few details about her but US media said she ran a number of channels and a website, posting videos on a variety of subjects including those highlighting animal cruelty. The channels have now been deleted. Aghdam has been variously described as a vegan bodybuilder, artist and rapper. Nasim Aghdam railed against YouTube on her personal website In January 2017 she posted a video complaining that YouTube was filtering her content, leading to fewer views. On her website she also ranted against YouTube, saying: ""Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated, so that people can hardly see their videos."" She also quotes Adolf Hitler, saying: ""Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it."" And she wrote: ""There is no equal growth opportunity on YouTube or any other video sharing site. Your channel will grow if they want [it] to!"" Aghdam's father, Ismail, told local US media she was angry because YouTube had stopped paying her for videos. Video posters can receive money from linked advertisements but the company can ""de-monetise"" channels for various reasons, taking adverts off. It is unclear if this happened with Aghdam's material. Her father said Aghdam had been reported missing on Monday after not answering calls for two days. Police later found her sleeping in her car in Mountain View, 25km (15 miles) south of the YouTube offices in San Bruno and reported this to her family, but they did not detain her. Her father told police she might go to YouTube as she ""hated the company"", local media said. YouTube terminated her account following the shooting. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have also been removed. However, many Twitter users posted her Facebook video rant against YouTube: Allow Twitter content?

The suspect is reported to have approached an outdoor patio and dining area at the offices in San Bruno, near San Francisco, at about lunchtime on Tuesday and opened fire with a handgun. San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said officers arrived at the offices at 12:48 (19:48 GMT) local time to find a ""chaotic scene"", with numerous people fleeing. Images broadcast on local TV stations showed employees leaving with their hands raised. Other footage showed evacuees forming a queue before being individually frisked by police. Police said officers had ""encountered one victim with an apparent gunshot wound at the site and two additional gunshot victims that had fled to a neighbouring business"". Inside the complex, officers then found a woman dead from a gunshot wound that was believed to be self-inflicted. People gathered outside the YouTube building with their arms raised as the incident unfolded An employee at a nearby fast food restaurant told Fox station KTVU he had treated a young woman who suffered a bullet wound to the leg. He said he had fashioned a makeshift tourniquet from a bungee cord as they waited for first responders. Several YouTube employees tweeted about the attack as it was taking place. Product manager Todd Sherman said people fled the building in panic as the shooting unfolded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The three wounded were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Officials said the 32-year-old woman's condition was serious and the 27-year-old's condition was fair. A fourth person was also taken to hospital with an ankle injury sustained while trying to escape, Mr Barberini said. Some 1,700 people work at the YouTube HQ. The company is owned by Google and is the area's biggest employer. There had been earlier media reports that the man shot was Aghdam's boyfriend, but police later said; ""At this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted."" Such ""active shooter"" incidents are overwhelmingly carried out by men - an FBI report found thatout of 160 incidents between 2000-2013, only six of the people who opened fire were women,external.

"Greater Manchester Police said it was called to reports that the body of a baby had been found A body of a newborn baby has been found in woodland, police have said. The remains were found near Peel Lane in Heywood, Rochdale, at about 07:10 BST. Greater Manchester Police, which initially said the child had been found in a field, is searching a large wooded area. A cordon remains in place, and detectives have appealed for anyone with information about the death to contact them. Police officers are searching the scene The woodland is part of Roch Valley Woods and is popular with local families, dog walkers and children. Millie Crosdale and Jess Hawkins, both 18 and live locally, laid flowers by the police cordon. ""It is heartbreaking really, all you can do is come and pay your respects,"" Ms Crosdale said. Ms Hawkins said: ""This is where we all come down in the summer and it's nice, when it's snowing you bring your kids down with the sleds. ""You wouldn't think something like that would happen here."" Stuart Pollitt, BBC North West Tonight Around a dozen police officers have been scouring this woodland, and police dogs have also been seen inside the large cordon. The baby was discovered at the bottom of a hill in parkland off Peel Lane. Already some local people have been delivering teddy bears and flowers to the site after hearing the news. One mother who brought a teddy was in tears as she told me she felt moved to pay her respects as she has a nine-day-old baby herself. Hearing the news this morning made her feel emotional, she said.

"This video can not be played Vince Cable launched the campaign in Watford Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable claimed his party was a ""well-kept secret"" defying opinion polls as he launched its local election campaign. He said the party was winning local council by-elections in all areas, which had gone unreported. Sir Vince claimed the Lib Dems were ""on the way back"" through local government and were the ""only party"" campaigning for another EU referendum. Voters go to the polls across England on 3 May for local elections. Seats on about 150 councils are up for grabs, on a mixture of metropolitan, unitary, borough and district authorities. A guide to the 2018 council elections Local elections: Are they about bins or Brexit? The Liberal Democrats had a mixed night in last year's general election - which left them with 12 MPs - and polls do not suggest a surge in support for their anti-Brexit stance, which includes a pledge for a referendum on the final deal reached with the EU. But as he launched his party's campaign with a speech in Watford, Sir Vince said: ""This country has a well-kept secret, which is what's been happening pretty much every Thursday since the general election."" He said the Lib Dems had been gaining seats in local council by-elections, which are held on Thursdays, from Labour and the Conservatives and were ""much the strongest of the three parties when it comes to these contests"" but he insisted this had largely gone unreported by the media. As a result, he claimed, ""we are doing about twice as well as the public opinion polls suggest we are."" ""We are very much on the way back - and we are on the way back through local government,"" he told an audience of party activists at Watford Football Club's Vicarage Road stadium. The Lib Dems have been on about 8% in national opinion polls since the general election. The party has made a net gain of 15 council seats over the same period, according to BBC research, compared with seven gains for Labour and a loss of 18 seats for the Conservatives. UKIP have lost eight seats, the Green Party have gained three and the SNP one, although there are no local elections in Scotland on 3 May. Most of the Lib Dem by-election victories have come at the expense of the Conservatives in the south of England, but they have also taken seats from Labour and UKIP in other parts of England. The reason for the Lib Dems' by-election success, suggested Sir Vince, was that they ""believe in local government,"" as he promised extra investment in school budgets and a new homes drive, including curbs on the right to buy. He said the local elections were an opportunity to send a message to the government over ""unnecessary"" spending cuts. ""It is also going to be an opportunity to pass verdict on the way in which the government is handling Brexit negotiations,"" he added. The Lib Dems were ""the only party which is warning about the dangers which this current Brexit trajectory poses,"" he said. The party is using the local elections to call for an ""exit from Brexit"". Sir Vince highlighted their campaign - with social media videos in 17 European languages - to get EU citizens living in the UK, who are entitled to vote on 3 May, to back the party.

"Greater Manchester Police said it was called to reports that the body of a baby had been found A body of a newborn baby has been found in woodland, police have said. The remains were found near Peel Lane in Heywood, Rochdale, at about 07:10 BST. Greater Manchester Police, which initially said the child had been found in a field, is searching a large wooded area. A cordon remains in place, and detectives have appealed for anyone with information about the death to contact them. Police officers are searching the scene The woodland is part of Roch Valley Woods and is popular with local families, dog walkers and children. Millie Crosdale and Jess Hawkins, both 18 and live locally, laid flowers by the police cordon. ""It is heartbreaking really, all you can do is come and pay your respects,"" Ms Crosdale said. Ms Hawkins said: ""This is where we all come down in the summer and it's nice, when it's snowing you bring your kids down with the sleds. ""You wouldn't think something like that would happen here."" Stuart Pollitt, BBC North West Tonight Around a dozen police officers have been scouring this woodland, and police dogs have also been seen inside the large cordon. The baby was discovered at the bottom of a hill in parkland off Peel Lane. Already some local people have been delivering teddy bears and flowers to the site after hearing the news. One mother who brought a teddy was in tears as she told me she felt moved to pay her respects as she has a nine-day-old baby herself. Hearing the news this morning made her feel emotional, she said. Even though the site is a fair distance from any homes, this incident had touched people here.

"Nasim Aghdam was reportedly angry that YouTube was filtering her videos The woman suspected of opening fire at YouTube's HQ in California had reportedly criticised the platform for suppressing her videos and reducing her revenue. Police have named Nasim Aghdam, 39, as the suspect in Tuesday's gun attack that left three people injured. She is reported to have started shooting at an outside dining area before killing herself. Now a picture of her vast online presence is starting to build. US media say Aghdam, who lived in San Diego, southern California, ran a website and multiple YouTube channels. She posted videos on a variety of subjects including hand art, exercise and animal cruelty. Suspect 'angry over video postings' How the shooting unfolded online A screenshot from one of her channels, posted on her website, describes her as a ""vegan bodybuilder and animal rights activist"" promoting a ""healthy and humane lifestyle"". She appears to have garnered thousands of subscribers across her various accounts. Her website lists Turkish, Farsi and English language YouTube channels. One channel - titled Nasime Sabz - has more than 11,000 subscribers and four million views. She also appears to have had a large following on Instagram. A screenshot from one of her accounts, in which she describes herself as a model, artist and comedian, has more than 54,000 followers. ""My Instagram followers, views, likes are real,"" a post on her website reads. But despite her large following, Aghdam railed against YouTube for filtering her content, leading to fewer views. ""Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated, so that people can hardly see their videos,"" she said. ""There is no equal growth opportunity on YouTube or any other video sharing site. Your channel will grow if they want [it] to!"" Aghdam also criticised ""close-minded"" YouTube employees for adding an age-restriction to one of her videos and reducing the amount of money she could make. Those who upload videos can receive money from advertisements but the company can ""de-monetise"" channels for various reasons, taking adverts off. It is unclear if this happened with her material. In one image posted on her website she complained about making just 10 US cents from 300,000 video views. Aghdam accused YouTube of restricting advertisement revenue on her videos Her father, Ismail, told local US media she had become angry because YouTube had stopped paying her for uploading videos. The platform ""stopped everything and now she has no income,"" he told NBC news. He also said she had been reported missing on Monday after not answering calls for two days. Police later found her sleeping in her car in Mountain View, 25km (15 miles) south of the YouTube offices in San Bruno and reported this to her family, but did not detain her. Aghdam's father then warned police that she might go to YouTube as she ""hated the company,"" local media said. YouTube terminated all of her channels following the shooting. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have also been removed. Aghdam also posted on her website about animal rights and the cruelty of the fur trade. In 2009,she was named and pictured in The San Diego Union-Tribune,externalprotesting about the use of pigs in military training. ""For me, animal rights equal human rights,"" she told the newspaper.

"A forensic tent has been set up outside Richard Osborn-Brooks' home in Hither Green A 78-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a suspected burglar was stabbed to death. The man, named locally as Richard Osborn-Brooks, discovered two intruders in South Park Crescent, Hither Green, south-east London, at about 00:45 BST. One suspect, armed with a screwdriver, forced the man into his kitchen where a struggle ensued and he was stabbed, Scotland Yard said. The 38-year-old was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 03:40. The suspected burglar was found collapsed in Further Green Road, south-east London The homeowner discovered two intruders in his house in South Park Crescent Mr Osborn-Brooks, who suffered bruising to his arms, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody at a south London police station. The other intruder remains at large. The CPS and police urge people to always call the police first - if you are able. But according toofficial guidance,external, anyone can use reasonable force to protect themselves. As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and the fear felt, the more force you can lawfully use in self-defence. The law doesn't require you to wait to be attacked before using defensive force, but does not protect you if, for example, your action is over-the-top or calculated revenge. You are given greater protection under the law if force is used to protect yourself or others when dealing with a burglar or trespasser on your property. The CPS says if you have acted in reasonable self-defence, as described above, and the intruder dies you will still have acted lawfully. Police said they were called to the property over reports of a burglary when they found the man collapsed in nearby Further Green Road with a stab wound to the upper body. One man who lives on the street said there had been a recent spate of burglaries in the area and his home had been broken into in recent months. ""I was renovating the house and they broke in and took a laptop. I know this has happened to others recently,"" he said. Adam Lake, another local resident, said he ""wasn't surprised"" to hear about the burglary. ""We've even had to put up CCTV at home because we didn't feel safe,"" he said. ""I feel terrible for the man that was burgled. He doesn't deserve to be punished for defending himself,"" he said. Forensic officers are carrying out investigations at the scene Keith Doyle, BBC News For now, the streets are cordoned off as police in blue boiler suits search gardens and bins for anything that will help their investigation. Neighbours say there have been quite a few burglaries in this area recently - this is a relatively well-off part of south east-London with streets of semi-detached houses. The chair of the residents' association told me it is trying to make the area safer, working with police and the council to close off alleyways. At the same time it has been trying to bring the community together with street parties and other events. The dead man's next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination would take place ""in due course"", the Met said. Local ward Councillor Mark Ingleby described the killing as a ""tragedy"" and said it had come ""out of the blue"". He said there had been a ""definite improvement"" on tackling burglaries in the area thanks to an active Neighbourhood Watch scheme. New security gates had also been installed to prevent trespassers accessing alleyways behind houses, he said.

"This video can not be played Gender pay gap: What do women think? UK companies have submitted their gender pay figures ahead of Wednesday's midnight deadline. Just over 10,000 companies did so ahead of the deadline, with more than 1,000 firms reporting on the last day. The median pay gap among all companies that have reported is 9.7%. Of those that have submitted their figures, 78% pay men more than women, 14% pay women more and 8% said they had no gender pay gap, based on the median measure. Firms with more than 250 staff must state the average difference between male and female employees. Gender pay gap: Four things we've learnt What is the gender pay gap?

One of the biggest names among the worst offenders so far is Ryanair, which reported a 71.8% gender pay gap. Meanwhile, High Street brands KFC, Matalan, Starbucks, Costa, McDonald's and Primark reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. In terms of bonus gaps, several NHS trusts have some of the highest figures, with Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust General Purposes Charity revealing a figure of 99.4%. Some have criticised the exercise, which also applies to charities and public sector bodies, as a crude mechanism open to misinterpretation. However, gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society says it represents an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn. Sam Smethers, the society's chief executive, said gender pay gap reporting was a game-changer in terms of workplace culture and practices. ""Finally women are realising that they have a right to talk about pay and they cannot be silenced,"" she said. ""By finding out what their colleagues earn, they are then in a position to challenge any pay inequality; it is much more common than people realise."" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said gender pay gap reporting was a chance for companies for businesses to bring about change. However, she warned that companies could not close the gap by themselves. ""Many of the causes of the gender pay gap lie outside the workplace and will require a partnership between companies and government if we are to dliver long-term, lasting change."" Ms Fairbairn said knowing the average pay difference between men and women would help companies develop more inclusive workplaces and support the rise of more women into senior roles. Want to learn more about the gender gap? Try asking our bot below. Research conducted by Business in the Community found 92% of female respondents would use gender pay gap data to choose between two potential employers. It also found more than than half of women would favour the company with the smallest pay gap or the one that was doing to most to close it. Chloe Chambraud, gender equality director at Business in the Community, said bosses had to understand the factors driving their pay gaps and the groups of women who were most affected. ""Employers must address the root causes of inequality, from reducing bias and increasing transparency in recruitment, appraisal and promotion processes to normalising flexible working, for men and women, and offer financially viable parental leave packages,"" she said. ""Only then we will ensure that men and women have equal lives at work and home."" Data as of 4pm on 4 April. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need. Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room. The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasn't in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the child's bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her. Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeep's childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says. So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his father's footsteps. There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isn't unique. A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. It's a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community. More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool: Harjinder moved in with her husband's family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired family's social life centred around the men's excessive drinking. The family, along with young children, would go to a friend's house and would stay there until two or three o'clock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated. Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They don't want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness."" Indian woman fights off tiger with stick Malaysians roast MasterChef over chicken rendang Parents find lost daughter after 24-year search Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped. By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadn't been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and he'd been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem. Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didn't feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didn't look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous. ""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone."" When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families. The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions. Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services. For Harjinder, her husband's heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help. She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasn't until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasn't normal. Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didn't acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having. ""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldn't admit it."" Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they don't want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?"" TheShanti Project,external, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham. Others include a volunteer-ledSikh Helpline,external, theDerby Recovery Network,external,BAC-IN,external, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinder's husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband. Her husband's family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home. But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadn't stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on."" Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him. ""I've thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if I've got another 20 years of this, that's not good. I think it could happen."" Harjinder and her family members' names have been changed. If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this article, please see the resources listed onBBC Action Line.

"Trade tensions between China and the US have been ramped up after Beijing responded to US plans for putting new taxes on hundreds of Chinese imports. China said it would place 25% trade tariffs on 106 US goods, including soybeans, aircraft and orange juice. The tit-for-tat action comes hours after Washington detailed about 1,300 Chinese products it intended to hit with tariffs - also set at 25%. Wall Street opened sharply lower, before rebounding to close higher. After starting down more than 400 points, or 1.75%, the Dow ended almost 1% higher. The S&P 500 did not fall as far and also rose about 1%, while the Nasdaq added 1.4%. Boeing - among the firms that investors expect to be most affected by the plans for tariffs - fell 1.4%. Analysis: Not a trade 'war' but a trade 'dance' Stock markets in Europe also fell, with investors taken aback by the speed of China's response, but closed only modestly lower. The FTSE 100 in London was almost flat at 7,034 points at the close. Beijing said it ""strongly condemns and firmly opposes"" the proposed US tariffs, calling them ""unilateralistic and protectionist"", and vowing to retaliate. But US President Donald Trump tweeted the US was not in a trade war with China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is the second wave of tariffs put forward by the US. Earlier this year, Mr Trump announced import taxes on aluminium and steel. The White House said its new plans were a response to unfair Chinese intellectual property practices, such as those that pressure US companies to share technology with Chinese firms. It has proposed tariffs on a wide range of items, including Chinese-made communication satellite parts, flat screen televisions, semiconductors and industrial machinery, as well as more niche products such as bakery ovens and rocket launchers. A final list will be determined after a public comment period and review, expected to last about two months. The Office of the US Trade Representative, which is handling the negotiations, said the tariffs were ""appropriate both in light of the estimated harm to the US economy and to obtain elimination of China's harmful acts, policies and practices"". Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Trump worries about the trade deficit - should we? Analysis: Why China won't baulk at US tariff threat Trump trade war: China tells US it will defend national interests China's tariffs are more narrowly aimed at politically important sectors, such as agriculture. US chemicals, some types of aircraft and corn products are among the goods facing the taxes, China's finance ministry said. Tariffs would also be placed on whiskey, cigars and tobacco, some types of beef, lubricants, and propane and other plastic products. US orange juice, certain sorghum products, cotton and some types of wheat, as well as trucks, some SUVs and certain electric vehicles, will also be subject to the new duties, the ministry added. Beijing has been adamant that it did not want a trade war, but that it would not back down under US pressure. ""Any attempt to bring China to its knees through threats and intimidation will never succeed,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. ""There is no winner in a trade war, and an initiator will harm itself as well as others."" Mr Geng said China had referred the US to the World Trade Organization. Neither set of tariffs goes into effect immediately. US economists said they expect the broader economic impact of the measures to be limited if they move forward, but warned that the risk of further escalation could weigh on business activity. The US and China exchanged more than $700bn in goods and services last year, according to US figures. Economists had warned the Trump administration's move could prompt Beijing to retaliate Each list of products represents an estimated $50bn (Â£35.5bn) in annual trade, officials said. ""It's the tit-for-tat uncertainty that shakes business confidence,"" said Satyam Panday, senior economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""Why should I invest when there's no certainty?"" China's economy has become less dependent on selling goods abroad in recent years, which is likely to blunt the effect of the US tariffs, according to analysts for S&P Global Ratings. In 2016, the US was the destination for about 18.2% of all Chinese exports. American business groups have urged the two sides to try to resolve the issues through talks, expressing concern that threatening tariffs could lead to a dispute that hurts the US economy.

"Alex Flowers and her daughter Ruby ""The midwife completely ignored me, I may as well not have been there."" Alex Flowers, from Derbyshire, has told the BBC how she suffered physical and mental problems after ""not being in control"" during her daughter's birth. The lowest point came 18 months later when Alex's best friend found her sitting on the kitchen floor saying she wanted to die. In a Mumsnet survey, very few mothers felt they received ""great medical care"" for certain conditions after birth. Only 6% ofthe 1,224 women surveyed by the parenting website,externalwhose pelvic floor or continence had been affected as a result of giving birth were ""extremely happy"" with the care they were given. And 34% of women who suffered a tear while giving birth or had a Caesarean felt they did not have adequate care or advice in the first few weeks afterwards. The women questioned had all experienced problems after giving birth between 2013 and 2016. Alex explained how a change of shift during her long labour with her daughter in November 2013 had long-term effects on both her and her husband. ""I was making really good progress with the labour but unfortunately the midwife who had been dealing with me was taken off the end of her shift and replaced by another one, who, I felt, didn't really want to be there and had too many cases to deal with,"" she said. After Alex had been in labour for 23 hours she started to feel something was wrong with the movements of her baby. However, Alex says, the midwife ""was saying to my husband, 'Don't worry, it's the throes of a woman in labour' and ignoring me"". ""I thought, 'I've got no control here' and everything I was saying about there being something wrong with the baby, she was almost tutting, rolling her eyes and saying it was normal. ""Two hours after I started saying something was wrong, I grabbed my husband and said, 'If you don't listen to me, the baby is going to die.' The mothers who regret having children Women 'more likely to lose interest in sex than men' Sex is painful for nearly one in 10 women, study finds The hidden trauma of being torn during childbirth ""They checked after that and the baby's heart had nearly stopped. Then it was a case of a mad rush, someone pressing the panic button and them all running in. ""As a result, I was told there was no time to give me any anaesthetic, but I had already given up and thought I was going to be walking out with no baby. ""In my head, she had already gone and it was too late to do anything and even just saying it again is heartbreaking. ""I had to have an episiotomy with no anaesthetic and then they used forceps to pull the baby out. She was fine but I was left with a lot of damage and blood loss and was sent home the very next day, even though I had been stitched up wrong and some of the placenta had been left in. It was a mess the whole way through."" The effects of this traumatic episode on Alex and her husband were dramatic. She had to return to hospital to have the stitches corrected and also suffered from severe post-natal depression, while her husband initially could not bond with his daughter, and would not pick her up for six weeks. ""I wasn't really coping and after 18 months, one of my best friends found me sitting on the kitchen floor saying I wanted to die and I was convinced my daughter was going to die or be taken away from me. ""I then started seeing a counsellor and he helped me understand that what happened wasn't my fault and I felt like that because I had a lack of control during the labour and had never had closure from that."" Harry and Meghan choose wedding flowers The country where the British are blamed for everything Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea Alex says the first step on her road to recovery came when she started taking an antidepressant, which she says she is going to have to take for the rest of her life. ""I was originally heartbroken but then thought if it means I can feel normal and look after my baby, then it's worth it."" The upset also led Alex and her husband to decide not to have any more children -but she became pregnant again and initially ""panicked"". ""My consultant agreed I could have a Caesarean and I felt so much better as I was in control of what was happening."" Alex advises women who find themselves in a similar position not to stay silent. ""You must speak out straight away and not get to the point where it turns into post-natal depression,"" she says. ""Your concerns are valid and what matters is having somebody there with you who is not afraid to speak out on your behalf. ""If a woman in labour is saying how she feels, she mustn't be ignored. We're not fine and and the damage that can be done - both physical and mental - can last for ever.""

"WPP is investigating an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. The world's largest advertising agency said its board had appointed independent counsel to conduct the investigation. ""The allegations do not involve amounts which are material to WPP,""  the firm said in a statement on Tuesday. Mr Sorrell responded on Wednesday, saying he rejected any allegation of financial impropriety ""unreservedly"". ""Reports in the media have stated that WPP is investigating an allegation of financial impropriety by me, specifically as to the use of company funds,"" Sir Martin said in a statement. ""This allegation is being investigated by a law firm. I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it,"" he said. ""I understand that this process will be completed shortly."" Sir Martin added: ""As a significant share owner, my commitment to the company, which I founded over thirty years ago, remains absolute - to our people, our clients, our shareholders and all of our many stakeholders.

A final list will be determined after a public comment period and review, expected to last about two months. The Office of the US Trade Representative, which is handling the negotiations, said the tariffs were ""appropriate both in light of the estimated harm to the US economy and to obtain elimination of China's harmful acts, policies and practices"". Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Trump worries about the trade deficit - should we? Analysis: Why China won't baulk at US tariff threat Trump trade war: China tells US it will defend national interests China's tariffs are more narrowly aimed at politically important sectors, such as agriculture. US chemicals, some types of aircraft and corn products are among the goods facing the taxes, China's finance ministry said. Tariffs would also be placed on whiskey, cigars and tobacco, some types of beef, lubricants, and propane and other plastic products. US orange juice, certain sorghum products, cotton and some types of wheat, as well as trucks, some SUVs and certain electric vehicles, will also be subject to the new duties, the ministry added. Beijing has been adamant that it did not want a trade war, but that it would not back down under US pressure. ""Any attempt to bring China to its knees through threats and intimidation will never succeed,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. ""There is no winner in a trade war, and an initiator will harm itself as well as others."" Mr Geng said China had referred the US to the World Trade Organization. Neither set of tariffs goes into effect immediately. US economists said they expect the broader economic impact of the measures to be limited if they move forward, but warned that the risk of further escalation could weigh on business activity. The US and China exchanged more than $700bn in goods and services last year, according to US figures. Economists had warned the Trump administration's move could prompt Beijing to retaliate Each list of products represents an estimated $50bn (Â£35.5bn) in annual trade, officials said. ""It's the tit-for-tat uncertainty that shakes business confidence,"" said Satyam Panday, senior economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""Why should I invest when there's no certainty?"" China's economy has become less dependent on selling goods abroad in recent years, which is likely to blunt the effect of the US tariffs, according to analysts for S&P Global Ratings. In 2016, the US was the destination for about 18.2% of all Chinese exports. American business groups have urged the two sides to try to resolve the issues through talks, expressing concern that threatening tariffs could lead to a dispute that hurts the US economy.

"Alex Flowers and her daughter Ruby ""The midwife completely ignored me, I may as well not have been there."" Alex Flowers, from Derbyshire, has told the BBC how she suffered physical and mental problems after ""not being in control"" during her daughter's birth. The lowest point came 18 months later when Alex's best friend found her sitting on the kitchen floor saying she wanted to die. In a Mumsnet survey, very few mothers felt they received ""great medical care"" for certain conditions after birth. Only 6% ofthe 1,224 women surveyed by the parenting website,externalwhose pelvic floor or continence had been affected as a result of giving birth were ""extremely happy"" with the care they were given. And 34% of women who suffered a tear while giving birth or had a Caesarean felt they did not have adequate care or advice in the first few weeks afterwards. The women questioned had all experienced problems after giving birth between 2013 and 2016. Alex explained how a change of shift during her long labour with her daughter in November 2013 had long-term effects on both her and her husband. ""I was making really good progress with the labour but unfortunately the midwife who had been dealing with me was taken off the end of her shift and replaced by another one, who, I felt, didn't really want to be there and had too many cases to deal with,"" she said. After Alex had been in labour for 23 hours she started to feel something was wrong with the movements of her baby. However, Alex says, the midwife ""was saying to my husband, 'Don't worry, it's the throes of a woman in labour' and ignoring me"". ""I thought, 'I've got no control here' and everything I was saying about there being something wrong with the baby, she was almost tutting, rolling her eyes and saying it was normal. ""Two hours after I started saying something was wrong, I grabbed my husband and said, 'If you don't listen to me, the baby is going to die.' The mothers who regret having children Women 'more likely to lose interest in sex than men' Sex is painful for nearly one in 10 women, study finds The hidden trauma of being torn during childbirth ""They checked after that and the baby's heart had nearly stopped. Then it was a case of a mad rush, someone pressing the panic button and them all running in. ""As a result, I was told there was no time to give me any anaesthetic, but I had already given up and thought I was going to be walking out with no baby. ""In my head, she had already gone and it was too late to do anything and even just saying it again is heartbreaking. ""I had to have an episiotomy with no anaesthetic and then they used forceps to pull the baby out. She was fine but I was left with a lot of damage and blood loss and was sent home the very next day, even though I had been stitched up wrong and some of the placenta had been left in. It was a mess the whole way through."" The effects of this traumatic episode on Alex and her husband were dramatic. She had to return to hospital to have the stitches corrected and also suffered from severe post-natal depression, while her husband initially could not bond with his daughter, and would not pick her up for six weeks. ""I wasn't really coping and after 18 months, one of my best friends found me sitting on the kitchen floor saying I wanted to die and I was convinced my daughter was going to die or be taken away from me. ""I then started seeing a counsellor and he helped me understand that what happened wasn't my fault and I felt like that because I had a lack of control during the labour and had never had closure from that."" Harry and Meghan choose wedding flowers The country where the British are blamed for everything Man has 'world's worst' super-gonorrhoea Alex says the first step on her road to recovery came when she started taking an antidepressant, which she says she is going to have to take for the rest of her life. ""I was originally heartbroken but then thought if it means I can feel normal and look after my baby, then it's worth it."" The upset also led Alex and her husband to decide not to have any more children -but she became pregnant again and initially ""panicked"". ""My consultant agreed I could have a Caesarean and I felt so much better as I was in control of what was happening."" Alex advises women who find themselves in a similar position not to stay silent. ""You must speak out straight away and not get to the point where it turns into post-natal depression,"" she says. ""Your concerns are valid and what matters is having somebody there with you who is not afraid to speak out on your behalf. ""If a woman in labour is saying how she feels, she mustn't be ignored. We're not fine and and the damage that can be done - both physical and mental - can last for ever.""

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia's call for a joint inquiry into the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in England is ""perverse"", the UK has told the international chemical weapons watchdog in the Hague. The victim of an attack is not required to work with the ""likely perpetrator"", UK acting representative John Foggo told the OPCW's executive council. Russia called the meeting to challenge the UK, which has blamed Moscow for the March 4 poisoning. It has strongly denied any involvement. The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, southern England. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. On Tuesday the UK's Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used in Salisbury, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The comments were seized upon by Russia to discredit the UK's accusations. On Wednesday,the European Union re-iterated that it backed the UK's assessment,externalthat it was highly likely that Russia was responsible. Row over Johnson's Salisbury response Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility In the Hague, Mr Foggo told the emergency OPCW meeting,externalthat the UK had blamed Russia based on: the identification of the nerve agent used knowledge that Russia ""has produced this agent and remains capable of doing so"" Russia's record of conducting state sponsored assassinations The assessment that Russia ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"" He said that Russia had offered more than 24 ""contradictory and changing counter-narratives"" about the attack, including ""preposterous"" suggestions that Sweden, the US or Britain itself could have been responsible. This video can not be played UK Security Minister: It is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" Russia is responsible The EU delegation offered its full support to Britain, saying Russia had unleashed ""a flood of insinuations targeting its member states"" in the aftermath of the poisoning. Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russia's President Putin, speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara, said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail. Russia called the meeting because, among other things, it wants to know what kind of evidence the UK has provided to the OPCW - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; which inspectors visited the site of the attack in Salisbury, who they met and where the samples are being analysed. A team believed to be from the OPCW carry out tests in Salisbury Diplomats at the OPCW said the Russian proposal for a joint inquiry - seen by Western powers as an attempt to undermine the OPCW's existing investigation - was unlikely to be approved by the 41-nation executive council. The OPCW expects to receive the results of its own independent laboratory tests within a week. It does not have the power to attribute blame, but it could ask the Kremlin to grant its inspectors access to former Soviet Union production facilities to check all of their chemical weapons stockpiles have been destroyed. The EU has said it is very concerned that Russia might reject the results of the investigation. Earlier, Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said in Moscow that the poisoning was a ""grotesque provocation... that was crudely concocted by the British and American security services"" to implicate Russia. ""It is appropriate to say that the dark times of the Cold War are back,"" he said. Analysis by the BBC's David Shukman The only way that scientists can be totally sure who made the Novichok agent is to compare it with another sample of the substance made in the same lab. That's what happened when Sarin was used by Saddam Hussein in Iraq and more recently by President Assad in Syria. Experts already knew which clues to look for, and that allowed them to lay the blame definitively. Novichok is much less well known. The traces of it gathered in Salisbury will have been put through detailed scientific screening and that would reveal the ingredients of the chemical and maybe also its basic structure. That could be matched with whatever is known about Novichok, maybe from lab notes handed over by defectors. And for Porton Down to describe it as ""military grade"" suggests a sophisticated state producer, not an amateur, though that itself is not categorical proof of Russian involvement. That leaves another scenario in this secretive world of smoke and mirrors - that Britain did already have a sample of Novichok and was able to compare it to the agent used on the Skripals but does not want to reveal the fact, to protect a valuable source of intelligence. What are Novichok nerve agents? Questions arose about whether the UK had been too quick to point the finger at Russia after the Porton Down laboratory said that it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent. Porton Down dismissed Russian claims the nerve agent might have come from the laboratory The laboratory, which had previously identified the Novichok nerve agent, said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"" but said it was not its job to say where the agent was manufactured. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. On Twitter, the Russian Embassy highlighted a now-deleted tweet by the UK Foreign Office which suggested Porton Down had said the nerve agent had been produced in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

""Unlike Russia, we allow the media to come and meet our scientists and question the science,"" he said. ""That's important. That's why we have this debate today: we have nothing to hide.""

"This video can not be played How the attack on YouTube's HQ in San Bruno unfolded A woman shot and wounded three people at YouTube's headquarters in Northern California before killing herself, police say. Police have named the suspect as Nasim Aghdam, 39, and say they are still investigating a motive. They say there is no evidence yet that she knew the victims, a 36-year-old man said to be in a critical condition, and two women aged 32 and 27. Aghdam had in the past posted material venting anger at YouTube. Such ""active shooter"" incidents are overwhelmingly carried out by men - an FBI report found thatout of 160 incidents between 2000-2013 only six of the people who opened fire were women,external. How YouTube shooting unfolded online The suspect is reported to have approached an outdoor patio and dining area at the offices in San Bruno, near San Francisco, at about lunchtime and opened fire with a handgun. San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said officers arrived at the offices at 12:48 (19:48 GMT) local time to find a ""chaotic scene"", with numerous people fleeing. Images broadcast on local TV stations showed employees leaving with their hands raised. Other footage showed evacuees forming a queue before being individually frisked by police. People gathered outside the YouTube building with their arms raised as the incident unfolded One person with a bullet wound was found at the front of the company headquarters, Mr Barberini said. Minutes later officers found a woman who appeared to have shot herself, he said. Two further victims were later discovered at an adjacent business. An employee at a nearby fast food restaurant told Fox station KTVU he had treated a young woman who suffered a bullet wound to the leg. He said he had fashioned a makeshift tourniquet from a bungee cord as they waited for first responders. Several YouTube employees tweeted about the attack as it was taking place. Product manager Todd Sherman said people fled the building in panic as the shooting unfolded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The three wounded were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Officials said the 32-year-old woman's condition was serious and the 27-year-old's condition was fair. A fourth person was also taken to hospital with an ankle injury sustained while trying to escape, Mr Barberini said. Some 1,700 people work at the YouTube HQ. The company is owned by Google and is the area's biggest employer. San Bruno police identified the suspect as Nasim Aghdam, a Californian resident of Iranian descent. She appeared often on YouTube and in one of her videos criticised the platform for discriminating against and filtering her posts. Nasim Aghdam railed against YouTube on her personal website YouTube terminated her account following the shooting. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have also been removed. On her personal website she accused YouTube of taking steps to prevent her videos from getting views. ""There is no equal growth opportunity on YouTube or any other video sharing site. Your channel will grow if they want to!"" she wrote. There had been earlier media reports that the man shot was her boyfriend, but police later said; ""At this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted."" YouTube spokesman Chris Dale praised the police response to the incident. ""Today it feels like the entire community of YouTube and all of the employees were victims of this crime. Our hearts go out to those who suffered in this particular attack,"" he said. Another online giant, Twitter, said it was horrified by the shooting and said it was monitoring instances of misinformation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Trade tensions between China and the US have been ramped up after Beijing responded to US plans for putting new taxes on hundreds of Chinese imports. China said it would place 25% trade tariffs on 106 US goods, including soybeans, aircraft and orange juice. The tit-for-tat action comes hours after Washington detailed about 1,300 Chinese products it intended to hit with tariffs - also set at 25%. Wall Street opened sharply lower, before rebounding to close higher. After starting down more than 400 points, or 1.75%, the Dow ended almost 1% higher. The S&P 500 did not fall as far and also rose about 1%, while the Nasdaq added 1.4%. Boeing - among the firms that investors expect to be most affected by the plans for tariffs - fell 1.4%. Analysis: Not a trade 'war' but a trade 'dance' Stock markets in Europe also fell, with investors taken aback by the speed of China's response, but closed only modestly lower. The FTSE 100 in London was almost flat at 7,034 points at the close. Beijing said it ""strongly condemns and firmly opposes"" the proposed US tariffs, calling them ""unilateralistic and protectionist"", and vowing to retaliate. But US President Donald Trump tweeted the US was not in a trade war with China. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is the second wave of tariffs put forward by the US. Earlier this year, Mr Trump announced import taxes on aluminium and steel. The White House said its new plans were a response to unfair Chinese intellectual property practices, such as those that pressure US companies to share technology with Chinese firms. It has proposed tariffs on a wide range of items, including Chinese-made communication satellite parts, flat screen televisions, semiconductors and industrial machinery, as well as more niche products such as bakery ovens and rocket launchers. A final list will be determined after a public comment period and review, expected to last about two months. The Office of the US Trade Representative, which is handling the negotiations, said the tariffs were ""appropriate both in light of the estimated harm to the US economy and to obtain elimination of China's harmful acts, policies and practices"". Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Trump worries about the trade deficit - should we? Analysis: Why China won't baulk at US tariff threat Trump trade war: China tells US it will defend national interests China's tariffs are more narrowly aimed at politically important sectors, such as agriculture. US chemicals, some types of aircraft and corn products are among the goods facing the taxes, China's finance ministry said. Tariffs would also be placed on whiskey, cigars and tobacco, some types of beef, lubricants, and propane and other plastic products. US orange juice, certain sorghum products, cotton and some types of wheat, as well as trucks, some SUVs and certain electric vehicles, will also be subject to the new duties, the ministry added. Beijing has been adamant that it did not want a trade war, but that it would not back down under US pressure. ""Any attempt to bring China to its knees through threats and intimidation will never succeed,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. ""There is no winner in a trade war, and an initiator will harm itself as well as others."" Mr Geng said China had referred the US to the World Trade Organization. Neither set of tariffs goes into effect immediately. US economists said they expect the broader economic impact of the measures to be limited if they move forward, but warned that the risk of further escalation could weigh on business activity. The US and China exchanged more than $700bn in goods and services last year, according to US figures. Economists had warned the Trump administration's move could prompt Beijing to retaliate Each list of products represents an estimated $50bn (Â£35.5bn) in annual trade, officials said. ""It's the tit-for-tat uncertainty that shakes business confidence,"" said Satyam Panday, senior economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""Why should I invest when there's no certainty?"" China's economy has become less dependent on selling goods abroad in recent years, which is likely to blunt the effect of the US tariffs, according to analysts for S&P Global Ratings. In 2016, the US was the destination for about 18.2% of all Chinese exports. American business groups have urged the two sides to try to resolve the issues through talks, expressing concern that threatening tariffs could lead to a dispute that hurts the US economy.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Russia's call for a joint inquiry into the poisoning of an ex-spy and his daughter in England is ""perverse"", the UK has told the international chemical weapons watchdog in the Hague. The victim of an attack is not required to work with the ""likely perpetrator"", UK acting representative John Foggo told the OPCW's executive council. Russia called the meeting to challenge the UK, which has blamed Moscow for the March 4 poisoning. It has strongly denied any involvement. The British government says a military-grade Novichok nerve agent of a type developed by Russia was used in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, southern England. The incident has caused a major diplomatic fallout, with the expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats by the UK and its allies being met by counter-expulsions by Moscow. On Tuesday the UK's Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used in Salisbury, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The comments were seized upon by Russia to discredit the UK's accusations. On Wednesday,the European Union re-iterated that it backed the UK's assessment,externalthat it was highly likely that Russia was responsible. Row over Johnson's Salisbury response Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility In the Hague, Mr Foggo told the emergency OPCW meeting,externalthat the UK had blamed Russia based on: the identification of the nerve agent used knowledge that Russia ""has produced this agent and remains capable of doing so"" Russia's record of conducting state sponsored assassinations The assessment that Russia ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"" He said that Russia had offered more than 24 ""contradictory and changing counter-narratives"" about the attack, including ""preposterous"" suggestions that Sweden, the US or Britain itself could have been responsible. This video can not be played UK Security Minister: It is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" Russia is responsible The EU delegation offered its full support to Britain, saying Russia had unleashed ""a flood of insinuations targeting its member states"" in the aftermath of the poisoning. Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russia's President Putin, speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara, said he hoped ""common sense"" would prevail. Russia called the meeting because, among other things, it wants to know what kind of evidence the UK has provided to the OPCW - the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; which inspectors visited the site of the attack in Salisbury, who they met and where the samples are being analysed. A team believed to be from the OPCW carry out tests in Salisbury Diplomats at the OPCW said the Russian proposal for a joint inquiry - seen by Western powers as an attempt to undermine the OPCW's existing investigation - was unlikely to be approved by the 41-nation executive council. The OPCW expects to receive the results of its own independent laboratory tests within a week. It does not have the power to attribute blame, but it could ask the Kremlin to grant its inspectors access to former Soviet Union production facilities to check all of their chemical weapons stockpiles have been destroyed. The EU has said it is very concerned that Russia might reject the results of the investigation. Earlier, Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said in Moscow that the poisoning was a ""grotesque provocation... that was crudely concocted by the British and American security services"" to implicate Russia. ""It is appropriate to say that the dark times of the Cold War are back,"" he said. Analysis by the BBC's David Shukman The only way that scientists can be totally sure who made the Novichok agent is to compare it with another sample of the substance made in the same lab. That's what happened when Sarin was used by Saddam Hussein in Iraq and more recently by President Assad in Syria. Experts already knew which clues to look for, and that allowed them to lay the blame definitively. Novichok is much less well known. The traces of it gathered in Salisbury will have been put through detailed scientific screening and that would reveal the ingredients of the chemical and maybe also its basic structure. That could be matched with whatever is known about Novichok, maybe from lab notes handed over by defectors. And for Porton Down to describe it as ""military grade"" suggests a sophisticated state producer, not an amateur, though that itself is not categorical proof of Russian involvement. That leaves another scenario in this secretive world of smoke and mirrors - that Britain did already have a sample of Novichok and was able to compare it to the agent used on the Skripals but does not want to reveal the fact, to protect a valuable source of intelligence. What are Novichok nerve agents? Questions arose about whether the UK had been too quick to point the finger at Russia after the Porton Down laboratory said that it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent. Porton Down dismissed Russian claims the nerve agent might have come from the laboratory The laboratory, which had previously identified the Novichok nerve agent, said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"" but said it was not its job to say where the agent was manufactured. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. On Twitter, the Russian Embassy highlighted a now-deleted tweet by the UK Foreign Office which suggested Porton Down had said the nerve agent had been produced in Russia. Allow Twitter content?

The Foreign Office said the tweet had been part of a real-time account of a speech by the UK's ambassador in Moscow and was deleted because it ""did not accurately report our Ambassador's words"". Security Minister Ben Wallace dismissed suggestions the government had been giving out mixed messages. ""Unlike Russia, we allow the media to come and meet our scientists and question the science,"" he said. ""That's important. That's why we have this debate today: we have nothing to hide."" UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has criticised Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, suggesting he exaggerated evidence provided by Porton Down.

"Patrick Kielty carrying his father's coffin in 1988 Comedian Patrick Kielty has revealed that the IRA offered ""revenge"" for his father's murder by loyalist paramilitaries in 1988. Kielty's father Jack was shot dead in 1988 in Dundrum, the County Down town where he grew up. However, he stressed that his family rejected the IRA's offer ""in no uncertain terms"". He makes the claim in a new BBC 1 documentary to be broadcast on Wednesday. In 'My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me', Kielty recalls how his uncle was approached by members of the IRA at the graveyard. He says the man said to his uncle: ""We could properly use a couple of good smart, strong, strapping lads like those Kielty lads if they are interested in revenge."" Kielty explained that his family were not interested in any form of retaliation: ""They were told in no uncertain terms where to go,"" he said. This video can not be played Patrick Kielty in 'My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me' ""My dad died for nothing - he wasn't a political figure, he wasn't taking a stand. ""He had a building firm, he employed both sides. That wouldn't be considered a stand anywhere else. ""He was just doing the right thing."" Three men were convicted in connection with the killing, but freed after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. In the documentary, Kielty explores the legacy of the agreement 20 years on. He reveals that he voted in favour of it but goes to meet those who did not - like DUP leader Arlene Foster. Her police officer father was shot by the IRA but survived, while she also survived a bomb attack on her school bus. Patrick Kielty met Arlene Foster to discuss the legacy of the Good Friday Agreement She went on to study at Queen's University at the same time as Patrick Kielty, but told him that her opposition to the agreement was due to prisoner releases. ""How can you allow people who have committed some of the most hideous crimes just walk free as if they had done nothing?"" she asked. Kielty told her that he voted 'yes', despite knowing it would lead to the release of the men convicted of his father's murder. ""That's true for you, but for others they want justice,"" she replied. ""Sadly, there are some people that still want retribution. ""That's why, 20 years later, we're talking of the legacy of the troubles and struggling with how to deal with it."" Patrick Kielty opens up about his experience of the Troubles in 'My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me' Around 500 prisoners were released after the agreement, over half of them from the IRA. Patrick Kielty went to the Felons Club in west Belfast to meet one of them, former IRA commander in the Maze prison, Seanna Walsh. Questioned about the innocent people killed in the troubles, Walsh said that a lot of things happened ""which don't sit comfortably with the passing of time"". ""Do you mean you regret it?"" Kielty asked. Former IRA commander in the Maze prison, Seanna Walsh, told Kielty he did not regret his part in the Troubles ""I regret the fact that we were at war, but I can't say that I regret what I did, Paddy, to be honest with you,"" Walsh replied. ""I wouldn't be true to myself if I was saying that I regret what I was involved in, because I'm actually proud of having been involved in the struggle here."" After his interview with Walsh, Kielty asks: ""Does Seanna have the answer for the future? I don't think he does."" He added: ""Seanna is really convinced that there's going to be a united Ireland and that what he believes is going to happen in the future will happen. ""The people on the other side feel exactly the same way, there's no middle ground.""

One of the biggest names among the worst offenders so far is Ryanair, which reported a 71.8% gender pay gap. Meanwhile, High Street brands KFC, Matalan, Starbucks, Costa, McDonald's and Primark reported no difference in what they paid their female and male staff. In terms of bonus gaps, several NHS trusts have some of the highest figures, with Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust General Purposes Charity revealing a figure of 99.4%. Some have criticised the exercise, which also applies to charities and public sector bodies, as a crude mechanism open to misinterpretation. However, gender equality campaigning charity the Fawcett Society says it represents an opportunity for employees to talk about pay and find out what their colleagues earn. Sam Smethers, the society's chief executive, said gender pay gap reporting was a game-changer in terms of workplace culture and practices. ""Finally women are realising that they have a right to talk about pay and they cannot be silenced,"" she said. ""By finding out what their colleagues earn, they are then in a position to challenge any pay inequality; it is much more common than people realise."" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said gender pay gap reporting was a chance for companies for businesses to bring about change. However, she warned that companies could not close the gap by themselves. ""Many of the causes of the gender pay gap lie outside the workplace and will require a partnership between companies and government if we are to dliver long-term, lasting change."" Ms Fairbairn said knowing the average pay difference between men and women would help companies develop more inclusive workplaces and support the rise of more women into senior roles.

Research conducted by Business in the Community found 92% of female respondents would use gender pay gap data to choose between two potential employers. It also found more than than half of women would favour the company with the smallest pay gap or the one that was doing to most to close it. Chloe Chambraud, gender equality director at Business in the Community, said bosses had to understand the factors driving their pay gaps and the groups of women who were most affected. ""Employers must address the root causes of inequality, from reducing bias and increasing transparency in recruitment, appraisal and promotion processes to normalising flexible working, for men and women, and offer financially viable parental leave packages,"" she said. ""Only then we will ensure that men and women have equal lives at work and home."" Data as of 4pm on 4 April. Individual company data has been reported by companies to the Government Equalities Office. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok The precise source of the nerve agent used to poison a Russian ex-spy and his daughter has not been verified, says the head of Porton Down laboratory. The defence research facility, which identified the substance in Salisbury as Novichok, said it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". The UK said further intelligence led to its belief that Russia was responsible. Russia's president has said he hopes a line can be drawn when the chemical weapons watchdog meets on Wednesday. Expressing surprise at the ""pace"" of what he described as an ""anti-Russia campaign"", Vladimir Putin added that Russia wants to be part of the investigation and hopes ""a line can be drawn under"" the incident. Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory. ""We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to [the] government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions,"" Mr Aitkenhead said. ""It is our job to provide the scientific evidence of what this particular nerve agent is - we identified that it is from this particular family and that it is a military grade, but it is not our job to say where it was manufactured."" A UK government spokesperson said that identifying the substance at Porton Down was ""only one part of the intelligence picture"". It maintained Russia was responsible, adding there was ""no other plausible explanation"". Porton Down: Britain's secret research facility Sergei Lavrov accuses West of 'children's games' Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the nerve agent on 4 March. The BBC understands Miss Skripal, 33, is now conscious and talking. Salisbury District Hospital has said her father, 66, remained critically ill but stable. Mr Aitkenhead said he had been advising those treating the Skripals. ""Unfortunately this is an extremely toxic substance. There is not, as far as we know, any antidote that you can use to negate the effects of it,"" he added. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The man who runs the government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down chose his words carefully today. Speaking strictly as a scientist, Gary Aitkenhead said that his staff had not yet verified that the nerve agent used to poison the Skripals had come from Russia. It was not his scientists' role, he said, to work out the source of the poison, implying that the government had reached the conclusion that Russia was to blame from other sources - notably secret intelligence. His comments come a day before an extraordinary meeting - called by Russia - with the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). ""We hope to discuss the whole matter and call on Britain to provide every possible element of evidence they might have in their hands,"" said the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov. ""Russia is interested in establishing the whole truth of the matter and we hope certainly that this meeting will help to return to at least the realm of normality within the realm of international law and...decency in international relations."" A Foreign Office spokesman called the meeting a ""diversionary tactic, intended to undermine the work of the OPCW in reaching a conclusion"". ""There is no requirement in the chemical weapons convention for the victim of a chemical weapons attack to engage in a joint investigation with the likely perpetrator,"" he added. The Skripals were found on a bench in Salisbury So far 29 nations have expelled diplomats over the poisoning, which the British government holds Russia responsible for. Russia has now told the UK thatmore than 50 of its diplomats have to leavethe country. In a news conference on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested the poisoning could be ""in the interests of the British government"" because of the ""uncomfortable situation"" they had found themselves in with Brexit. ""There could be a whole number of reasons and none of them can be ruled out,""Mr Lavrov said.
