"US teenagers are using marijuana and vaporisers more than they smoke cigarettes, a government study shows. Some 15% of high school students said they had used marijuana within the previous 30 days, found the report for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. And 12.1% of students said they had used a vaping device. But only 5% had smoked cigarettes. One in 10 high school seniors said he or she had vaped marijuana at least once in the past year. ""It's much higher than I expected,"" said Richard Miech, the University of Michigan researcher who ledthe study,external, of the cannabis vaping figure. This video can not be played The e-cigarette market is growing fast The findings suggest cannabis use is up about 1% overall among teenagers. Nearly a quarter of students said they had vaped, smoked or eaten marijuana in the previous year. One in 17 high school seniors said he or she had used marijuana every day. Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said: ""These are teens that are supposed to be learning at school. ""When you're stoned, you can't learn much."" Some students surveyed said they used vaporisers to smoke nicotine or flavouring, instead of marijuana. The study suggests this as a possible reason why daily cigarette smoking among 17 and 18-year-old students was down to 4.2% this year from a recorded high of 24.6% in 1997. Some 43,703 students aged between 13 and 18 years old in public and private high schools were questioned for the study.

"The government should create a national strategy to combat loneliness, says a report by a commission set up by the murdered MP Jo Cox. Thecommission,external, formed by the MP before she was killed in her constituency in 2016, calls for the appointment of a minister to lead action on the issue. It says loneliness is as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and affects nine million UK people. The government says new initiatives will be announced next year. The report acknowledges that government action alone cannot solve the problem. However, it says: ""Tackling loneliness is a generational challenge that can only be met by concerted action by everyone - governments, employers, businesses, civil society organisations, families, communities and individuals all have a role to play. ""Working together we can make a difference."" The report is calling for theFamily Test,external, a measure of assessing the effect of government policies on stable families, to become a family and relationships test. Remembering Jo Cox: Her family one year on Daughter's poem wins Jo Cox contest The cross-party commission was established by Mrs Cox when she was Labour MP for Batley and Spen. It continued its work after she was murdered outside her constituency office in Birstall, West Yorkshire in June 2016. The commission has been working with 13 charities including Age UK and Action for Children to come up with ideas for change. The report will be presented in Birstall on Friday by the joint commission chairs, Labour MP Rachel Reeves and the Conservative's Seema Kennedy, They will be joined by Mrs Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater. Mrs Cox set up the commission before she was killed in 2016 The joint chairs said: ""We know that loneliness will not end until we all recognise the role we can play in making that happen. ""Jo always looked forwards, not back. She would have said that what matters most now are the actions, big and small, that people take in response to the commission's work."" The report's release will coincide with the launch of three Royal Voluntary Service projects set to tackle loneliness and isolation in Mrs Cox's former constituency. The schemes - partly financed by theJo Cox Fund,externalset up in her memory - will include lunch clubs, activities, and workshops as well as a new Community Connections Programme. This will ""match up volunteers with lonely people in the area"" according to Royal Voluntary Service's Chief Executive Catherine Johnstone, acting as a practical template for the commission's recommendations. The government said it welcomed the commission's work and tackling social isolation and loneliness is of ""huge importance"". A spokeswoman added: ""A number of government initiatives already help to reduce loneliness, such as improved mental health support and funding to create new green spaces for communities, but we are committed to doing more and look forward to setting out plans in the new year,"" she added.

"Jayda Fransen and Paul Golding outside the courtroom in Belfast on Thursday The deputy leader of far-right group Britain First has been re-arrested after appearing in a Belfast court over a speech she gave in the city. Jayda Fransen, 31, of Anerley, south-east London, was in court over two charges relating to behaviour intended to or likely to stir up hatred. Her lawyer told the court that she intended to plead not guilty. Britain First leader Paul Golding, 35, was also arrested outside the courtroom before the hearing. Mr Golding was accompanying Ms Fransen to the hearing. The police confirmed they have arrested a 35-year-old man as part of their investigation into the ""Northern Ireland Against Terrorism"" rally in August. It is believed Ms Fransen has been re-arrested over social media posts she made from a peace wall in Belfast on Wednesday. Peace walls are used to separate Catholic and Protestant residents in areas where tension between the two communities can run high. Chris Page, BBC News Ireland correspondent The Britain First leader Paul Golding was alongside his deputy as she arrived at court. But instead of accompanying her into the courtroom, Mr Golding was detained by detectives and taken to a nearby police station. Britain First supporters holding a demonstration outside the court building Ms Fransen spoke only once in the dock  - to confirm she understood the charges against her. A small group of supporters were in Belfast Magistrates Court - and after Ms Fransen was re-arrested, they staged a short but angry demonstration, holding placards and chanting in front of the media gathered outside the building. The police confirmed that a 31-year-old woman had been arrested as part of an investigation into ""an incident at a peace wall"". Ms Fransen, whose anti-Islamic social media posts were retweeted by US President Donald Trump in November, appeared in the dock at Belfast Magistrate's Court on Thursday. The court ordered her not to go within 500m of any demonstration or parade in Northern Ireland as part of her release on bail. A detective told the court that a ""Free Speech for Jayda"" rally was planned to take place last weekend and was postponed because of snow. ""We have concerns there would be further offences and also concerns about public order,"" the detective said. Prosecutors has also sought curbs on Ms Fransen's social media use but the judge expressed doubts over whether the court's jurisdiction extended that far. Ms Fransen is due to return to court on 9 January.

"Jayda Fransen is charged with using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour The deputy leader of far right group Britain First has appeared in court charged in connection with an incident at a Belfast peace wall. Jayda Fransen, 31, from Anerley, south-east London, was charged with using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. She appeared briefly at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Friday morning. Ms Fransen was arrested on Thursday after appearing in court in Belfast over a separate incident. She was released on bail and is due to appear in court again next month. At the court - Mark Simpson, BBC News NI After bail was granted, Ms Fransen's supporters in the public gallery cheered and applauded. She raised her arm in the air as they cheered. Among her supporters was Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First. The charge against Ms Fransen relates to comments she is alleged to have made in a video online that was filmed at a peace wall in west Belfast. Friday's charge stems from an incident at a peace wall on 13 December. Peace walls are used to separate Catholic and Protestant residents in Northern Ireland, in areas where tension between the two communities can run high. The police objected in court to Ms Fransen being given bail. A PSNI detective told the court that ""our objection is that she's going to commit further offences"". However, the judge granted her bail on the condition that she did not go within 500m of any demonstration or procession in Northern Ireland.

"Well, well, well. The Tory rebels, and the government, believed that a last-minute panicked concession from the government side had walked Theresa May back from the brink of defeat. Frantic conversations between the government, the whips, the party managers and their MPs who were tempted to rebel had been taking place all day. We saw cabinet ministers take MPs aside - for just a quiet chat of course - in the closing moments of the vote. May heads to Brussels after EU vote loss And during the voting, which always takes about 15 minutes, some of those who were tempted tweeted that they had decided to abstain - the last minute promise from the minister, Dominic Raab, had changed their minds or delayed the clash. We saw as one of the possible rebels, a new Scottish MP, Paul Masterton, was cajoled by the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson (the chief whip until weeks ago) - then after the conversation, picked up his mobile phone and tweeted that he was going to abstain. But the arm twisting and arguments failed. As the MPs who count the votes made their way to the Speaker's chair, the opposition teller made their way to the outside of the despatch box. It's a physical signal of telling MPs who has won before the official announcement takes place. As that happened the House of Commons erupted - well at least the Labour side. Ministers looked like they felt sick. The deputy speaker had to call for silence so the chamber could hear the actual result. Total silence, and then disbelief as the result was read out. The government had been beaten after all, by only four votes. It's the first time that Theresa May has been defeated on her own business in the Commons. She has to front up in Brussels tomorrow with other EU leaders only hours after an embarrassing loss in Parliament. Beyond the red faces in government tonight, does it really matter? Ministers tonight are divided on that. Two cabinet ministers have told me while it's disappointing it doesn't really matter in the big picture. It's certainly true that the Tory party is so divided over how we leave the EU that the Parliamentary process was always going to be very, very choppy. But another minister told me the defeat is ""bad for Brexit"" and was openly frustrated and worried about their colleagues' behaviour. It's possible too that it was a miscalculation that could have been avoided. Had the minister at the despatch box put forward the concession even a few hours earlier, that tiny number of votes might have gone the other way. This is only the first big piece of legislation related to our withdrawal from the EU and it has run into trouble. And one of the leading Tory rebels predicted the government will have to drop one of its other plans, to put a Brexit date in the withdrawal bill, next week. The broader risk for May is not just that she will have to budge on this particular issue, but that the small group of rebels in the Tory party is strengthened by actually having had this kind of impact - and the opposition parties are already emboldened. Theresa May had been having her first good week in many, many months. That brief respite just might have come to an end. Stephen Hammond, one of the rebels, has just been sacked from his position as deputy Conservative Party chairman. Tonight, no-one is playing nice.

"The UK will continue to take part in the Erasmus student exchange programme until at least the end of 2020, the prime minister has said. Theresa May praised Erasmus+ and confirmed the UK would still be involved after Brexit in March 2019. Whether it is involved long term is among issues likely to be discussed during the next stage of negotiations. Erasmus+ sees students study in another European country for between three and 12 months as part of their degree. The prime minister is in Brussels where she will have dinner with EU leaders on Thursday. May: We're on course to deliver Brexit On Friday, without Mrs May, they are expected to formally approve a recommendation that ""sufficient progress"" has been made in Brexit negotiations so far to move them onto the next stage. Mrs May agreed a draft deal with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week which would mean the UK would continue its funding of EU projects, including Erasmus, until the end of this EU budget period in 2020. If EU leaders approve the draft deal, Brexit negotiations can begin on the next phase, covering the future relationship between the UK and EU and a two-year transition or implementation deal from March 2019. It is not clear whether this would include Erasmus+. Mrs May said that British students benefitted from studying in the EU while UK universities were a popular choice for European students. Speaking during a discussion on education and culture at the summit in Brussels, she added: ""I welcome the opportunity to provide clarity to young people and the education sector and reaffirm our commitment to the deep and special relationship we want to build with the EU.""

"This video can not be played Andrew Neil tells us five things the $52.4bn (Â£39bn) tie-up could mean. Walt Disney has agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business for $52.4bn (Â£39bn), in a deal both companies said position them to compete in the rapidly changing media industry. The purchase includes Fox's film and television studios, as well as its 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky. Fox will form a news-focused company with its remaining assets. The move is a sharp shift for 86-year-old Fox owner Rupert Murdoch after more than half a century of media expansion. Simon Jack: Why is Disney buying Fox? Five reasons why the Murdochs are selling Fox to Disney Media Editor Amol Rajan: Cunning Fox and mighty Mouse Mr Murdoch turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world's largest news and film empires. He said the break-up makes sense amid new threats from online advertising and competitors who are streaming entertainment into homes via the internet. Disney's long-standing chief executive Bob Iger struck the deal with Rupert Murdoch Fox shareholders, who include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the larger Disney. ""With today's announcement, we launch the next great leg of our journey,"" Rupert Murdoch said on Thursday in a call for investors. He added later: ""Are we retreating? Absolutely not."" Disney will scoop up Fox's movie and television studios, regional sports network and international holdings, among other investments. The move adds to Disney's back catalogue high-grossing films such as the original Star Wars movies, the Marvel superhero pictures, Avatar and Deadpool, as well as TV hits such as Modern Family and The Simpsons. The Star Wars franchise will fall under one roof if the merger is completed It expands Disney's offerings with the FX and National Geographic cable channels, and Fox's regional sports network in the US. The purchase also extends Disney's global reach, adding media company Star India and Fox's interests in Sky plc and Tata Sky to its portfolio. Disney will also get majority control of the video streaming service Hulu, which is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner. Disney will assume $13.7bn in Fox debt as part of the stock deal, taking the total value of the transaction to more than $66bn. Disney already owns a vast array of news, film and leisure companies. But the media landscape is changing as technology companies like Amazon and Netflix attract customers to new ways of viewing. Disney is investing heavily in online streaming platforms, as a way to counter a downturn in its pay-TV business and threats from these new rivals. The firm believes this deal will give it the scale to compete, and expects to wring ""at least"" $2bn in cost-savings out of the new company to boot. David Yelland, former editor of the Murdoch owned Sun newspaper in the UK, told the BBC the transaction puts Disney in pole position to compete with California's tech giants. ""In ten years time there'll be two Chinese giants and four US giants and [of the current entertainment companies] the only one that'll survive will be Disney."" A 2011 interview on the FOX Business Network, part of what will remain at Fox Fox is creating a smaller firm focused on news and major live sports events in the US. It will hold onto its flagship Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network. Lachlan Murdoch said: ""While the merged business is about scale, the new Fox is about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive, challenger brand."" There has been speculation the deal opens the opportunity to reunite Fox with the news businesses which were spun-off in 2013 following a scandal over phone tapping in the UK. That prompted the creation of a separate news publishing group, News Corp., which owns the Times and the Sun newspapers and remains controlled by the Murdochs. Rupert Murdoch said the firm hasn't looked at that possibility and any move along those lines is ""way ahead"" in the future. As part of the deal Fox shareholders will receive Disney stock, representing about 25% of the enlarged company. In the UK, Fox is in the midst of a bid to buy the part of the broadcaster Sky that it doesn't already own. That bid is being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is due to publish provisional findings in January. The BBC understands that the Disney deal will not alter that CMA investigation. If the Sky purchase is approved, that deal would probably go through before the Disney purchase of Fox assets. So the whole of Sky would then be likely to transfer to Disney's ownership. If not, then just the 39% of Sky currently in Fox's stable passes to Disney. Rupert Murdoch said: ""If things go wrong, the existing [Sky] shares go to Disney. It will be up to them to decide what to do."" Either way Sky's future will lie primarily in Disney's hands. Most observers expected Rupert Murdoch to hand over his vast media empire to his two sons James and Lachlan. So the decision to break it up came as something of a surprise. The management of the new Fox company is still being discussed. But Rupert Murdoch told Sky he hopes his elder son, Lachlan, will become chief executive. James has been widely tipped to take on a senior role at Disney. On Thursday, Disney boss Bob Iger, who is staying in his role running Disney until the end of 2021, said James will be involved in the integration of the two firms. As for the future he said: ""He and I will continue to discuss whether there's a role for him here or not, but I look forward to talking to him about it."" Rupert Murdoch with sons Lachlan (l) and James (r) The companies said they expect to complete the transaction in 12 to 18 months. But it is not clear how the deal - which increases consolidation in the movie and sports media industries - will be received by US competition regulators. The US Department of Justice recently sued to block AT&T's $85.4bn deal to buy Time Warner, on the basis that it will raise prices for consumers and competitors. It is possible officials would take a similarly dim view of a Disney-Fox tie up, in which case Disney would pay Fox a $2.5bn break-up fee. The Writers Guild of America West, a union that represents writers for television and movies, said it opposes the deal on the grounds that it would increase Disney's already sizeable power. It said: ""The antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant."" The Simpsons would become part of Disney's catalogue Five reasons for the Fox-Disney deal Would Rupert Murdoch break up his empire?

"This video can not be played What is net neutrality and how could it affect you? Restrictions on US broadband providers' ability to prioritise one service's data over another are to be reduced after a vote by a regulator. The Federal Communications Commission voted three to two to change the way ""net neutrality"" is governed. Internet service providers (ISPs) will now be allowed to speed up or slow down different companies' data, and charge consumers according to the services they access. But they must disclose such practices. Ahead of the vote, protesters rallied outside the FCC's building to oppose the change. Many argue the reversal of rules introduced under President Barack Obama will make the internet less open and accessible. The decision is already facing legal challenges, with New York's attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, announcing he will lead a lawsuit challenging the FCC's decision. Mr Schneiderman accused the watchdog,externalof failing to investigate possible abuse of the public commenting process. He said as many as two million identities, some of dead New Yorkers, were used to post comments to the FCC website. During the hearing, FCC commissioner Mr Michael O'Rielly hit back at those claims, saying staff had been able to determine and discard comments that were illegitimate. Thursday's proceedings in Washington were halted for about 15 minutes after a security alert forced an evacuation of the FCC's chamber, the final twist in a bitter and at times vitriolic debate. The hearing was briefly suspended because of a security alert that occurred while chairman Ajit Pai was speaking The FCC's chairman, Ajit Pai, argues the changes will foster innovation and encourage ISPs to invest in faster connections for people living in rural areas. He refers to the change as ""restoring internet freedom"". Technically, the vote was to reclassify broadband internet as an information service rather than telecommunications. The consequence of this is that the FCC will no longer directly regulate ISPs. This video can not be played WATCH: What do people know about net neutrality? Instead jurisdiction will pass to another regulator, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Its key responsibility will be to check that the companies disclose if they block data, throttle it or offer to prioritise traffic, rather than stopping such behaviour. US net neutrality vote: a brief guide Net neutrality: The internet holds its breath What do you know about net neutrality? Explainer: What is net neutrality? One criticism of this is that US consumers often have few if any ISPs to choose between. Moreover, opponents of the change claim it could take years to address any misbehaviour. ""I dissent to this legally-lightweight, consumer-harming, corporate-enabling, destroying-internet freedom order,"" said Democrat commissioner Mignon Clyburn ahead of the vote. But fellow commissioner Mr O'Rielly, a Republican, said fears over the end of net neutrality were a ""scary bedtime story for the children of telecom geeks"".

"A Home Office policy of removing EU citizens found sleeping rough on UK streets is unlawful and must stop, the High Court has ruled. A judge said the measure, introduced last year, was discriminatory and broke freedom of movement rules. Campaigners brought the case on behalf of three men facing removal. The government said it was disappointed by the ruling - which applies to people from the EU and European Economic Area - but would not be appealing. The Public Interest Law Unit (PILU) at Lambeth Law Centre, which took out the judicial review, said the decision would affect hundreds of people. It said the Home Office had been carrying out ""regular raids"" on locations where officials believed they would find European nationals who could be deported. In herruling,external, the judge, Mrs Justice Lang, also said the Home Office was wrong to have used the raids as a chance to verify whether the rough sleepers were abusing their right to reside in another European nation. PILU said the High Court had shown itself willing to protect the rights of a vulnerable group, adding: ""Homelessness cannot humanely be dealt with by detaining or forcibly removing homeless people."" Three men facing removal orders from the Home Office were selected as ""test cases"" for the hearing: Latvian Gunars Gureckis, who had been in the UK since 2009, and had a long history of sleeping rough interspersed with periods where he did have accommodation Polish citizen Mariusz Cielecki, who arrived in the UK in 2015 and unsuccessfully tried to appeal against his order, claiming he was looking for work Polish citizen Mariusz Perlinski, who was in poor health and alcohol dependent and had lived in the UK since 2011. He became homeless in November 2016 and was held in an immigration centre. The judge said the order should be dropped against Mr Gureckis, while Mr Cielecki is now expected to appeal against his. The order against Mr Perlinski was withdrawn in November after he began living with a relative. She said ""rough sleeping, even accompanied by low level offending such as begging, drinking in a public place and other street nuisances, would not be grounds for removal"" and the Home Office's ""less favourable"" treatment of rough sleepers from outside the UK could not be justified. The Home Office said the EU'sFree Movement Directive,externalallowed member states to impose restrictions on people in certain situations, including where there were concerns about security, public health, or fraud. Its lawyers had argued the operations to remove the rough sleepers were a ""sensible and lawful approach"". A spokesman said: ""We will consider carefully what steps are necessary to ensure we reflect the judgment in future enforcement."" He added that most of the people removed under the measure had not exercised their rights to residency in the UK when required and were therefore unlawfully in the country. Speaking after the ruling, Matthew Downie from the homeless charity Crisis, who gave evidence against the Home Office, said the policy had been ""brutal and indiscriminate"". He said in many cases people had been taken away from help they were getting to resolve their homelessness.

"US teenagers are using marijuana and vaporisers more than they smoke cigarettes, a government study shows. Some 15% of high school students said they had used marijuana within the previous 30 days, found the report for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. And 12.1% of students said they had used a vaping device. But only 5% had smoked cigarettes. One in 10 high school seniors said he or she had vaped marijuana at least once in the past year. ""It's much higher than I expected,"" said Richard Miech, the University of Michigan researcher who ledthe study,external, of the cannabis vaping figure. This video can not be played The e-cigarette market is growing fast The findings suggest cannabis use is up about 1% overall among teenagers. Nearly a quarter of students said they had vaped, smoked or eaten marijuana in the previous year. One in 17 high school seniors said he or she had used marijuana every day. Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said: ""These are teens that are supposed to be learning at school. ""When you're stoned, you can't learn much."" Some students surveyed said they used vaporisers to smoke nicotine or flavouring, instead of marijuana. The study suggests this as a possible reason why daily cigarette smoking among 17 and 18-year-old students was down to 4.2% this year from a recorded high of 24.6% in 1997. Some 43,703 students aged between 13 and 18 years old in public and private high schools were questioned for the study.

"Pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in England are dropping further behind their classmates in national primary school tests, statistics show. The gap between SEN pupils and their peers has risen from 48 percentage points in 2016 to 52 this year. The figures are revealed in school league tables, published by the Department for Education (DfE), showing the results of about 16,000 primaries. Head teachers say special-needs education funding is in crisis. The government statistics show 18% of children with SEN reached the expected level in reading, writing and mathematics, compared with 70% of their peers without special needs. Although SEN pupils' results edged upwards on last year, when 14% made the grade, their non-SEN peers boosted their results more dramatically from 62% to 70%. Teachers have been warning that pupils with special needs, such as mild autism or dyslexia, would struggle in the tougher tests introduced last year. Primary school league tables explained A National Association of Head Teachers' spokesman said it was ""one of those situations where money is the solution and schools need the government's help"". The tables also showed disadvantaged pupils still perform far worse than all other pupils in England, with around half passing the tests, compared to nearly two-thirds of non-disadvantaged. The gap between the two groups of pupils is now as wide as it was in 2012 at about 20 percentage points. However, there does appear to be a small catch-up (one percentage point) in poorer pupils' attainment on 2016 when the tougher tests were introduced and results for all pupils dipped significantly. NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""This data is a useful indication of school performance but it is not the whole story. One thing it does do, though, is confirm what NAHT has been saying for a long time about social mobility. ""Raising the Key Stage 2 standard (Sats test) was not going to help close the gap. The issues that underpin inequality reach far beyond the school gates and exist throughout the communities that schools serve."" But Schools Minister Nick Gibb hailed the achievements of pupils and teachers, saying they had responded well to the more rigorous curriculum. This set of pupils was the first to benefit from the government's new approach to phonics, he said. ""Pupils are now leaving primary school better prepared for the rigours of secondary school and for future success in their education,"" Mr Gibb added. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Overall, pupils have scored better in their Sats results than last year, which was the first year of the new tests. The DfE said this was partly because of ""increased familiarity"" with the new tests. There was a nine percentage point increase in the proportion of black pupils passing the tests, to 60% - just one percentage point behind the national average and white pupils. The top five local authorities were all London boroughs, with Richmond upon Thames at the top, Kensington and Chelsea coming second and Bromley third. The inner city boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham and Hackney have claimed the fourth and fifth spots. In 1999, Hackney, which had been one of the worst performing boroughs, became the first local education authority to be taken out of council control. In this year's tests across England, local authority schools slightly outperformed academies and free schools, with 62% of their schools reaching the expected standard compared with 61% of academies and free schools. In all, 511 schools - 4% of the total - have fallen beneath the government's expectations or ""floor standard"", where fewer than 65% of pupils met the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics and the school did not achieve sufficient progress scores in all three subjects. This is an improvement on last year, where 665 - 5% - primaries were found wanting. What's in the school league tables?

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have attended a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, alongside members of the Royal Family and PM Theresa May. Bereaved families, survivors and rescue workers were joined by the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin said he hoped the tragedy would represent a ""time we learnt a new, better way"". The fire, on 14 June, claimed 71 lives. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened The commemoration, marking six months since the tragedy, also gave thanks to all those who assisted at the time of the fire and since - including the emergency services, recovery teams, the community, public support workers and volunteers. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and singer Adele were also among the more than 1,500 guests. The families of victims held photographs of their loved ones outside the cathedral Singer Adele attended the service, among more than 1,500 guests As the memorial began, a Green For Grenfell banner adorned with a heart was carried into the cathedral. Opening the service ahead of a minute's silence, Dean of St Paul's Dr David Ison said: ""We come together as different faiths as we remember those whose lives were lost."" ""Be united in the face of suffering and sorrow,"" he added. He said the UK grieved ""at the unspeakable tragedy, loss and hurt of that June day"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined the congregation By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News, at St Paul's Cathedral Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Families held photographs of victims of the fire, while voice recordings from people at the scene of the fire were played to the congregation. The Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra Schools Girls' Choir then sang out the words: ""Never lose hope."" Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington and organiser of the memorial, told the congregation: ""Today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to."" But he said he looked ahead to the New Year with ""hope"" of change from ""a city that didn't listen"". He said he hoped the word ""Grenfell"" would change from a symbol of ""sorrow, grief or injustice"" to ""a symbol of the time we learnt a new and better way - to listen and to love"". This video can not be played Ebony Steel band plays at Grenfell Memorial Choirs featuring local children performed during the service Before the service, Bishop Tomlin told the BBC: ""There was a very strong desire within the local community to have the service here, because faith is very important to a lot of people in the local area, and that can bring a real sense of strength to people."" One of those in attendance was Tiago Alves, who escaped the blaze with his family. He told BBC Breakfast his thoughts would be with bereaved families during the ""emotional"" memorial: ""Today is a day not about survivors; today is purely about the bereaved, their families and the loved ones they have lost."" He said the memorial would bring back a lot of awful memories for many people, but added: ""The reason we are doing this today is so that people never forget - we want people to remember."" Families stood on the steps of St Paul's after the service Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also attended the service A young girl lights a memorial candle among tributes laid for the victims Firefighters also paid respects Portobello Road Salvation Army Band and St Paul's Cathedral Choir performed during the service, and the Ebony Steel Band, frequent performers at the Notting Hill Carnival, played a verse of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. At the end of the service, bereaved families and survivors left the cathedral in silence, holding white roses. Clarrie Mendy, who lost her cousin Mary and Mary's daughter, Khadija Saye, in the fire, said the memorial was ""what the community needs, what the survivors need"". ""It is a very emotional day,"" she said. ""I just hope everybody will get something from it."" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, did not attend the service, after some families said they did not want the council there in an official capacity. However, a minute's silence was held outside the town hall in High Street Kensington as the memorial service began.

"This video can not be played Footage of emergency vehicles at the scene of the crash A train and a school bus have collided near Perpignan in southern France, leaving at least four children dead. At least 18 people were injured, some of them critically, after the crash on a level crossing between Millas and Saint-FÃ©liu-d'Amont. The bus had picked up pupils from a nearby secondary school before it was hit by a train travelling at about 80km/h (50mph). Pictures from the scene showed the bus split in two by the force of the crash. Train operator SNCF said witnesses had reported seeing the barriers at the level crossing down at the time of the collision, although that was not confirmed. The bus, which had left the Christian Bourquin College in Millas, was on the crossing when it was hit by the train, which was travelling from Perpignan. Visibility was described as good. Four children died at the scene on Thursday. At one point local authorities said two 11-year-old girls had succumbed to their injuries on Friday morning, but later denied this report. A witness who was on the train told local news website l'IndÃ©pendant that ""it was a very violent crash - it seemed as if the train would derail"".,external Some 30 people were on the regional train at the time. Pictures from the scene showed the school bus sheared in two Investigators are waiting to interview the driver of the bus. She was slightly injured in the crash. The train driver also escaped serous injury. Carole Delga, president of the Occitanie regional council, said the level crossing had been upgraded recently and appeared to have been in very good condition. ""The level crossing was very visible,"" she said. SNCF said it had an automatic barrier with standard signals and was not considered particularly dangerous. But the grandmother of an injured 11-year-old girl who had been on the bus told a very different story. The girl said the barrier had not come down but remained raised. ""The red lights that normally flash did not come on,"" she said. ""The [bus] driver went through and stopped half way, and that's where the train crashed into it."" Rail operator SNCF has modernised level crossings across France in recent years, following numerous accidents, the BBC's Chris Bockman reports from Toulouse. More than 150 emergency workers and four helicopters were deployed as part of the rescue effort. Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne called the crash a ""terrible accident"" and Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer was due to visit a counselling centre set up at the Christian Bourquin College on Friday. A statement from the education minister's office said he would visit ""to support students, families, teachers and the entire educational community"". In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron offered his condolences: ""All my thoughts for the victims of this terrible accident involving a school bus, as well as their families.

" Warning: This article contains content that some readers may find distressing The fire at Grenfell Tower in west London on 14 June killed scores of people and left the block a charred ruin. It stands as a reminder of one of the most tragic days in modern British history. Each floor of the tower tells a story - about London and its inhabitants, about immigration and gentrification, about lives lived and tragically lost. It was a microcosm of life in the capital. Like most of Grenfell, the 21st floor housed four two-bedroom flats and two one-bedroom flats arranged around a central hallway, with the lifts on one side and the staircase on the other. We used to play in the hallways because it was pretty big. We’d play football. And ‘it’. We had a nice little group on that floor” Marcio Gomes, former Grenfell Tower resident Marcio and Andreia Gomes, both 38, are originally from Portugal.  Marcio’s parents moved to the UK in search of a better life when he was five. He grew up in west London near Grenfell Tower.  Andreia arrived from Madeira when she was 21, looking for a change of scene. She had come on holiday to England every year with her family. The couple lived with their daughters, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. They’d moved into their council flat 10 years before, but still considered themselves “babies in the tower - a lot of friends had been there 20 years plus”. They loved life in the tower - the amazing views of London and the close-knit community. Marcio Gomes “It was great.  The rooms were big,” says Marcio. “There were kids on every floor, of all different ages. The corridor space in between the flats, even though it was very small, they would play tag, or ride their scooters or play football. We’ve seen a lot of those kids grow up and become young women and men, and move on and get a job.” He works in IT and Andreia is a supervisor in a clothes shop. Seven months pregnant at the time of the fire, she was about to go on maternity leave.  Their son was to be called Logan. They believe that, since the fire, Grenfell has too often been portrayed in a one-dimensional way, as a place full of poor people, living on benefits, but they point out the majority were working. Before the fire, Marcio had done some renovations in preparation for Logan’s arrival, transforming a recessed storage area into a snug nursery. His daughters shared a big bedroom and were making plans to welcome their new brother.  “They were very excited,” says Marcio. “The diversity was great, you’d meet all sorts of different people – Irish, English, Arabic, Muslim, Portuguese, Spanish, Italians. You’d get to see different cultures.  You’d go up in the lift with lots of different people, you’d talk, the kids would play. The tower itself was a community, it was very family orientated.  It’s been portrayed as a poor tower, a broken tower.  It was far from that.” On the night of the fire, the Gomes family had been out for dinner, but had been asleep for several hours when they were woken up by Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya, 12, who lived across the corridor in Flat 186. Helen and Lulya had already tried to get out of the building and had met the El Wahabis from flat 182 on the way. By the time they knocked on the Gomeses' door, it was between 01:30 and 02:00. “[Helen] was panicking a little bit.  I closed the door to stop the smoke.  It was already thick, black smoke,” says Marcio. These two families - the Gomes family of four with Helen, her daughter, Lulya, and two dogs - spent the next two terrifying hours waiting as smoke started to fill the flat. Marcio filled the bath with water and ran the shower.  With all the windows open, the two families stayed low to the ground to try to keep beneath the smoke. All of the adults had conversations with the emergency services and were told to stay put, that firefighters would come to rescue them. They had friends outside the tower who were watching the building burn and were calling them to say they must get out, including Miguel and Fatima Alves who lived on the 13th floor.  They’re also from Portugal and Miguel and Marcio play football together every week. Once the Alves family had escaped from the building, they began to call Marcio to tell him he must get his family out. Tension grew as the fire spread and people became trapped by dense smoke, especially those residents on the top floors of the tower. “I’m very religious and I kneeled down and I begged our lady of Fatima to protect them, to protect everybody in the building, but especially them because they are Portuguese and we knew them,"" says Fatima Alves. Helen was increasingly anxious. “At one point I think I asked one of my friends, ‘Can we speak to the fire people or the police you know?’ And she let me talk to them and we asked them, ‘What shall we do?’ And they say to us, ‘Someone is going to come and take you out,’” says Helen. “That's what they say to us from two to three o'clock. So we've been waiting and waiting and waiting. And then we call again and we asked them. And they said, ‘No, stay in, do not come out. Don't come out, don't come out.’” So the Gomes family and the Gebremeskels waited. At about 03:30, Marcio and Andreia’s bedroom caught fire. “My room is on fire.  Just like that.  My curtains are on fire.  My Moses basket is on fire.  All that side of the window is on fire,” says Marcio. “I looked at them and I said, ‘We have to go now.  There’s no turning back.  It’s now or never.’” Marcio tied wet tea towels around everyone's faces, wrapped wet sheets around them and gave specific instructions about the order in which they should leave.  They began the descent in the pitch black, gagging as they attempted to get down 21 floors of smoke-filled stairs. They found themselves treading on the dead and the dying - other Grenfell residents who, like them, had tried to get out of the building before passing out on the stairs. “We were just going, just going and going, because if we don’t keep going, we’re going to die,” says Helen. Helen, Andreia and Megan, who were at the front, managed to get out.  But when they turned around, Marcio, Luana and Lulya weren’t behind them.  The girls had been overcome by smoke at about the 10th floor and Marcio was desperately trying to find them in the darkness. ""I said, 'I’m here, follow my voice.’ I tried to climb up. She said, ‘I can’t, Dad.’ Then she didn’t talk any more. The smoke was so heavy you couldn’t see.  I kept trying to shout, ‘I’m waiting.’” Marcio saw a light. Two firefighters were on their way upstairs.  They rescued the girls and brought them down to safety. All three children and Andreia Gomes were put into induced comas and treated for cyanide poisoning.  Logan, the Gomeses’ son-to-be, was stillborn in hospital.  It has been difficult to cope with his death - and the deaths of other close friends and neighbours. Andreia Gomes “To me, it’s like yesterday.  Sleeping is horrible.  It’s good to talk about it.  We do that every day,” says Andreia. Marcio is angry that concerns about safety were ignored by the council and the tenants' management organisation before the fire. “Yes, it was an accident, but it could have been avoided.  The residents never wanted cladding, we wanted sprinklers.  We said to them many times it didn’t feel safe after the regeneration work they spent three years doing.  They kept saying, ‘Be quiet, it’s fine.’” But Marcio and Andreia are clear they don’t blame the firefighters for any of what happened. And they are intensely grateful to the two who picked their way through the darkness to rescue Luana and Lulya. The London Fire Brigade rescued 65 people during the fire. Due to ongoing investigations and the public inquiry, it says it cannot go into details of what happened on the night. Now the Gomes family home is just ash.  Detectives showed them a 360-degree view of the flat. “It’s pretty much all gone. The only thing that remained was the metal frames of the beds,” says Marcio.  “There’s a huge crack in the floor.  The fire must have been so intense in that area.  It was difficult for me and my wife to see, but it was important, to close that chapter in the book.” Both the dogs that the Gomeses and Gebremeskels tried to rescue died - after the girls passed out, both dogs ran back to their flats. As for the material possessions they have lost, though everything is gone, it’s the sentimental things “you can’t put a price on” that are missed. “The first thing I thought of was the nursery books my daughters had done, and pictures of course,” says Andreia. “I had photos of my mum who passed away.  The negatives were there, but we lost them as well.” Three months on from the fire, the family are still living in a hotel. They’ve only been shown one potential new flat in all that time and the strain is beginning to show. Marcio believes they can rebuild their lives. “We have to for the sake of the girls,” says Andreia. But they are haunted by what happened and by the fine line between death and survival. “I am not sleeping too well at the moment and that’s because all those things keep running through my head,” says Marcio. But his actions on the night were key to their escape.  He was calm and organised, filling the bath, wetting towels, giving clear instructions to the others about how they might make it out of the building.  Six of the seven people who escaped from the 21st floor that night did so under his guidance. Helen Gebremeskel Born in Ethiopia, Helen Gebremeskel, 45, came to the UK as a political asylum seeker when she was a child.  She moved into Grenfell Tower 20 years ago. For 17 years she lived in a one-bedroom council flat and then in 2014 she moved down a floor, to the two-bed council flat on the 21st floor she shared with her daughter Lulya – Flat 186. “It was a very special building, Grenfell Tower, very special,” says Helen. Lulya misses the flat. “Like when I walk through, I open the door and I hear my dog bark.  And then I miss my friends that I would play with.” Lulya: “I miss my friends” Helen’s flat was painstakingly decorated - a haven of white with a few splashes of purple in the form of cushions and carpet. She was proud of the home she’d created with its corner sofa in the living room, its large television and its designed feel. “It was very nice.  Whoever comes in that house is shocked.  It was a beautiful house.  The living room was very big.  And the kitchen, it’s very big.  I have never seen a council flat that big.” Off the entrance corridor, Helen had created a prayer room - a quiet place for someone with a hectic working life. Every day Helen went to the beauty salon she ran in west London. “I’m always working, I always go home late.  The only day I have a day off is Sunday which is to spend time with my daughter.” Helen was always close to her neighbours, the Gomes family. Lulya often spent time with their daughters. The night of the fire began like many other evenings for the family in Grenfell.  Lulya had a shower and watched a movie while Helen cooked their dinner.  They ate together and then went to bed.  But Helen was woken just before 01:30 by her fire alarm and immediately smelled smoke.  When she looked out of her kitchen window, she could see the fire. She woke Lulya, who grabbed their dog, and they tried to go down the staircase. That attempt failed but ultimately they were to be successful. Helen talks wistfully of the community she’s lost. “It’s my home. I know a lot of the people there, my neighbours, and everyone there.   When you live somewhere for 20 years, it’s your home. It’s very difficult for us.” As well as her neighbours on the 21st floor, her best friends in the tower were the Choucair family - Nadia Choucair, her husband Bassem and their three children, Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab who was three.  They lived on the 22nd floor and were her neighbours for 17 years. Helen spoke to them a lot on the night of the fire as they sheltered in their flat one floor up. “The last time I called them and I say to them, ‘You need to get out, you need to get out.  No-one’s coming to rescue us, you need to get out.’ I explained to them, ‘Just cover them with a wet towel, just wet it and just get out.’ I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for Marcio. Her husband Bassem was crying.  He was crying and that was the last time I spoke to them.” Helen is devastated by their loss. “It’s very emotional, thinking you’ve got friends there who support you, is always there with you, you know. And then, all of a sudden, they’re not there.” Flat 182 was the home of NHS worker Abdulaziz El Wahabi, 52, and charity volunteer Faouzia El Wahabi, 42. They lived with their children Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 15, and Mehdi, eight. Abdulaziz worked long hours as a hospital porter. He was dedicated, with a great sense of fun, says his brother-in-law Chris Jones. “You have to have a sense of humour to work in the NHS.  He never complained, he got on with the job.  Being a porter, you’re someone who goes to the operating theatre, to X-rays.  It’s a very important job - you just don’t get well paid for it.” Abdulaziz at work in University College Hospital Faouzia volunteered at the Westway Trust, teaching people to knit and crochet. She was also an involved parent at her youngest son’s school. “His mum always came on our visits. She’d accompany the class.  The children got to know her very well.  She had a wonderful smile.  She was a lovely lady,” says Sara Cooper, head teacher at the Oxford Gardens primary school. Originally from the harbour town of Larache in northern Morocco, Abdulaziz moved to the UK when he was nine.  His father, who was also a hospital porter, came on a visit to London and liked it so much, he stayed and got a job.  Soon after, he brought his family over to live with him.  His son, Abdulaziz, had two brothers and six sisters who all live in Britain. Abdulaziz and Faouzia had three children, all born in the UK. The family moved to Grenfell  shortly after the birth of their oldest son Yasin, 20 years ago. “That flat was their home.  It was like they took Morocco and it was in the flat,” says Chris Jones. Flat 182 was full of Moroccan artefacts including carpets and ceramics gathered on the family’s trips back to north Africa. There were Moroccan paintings on the walls and mirrors with Moroccan frames. There was even a miniature electrically operated water fountain with ceramic tiles. “Abdulaziz loved plants,” says sister Hanan Wahabi, who lived in another part of the tower. “He had a range of plants and he took pride in how much they would grow. “Abdulaziz and Faouzia were both proud of their children and liked having their photos displayed showing the progression of how they had grown.” The couple had just finished redecorating their bedroom. They changed the flooring from carpet to laminate wood and bought new cupboards and drawers from Ikea which the older two children helped to put together. The oldest child, Yasin, was studying accountancy part-time at Greenwich University.  He’d also completed a course as a referee at football tournaments, worked in Subway and helped one of his uncles on his stall in Portobello market selling Moroccan rugs. “Yasin was a grafter.  He had lots of friends.  Everybody loved Yasin,” says Chris. Yasin on holiday in Morocco Nur Huda, their only daughter, was described by her teachers at Holland Park School as a “warm and good-spirited 15-year-old”. She loved playing football. Nur Huda had finished some of her GCSEs just before the fire. Her aunt, Hanan, picked up the results when they came.  Nur Huda got an A in additional science and Bs in core science, history, PE, maths, English language and literature. “Her parents would have been proud of her,” says Hanan. Nur Huda was taking her GCSEs in June Eight-year-old Mehdi was in year three at Oxford Gardens Primary School.  A keen judo fan, his friends made a collage to describe him.  It included the words “funny”, “loving”, “warm”, “beautiful person”. Mehdi, dressed for World Book Day The El Wahabis, the Gomes family say, were at the heart of the 21st floor community.   The children were in and out of each other’s homes and the adults often knocked on each other’s doors for a chat or to borrow something when they’d run out.  Faouzia’s generosity stands out. “I remember one Christmas, she came to knock on our door, with this huge chicken.  She said, ‘This is for you, it’s Christmas,’” says Andreia Gomes. On the night of the fire, the El Wahabis ate together as a family.  It was Ramadan and Yasin went to the mosque to perform the specific prayer that follows the fast.  He then went out with some cousins and friends to an American diner in west London before returning home.  Abdulaziz and the rest of the family stayed and prayed in their flat.  Nur Huda was revising for her GCSE exams. Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya saw the El Wahabis at about 01:30 as they all tried to escape the building.  But as they attempted to go downstairs, they were turned back by other Grenfell residents who were coming up the staircase. “People were telling us to go back up.  Because the firefighters had told them to go back up, to go to the top,” says Lulya. Relatives of the El Wahabis spoke to them by phone that night. Abdulaziz’s sister Hanan lived with her family on the ninth floor.  She escaped from the building at about 01:20 and then spoke to her brother at 01:25.  He said he was going to try and get out with his family.  They spoke again at about 01:30 and Abdulaziz told her they hadn’t been able to get out because it was pitch black and they were struggling to breathe outside the flat. When Hanan called again, the family said they’d been told by the emergency services to stay put and await rescue.  Another sister spoke to Faouzia El Wahabi at about 02:00.  Faouzia told her that the emergency services had advised the family to move into the bedroom and put towels under the door. Chris Jones and his wife also spoke to Abdulaziz that night. “He said, ‘There’s a lot of smoke, we’re not leaving.’  After that, that was it.  We tried ringing and ringing, but there was no answer,” says Chris. “I’ve thought a few times about being put in the position where you’ve made a decision for the family around you.  The last thing you would do is what we call the Shahada [prayer]. They would have got comfort out of that.” The surviving relatives have endured a long wait to find the remains of their loved ones.  All five members of the family - Abdulaziz, Faouzia, Yasin, Nur Huda and Mehdi - have now been identified in the flat.  Relatives received the news about Nur Huda only in the middle of September. The tragedy of the family’s demise has rippled out into the community. Head teacher Sara Cooper had to break the news to Mehdi’s class. “It was incredibly hard.  There was lots of sobbing, but I think it was important because they were ready – they were at the point where they could cry, because of all the amazing work their teachers had done. We all cried together.” A week after the fire, University College Hospital paid tribute to its missing porter.  The chief executive, Marcel Levi, said: “Abdulaziz is an extremely dedicated and hugely popular member of staff.  He is a larger than life character who never fails to show kindness and compassion to patients and colleagues.” Chris Jones is still trying to deal with what has happened. “If there was a good way to die, it would be among people who loved you and cared for you and would do anything on this earth to be with you.” “I can’t believe we won’t see them any more,” says Andreia Gomes. “The youngest one used to come and knock on our door every Sunday to play with our youngest. She used to go there as well to have dinner with them.  We used to see them every day, if not one of the children then the mum or dad.  I think I’m still just expecting to bump into one of them in the road.” Only 14 flats in Grenfell Tower were not in council hands - two were owned by housing associations and 12 had private owners. One of those was on the 21st floor. Flat 185 had been bought from the council in 2000 under right- to-buy rules by its tenant, Nigerian-born Tunde Adoweru. He had moved out a few years before and begun to rent out his property. The listing on the rental website described “a fabulous, bright two-bedroom flat, with panoramic views of London landmarks - 77 square metres in size, includes a contemporary fully fitted kitchen and open plan living room, two double bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, limestone bathroom and separate toilet.” Management consultant Julian Ng, 30, and IT platforms engineer Lee Stewart, 29, both British-born, had moved in 11 days before the fire. Their rent was more than £400 a week.  But the flat’s spacious rooms, chrome kitchen and surround sound stereo system immediately attracted them. “When you stepped into the flat itself, it was beautiful, tasteful, modern and because it was on the 21st floor, it had amazing views,” says Julian. “How do you describe London?  It’s very diverse.  And that’s what we got from this place.  It was a very nice place to live in.” Lee also liked the building. “It’s been painted as a very, kind of, poverty-stricken building.  Maybe parts of it were.  But that’s not the impression we had when viewing it.” The couple had started to plan for dinner parties. “We had a huge glass dining table, loads of windows.  You could take advantage of the views from so high up,” says Lee. They had a lucky escape on the night of the fire.  It was Lee’s birthday.  Julian was away for work and had invited his partner to spend the night in his hotel. They heard about the fire when their landlord called them at about 03:00. They watched the blaze on TV, horrified by what was happening and wondering about their new neighbours. “My last morning in there, I was late for work, it was 8.55.  The lifts took a really long time to get down - they were stopping at most floors and kids were piling in, going to the school just outside.  There were so many families and children in there.  You have a hazy memory of who you’ve seen, knowing not all of them will be OK,” says Lee. Julian and Lee have had moments of overwhelming sadness. “There’s a huge sense of loss,” says Lee. “It was my first night away from the flat.  I should have been home.  If I had been, when would I have heard?  Would I have been able to get out?  Would I have got messages to my family?  I keep thinking about the ‘what ifs’.  We were very lucky.” The couple have lost all their possessions and, like the Gomes family, it’s the more personal belongings that matter. “I had a stupid plant I carried around for 10 years,” says Lee. “It had a name, it is really daft. I’m terrible at gardening and can’t keep anything alive.  But this plant lived for 10 years.  It’s just stuff like that that’s irreplaceable.” Julian lost old photos from university and childhood.  “One of the things Lee liked was a T-shirt I had.  That’s lost.  OK, I can replace it, but not that specific T-shirt. [Or] the cuddly toy you had for 10 years.” Ligaya Moore’s friend, Nenita Bungay In one of the one-bedroom flats lived Ligaya Moore, who came to Britain from the Philippines about 45 years ago. Her friend Nenita Bungay says Ligaya had always dreamed of living in the UK. She came to work as a nanny and later was a waitress, and had married a British man, James Moore.  He died of cancer a decade ago and Ligaya, by then retired, continued to live in their council flat.  She was a keen ballroom dancer back in the day. A photo of Ligaya's wedding “She was an active person, she loved to dance, even at her age.  That’s why she loved our church because she loved dancing,” says Pastor Emil from the Jesus is Lord Church. Ligaya was well known to her neighbours on the 21st floor. “She was always sweet after school, because sometimes I’d come home by myself.  I’d see her in the lift and she would always offer me a sweet,” says Lulya. “She was lovely, she always played with the kids.  She was 80, something like that I think, and she used to use the stairs for exercise!  It was amazing.  From the 21st floor to the ground is a lot of steps,” says Marcio Gomes. On the night of the fire, none of the surviving neighbours saw Ligaya at all. Nenita was the last person to see her. “We had a wonderful dinner that night.  She peeled avocado.  We had a wonderful salad.  I brought some porridge.  She brought chocolate.  She was so happy.” After the meal, they went their separate ways at about 22:30.  Nenita got a call that night from another friend to say Ligaya’s building was on fire. “I call her every minute, no answer,” says Nenita. Nenita Bungay hopes her friend died peacefully in her sleep “I am thinking she was in a deep sleep, maybe in a deep sleep and being suffocated with fire and smoke.” The police showed Nenita footage of Ligaya’s burnt- out flat. “The ceiling, the walls, everything is rubble… everything is collapsed. The bed is only coils, the fridge is only a skeleton.” Forensic teams have located human remains inside Ligaya’s flat.  They haven’t yet been identified as hers. Very sadly, on 14 June, rescue never came for Ligaya Moore, or the El Wahabis in flat 182. Their neighbours will never forget them. “We used to see them every day,” says Andreia Gomes. “I can’t believe I won’t see them any more.” The occupant of Flat 184, who escaped the fire, chose not to take part in this report. Apart from the permanent residents, there have been reports of a woman from the Philippines, illegally in Britain, who claimed to live on the 21st floor. On contacting her, she said she was homeless and had spent time between two flats in Grenfell Tower - sometimes staying on the 21st floor but not on the night of the fire. She chose not to take part in this report. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.0012589741
"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul's Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened On a cold and crisp December morning, there was a noticeable silence around St Paul's as people stopped to reflect. The poignant lull continued as survivors, friends and families of those affected by the fire quietly began to make their way into the cathedral. This silence was only broken when the majestic bells of St Paul's tolled across the City of London at 10:30. At the same time a spontaneous ripple of applause broke out from the crowd as firefighters made their way up the cathedral steps. Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones It was a sign of the gratitude for the efforts of the emergency services on the night of 14 June. The bells continued to chime for 30 minutes, a mark of respect to the 71 who died in Grenfell Tower. And it is clear why the survivors chose St Paul's, a cathedral where so many services of national significance have taken place over the years. One mourner, Damel Carayol, 55, who lost his 44-year-old cousin Mary Mandy in the fire, said the service was needed and the venue fitting. The service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, in central London ""It recognises the tragedy on a national level,"" he said. ""It's a step, but the biggest step will be accountability."" And while the service was being held it became apparent that the anger and uncertainty on display in the aftermath of the fire remained. There are currentlydozens of households still stuck in hotels. Outside St Paul's, Prof Chris Imafidon said he knows of 20 people who lost everything in the fire. ""It is a very sad day,"" he said. ""But the families want a service from the council, not a church service. ""This is just a big distraction from the fact that six months on many families are still homeless and will be spending Christmas in a hotel,"" he said. There was another moment of reflection after the service finished. Hundreds of relatives and survivors gathered on the steps of St Paul's, displaying single white roses and photographs of those who perished. Some survivors then went straight back to their hotels. But there was then a range of emotions on display as others moved on to St Paul's churchyard. Visibly upset, they hugged and consoled each other, while some continued to vent their anger and speak of feeling neglected.

"The Bank of England says confidence among households and businesses is likely to be supported by last week's progress in Brexit talks. Last week the European Union agreedthat sufficient progress had been made in Brexit negotiations to allow progress to the next stage and to put in place a transition period from 2019. The Bank said that would reduce the likelihood of a ""disorderly"" Brexit. Bank policy makers have also agreed to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%. In minutes from the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Bank said that since its previous meeting in early November there had been two ""significant events"":  the Autumn Budget and progress in Brexit talks. Last week's agreement between the UK and the European Union would ""reduce the likelihood of a disorderly exit, and was likely to support household and corporate confidence,"" the MPC said. However, it said the reaction of households, businesses and markets to developments on Brexit talks ""remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook"". Since their last meeting, members of the MPC have also assessed the potential impact of the November's Autumn Budget. They believe it will lift the level of GDP by 0.3% by 2020, as Chancellor Philip Hammond eased up on austerity measures. US Federal reserve raises interest rates Eurozone interest rates kept on hold Black Friday lifts UK retail sales Pay squeeze continues for UK households On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index hit 3.1% in November, the highest rate in nearly six years. That rise above 3% means Bank of England governor Mark Carney has to write to the government and explain why inflation is so far above the target of 2%. That letter will be revealed along with the Bank's next Quarterly Inflation report, next February. The MPC today repeated its view that inflation was ""likely to be close to its peak"". The Bank argues that the main reason behind rising inflation has been the decline in value of the pound, which fell sharply in June 2016 when the UK voted to leave the European Union. Although the pound has recovered in recent months, it is still about 10% lower against the dollar and the euro, which makes imported goods, food and raw materials more expensive. Last month the MPC decided to raise interest rates for the first time in 10 years. It attributed the 0.25% rise to record-low unemployment, rising inflation and stronger global growth. It also indicated there would be two more rises over the next three years. In the minutes from its latest meeting the Bank said ""modest"" increases in interest rates would be needed over the next few years, but repeated previous promises that those rises would be ""gradual and to a limited extent"". Higher interest rates have a big impact on the economy. Of the 8.1 million households with a mortgage, 3.7 million - or 46% - are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate - which generally move in line with the official bank rate. A move higher can also give savers a lift as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest.

"Morgan Spurlock made his name with the documentary Super Size Me, which looked at the effects of eating fast food US documentary film-maker Morgan Spurlockhas publicly confessed to a history of sexual misconduct,external, referring to himself as ""part of the problem"". Spurlock, who made the hit film Super Size Me, wrote on Twitter that he had been accused of rape and had paid to settle a claim of sexual harassment. He also admitted cheating on ""every wife and girlfriend I have ever had"". The US entertainment industry has been rocked by claims of sexual abuse and harassment going back decades. In a lengthy statement, Spurlock said that after months of such revelations he had come to the conclusion that ""I am not some innocent bystander, I am also a part of the problem"". ""As I sit around watching hero after hero, man after man, fall at the realisation of their past indiscretions, I don't sit by and wonder 'who will be next?'

He said the allegations of rape took place at college. It did not lead to charges or investigations but he said the woman had written about the incident in a story writing class and had named Spurlock. The settlement for alleged harassment involved a female employee and took place about eight years ago, he said. ""It wasn't a gropy, feely harassment. It was verbal, and it was just as bad,"" he wrote. ""I would call my female assistant 'hot pants' or 'sex pants' when I was yelling to her from the other side of the office.

""Being who I was, it was the last thing I wanted, so of course I paid,"" he said. ""I paid for peace of mind. I paid for her silence and co-operation. Most of all, I paid so I could remain who I was."" Spurlock said he himself had been the victim of sexual abuse as a boy and a teenager, and also had a longstanding drink problem. ""I haven't been sober for more than a week in 30 years, something our society doesn't shun or condemn but which only served to fill the emotional hole inside me and the daily depression I coped with,"" he wrote. Spurlock said he hoped that by ""recognising and openly admitting what I've done to further this terrible situation, I hope to empower the change within myself"".

Shortly afterwards, NatWest registered the nuuolb.com web address. But Mr Hunt, who has previously testified before US Congress on matters of cyber-security, said the bank had missed the point. ""We're seeing 'Not secure' next to the address bar,"" he said. ""I would opine that 'Not secure' is not what you want to see on your bank."" A spokesman for RBS, which owns NatWest, told the BBC: ""We take the security of our services extremely seriously. While we do not currently enforce HTTPS on some of our websites, we are working towards upgrading this in the next 48 hours. ""Our online banking channel is secured with HTTPS."" Security researchers found several other major banks did not use HTTPS on their homepages. First Direct told the BBC: ""This functionality is something we're currently reviewing."" Lloyds Banking Group said the websites for Lloyds and Halifax did typically use HTTPS, but had also ""allowed HTTP access"" if people typed in the web address manually. ""We are in the final stages of correcting this,"" a spokesman told the BBC.  It implemented changes on Thursday evening. Tesco Bank has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. Online banking websites use HTTPS connections to help keep customer data private. When a website uses HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure), any information sent between your device and the website is encrypted, so it cannot be read if it is intercepted. However, security researchers found several banks did not use HTTPS on the rest of their websites, including the homepage on which visitors land. NatWest originally tweeted that it did not use HTTPS on its homepage because it only contained ""general information"". But the researchers suggested that without HTTPS an attacker could theoretically modify elements of a bank's website. They could send victims to a fake online banking site and steal their information. ""The homepage is insecure so you can't trust anything on it,"" said Mr Hunt. ""This is a banking website. No excuses,"" added Stephen Kellett, from security firm Software Verify. ""All pages, whether performing transactions, the homepage, the about page, the whole lot, they should all be secure. Why? Because they all launch the login page."" ""There are various ways this can be exploited, to lure the client on to a phishing website,"" said Dr Mark Manulis, from the Surrey Centre for Cyber-security. A phishing page is designed to look like a legitimate website to trick people into handing over personal information. ""It's possible to spoof the website and create a fake login button. Phishing attacks for a long time have been a major threat and can be quite sophisticated.  This makes such attacks easier.""

"A Home Office policy of removing EU citizens found sleeping rough on UK streets is unlawful and must stop, the High Court has ruled. A judge said the measure, introduced last year, was discriminatory and broke freedom of movement rules. Campaigners brought the case on behalf of three men facing removal. The government said it was disappointed by the ruling - which applies to people from the EU and European Economic Area - but would not be appealing. The Public Interest Law Unit (PILU) at Lambeth Law Centre, which took out the judicial review, said the decision would affect hundreds of people. It said the Home Office had been carrying out ""regular raids"" on locations where officials believed they would find European nationals who could be deported. In herruling,external, the judge, Mrs Justice Lang, also said the Home Office was wrong to have used the raids as a chance to verify whether the rough sleepers were abusing their right to reside in another European nation. PILU said the High Court had shown itself willing to protect the rights of a vulnerable group, adding: ""Homelessness cannot humanely be dealt with by detaining or forcibly removing homeless people."" Three men facing removal orders from the Home Office were selected as ""test cases"" for the hearing: Latvian Gunars Gureckis, who had been in the UK since 2009, and had a long history of sleeping rough interspersed with periods where he did have accommodation Polish citizen Mariusz Cielecki, who arrived in the UK in 2015 and unsuccessfully tried to appeal against his order, claiming he was looking for work Polish citizen Mariusz Perlinski, who was in poor health and alcohol dependent and had lived in the UK since 2011. He became homeless in November 2016 and was held in an immigration centre. The judge said the order should be dropped against Mr Gureckis, while Mr Cielecki is now expected to appeal against his. The order against Mr Perlinski was withdrawn in November after he began living with a relative. She said ""rough sleeping, even accompanied by low level offending such as begging, drinking in a public place and other street nuisances, would not be grounds for removal"" and the Home Office's ""less favourable"" treatment of rough sleepers from outside the UK could not be justified. The Home Office said the EU'sFree Movement Directive,externalallowed member states to impose restrictions on people in certain situations, including where there were concerns about security, public health, or fraud. Its lawyers had argued the operations to remove the rough sleepers were a ""sensible and lawful approach"". A spokesman said: ""We will consider carefully what steps are necessary to ensure we reflect the judgment in future enforcement."" He added that most of the people removed under the measure had not exercised their rights to residency in the UK when required and were therefore unlawfully in the country. Speaking after the ruling, Matthew Downie from the homeless charity Crisis, who gave evidence against the Home Office, said the policy had been ""brutal and indiscriminate"". He said in many cases people had been taken away from help they were getting to resolve their homelessness.

"Robin was 13 when he found out he was adopted. Later he was told he had been abandoned - left in a box on London's Oxford Street. Now 74, he has spent most of his life wondering who left him and why. But thanks to DNA, and the dogged detective work of one of his daughters, he finally has some answers. When Robin King discovered he was adopted he ran away from home. He had been snooping around his parents' bedroom when he came across his adoption papers in a holdall. He fled to a friend's house and the pair then cycled from London to Southend where they slept in a tent until they were picked up by the police a few days later. ""My friend's mum had to pay for us to come back on the train,"" Robin recalls. At home, no-one ever mentioned the subject of his adoption. ""I was afraid of raising it as I didn't want any confrontation. I think it affected me deep down,"" he says. Robin was adopted by Fred and Elsie King when he was four-and-a-half Robin had been adopted by Fred and Elsie King and grew up in a poor part of Woolwich, in south London. It was just after the end of World War Two and his earliest memories are of playing on bomb sites and his mother cleaning for the ""rich people in Charlton"". He finished school with few qualifications and in his own words, ""went off the rails for a while"". But in his 20s he got married, had two daughters and moved to Peterborough, where he worked as a town planner, and later as an architect. ""I would never have got to where I did today without my family. I really love my two girls, they were the only people with a biological connection to me,"" he says. Robin with his daughters, Lorraine and Michaela A few years later Robin applied for a passport for work and was called by an official from the passport office. He had startling news. ""I was asked my age. Then the man said: 'I don't think it will bother you too much to learn that you were abandoned at the Peter Robinson store in London.'"" This was how Robin discovered that he was a foundling - and why his first name was Robin and his second was Peter. Many years passed before Robin next made serious efforts to discover more about his past. In 1996, already in his 50s, he went with his daughter Michaela to the London Metropolitan Archive to look at his full adoption record. He learned he had been found outside the Oxford Circus department store on 20 October, 1943. It was a dangerous time to be in London. Although the Blitz had finished, there were still intermittent attacks by the Luftwaffe. Just 10 days earlier 30 tons of bombs had been dropped on the capital. His file said he had been adopted by the Kings when he was four-and-a-half years old and that they had thanked the authorities for giving them such as ""good little boy"". However, there were no clues as to why he'd been left. ""Efforts to trace any relative of child have not been successful,"" one document stated. Robin's daughter Lorraine decided to continue the search. Over the next 20 years she wrote to every TV show she could think of that reunited families or solved mysteries. Each time the reply was the same - without the names of the birth parents there was nothing to go on. Lorraine then found a library archivist who searched through spools of microfilm looking for any mention of a foundling in old newspapers. She wrote to the Arcadia Group, which took over the Peter Robinson store, in case there was any mention in their archives. ""I used to have moments of inspiration when I thought, 'I know I'll write to so-and-so,'"" Lorraine says. Then last year she watched an episode of The One Show on BBC One featuring a people-tracing expert called Cat Whiteaway. ""I contacted Cat explaining my dad's situation. A few weeks later she told me she had met someone she thought could help - a DNA detective called Julia Bell."" Julia had managed to track down her own American GI grandfather using DNA and genealogical research. She had then started helping other people look for their relatives in her spare time. ""My mother had been left with so many questions and this answered some of them and gave her a great sense of peace,"" Julia says. ""I believe everyone deserves to know who they really are."" Julia took on Robin's case and sent off saliva tests to three consumer DNA databases - Ancestry, 23andme and Family Tree DNA. ""We had lots of theories when we started. Lots of people told me I looked American and we thought maybe I was a GI baby, but they weren't over here in 1943,"" Robin says. Soon there was exciting news - the 23andme results had provided a DNA match. ""She was called Maria in New York. I thought, 'Well that's it - we've done it!'"" Lorraine says. But it wasn't so simple. The test showed Maria and Robin shared about 1% of their DNA, making them either second or third cousins. ""We contacted Maria and she agreed to collaborate to create a full family tree going back several generations to her 16 great-great-grandparents,"" Julia says. ""Our goal was then to bring each of these lines down to recent times to try and find a likely parent for Robin."" To give some idea of the scale of the task, if each of the great-great-grandparents and their descendants had just two children, there would be 224 people who could be one of Robin's parents. ""We had no idea who would be the shared ancestor on the family tree. It's like the children's puzzle when you have to work out which is the right path that leads to the pot of gold,"" Lorraine says. Robin and daughter Lorraine discuss the family tree (Photo: Phil Coomes) Working as a team, Julia and Lorraine used censuses, birth and marriage indexes and wills to reconstruct the family tree. Results from Ancestry suggested Robin had a strong Scottish/Irish connection, which helped. When they felt they might be getting close, they would look to see whether a descendant could have been in the right place at the right time. ""I was working on it every night like someone possessed. Every time I had a breakthrough I'd get excited and it spurred me on,"" Lorraine says. After a year of trial and error, and a number of dead ends, they tracked down a woman called Agnes, who had been born in Scotland and died in Canada. ""I had a strong hunch that this could be my dad's mother,"" Lorraine says. She found a phone number for Agnes's son Grant, and rang one Saturday afternoon. ""I explained I was researching my dad's family tree and all the details. It went a bit quiet,"" Lorraine says. ""He said, 'That's really strange because when my mum got Alzheimer's she started talking as if she'd had another baby and would talk to me like I was that baby.'"" Grant agreed to take a DNA test, which Julia sent out to Canada. Lorraine suspected he would be a half-sibling, proving Agnes had had a wartime affair. However, the results showed Grant was actually Robin's full brother, meaning they shared both parents. ""I cried when Julia told me. I just couldn't believe it,"" Lorraine says. Douglas and Agnes Jones - Robin's biological parents Grant explained that Robin's parents were Douglas and Agnes Jones. Douglas was in the Royal Canadian Air Force and had met and married Agnes in Glasgow. The couple moved to Canada after the war ended and Douglas qualified as a psychologist. They had three more children - Karen, born 14 years after Robin, then Grant and another daughter, Peggy. Lorraine drove over to Robin's house to tell him the news face-to-face. ""He was a bit upset and went out the room. Then he came back and we went through it all,"" Lorraine says. Robin was surprised to discover that his parents had married in December 1942 - before he was conceived. ""If they didn't want me, why didn't they give me up for adoption?"" he asks. ""It just doesn't make sense to me."" Oxford Street during the Blitz - London continued to endure sporadic attacks throughout the war Sadly Robin can't get them to explain it to him. Douglas Jones died in 1975 and Agnes passed away in 2014. ""I feel like it was an opportunity lost. I would have gone over to meet her if I could,"" Robin says. ""I can see how Agnes and Douglas couldn't see a way of coping with war and a baby so early in their marriage. ""But I can't understand how you could leave a baby in central London, which was such a dangerous place at the time."" Robin's oldest sister, Karen, visited from Canada a few months ago. She told him that their parents had mentioned an earlier baby but said it had been stillborn. However, around this time, Lorraine also found Agnes's half-brother, Brian, who lives in Scotland, and he had heard a different story - that Agnes had had a baby and given it up for adoption to an Air Force couple who were unable to have children. Though legal adoption had been possible since 1926 it remained common in the 1940s for one couple to simply agree to hand their child over to another. In September 1945, the Evening Despatch newspaper quoted a medical officer who said: ""More than once children have been handed from parent to adopting parent following a casual meeting in a queue or in an employment exchange."" Robin with his sister Karen, during their first meeting Julia Bell believes Robin could have been abandoned after such a handover went wrong. It's a scenario she has come across a number of times in her detective work. ""Imagine you've steeled yourself and no-one shows at the meeting place. You're not going to go back with the baby - it's going to have to be left,"" she says. Lorraine says this would help explain some puzzling aspects of the story. ""Apparently my grandma was a lovely lady, a homely mum and really nice,"" she says, ""which makes it hard to understand why she would do something like leave a baby."" Then there is a birth certificate, which reveals Robin was born on 10 October at a maternity unit in Winchester. If Agnes had been planning to break the law by leaving her baby on the street, Lorraine thinks she would most likely have given birth at home, to prevent the birth being officially recorded. But other details remain perplexing. One is that the couple registered the baby's birth two weeks after abandoning him - and provided details such as his father's service number. ""I would have thought they'd put as little information as possible,"" Lorraine says. They also gave him family names - Brian after Agnes's half-brother and Douglas after his father. Robin and Lorraine with Cat Whiteaway (left) and Vanessa Feltz after the Jeremy Vine Show Robin and Lorraine had finally found their family, but they were still desperate to find someone who could tell them about the day he was left. They made an appeal on BBC's Jeremy Vine show on Radio 2. ""We thought someone might have had a family story of finding a baby in London during the war,"" Lorraine says. ""It got our search out to more people but sadly it didn't lead to anything."" However, the BBC was able to fill in another piece of the jigsaw. It turns out 200 Oxford Street, which was part of Peter Robinson's department store, had been taken over by the BBC's Overseas Service in 1941. Staff, including the writer George Orwell, made regular radio broadcasts from the building during the war. Pictured in 1949, 200 Oxford Street was the home of the BBC's Overseas Service during WW2 - it's now a branch of Urban Outfitters Trevor Hill, 92, was a junior programme engineer there at the time. And when asked if he remembered a baby being abandoned there during the war, remarkably he did - a baby wrapped in a blanket left in a box close to the front entrance. ""I worked at 200 Oxford Street and I do remember the baby in the box,"" he says. ""I did Home Guard duty for the BBC so when I saw the box I was slightly worried. ""We weren't allowed to leave deliveries or anything lying around because of security."" Trevor Hill became a BBC announcer after working as a studio manager during World War Two A couple of security guards went to check it - and discovered Robin inside. ""I imagine the baby was taken inside to the staff canteen where there was milk, although I doubt we had any bottles,"" Trevor says. ""We thought that the child's home might have been bombed and the mother had left it in desperation. It was typical of war time."" Recently, Robin and Trevor met near the spot where their paths had crossed nearly 74 years before. This end of the former Peter Robinson store is now a branch of Urban Outfitters. ""It's been a terrific experience to find someone who saw me at that time of life,"" Robin says. The two men plan on exchanging Christmas cards this year. This video can not be played Watch: Robin meets Trevor. Courtesy of BBC Points West A few weeks ago Lorraine received another tantalising piece of information from Canada - a copy of Robin's father's war record. It revealed that in October 1943 Douglas, a corporal, was an instructor at No 7 Radio School in South Kensington. It's probable he was staying in digs nearby at the time while Agnes was living near Andover. Douglas was on leave for the week before Robin's birth on 10 October and for four days following it. However, his file indicates he was back at work when Robin was found abandoned on Wednesday 20 October. He was almost certainly present when the now abandoned Robin was registered as Brian Jones. He was on leave from 5 to 7 November. Baby Brian was registered on 6 November. Douglas's war leave record shows he was off on the day Robin was registered as Brian Jones Lorraine and Robin know they are running out of new avenues to follow. They are waiting for a second adoption file to be opened but Robin doesn't think it will reveal the secret of why he was left. They think Julia Bell's theory that an informal adoption went wrong may well be correct. However, they don't rule out the possibility that Douglas deliberately left the baby at the BBC, while telling friends and family the baby had been adopted. It's hard to be sure. But Lorraine and Robin have at least found some answers. ""It means a lot to find out what my dad's real name would have been and when he was actually born,"" Lorraine says. It turns out that Robin has been celebrating his birthday four days too early, on 6 October. That's the date officials estimated he was born, when he was found in 1943. In fact, his birth certificate reveals, he was born on 10 October. The search has strengthened the bond between Robin and his daughters (Photo: Phil Coomes) Robin hasn't decided yet which birthday to use in future, but he has no plans to change his name to Brian Douglas Jones. As regards his nationality, he is getting used to the idea that he is not English, as he always assumed, but half-Scottish and half-Canadian. ""I am happy we went down this route,"" he says. ""It's astounding to see what Lorraine did through trial and error. But there are certain things I will never know about my past.""

"The most advantaged teens have tightened their grip on university places, pulling further ahead of the least advantaged, Ucas data shows. Although more poorer students won places at university this year, wealthy students increased at a higher rate. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said he was reforming the sector to encourage equality of opportunity. The data also shows the number of unconditional offers made to students  jumped 40% last year to 51,615. These are offers made to students on the basis of their predicted grades rather than their actual results. Although at least one unconditional offer was made to 17.5% of students it is important to remember that students generally make five choices and often have multiple offers from which to chose. This year, unconditional offers accounted for less than 5% of offers made by the majority of the largest 140 higher education providers. Assessing the year-on-year data, the University and College Admissions Service said there had been no progress in equal representation since 2014. Successive ministers have required universities to do more to increase access for disadvantaged groups. And Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to put social mobility at the heart of her policies Ucas is using a new measure of equality that combines social background, ethnicity and gender to examine how well universities are opening their doors to all sections of society. Statisticians feel it sheds more light on the issue of equality of access because it looks at the interplay of a number of factors. Details of this backwards step on social mobility come at a time when the chances of getting a place at university have never been higher. In 2017, a third of 18-year-olds were accepted on to higher education courses in England. But a detailed look at who these teenagers are shows the most advantaged group increased their entry rate by 1.8% to 53.1% in 2017. This means over half of 18-year-olds in this top social group got places at university. Meanwhile, 13.8% of the most disadvantaged group netted places on courses, an increase of 1.2%. The statistics also show teenagers from the most advantaged group are still nearly 10 times more likely to attend the most competitive universities. However, the least advantaged students have made some headway, increasing their entry rates to these top institutions by 7.4%. Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: ""Although our analysis shows that a record number of disadvantaged young people have entered higher education this year - with the greatest increase at higher-tariff providers - gaps in participation remain wide."" The Ucas data also again shows that white pupils are less likely to go to university than any other ethnic group. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said he was encouraged by the record entry rates for young people going to university, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds. ""Today's figures show that 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas are now 50% more likely to go university in 2017 than in 2009. ""However, we recognise that there is more to do. ""That's why we have introduced sweeping reforms, including the new Office for Students, to ensure equality of opportunity."" Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Schools and colleges across the country are straining every sinew to improve the opportunities for disadvantaged pupils, and indeed all their young people. Significant challenges remain, however. ""In many communities, the impact of unemployment, insecure and low-paid work, and poor quality housing has had a devastating impact on the hopes and aspirations of families. ""In areas where traditional industries have collapsed, many white British families have been badly affected, and it is therefore not surprising that white pupils are proportionally less likely to go to university than other ethnic groups."" Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, was encouraged by the increase in disadvantaged students at top universities, but said they were still 5.5 times less likely to attend these institutions than their advantaged peers. ""As a result, people with the potential to excel are missing out on opportunities. This is an unforgivable waste of talent, and universities must continue to press for transformational progress.""

"Four Iraqi citizens have won damages from the Ministry of Defence for ill-treatment and unlawful detention during the Iraq War. The High Court ruled they were entitled to the compensation under the Human Rights Act. Lawyers said the four cases could pave the way for more than 600 other civilian claims to be settled. The MoD said it was ""studying the judgment."" One of the men was awarded more than Â£30,000 by the court in London. Abd Al-Waheed, who was arrested when British soldiers raided a house in the city of Basra, in February 2007, was given Â£15,000 in ""respect of the beating"" he suffered. He was awarded another Â£15,000 for what the judge described as ""the further inhuman and degrading treatment which he suffered, encompassing harsh interrogation, being deprived of sleep and being deprived of sight and hearing"". And he was also compensated Â£3,300 for 33 days of unlawful detention. Lawyer Phil Shiner was struck off after he was found guilty of misconduct charges By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent You may have thought this was over, but it's not. There has already been a huge political, public and media backlash against a perceived ""witch-hunt"" of British soldiers who took part in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Many of the claims against them, which included unlawful killings, proved to be exaggerated and unfounded. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Defence closed down its Iraq Historical Allegations Team, IHAT, after the vast majority of more than 3,000 claims of abuse had been dismissed. One of the leading lawyers, Phil Shiner, was struck off after he was found guilty of multiple professional misconduct charges, including dishonesty and lack of integrity. But, despite the sense of moral outrage, this High Court ruling shows not every claim has been spurious. A statement from Mr Al-Waheed's legal team, Leigh Day Solicitors, said the ill-treatment included soldiers taking turns running over the detainees' backs and hooding them for periods of time. Sapna Malik, a partner at the firm, said: ""These trials took place against an onslaught of political, military and media slurs of Iraqis bringing spurious claims, and strident criticism of us, as lawyers, representing them. ""It is vital that those wronged by the UK government, whether in this country or overseas, are able to seek justice and redress. Their ability to do so in our courts is not a witch hunt but a testament to the strength of our democracy."" This video can not be played Solicitor Sapna Malik praises the judge presiding over the cases A spokesman for the MoD said: ""Our military personnel served with great courage in Iraq, often working under extremely difficult circumstances.

"This video can not be played May: We've won 35 out of 36 votes Theresa May has said the UK is ""on course to deliver on Brexit"" as she arrived in Brussels, the day after her first Commons defeat as prime minister. She said she was ""disappointed"" at the vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, but the legislation was making ""good progress"". MPs backed an amendment giving them a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. EU leaders are expected to formally agree to start the next phase of negotiations on Friday. The European Commission has said ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the first phase to move onto discussing the framework of a future relationship between the EU and UK - on issues such as security and trade. Kamal Ahmed: Brexit transition deal is 'urgent', say MPs Can Leavers and Remainers call Christmas truce? What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do Mrs May told fellow EU leaders at dinner on Thursday that she wanted to get agreement on the ""implementation period"" as a priority but wanted to talk about trade ""as soon as possible"". She said was personally committed to delivering a ""smooth Brexit"" and she wanted to approach the next phase of talks ""with ambition and creativity"". Speaking to reporters earlier, she said: ""I'm disappointed with the amendment but actually the EU Withdrawal Bill is making good progress through the House of Commons and we are on course to deliver Brexit."" UK to stay in Erasmus scheme until at least 2020 MEPs vote on Brexit: What we learned Asked whether she felt she would have to compromise more to win over rebels from her own party, she told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""We've actually had 36 votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill, and we've won 35 of those votes with an average majority of 22."" Mrs May lost by just four votes, as MPs backed an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 to 305. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described it as a ""humiliating loss of authority"" for the PM and warned that his party would vote against another bit of the bill - the plan to put a fixed Brexit date into law. He said setting an ""arbitrary date"" was not sensible and there ""should be some flexibility"". This video can not be played Brexit is unstoppable and MPs will not block it, says Boris Johnson It will not derail Brexit but MPs who voted against the government hope it will give them a bigger say in the final deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that as other EU leaders also run minority or coalition governments they would see the vote defeat as a small-scale domestic political issue. The government had promised a ""meaningful vote"" for MPs on the final Brexit deal, but this defeat means that promise now has legal force and must happen before any UK-EU deal is implemented in the UK. Ministers had wanted to be able to start implementing any deal as soon as it was agreed - in case, for instance, it was only agreed at the last minute. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it would embolden the opposition and showed there was a majority in Parliament against a ""hard Brexit"". Cabinet Minister Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the vote was ""not going to stop Brexit"". Labour joined forces with the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party in a cross-party alliance. If all Conservative and DUP MPs had voted against the amendment the government would have won. But 11 Conservatives resisted the arm-twisting by their party managers to vote with the opposition. The Tory rebels were Dominic Grieve, Heidi Allen, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Stephen Hammond, Sir Oliver Heald, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. Another Conservative MP, John Stevenson, officially abstained by voting for and against the amendment. Two Eurosceptic Labour MPs - Frank Field and Kate Hoey - voted with the Conservatives and the DUP. This video can not be played ""I'm in parliament to do my duty by my constituents and by my country"" said Tory rebel Dominic Grieve Emotions ran high before, during and after Wednesday's Commons debate, with Eurosceptic Conservatives accusing the rebels of trying to ""frustrate"" Brexit. In dramatic scenes, the rebels shouted ""too late"" as Justice Minister Dominic Raab announced a concession shortly before voting began and Tory whips could be seen attempting to twist the arm of MPs thinking of voting against the government. Leading rebel Anna Soubry said she had found a woman MP ""upset and shaken"" on Tuesday evening after a whip tried to persuade her not to revolt. She told MPs on Thursday morning, that none of the rebels took any pleasure in defeating the government, adding that ""nobody drank champagne"". After the result was announced, one of the rebels, former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, tweeted: ""Tonight Parliament took control of the EU Withdrawal process."" This did not go down well with Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who called for the deselection of rebel Tories for ""undermining the PM"", and accused their leader, Dominic Grieve of ""treachery"". Rebel Tory Sarah Wollaston hit back on Twitter, saying: ""Get over yourself Nadine."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dominic Grieve tried to calm the mood, insisting he was merely trying to ensure Brexit was carried out in an ""orderly, sensible way"". This video can not be played There were cheers from the opposition benches as the result was announced BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It's certainly true that the Tory party is so divided over how we leave the EU that the Parliamentary process was always going to be very, very choppy. But another minister told me the defeat is ""bad for Brexit"" and was openly frustrated and worried about their colleagues' behaviour. Read the rest of Laura's blog Theresa May has travelled to Brussels to attend a dinner with the 27 other EU leaders, at which she will urge them to approve an agreement to move Brexit talks on to a second phase. They are all but certain to agree.  Talks could then start next month on the two-year transition period the UK wants to ease it out of the EU after it formally leaves in March 2019. But the EU wants more detail from the UK government before starting talks on a future relations - including trade - with the UK. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said he wants to complete the ""substantive portion"" of trade negotiations by March 2019, leaving open the possibility that the detail will be hammered out during the two-year transition period. This video can not be played Is it game over for Brexit? The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. MPs have been making hundreds of attempts to change its wording - but Wednesday's vote was the first time one has succeeded. Unless the government manages to overturn it further down the line, it means a new Act of Parliament will have to be passed before ministers can implement the withdrawal deal struck with Brussels. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer urged David Davis not to undermine Wednesday night's vote when the EU Withdrawal Bill reaches the next stage of its passage into law. Mr Davis said the vote would lead to a ""very compressed timetable"" for Brexit legislation and the government ""will have to think about how we respond to it"". There is also a row brewing over a vote next week on putting the precise date and time of Britain's exit from the EU - 11pm on 29 March 2019 - into law. Sir Keir described the vote as the next ""accident waiting to happen"", telling Mr Davis: ""Rather than repeat last night's debacle, will the government now commit to dropping that ill-conceived gimmick?"" Mr Davis told Sir Keir: ""Unlike him, I do not view votes of this House of Commons as accidents. They are decisions taken by the House, and that decision we respect, as we will the next one."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake also warned the prime minister she was heading for defeat if she did not drop the ""silly idea"" of enshrining the Brexit date and time in law, adding: ""Parliament has now shown it is not prepared to be bullied.""

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have attended a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, alongside members of the Royal Family and PM Theresa May. Bereaved families, survivors and rescue workers were joined by the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin said he hoped the tragedy would represent a ""time we learnt a new, better way"". The fire, on 14 June, claimed 71 lives. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened The commemoration, marking six months since the tragedy, also gave thanks to all those who assisted at the time of the fire and since - including the emergency services, recovery teams, the community, public support workers and volunteers. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and singer Adele were also among the more than 1,500 guests. The families of victims held photographs of their loved ones outside the cathedral Singer Adele attended the service, among more than 1,500 guests As the memorial began, a Green For Grenfell banner adorned with a heart was carried into the cathedral. Opening the service ahead of a minute's silence, Dean of St Paul's Dr David Ison said: ""We come together as different faiths as we remember those whose lives were lost."" ""Be united in the face of suffering and sorrow,"" he added. He said the UK grieved ""at the unspeakable tragedy, loss and hurt of that June day"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined the congregation By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News, at St Paul's Cathedral Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Families held photographs of victims of the fire, while voice recordings from people at the scene of the fire were played to the congregation. The Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra Schools Girls' Choir then sang out the words: ""Never lose hope."" Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington and organiser of the memorial, told the congregation: ""Today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to."" But he said he looked ahead to the New Year with ""hope"" of change from ""a city that didn't listen"". He said he hoped the word ""Grenfell"" would change from a symbol of ""sorrow, grief or injustice"" to ""a symbol of the time we learnt a new and better way - to listen and to love"". This video can not be played Ebony Steel band plays at Grenfell Memorial Choirs featuring local children performed during the service Before the service, Bishop Tomlin told the BBC: ""There was a very strong desire within the local community to have the service here, because faith is very important to a lot of people in the local area, and that can bring a real sense of strength to people."" One of those in attendance was Tiago Alves, who escaped the blaze with his family. He told BBC Breakfast his thoughts would be with bereaved families during the ""emotional"" memorial: ""Today is a day not about survivors; today is purely about the bereaved, their families and the loved ones they have lost."" He said the memorial would bring back a lot of awful memories for many people, but added: ""The reason we are doing this today is so that people never forget - we want people to remember."" Families stood on the steps of St Paul's after the service Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also attended the service A young girl lights a memorial candle among tributes laid for the victims Firefighters also paid respects Portobello Road Salvation Army Band and St Paul's Cathedral Choir performed during the service, and the Ebony Steel Band, frequent performers at the Notting Hill Carnival, played a verse of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. At the end of the service, bereaved families and survivors left the cathedral in silence, holding white roses. Clarrie Mendy, who lost her cousin Mary and Mary's daughter, Khadija Saye, in the fire, said the memorial was ""what the community needs, what the survivors need"". ""It is a very emotional day,"" she said. ""I just hope everybody will get something from it."" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, did not attend the service, after some families said they did not want the council there in an official capacity. However, a minute's silence was held outside the town hall in High Street Kensington as the memorial service began.

"The theatre said there was no intention to offend A mum has called for a ""lewd and offensive"" pantomime starring the Krankies, and former Doctor Who star John Barrowman, to be axed. Natalie Wood has made an official complaint about Dick Whittington at Manchester Opera House, saying it was ""too smutty"" for children. During the show, she said, Barrowman fondled co-star Janette Krankie's breasts, and also invited audience members to chant ""Alice loves Dick"". The venue said no offence was intended. Ms Wood, who attended the show with 10 family members - including six children aged three to 12 - told the BBC the show crossed the line from innuendo to ""raw"" vulgarity. Among the moments she took issue with was one where Wee Jimmy Krankie, played by Janette Krankie, poked her finger out of her trousers, emulating a penis. ""The main issue for us was the actual fondling of Jimmy Krankie's breasts and all the different cheap smutty jokes,"" she said. ""Normally we share the jokes from the show afterwards - these kind of jokes you would have to discourage the children from repeating and or acting out,"" she said. A local primary school teacher, who wants to remain anonymous, told the BBC she was also concerned about the play after seeing it with her class. ""I've seen a lot of pantos in my time but this was a step too far - all the staff agreed it was wholly inappropriate,"" she said. ""I felt really uncomfortable watching it with my class. ""They were all gasping and saying 'this is really rude'."" In her letter to the theatre, Ms Wood said her children had copied some of the jokes in the show. ""My children were repeating Alice loves Dick and sticking their fingers out of their trousers for a pretend penis throughout the evening. ""This is not acceptable and my children required far too much explaining about adult humour for a family show."" Panto veterans The Krankies have appeared alongside John Barrowman before Ms Wood went to the show with 10 family members Promoters Qdos Entertainment said: ""In-keeping with the tradition of pantomime, the script does make use of double entendre and part of that is a play on the names of the characters. ""None of the humour within the show is intended to cause offence of any kind."" Pantomime authority Roy Hudd, who has starred, written or directed in more than 50 festive productions, said there was a place for innuendo but they ""should be aimed at the children"". ""You cannot do rude jokes, my yardstick for writing gags is Laurel and Hardy or Dad's Army who made adults and children laugh,"" he said. 'Rude-dolph' leaves teachers red-faced Euston to host homeless on Christmas Day Man 'cements microwave to his head' The Krankies - husband and wife team Ian and Janette Tough - made their name as children's TV stars in the 80s on BBC TV's Crackerjack. Now semi-retired, the pair still appear in pantomimes, and have previously joined Barrowman, who came to fame in Doctor Who as Captain Jack Harkness and spin-off series Torchwood, on stage.

"Derek Mackay will be presenting his second draft budget as Scottish finance secretary Scotland's finance secretary is expected to confirm income tax rises for middle and higher earners when he unveils his draft budget for next year. Derek Mackay will say the increase in taxation is needed to raise more money to help protect public services. It will see many people in Scotland pay more income tax than those on the same salary elsewhere in the UK. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that 70% of taxpayers will pay no more than they do at present. The Scottish government was given powers over income tax rates and bands last year. Follow the budget on Holyrood Live from 14:00 Scotland's budget: what you need to know What are Scotland's income tax options? Mr Mackay is also expected to promise extra money for the NHS, childcare, education and the police in his budget statement in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday afternoon, and to give details of pay rises for public sector workers. And he will outline a package of plans designed to boost business, including more extensive broadband provision. But the most significant measure will be an increase in income tax, which comes after Ms Sturgeon suggested it was time for higher earners to pay a ""modest"" amount more. Derek Mackay and Nicola Sturgeon published a discussion paper on income tax last month BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor says he expects the 20p rate for lower earners to be frozen, but that there may be a new tax band created that would see those earning above about Â£30,000 pay more. The government has hinted that the top 45p rate of tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 will not be raised to 50p, as some opposition parties have called for, but may go up by a smaller amount. Business leaders have warned that Scotland cannot afford to be associated with higher taxation than other parts of the UK. But most people will pay no more tax than they do now - because the median salary in Scotland is Â£24,000. Nobody likes paying income tax. Nobody likes paying more income tax. Therefore, the draft budget is potentially a challenge in terms of public support. It is particularly a challenge given that the largest opposition party to the SNP are the Conservatives and the Conservatives will mount a very, very strong attack based upon any tax changes whatsoever. Mr Mackay will seek to rebut that by accusing the Conservatives of hypocrisy - by saying that they demand spending on pet projects while at the same time demanding tax restraint. Again, it will depend on what the public hears with regard to this - whether they listen to the government or whether they listen to the opposition, the Conservatives. MSPs will get their first chance to vote on the plans in the new year, with the minority SNP government needing support from at least one opposition party in order to pass the budget. Economic forecasts from the new Scottish Fiscal Commission will be published alongside the draft budget for the first time. Experts havewarned that the budget comes at a ""crucial"" timefor Scotland's economy, which they say is ""stuck in a cycle of weak growth"". Ms Sturgeon and Mr Mackay set outa series of possible income tax models last month, with many of them adding additional tax bands to those currently in place across the UK. The various models were estimated to raise up to an additional Â£290m - less than 1% of the Scottish government's total budget, which was about Â£33bn last year. Mr Mackay has conceded that the budget is ""set within a challenging context"", although he points the finger at ""continued austerity"" from Westminster. He has highlighted analysis showing Holyrood's resource grant falling by Â£200m in real terms for the coming year - although the Conservatives contend that the block grant from the UK government is increasing overall, due to extra funds for capital spending. The finance secretary said: ""The budget will bring forward key measures to protect public services like our NHS against the worst effects of UK budget cuts and continued Brexit uncertainty, and deliver a growth package to support the economy, unlock innovation and drive increased productivity. ""This will be a budget that is good for taxpayers, good for public services and good for business. It is a budget that will deliver for Scotland."" MSPs will get their first chance to vote on the plans in the new year Opposition parties will ultimately be key as the minority SNP government will need support from at least one in order to pass its budget, with the final vote due in February. The Conservatives have consistently argued against tax rises, and as such are highly unlikely to be persuaded to back Mr Mackay's budget. Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser used a Holyrood debate on Wednesdayto quote the SNP's manifesto back at them, saying the party had ""absolutely no mandate"" to increase the basic rate of tax. He said 65% of the electorate had backed parties which had pledged not to increase the basic rate of tax - the SNP and Conservatives - and that the budget was about ""whether politicians can be trusted to keep their promises"". Scottish Labour has called for ""radical decisions"" in the budget to tackle poverty, with new leader Richard Leonard saying Mr Mackay must not ""just tinker around the edges"". Labour has also repeatedly raised the issue of funding for local councils, which Mr Mackay has insisted will be ""fair"". The Scottish Greens - seen as the most likely party to back the SNP on the budget - have set out priorities including ""progressive changes to income tax"", a move to ""reverse the cuts"" to local budgets, an above-inflation rise in public sector pay and investment in low-carbon infrastructure. The Scottish Lib Dems, meanwhile, have called for ""specific, targeted investment"" with a particular focus on education, as well as action to tackle the ""woeful gap in the numbers of new mental health staff being trained"".

"Derek Mackay arrived in the Holyrood chamber alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon ahead of his budget speech The Scottish government has announced income tax changes that will see higher earners pay more than elsewhere in the UK - and lower earners pay less. The country's finance secretary, Derek Mackay, announced a new tax band of 21p for those earning more than Â£24,000. The higher rate of tax will be increased from 40p to 41p and the top rate from 45p to 46p. But a starter rate of 19p in the pound will also be introduced, Mr Mackay confirmed in his draft budget. Mr Mackay said the move to a five-band income tax system will mean no one earning less than Â£33,000 in Scotland will pay more tax than they do now. Scots budget: what does it mean for me? Mischievous Mackay's taxing budget Report: How was the budget unveiled? Scottish draft budget: At a glance Scottish economy facing 'subdued' growth And he told the Scottish Parliament that those earning above that figure would only pay a ""proportionate amount more"" than they currently do. His figures showed that 55% of Scottish taxpayers will pay less compared to south of the border under the new system - with 45% of people paying more. Someone in Scotland earning Â£150,000 will pay Â£1,774 more than if they lived elsewhere in the UK, with someone earning Â£40,000 paying Â£140 more. Accountancy body ICAS calculated that, of the 2.2 million basic rate taxpayers in Scotland, 1.4 million will be marginally better off than those in the rest of the UK whereas the remaining 800,000 will have a slightly increased tax bill. All 346,000 higher and 20,000 additional rate taxpayers will pay more. Mr Mackay also outlined how lifting the public-sector pay cap would allow for a 3% pay rise for public sector workers earning less than Â£30,000, and a 2% rise for those earning more than that - with a cap of Â£1,600 for those earning Â£80,000 or more. And he pledged a further Â£600m to provide superfast broadband to all premises in Scotland by 2021. The Scottish government was given powers over income tax rates and bands last year, with the new rates being paid by anyone who lives in Scotland. Mr Mackay had faced warnings from business leaders and the Scottish Conservatives ahead of his budget statement that Scotland could not afford to be associated with higher taxation than the rest of the UK. The finance secretary insisted the changes - which he said would raise an additional Â£164m - were necessary to ""mitigate UK budget cuts, protect our NHS and other public services, support our economy and tackle inequality in our society."" He said the tax reforms would make ""Scotland's income tax system even fairer and more progressive"". And he said a bigger increase in the top rate of tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 - which some opposition parties had called for - would actually reduce revenue as high earners would find ways to avoid paying it. Among the other measures in the budget were: Full relief from LBTT - the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty - on up to Â£175,000 for first time home buyers Funding to reduce the attainment gap in Scottish schools increased from Â£170m to Â£179m An increase in health funding of more than Â£400m - double the amount needed for NHS spending to keep pace with inflation Â£243m towards the expansion of free nursery education and childcare Local government resource budget will be protected in cash terms with the capital budget increased in real terms ""resulting in a total increase in local authority core funding of Â£94m"" Private schools will no longer be eligible for charitable relief from business rates, but universities and council arm's length bodies will be. Income tax. Public spending. Employment. Pay. The NHS. Schools. Indisputably, serious stuff. But there was more than a touch of mischief about Derek Mackay's demeanour as he got to the tax bits of his budget. Normally, he exudes gravitas, solemnity even. But he could not help playing to the gallery with a declaratory grin when he insisted that, for most people, Scotland would now be the lowest taxed part of the UK. Said gallery - led enthusiastically by Mr Mackay's predecessor, John Swinney - applauded loudly. The reason for this glee? Politically, the claim is a direct and precise retort to Conservative attacks that Scotland is taxed more highly. But, of course, when the dust dies down, the Tories will return to that attack. Read more from Brian Mr Mackay's budget statement was accompanied by the first economic estimates from the newScottish Fiscal Commission, which said the country is facing ""subdued"" growthover the next five years. The independent body predicted the Scottish economy will grow at less than 1% per year until 2022 - lower than that predicted by other economists. Its five-year forecast suggests GDP growth will be 0.7% in both 2017 and 2018, rising to 1.1% in 2022. It said the outlook was ""driven by slow productivity growth and exacerbated by demographic challenges"". Scottish Conservativefinance spokesman Murdo Fraser branded the creation of a new basic rate the ""Nat tax"". He accused the SNP of breaking a 2016 manifesto promise pledging not to increase the basic rate of income tax for those on low or middle incomes, and claimed the real reason was that Scottish economic growth is lagging behind the UK. Scottish Labourleader Richard Leonard said the Scottish government's tax and spending plans had ""tinkered round the edges"" instead of implementing radical change and delivering a genuine alternative to ""Tory austerity"". Scottish Greensco-convener Patrick Harvie said he was ""delighted that the argument for a more progressive tax structure appears to have won the day"", but said Mr Mackay should have gone further. AndScottish Liberal Democratleader Willie Rennie said the budget was a ""missed opportunity"" and ""does not do enough to meet the long term needs in the economy"". Elsewhere, theFederation of Small Businessessaid a majority of its members were against income tax rises, and that the Scottish government was steering the country into ""uncharted economic waters"". TheScottish Chambers of Commercewelcomed much of the budget as being positive for business, but repeated its concerns about ""Scotland's new status as the highest-taxed part of the UK."" And local government bodyCoslasaid councils would continue to face ""really difficult times"" in the future, despite the ""more measured approach"" by the Scottish government.

"This video can not be played May: We've won 35 out of 36 votes Theresa May has said the UK is ""on course to deliver on Brexit"" as she arrived in Brussels, the day after her first Commons defeat as prime minister. She said she was ""disappointed"" at the vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, but the legislation was making ""good progress"". MPs backed an amendment giving them a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. EU leaders are expected to formally agree to start the next phase of negotiations on Friday. The European Commission has said ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the first phase to move onto discussing the framework of a future relationship between the EU and UK - on issues such as security and trade. Kamal Ahmed: Brexit transition deal is 'urgent', say MPs Can Leavers and Remainers call Christmas truce? What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do Mrs May told fellow EU leaders at dinner on Thursday that she wanted to get agreement on the ""implementation period"" as a priority but wanted to talk about trade ""as soon as possible"". She said was personally committed to delivering a ""smooth Brexit"" and she wanted to approach the next phase of talks ""with ambition and creativity"". Speaking to reporters earlier, she said: ""I'm disappointed with the amendment but actually the EU Withdrawal Bill is making good progress through the House of Commons and we are on course to deliver Brexit."" UK to stay in Erasmus scheme until at least 2020 MEPs vote on Brexit: What we learned Asked whether she felt she would have to compromise more to win over rebels from her own party, she told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""We've actually had 36 votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill, and we've won 35 of those votes with an average majority of 22."" Mrs May lost by just four votes, as MPs backed an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 to 305. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described it as a ""humiliating loss of authority"" for the PM and warned that his party would vote against another bit of the bill - the plan to put a fixed Brexit date into law. He said setting an ""arbitrary date"" was not sensible and there ""should be some flexibility"". This video can not be played Brexit is unstoppable and MPs will not block it, says Boris Johnson It will not derail Brexit but MPs who voted against the government hope it will give them a bigger say in the final deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that as other EU leaders also run minority or coalition governments they would see the vote defeat as a small-scale domestic political issue. The government had promised a ""meaningful vote"" for MPs on the final Brexit deal, but this defeat means that promise now has legal force and must happen before any UK-EU deal is implemented in the UK. Ministers had wanted to be able to start implementing any deal as soon as it was agreed - in case, for instance, it was only agreed at the last minute. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it would embolden the opposition and showed there was a majority in Parliament against a ""hard Brexit"". Cabinet Minister Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the vote was ""not going to stop Brexit"". Labour joined forces with the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party in a cross-party alliance. If all Conservative and DUP MPs had voted against the amendment the government would have won. But 11 Conservatives resisted the arm-twisting by their party managers to vote with the opposition. The Tory rebels were Dominic Grieve, Heidi Allen, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Stephen Hammond, Sir Oliver Heald, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. Another Conservative MP, John Stevenson, officially abstained by voting for and against the amendment. Two Eurosceptic Labour MPs - Frank Field and Kate Hoey - voted with the Conservatives and the DUP. This video can not be played ""I'm in parliament to do my duty by my constituents and by my country"" said Tory rebel Dominic Grieve Emotions ran high before, during and after Wednesday's Commons debate, with Eurosceptic Conservatives accusing the rebels of trying to ""frustrate"" Brexit. In dramatic scenes, the rebels shouted ""too late"" as Justice Minister Dominic Raab announced a concession shortly before voting began and Tory whips could be seen attempting to twist the arm of MPs thinking of voting against the government. Leading rebel Anna Soubry said she had found a woman MP ""upset and shaken"" on Tuesday evening after a whip tried to persuade her not to revolt. She told MPs on Thursday morning, that none of the rebels took any pleasure in defeating the government, adding that ""nobody drank champagne"". After the result was announced, one of the rebels, former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, tweeted: ""Tonight Parliament took control of the EU Withdrawal process."" This did not go down well with Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who called for the deselection of rebel Tories for ""undermining the PM"", and accused their leader, Dominic Grieve of ""treachery"". Rebel Tory Sarah Wollaston hit back on Twitter, saying: ""Get over yourself Nadine."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dominic Grieve tried to calm the mood, insisting he was merely trying to ensure Brexit was carried out in an ""orderly, sensible way"". This video can not be played There were cheers from the opposition benches as the result was announced BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It's certainly true that the Tory party is so divided over how we leave the EU that the Parliamentary process was always going to be very, very choppy. But another minister told me the defeat is ""bad for Brexit"" and was openly frustrated and worried about their colleagues' behaviour. Read the rest of Laura's blog Theresa May has travelled to Brussels to attend a dinner with the 27 other EU leaders, at which she will urge them to approve an agreement to move Brexit talks on to a second phase. They are all but certain to agree.  Talks could then start next month on the two-year transition period the UK wants to ease it out of the EU after it formally leaves in March 2019. But the EU wants more detail from the UK government before starting talks on a future relations - including trade - with the UK. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said he wants to complete the ""substantive portion"" of trade negotiations by March 2019, leaving open the possibility that the detail will be hammered out during the two-year transition period. This video can not be played Is it game over for Brexit? The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. MPs have been making hundreds of attempts to change its wording - but Wednesday's vote was the first time one has succeeded. Unless the government manages to overturn it further down the line, it means a new Act of Parliament will have to be passed before ministers can implement the withdrawal deal struck with Brussels. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer urged David Davis not to undermine Wednesday night's vote when the EU Withdrawal Bill reaches the next stage of its passage into law. Mr Davis said the vote would lead to a ""very compressed timetable"" for Brexit legislation and the government ""will have to think about how we respond to it"". There is also a row brewing over a vote next week on putting the precise date and time of Britain's exit from the EU - 11pm on 29 March 2019 - into law. Sir Keir described the vote as the next ""accident waiting to happen"", telling Mr Davis: ""Rather than repeat last night's debacle, will the government now commit to dropping that ill-conceived gimmick?"" Mr Davis told Sir Keir: ""Unlike him, I do not view votes of this House of Commons as accidents. They are decisions taken by the House, and that decision we respect, as we will the next one."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake also warned the prime minister she was heading for defeat if she did not drop the ""silly idea"" of enshrining the Brexit date and time in law, adding: ""Parliament has now shown it is not prepared to be bullied.""

"Black Friday helped to propel retail sales 1.6% higher in November from a year earlier, official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid that retailers had reported a particular uplift in sales of electrical household appliances. ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said underlying growth remained ""reasonably strong"". However, analysts said that Black Friday had distorted sales and retailers faced challenging conditions. The ONS said that the quantity of food bought in November fell by 0.1% compared to the same month last year. However, the amount of money spent jumped by 3.5%, reflecting a rise in food prices that has contributed to the increase in inflation, which is now at a near six-year high of 3.1%. Pay squeeze continues for UK households Will you feel the pinch this Christmas? UK inflation rate at near six-year high In non-food sales, clothing and footwear rebounded from a slump in October to rise 2.3% in November from a year earlier. Department stores, however, saw their sales fall by 0.9% which the ONS said ""continues a recent pattern of slowdown in this sector"". Alex Marsh, managing director of Close Brothers Retail Finance, said: ""The final run up to Christmas may prove more difficult than usual for retailers as they battle low consumer confidence amid increasing inflation and a squeeze on wages."" Black Friday is an import from the US, where it takes place on the day after Thanksgiving and is regarded as the start of the Christmas shopping period. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The surge in retail sales in November does not signal broader consumer strength."" Mr Tombs said Black Friday meant the strength in November retail sales ""merely reflected people bringing forward purchases that they otherwise would have made in December or January to November, due to the discounts available"". Month-on-month, sales rose by 1.1% in November from October, which was ahead of analysts' forecasts for 0.4% growth. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said that ""on the surface"" the data was ""promising"". But he said: ""The next 10 days of pre-Christmas sales will be crucial for retailers. Trading is likely to peak on Friday 22 December, particularly for purchases of food and drink as consumers prepare for festive hosting. ""However, profitability is another matter and margins are under intense pressure.""

"This video can not be played Father-of-two Jake Omer was born with haemophilia A British doctors say they have achieved ""mind-blowing"" results in an attempt to rid people of haemophilia A. Patients are born with a genetic defect that means they do not produce a protein needed to stop bleeding. Thirteen patients given the gene therapy at Barts Health NHS Trust are now off treatment with 11 producing near-normal levels of the protein. Jake Omer, 29 from Billericay, Essex, was on the trial and says he feels like he has a new body. Like 2,000 other people in the UK, his body could not make clotting factor VIII. A minor injury used to cause severe bleeding. He remembers losing two front teeth as a child and bleeding for days afterwards. Even the impact of walking would lead to bleeding in his joints and eventually cause arthritis. Jake has needed at least three injections of factor VIII a week for most of his life. But in February 2016, he had a single infusion of gene therapy. Jake Omer: 'Like a new body' Jake told the BBC: ""I feel like a new person now - I feel like a well-oiled robot. ""I feel I can do a lot more. I feel my body allows me to do more. ""I don't think I would have been able to walk 500m without my joints flaring up, whereas now I think sort of two, three, four-mile walk - I could quite easily achieve that."" The first time he knew it had worked was four months after the therapy when he dropped a gym weight and bashed his elbow. He started to panic, but after icing the injury that evening, everything was normal the next day. The therapy is a genetically engineered virus. It contains the instructions for factor VIII that Jake was born without. The virus is used like a postman to deliver the genetic instructions to the liver, which then starts producing factor VIII. In the first trials, low doses of gene therapy had no effect. Of the 13 patients given higher doses, all are off their haemophilia medication a year on and 11 are producing near-normal levels of factor VIII. Prof John Pasi, who led the trials at Barts and Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This is huge. ""It's ground-breaking because the option to think about normalising levels in patients with severe haemophilia is absolutely mind-blowing. ""To offer people the potential of a normal life when they've had to inject themselves with factor VIII every other day to prevent bleeding is transformational."" An analysis of the first nine patients on the trial waspublished in the New England Journal of Medicine,external. Larger trials are now imminent to see if the therapy can truly transform the lives of patients. It is also uncertain how long the gene therapy will be effective. Liz Carroll, the chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, said: ""Gene therapy is a potentially game-changing treatment. ""Despite world-leading treatment standards in the UK many still suffer painful bleeds leading to chronic joint damage."" However, she warned there was a wide variation in who responded to therapy, which still needed to be explained. Gene therapies are likely to be spectacularly expensive. However, the current cost of regular factor VIII injections is about Â£100,000 a patient per year for life. Jake says the therapy should help him live a full life with his family: ""It's going to allow me as my boys grow up to be more active with them, to kick footballs about, to climb trees, to hopefully run around the park with them, not be someone who has to worry.""

"Hotel living has been a struggle, says Mohammed Rasoul It is only when you walk through the door of the hotel room that you even begin to understand what life has been like for so many of the survivors, six months on from the Grenfell fire. Stacked along a short corridor, past the wardrobe and door to the bathroom, they've piled up cases and boxes. Clothes on top. It's tidy, but a squeeze. This is the room that grandpa sleeps in. Then through the door into the adjoining room. You can't open it fully because of the single camp bed on the other side. Push through, however, and you're in another room, the same size. The single bed is for dad - Mohammed. A double is shared by mum, son and daughter. They are five and two years old respectively, and there's little space in which to play. They say there's nowhere for Mohammed's wife Munira to cook, so most of the time they get take-away meals. The plastic boxes are stacked up neatly on the side, ready to be washed. For the last six months this is how the Rasoul family has lived. ""It's a struggle,"" says the father, Mohammed Rasoul. ""At first, immediately after the fire you think, 'Oh, OK, hotels, we'll be comfortable for a while.' But the novelty soon wears off when you realise it's the place you're going to be living in. ""It comes to the point where you feel like a prisoner living in here."" Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Residents of the 21st floor Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Mohammed's father had lived in the Grenfell tower for 37 years. Now 86, he has vascular dementia, and he's confused. They have been offered a new home, but not close to where they used to live. ""All we want is to be rehoused in the same area. We want to be there back in the community, with our friends, my son's school,"" he says. Take the underground from the stop close to Mohammed's hotel, change at Notting Hill, and in half an hour you can be at another hotel, which is currently home to Rashida Ali and her 10-year-old daughter Hayam. The council needs to find homes for 208 Grenfell families ""I have lots of nightmares. Sometimes I cry in the middle of the night and wake my mum and she calms me down and she says 'Don't worry, at least we're safe.' ""I don't feel safe when I'm by myself or like in a closed room and there's no escape next to me. I just feel I can't breathe."" Hayam and her mother are about to move into temporary accommodation. Rashida didn't want that initially, because she preferred not to have to uproot them twice. But she's decided to move, for her daughter's benefit. ""She needs to pack her stuff everyday, open suitcase, close suitcase, tidy up because this is not our home. We live in a hotel but it feels like we are homeless."" Like many she says she doesn't trust the council to deliver on their promise to move people into permanent homes when a suitable one comes up. ""The system keeps changing,"" she says. ""I'm worried if I sign this (temporary accommodation contract) in a few months I'm not going to be allowed to move out."" Most of those made homeless by the fire are still in hotels - 28 of them are families with children. The council wants to move people out into temporary flats. The Alves family has taken up the offer. Miguel Alves says it allows them ""to have a family life, to have meals together."" Miguel Alves: ""Nobody answers my emails."" Miguel was one of the few leaseholders in the Grenfell Tower - he bought his flat in 2001 - and had 15 years of his mortgage left to pay. That adds another layer of complication. Despite all he's gone through, he says he's having to fight to get the council to accept his demand that the new home he eventually moves into will be the same size with the same number of bedrooms as his Grenfell flat. ""I asked for a meeting, and they take one week, nobody answers my emails."" This lack of communication isn't a one off. At a recent council meeting one woman - Lidia, whose elderly mother lived on the top floor and who survived because she was away that night - said she had had 11 different housing officers assigned to her in the last six months. Lidia's hands and legs were shaking uncontrollably with stress as she spoke. Many say the delays and uncertainty are taking a mental toll. Any local authority would be stretched by the task that faces Kensington and Chelsea Council. It needs to find homes for 208 households. It has set aside Â£235m to do that. It takes time to buy properties. Lawyers representing the former residents are striving to ensure that the new tenancy agreements and leaseholds match exactly the terms and conditions people had in Grenfell. The council's director of housing, Maxine Holdsworth, says she ""gets a huge amount of positive feedback about our frontline housing officers and how supportive they've been"". What then about the charges that officers change, that communications are difficult? ""Every single household has their own dedicated housing officer,"" she replies.  ""I would be confident that if someone rang up today their call would be answered they would get to speak to their housing officer."" The deputy leader of the council admitted last week that he felt embarrassed about the speed of the rehousing process. Back down the Tube line, in the Rasoul family's hotel room they are keeping their spirits up, somehow. ""I'm OK,"" says Mohammed. ""I have my moments, but there's so much that needs to be dealt with, so many things going on. ""It's not just our housing issues, it's our personal issues, living here. No personal space, the kids have to go to sleep at certain times, lights out for the children. But we stay positive."" And when he thinks about the home that he has lost? ""All my childhood memories, moments of happiness, laughter, food being enjoyed, my children being born there. I dare not delve into it too much, I know that will just break me.""

"A large proportion of the people living in buildings close to Grenfell Tower show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), six months after the tragedy, which killed 71 people, the NHS says. Caused by very stressful or distressing events, PTSD can lead to nightmares and flashbacks, with sufferers often feeling isolated, irritable and guilty. So far, about 1,000 people have been screened for symptoms, with the number of PTSD sufferers at the highest end of a range of expectations after comparing it to other recent tragedies such as terror attacks. Overall, the NHS believes that as many as 11,000 people - including survivors, witnesses and the bereaved - could be suffering from the psychological impact of the fire, which took many hours to be brought under control. It anticipates that thousands of these people will need therapy. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Who were the Grenfell victims? Grenfell fire: Police say 255 people survived the blaze A special team of more than 50 therapists and 20 outreach workers has been established, called the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, in what the NHS says is its largest ever mental health response to a traumatic event. More than 500 people have already attended sessions with NHS therapists to treat symptoms of anxiety and PTSD. So far, 150 children have completed or are having continuing therapy. ""I'm not coping,"" one woman told an outreach worker. She lives in a flat in what is known as the walkways - right next to the burnt-out shell of Grenfell Tower, a potent and ever-present symbol of the fire. Her eyes filling with tears, she said she was having flashbacks and was struggling to sleep but had begun to get therapy, which was helping. ""I thought I would cope, but I can't because the tower is still there. It's a big reminder, which you can't forget."" Inside the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower Messages from the tower The outreach work involves teams of NHS staff going door to door, working outwards from Grenfell Tower. They ask each person how they are feeling and look for signs of trauma. If appropriate, they complete an on-the-spot PTSD questionnaire. They call it ""street-screening"", and so far staff have screened about 1,000 people living close to the tower. The rates of PTSD picked up by the screening range from 75% of those screened in the buildings nearest the tower to 40% in buildings a little further away. But rates vary considerably from building to building. The plan is to continue street-screening outwards from the tower until the PTSD rate drops. But there are dozens of high-rise buildings, some miles away from Grenfell Tower, that had a clear line of sight to the burning building, and whose residents may also have been affected. The teams have also screened survivors from Grenfell Tower, most of whom are still living in hotels. I joined two outreach workers as they spoke to one survivor. ""Feeling down, depressed, or helpless?"" ""I'm feeling down, not depressed, but down."" ""Is that every day, every other day, or for several days?"" ""It's every day, yes."" ""Feeling irritable, or angry?"" ""Yes."" ""Difficulty concentrating?"" ""Yes."" The man lived on the 13th floor, with his wife, son and daughter. The whole family survived. The other family members are getting counselling, but he felt he didn't need help. Six months on, he's now changed his mind. The family owned a leasehold flat in the tower, and he says the continuing process of seeking compensation from Kensington and Chelsea Council has made him feel increasingly anxious. ""I tried to prove to myself that I can manage without [counselling], but I think it's the right time now to ask for help. ""I've felt a bit sad, and I don't want to give up just because I'm not well. I have the feeling it's better to give up - that's the reason I'm going to accept some help."" You can listen to Andrew Bomford's reports forWorld at Oneprogramme on the BBC Radio 4 websitehereandhere. Kensington and Chelsea Council says it is doing all it can to ensure survivors and local residents have access to the mental health support they need. The outreach team is dealing with numerous logistical challenges, including incomplete lists of survivors living in temporary accommodation and frequently changing council key-workers who are meant to be the main point of contact with survivors. Grenfell Tower: 131 families are in hotels, MPs hear The team has even had to provide therapy to key-workers who have themselves become traumatised by their work. The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service is the first response of its kind It's all been an unusual challenge for the NHS. ""I think the outreach model is completely unique,"" said Emma Kennedy, from the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service. ""Seeking out people, bringing them in, and walking through the journey of therapy with them, hasn't been tried in any other service in terms of disaster response."" People who score highly enough under the street-screening tool for PTSD or anxiety are referred to therapists for counselling, often a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or another talking therapy. Therapist Claire Gibson is treating a number of survivors. She said many had not been able to process their memories of what had happened on the night of the fire, because of the extreme stress they had been under as they had tried to escape the burning building. ""The memory evolves like a multi-sensory video which can be re-triggered at any time."" ""People might start to get clips of what they saw, what they heard - even smelt, tasted, felt - on that night coming back to them in the months and years afterwards, and that can be very distressing."" One Grenfell resident now experiences those feelings whenever he goes downstairs. ""They actually smell smoke, and have the same fear they felt that night."" Treating PTSD of this type involves a process known as reliving - having the patient talk through these experiences in minute detail in order to update the memory in a safe environment. I joined one patient, who asked to remain anonymous, during a CBT session. He witnessed the fire and lost three close family members in it. ""When doing therapy, you're basically writing down what you've got in your head, but you're also re-writing what you've got in your head in a way that you're able to deal with,"" he said. ""It most definitely put things into perspective for me, in terms of filtering the important thoughts and using them to move forward with my life."" Many people living in the area say the constant physical presence of the gutted shell of the tower itself triggers flashbacks. Alastair Bailey, a consultant clinical psychologist who runs the adult part of the service, says it's a very difficult reminder for people. ""There's been a lot of support in the local community, and that's a really helpful thing. ""But there's another thing which is not so helpful in terms of developing trauma, and that's called rumination, which is going over what's happened to you again and again. Both things have occurred."" The service expects to continue offering therapy for years to come, as PTSD can sometimes take years to develop. About Â£7m has been budgeted for the NHS health response this year, and up to Â£10m will be needed next year. The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service is a free and confidential NHS service for children and adults  affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. You can access the service at The Curve, 4 Bard Road, W10 6TP between 10:00 and 20:00 every day.

"Pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in England are dropping further behind their classmates in national primary school tests, statistics show. The gap between SEN pupils and their peers has risen from 48 percentage points in 2016 to 52 this year. The figures are revealed in school league tables, published by the Department for Education (DfE), showing the results of about 16,000 primaries. Head teachers say special-needs education funding is in crisis. The government statistics show 18% of children with SEN reached the expected level in reading, writing and mathematics, compared with 70% of their peers without special needs. Although SEN pupils' results edged upwards on last year, when 14% made the grade, their non-SEN peers boosted their results more dramatically from 62% to 70%. Teachers have been warning that pupils with special needs, such as mild autism or dyslexia, would struggle in the tougher tests introduced last year. Primary school league tables explained A National Association of Head Teachers' spokesman said it was ""one of those situations where money is the solution and schools need the government's help"". The tables also showed disadvantaged pupils still perform far worse than all other pupils in England, with around half passing the tests, compared to nearly two-thirds of non-disadvantaged. The gap between the two groups of pupils is now as wide as it was in 2012 at about 20 percentage points. However, there does appear to be a small catch-up (one percentage point) in poorer pupils' attainment on 2016 when the tougher tests were introduced and results for all pupils dipped significantly. NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ""This data is a useful indication of school performance but it is not the whole story. One thing it does do, though, is confirm what NAHT has been saying for a long time about social mobility. ""Raising the Key Stage 2 standard (Sats test) was not going to help close the gap. The issues that underpin inequality reach far beyond the school gates and exist throughout the communities that schools serve."" But Schools Minister Nick Gibb hailed the achievements of pupils and teachers, saying they had responded well to the more rigorous curriculum. This set of pupils was the first to benefit from the government's new approach to phonics, he said. ""Pupils are now leaving primary school better prepared for the rigours of secondary school and for future success in their education,"" Mr Gibb added. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Overall, pupils have scored better in their Sats results than last year, which was the first year of the new tests. The DfE said this was partly because of ""increased familiarity"" with the new tests. There was a nine percentage point increase in the proportion of black pupils passing the tests, to 60% - just one percentage point behind the national average and white pupils. The top five local authorities were all London boroughs, with Richmond upon Thames at the top, Kensington and Chelsea coming second and Bromley third. The inner city boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham and Hackney have claimed the fourth and fifth spots. In 1999, Hackney, which had been one of the worst performing boroughs, became the first local education authority to be taken out of council control. In this year's tests across England, local authority schools slightly outperformed academies and free schools, with 62% of their schools reaching the expected standard compared with 61% of academies and free schools. In all, 511 schools - 4% of the total - have fallen beneath the government's expectations or ""floor standard"", where fewer than 65% of pupils met the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics and the school did not achieve sufficient progress scores in all three subjects. This is an improvement on last year, where 665 - 5% - primaries were found wanting. What's in the school league tables?

"The Bank of England says confidence among households and businesses is likely to be supported by last week's progress in Brexit talks. Last week the European Union agreedthat sufficient progress had been made in Brexit negotiations to allow progress to the next stage and to put in place a transition period from 2019. The Bank said that would reduce the likelihood of a ""disorderly"" Brexit. Bank policy makers have also agreed to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%. In minutes from the latest meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Bank said that since its previous meeting in early November there had been two ""significant events"":  the Autumn Budget and progress in Brexit talks. Last week's agreement between the UK and the European Union would ""reduce the likelihood of a disorderly exit, and was likely to support household and corporate confidence,"" the MPC said. However, it said the reaction of households, businesses and markets to developments on Brexit talks ""remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook"". Since their last meeting, members of the MPC have also assessed the potential impact of the November's Autumn Budget. They believe it will lift the level of GDP by 0.3% by 2020, as Chancellor Philip Hammond eased up on austerity measures. US Federal reserve raises interest rates Eurozone interest rates kept on hold Black Friday lifts UK retail sales Pay squeeze continues for UK households On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that inflation as measured by the Consumer Prices Index hit 3.1% in November, the highest rate in nearly six years. That rise above 3% means Bank of England governor Mark Carney has to write to the government and explain why inflation is so far above the target of 2%. That letter will be revealed along with the Bank's next Quarterly Inflation report, next February. The MPC today repeated its view that inflation was ""likely to be close to its peak"". The Bank argues that the main reason behind rising inflation has been the decline in value of the pound, which fell sharply in June 2016 when the UK voted to leave the European Union. Although the pound has recovered in recent months, it is still about 10% lower against the dollar and the euro, which makes imported goods, food and raw materials more expensive. Last month the MPC decided to raise interest rates for the first time in 10 years. It attributed the 0.25% rise to record-low unemployment, rising inflation and stronger global growth. It also indicated there would be two more rises over the next three years. In the minutes from its latest meeting the Bank said ""modest"" increases in interest rates would be needed over the next few years, but repeated previous promises that those rises would be ""gradual and to a limited extent"". Higher interest rates have a big impact on the economy. Of the 8.1 million households with a mortgage, 3.7 million - or 46% - are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate - which generally move in line with the official bank rate. A move higher can also give savers a lift as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest.

"A Home Office policy of removing EU citizens found sleeping rough on UK streets is unlawful and must stop, the High Court has ruled. A judge said the measure, introduced last year, was discriminatory and broke freedom of movement rules. Campaigners brought the case on behalf of three men facing removal. The government said it was disappointed by the ruling - which applies to people from the EU and European Economic Area - but would not be appealing. The Public Interest Law Unit (PILU) at Lambeth Law Centre, which took out the judicial review, said the decision would affect hundreds of people. It said the Home Office had been carrying out ""regular raids"" on locations where officials believed they would find European nationals who could be deported. In herruling,external, the judge, Mrs Justice Lang, also said the Home Office was wrong to have used the raids as a chance to verify whether the rough sleepers were abusing their right to reside in another European nation. PILU said the High Court had shown itself willing to protect the rights of a vulnerable group, adding: ""Homelessness cannot humanely be dealt with by detaining or forcibly removing homeless people."" Three men facing removal orders from the Home Office were selected as ""test cases"" for the hearing: Latvian Gunars Gureckis, who had been in the UK since 2009, and had a long history of sleeping rough interspersed with periods where he did have accommodation Polish citizen Mariusz Cielecki, who arrived in the UK in 2015 and unsuccessfully tried to appeal against his order, claiming he was looking for work Polish citizen Mariusz Perlinski, who was in poor health and alcohol dependent and had lived in the UK since 2011. He became homeless in November 2016 and was held in an immigration centre. The judge said the order should be dropped against Mr Gureckis, while Mr Cielecki is now expected to appeal against his. The order against Mr Perlinski was withdrawn in November after he began living with a relative. She said ""rough sleeping, even accompanied by low level offending such as begging, drinking in a public place and other street nuisances, would not be grounds for removal"" and the Home Office's ""less favourable"" treatment of rough sleepers from outside the UK could not be justified. The Home Office said the EU'sFree Movement Directive,externalallowed member states to impose restrictions on people in certain situations, including where there were concerns about security, public health, or fraud. Its lawyers had argued the operations to remove the rough sleepers were a ""sensible and lawful approach"". A spokesman said: ""We will consider carefully what steps are necessary to ensure we reflect the judgment in future enforcement."" He added that most of the people removed under the measure had not exercised their rights to residency in the UK when required and were therefore unlawfully in the country. Speaking after the ruling, Matthew Downie from the homeless charity Crisis, who gave evidence against the Home Office, said the policy had been ""brutal and indiscriminate"". He said in many cases people had been taken away from help they were getting to resolve their homelessness.

"Jayda Fransen and Paul Golding outside the courtroom in Belfast on Thursday The deputy leader of far-right group Britain First has been re-arrested after appearing in a Belfast court over a speech she gave in the city. Jayda Fransen, 31, of Anerley, south-east London, was in court over two charges relating to behaviour intended to or likely to stir up hatred. Her lawyer told the court that she intended to plead not guilty. Britain First leader Paul Golding, 35, was also arrested outside the courtroom before the hearing. Mr Golding was accompanying Ms Fransen to the hearing. The police confirmed they have arrested a 35-year-old man as part of their investigation into the ""Northern Ireland Against Terrorism"" rally in August. It is believed Ms Fransen has been re-arrested over social media posts she made from a peace wall in Belfast on Wednesday. Peace walls are used to separate Catholic and Protestant residents in areas where tension between the two communities can run high. Chris Page, BBC News Ireland correspondent The Britain First leader Paul Golding was alongside his deputy as she arrived at court. But instead of accompanying her into the courtroom, Mr Golding was detained by detectives and taken to a nearby police station. Britain First supporters holding a demonstration outside the court building Ms Fransen spoke only once in the dock  - to confirm she understood the charges against her. A small group of supporters were in Belfast Magistrates Court - and after Ms Fransen was re-arrested, they staged a short but angry demonstration, holding placards and chanting in front of the media gathered outside the building. The police confirmed that a 31-year-old woman had been arrested as part of an investigation into ""an incident at a peace wall"". Ms Fransen, whose anti-Islamic social media posts were retweeted by US President Donald Trump in November, appeared in the dock at Belfast Magistrate's Court on Thursday. The court ordered her not to go within 500m of any demonstration or parade in Northern Ireland as part of her release on bail. A detective told the court that a ""Free Speech for Jayda"" rally was planned to take place last weekend and was postponed because of snow. ""We have concerns there would be further offences and also concerns about public order,"" the detective said. Prosecutors has also sought curbs on Ms Fransen's social media use but the judge expressed doubts over whether the court's jurisdiction extended that far. Ms Fransen is due to return to court on 9 January.

"Derek Mackay will be presenting his second draft budget as Scottish finance secretary Scotland's finance secretary is expected to confirm income tax rises for middle and higher earners when he unveils his draft budget for next year. Derek Mackay will say the increase in taxation is needed to raise more money to help protect public services. It will see many people in Scotland pay more income tax than those on the same salary elsewhere in the UK. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that 70% of taxpayers will pay no more than they do at present. The Scottish government was given powers over income tax rates and bands last year. Follow the budget on Holyrood Live from 14:00 Scotland's budget: what you need to know What are Scotland's income tax options? Mr Mackay is also expected to promise extra money for the NHS, childcare, education and the police in his budget statement in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday afternoon, and to give details of pay rises for public sector workers. And he will outline a package of plans designed to boost business, including more extensive broadband provision. But the most significant measure will be an increase in income tax, which comes after Ms Sturgeon suggested it was time for higher earners to pay a ""modest"" amount more. Derek Mackay and Nicola Sturgeon published a discussion paper on income tax last month BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor says he expects the 20p rate for lower earners to be frozen, but that there may be a new tax band created that would see those earning above about Â£30,000 pay more. The government has hinted that the top 45p rate of tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 will not be raised to 50p, as some opposition parties have called for, but may go up by a smaller amount. Business leaders have warned that Scotland cannot afford to be associated with higher taxation than other parts of the UK. But most people will pay no more tax than they do now - because the median salary in Scotland is Â£24,000. Nobody likes paying income tax. Nobody likes paying more income tax. Therefore, the draft budget is potentially a challenge in terms of public support. It is particularly a challenge given that the largest opposition party to the SNP are the Conservatives and the Conservatives will mount a very, very strong attack based upon any tax changes whatsoever. Mr Mackay will seek to rebut that by accusing the Conservatives of hypocrisy - by saying that they demand spending on pet projects while at the same time demanding tax restraint. Again, it will depend on what the public hears with regard to this - whether they listen to the government or whether they listen to the opposition, the Conservatives. MSPs will get their first chance to vote on the plans in the new year, with the minority SNP government needing support from at least one opposition party in order to pass the budget. Economic forecasts from the new Scottish Fiscal Commission will be published alongside the draft budget for the first time. Experts havewarned that the budget comes at a ""crucial"" timefor Scotland's economy, which they say is ""stuck in a cycle of weak growth"". Ms Sturgeon and Mr Mackay set outa series of possible income tax models last month, with many of them adding additional tax bands to those currently in place across the UK. The various models were estimated to raise up to an additional Â£290m - less than 1% of the Scottish government's total budget, which was about Â£33bn last year. Mr Mackay has conceded that the budget is ""set within a challenging context"", although he points the finger at ""continued austerity"" from Westminster. He has highlighted analysis showing Holyrood's resource grant falling by Â£200m in real terms for the coming year - although the Conservatives contend that the block grant from the UK government is increasing overall, due to extra funds for capital spending. The finance secretary said: ""The budget will bring forward key measures to protect public services like our NHS against the worst effects of UK budget cuts and continued Brexit uncertainty, and deliver a growth package to support the economy, unlock innovation and drive increased productivity. ""This will be a budget that is good for taxpayers, good for public services and good for business. It is a budget that will deliver for Scotland."" MSPs will get their first chance to vote on the plans in the new year Opposition parties will ultimately be key as the minority SNP government will need support from at least one in order to pass its budget, with the final vote due in February. The Conservatives have consistently argued against tax rises, and as such are highly unlikely to be persuaded to back Mr Mackay's budget. Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser used a Holyrood debate on Wednesdayto quote the SNP's manifesto back at them, saying the party had ""absolutely no mandate"" to increase the basic rate of tax. He said 65% of the electorate had backed parties which had pledged not to increase the basic rate of tax - the SNP and Conservatives - and that the budget was about ""whether politicians can be trusted to keep their promises"". Scottish Labour has called for ""radical decisions"" in the budget to tackle poverty, with new leader Richard Leonard saying Mr Mackay must not ""just tinker around the edges"". Labour has also repeatedly raised the issue of funding for local councils, which Mr Mackay has insisted will be ""fair"". The Scottish Greens - seen as the most likely party to back the SNP on the budget - have set out priorities including ""progressive changes to income tax"", a move to ""reverse the cuts"" to local budgets, an above-inflation rise in public sector pay and investment in low-carbon infrastructure. The Scottish Lib Dems, meanwhile, have called for ""specific, targeted investment"" with a particular focus on education, as well as action to tackle the ""woeful gap in the numbers of new mental health staff being trained"".

"Black Friday helped to propel retail sales 1.6% higher in November from a year earlier, official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid that retailers had reported a particular uplift in sales of electrical household appliances. ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said underlying growth remained ""reasonably strong"". However, analysts said that Black Friday had distorted sales and retailers faced challenging conditions. The ONS said that the quantity of food bought in November fell by 0.1% compared to the same month last year. However, the amount of money spent jumped by 3.5%, reflecting a rise in food prices that has contributed to the increase in inflation, which is now at a near six-year high of 3.1%. Pay squeeze continues for UK households Will you feel the pinch this Christmas? UK inflation rate at near six-year high In non-food sales, clothing and footwear rebounded from a slump in October to rise 2.3% in November from a year earlier. Department stores, however, saw their sales fall by 0.9% which the ONS said ""continues a recent pattern of slowdown in this sector"". Alex Marsh, managing director of Close Brothers Retail Finance, said: ""The final run up to Christmas may prove more difficult than usual for retailers as they battle low consumer confidence amid increasing inflation and a squeeze on wages."" Black Friday is an import from the US, where it takes place on the day after Thanksgiving and is regarded as the start of the Christmas shopping period. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The surge in retail sales in November does not signal broader consumer strength."" Mr Tombs said Black Friday meant the strength in November retail sales ""merely reflected people bringing forward purchases that they otherwise would have made in December or January to November, due to the discounts available"". Month-on-month, sales rose by 1.1% in November from October, which was ahead of analysts' forecasts for 0.4% growth. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said that ""on the surface"" the data was ""promising"". But he said: ""The next 10 days of pre-Christmas sales will be crucial for retailers. Trading is likely to peak on Friday 22 December, particularly for purchases of food and drink as consumers prepare for festive hosting. ""However, profitability is another matter and margins are under intense pressure.""

"Morgan Spurlock made his name with the documentary Super Size Me, which looked at the effects of eating fast food US documentary film-maker Morgan Spurlockhas publicly confessed to a history of sexual misconduct,external, referring to himself as ""part of the problem"". Spurlock, who made the hit film Super Size Me, wrote on Twitter that he had been accused of rape and had paid to settle a claim of sexual harassment. He also admitted cheating on ""every wife and girlfriend I have ever had"". The US entertainment industry has been rocked by claims of sexual abuse and harassment going back decades. In a lengthy statement, Spurlock said that after months of such revelations he had come to the conclusion that ""I am not some innocent bystander, I am also a part of the problem"". ""As I sit around watching hero after hero, man after man, fall at the realisation of their past indiscretions, I don't sit by and wonder 'who will be next?'

He said the allegations of rape took place at college. It did not lead to charges or investigations but he said the woman had written about the incident in a story writing class and had named Spurlock. The settlement for alleged harassment involved a female employee and took place about eight years ago, he said. ""It wasn't a gropy, feely harassment. It was verbal, and it was just as bad,"" he wrote. ""I would call my female assistant 'hot pants' or 'sex pants' when I was yelling to her from the other side of the office. Something I thought was funny at the time, but then realised I had completely demeaned and belittled her to a place of non-existence."" How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Harassment in Hollywood: Who's been accused? What to do if you're being sexually harassed at work Spurlock, 47, said that when the woman decided to leave she asked for a settlement in return for her silence. ""Being who I was, it was the last thing I wanted, so of course I paid,"" he said. ""I paid for peace of mind. I paid for her silence and co-operation. Most of all, I paid so I could remain who I was."" Spurlock said he himself had been the victim of sexual abuse as a boy and a teenager, and also had a longstanding drink problem. ""I haven't been sober for more than a week in 30 years, something our society doesn't shun or condemn but which only served to fill the emotional hole inside me and the daily depression I coped with,"" he wrote. Spurlock said he hoped that by ""recognising and openly admitting what I've done to further this terrible situation, I hope to empower the change within myself"". ""We should all find the courage to admit we're at fault,"" he said. ""I will do better. I will be better. I believe we all can."" Responding to messages on Twitter, Spurlock said he was ""seeking help"".

"Among the refugees are many young children At least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the month after violence broke out in Myanmar in August, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says. Based on surveys of refugees in Bangladesh, the number is much higher than Myanmar's official figure of 400. MSF said it was ""the clearest indication yet of the widespread violence"" by Myanmar authorities. The Myanmar military blames the violence on ""terrorists"" and has denied any wrongdoing. More than 647,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since August, MSF says. Is the refugee crisis 'textbook ethnic cleansing'? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar The injured sheltering in Bangladesh What sparked the Rakhine violence? The aid group's survey found that at least 9,000 Rohingya died in Myanmar, also known as Burma, between 25 August and 24 September. ""In the most conservative estimations"" at least 6,700 of those deaths have been caused by violence, including at least 730 children under the age of five, according to MSF. Previously, the armed forces stated that around 400 people had been killed, most of them described as Muslim terrorists. Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts There have been plenty of detailed reports by journalists and researchers, based on interviews conducted with refugees, which make it hard to dispute that terrible human rights abuses took place at the hands of the security forces. But many of these reports focussed on the worst cases; there are several media reports about a massacre at one village called Tula Toli. Some Rohingya I interviewed told me they had fled in fear of violence, but had not actually experienced it. This well-researched figure by MSF suggests the operation conducted by the military was brutal enough to raise the possibility of taking a case to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. The problem would be that Myanmar has not ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC and is not bound to co-operate with it. Bringing a case would require the approval of all five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and China has until now given its full support to the Myanmar government's handling of the crisis. 'A Muslim village was burning' The truth about Rohingya militants The military crackdown began on 25 August after Rohingya Arsa militants attacked more than 30 police posts. After an internal investigation,the Myanmar army in November exonerated itself of any blame regarding the crisis. It denied killing any civilians, burning their villages, raping women and girls, and stealing possessions. The mostly Muslim minority are denied citizenship by Myanmar, where they are seen as immigrants from Bangladesh. The government does not use the term Rohingya but calls them Bengali Muslims. The government's assertions contradicted evidence seen by BBC correspondents. The United Nations human rights chief has said it seems like ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". MSF says the experiences recounted by refugees were ""horrific"" ""What we uncovered was staggering, both in terms of the numbers of people who reported a family member died as a result of violence, and the horrific ways in which they said they were killed or severely injured,"" MSF Medical Director Sidney Wong said. According to MSF: 69% of the violence-related deaths were caused by gunshots 9% were due to being burnt to death in their houses 5% were beaten to death. Among the dead children below the age of five, MSF says more than 59% were reportedly shot, 15% burnt to death, 7% beaten to death and 2% killed by landmine blasts. Many refugees have been subject to brutal violence ""The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don't account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar,"" Mr Wong said. In November, Bangladesh signed a deal with Myanmarto return hundreds of thousands of the refugees. MSF said the agreement was ""premature"" pointing out that ""currently people are still fleeing"" and reports of violence have come even in recent weeks. The group also warned there was still very limited access for aid groups into Rakhine state. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar.

"This video can not be played Father-of-two Jake Omer was born with haemophilia A British doctors say they have achieved ""mind-blowing"" results in an attempt to rid people of haemophilia A. Patients are born with a genetic defect that means they do not produce a protein needed to stop bleeding. Thirteen patients given the gene therapy at Barts Health NHS Trust are now off treatment with 11 producing near-normal levels of the protein. Jake Omer, 29 from Billericay, Essex, was on the trial and says he feels like he has a new body. Like 2,000 other people in the UK, his body could not make clotting factor VIII. A minor injury used to cause severe bleeding. He remembers losing two front teeth as a child and bleeding for days afterwards. Even the impact of walking would lead to bleeding in his joints and eventually cause arthritis. Jake has needed at least three injections of factor VIII a week for most of his life. But in February 2016, he had a single infusion of gene therapy. Jake Omer: 'Like a new body' Jake told the BBC: ""I feel like a new person now - I feel like a well-oiled robot. ""I feel I can do a lot more. I feel my body allows me to do more. ""I don't think I would have been able to walk 500m without my joints flaring up, whereas now I think sort of two, three, four-mile walk - I could quite easily achieve that."" The first time he knew it had worked was four months after the therapy when he dropped a gym weight and bashed his elbow. He started to panic, but after icing the injury that evening, everything was normal the next day. The therapy is a genetically engineered virus. It contains the instructions for factor VIII that Jake was born without. The virus is used like a postman to deliver the genetic instructions to the liver, which then starts producing factor VIII. In the first trials, low doses of gene therapy had no effect. Of the 13 patients given higher doses, all are off their haemophilia medication a year on and 11 are producing near-normal levels of factor VIII. Prof John Pasi, who led the trials at Barts and Queen Mary University of London, said: ""This is huge. ""It's ground-breaking because the option to think about normalising levels in patients with severe haemophilia is absolutely mind-blowing. ""To offer people the potential of a normal life when they've had to inject themselves with factor VIII every other day to prevent bleeding is transformational."" An analysis of the first nine patients on the trial waspublished in the New England Journal of Medicine,external. Larger trials are now imminent to see if the therapy can truly transform the lives of patients. It is also uncertain how long the gene therapy will be effective. Liz Carroll, the chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, said: ""Gene therapy is a potentially game-changing treatment. ""Despite world-leading treatment standards in the UK many still suffer painful bleeds leading to chronic joint damage."" However, she warned there was a wide variation in who responded to therapy, which still needed to be explained. Gene therapies are likely to be spectacularly expensive. However, the current cost of regular factor VIII injections is about Â£100,000 a patient per year for life. Jake says the therapy should help him live a full life with his family: ""It's going to allow me as my boys grow up to be more active with them, to kick footballs about, to climb trees, to hopefully run around the park with them, not be someone who has to worry.""

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have attended a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, alongside members of the Royal Family and PM Theresa May. Bereaved families, survivors and rescue workers were joined by the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin said he hoped the tragedy would represent a ""time we learnt a new, better way"". The fire, on 14 June, claimed 71 lives. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened The commemoration, marking six months since the tragedy, also gave thanks to all those who assisted at the time of the fire and since - including the emergency services, recovery teams, the community, public support workers and volunteers. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and singer Adele were also among the more than 1,500 guests. The families of victims held photographs of their loved ones outside the cathedral Singer Adele attended the service, among more than 1,500 guests As the memorial began, a Green For Grenfell banner adorned with a heart was carried into the cathedral. Opening the service ahead of a minute's silence, Dean of St Paul's Dr David Ison said: ""We come together as different faiths as we remember those whose lives were lost."" ""Be united in the face of suffering and sorrow,"" he added. He said the UK grieved ""at the unspeakable tragedy, loss and hurt of that June day"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined the congregation By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News, at St Paul's Cathedral Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Families held photographs of victims of the fire, while voice recordings from people at the scene of the fire were played to the congregation. The Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra Schools Girls' Choir then sang out the words: ""Never lose hope."" Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington and organiser of the memorial, told the congregation: ""Today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to."" But he said he looked ahead to the New Year with ""hope"" of change from ""a city that didn't listen"". He said he hoped the word ""Grenfell"" would change from a symbol of ""sorrow, grief or injustice"" to ""a symbol of the time we learnt a new and better way - to listen and to love"". This video can not be played Ebony Steel band plays at Grenfell Memorial Choirs featuring local children performed during the service Before the service, Bishop Tomlin told the BBC: ""There was a very strong desire within the local community to have the service here, because faith is very important to a lot of people in the local area, and that can bring a real sense of strength to people."" One of those in attendance was Tiago Alves, who escaped the blaze with his family. He told BBC Breakfast his thoughts would be with bereaved families during the ""emotional"" memorial: ""Today is a day not about survivors; today is purely about the bereaved, their families and the loved ones they have lost."" He said the memorial would bring back a lot of awful memories for many people, but added: ""The reason we are doing this today is so that people never forget - we want people to remember."" Families stood on the steps of St Paul's after the service Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also attended the service A young girl lights a memorial candle among tributes laid for the victims Firefighters also paid respects Portobello Road Salvation Army Band and St Paul's Cathedral Choir performed during the service, and the Ebony Steel Band, frequent performers at the Notting Hill Carnival, played a verse of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. At the end of the service, bereaved families and survivors left the cathedral in silence, holding white roses. Clarrie Mendy, who lost her cousin Mary and Mary's daughter, Khadija Saye, in the fire, said the memorial was ""what the community needs, what the survivors need"". ""It is a very emotional day,"" she said. ""I just hope everybody will get something from it."" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, did not attend the service, after some families said they did not want the council there in an official capacity. However, a minute's silence was held outside the town hall in High Street Kensington as the memorial service began.

"This video can not be played May: We've won 35 out of 36 votes Theresa May has said the UK is ""on course to deliver on Brexit"" as she arrived in Brussels, the day after her first Commons defeat as prime minister. She said she was ""disappointed"" at the vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, but the legislation was making ""good progress"". MPs backed an amendment giving them a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. EU leaders are expected to formally agree to start the next phase of negotiations on Friday. The European Commission has said ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the first phase to move onto discussing the framework of a future relationship between the EU and UK - on issues such as security and trade.

What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do Mrs May told fellow EU leaders at dinner on Thursday that she wanted to get agreement on the ""implementation period"" as a priority but wanted to talk about trade ""as soon as possible"". She said was personally committed to delivering a ""smooth Brexit"" and she wanted to approach the next phase of talks ""with ambition and creativity"". Speaking to reporters earlier, she said: ""I'm disappointed with the amendment but actually the EU Withdrawal Bill is making good progress through the House of Commons and we are on course to deliver Brexit."" UK to stay in Erasmus scheme until at least 2020 MEPs vote on Brexit: What we learned Asked whether she felt she would have to compromise more to win over rebels from her own party, she told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""We've actually had 36 votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill, and we've won 35 of those votes with an average majority of 22."" Mrs May lost by just four votes, as MPs backed an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill by 309 to 305. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described it as a ""humiliating loss of authority"" for the PM and warned that his party would vote against another bit of the bill - the plan to put a fixed Brexit date into law. He said setting an ""arbitrary date"" was not sensible and there ""should be some flexibility"". This video can not be played Brexit is unstoppable and MPs will not block it, says Boris Johnson It will not derail Brexit but MPs who voted against the government hope it will give them a bigger say in the final deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that as other EU leaders also run minority or coalition governments they would see the vote defeat as a small-scale domestic political issue. The government had promised a ""meaningful vote"" for MPs on the final Brexit deal, but this defeat means that promise now has legal force and must happen before any UK-EU deal is implemented in the UK. Ministers had wanted to be able to start implementing any deal as soon as it was agreed - in case, for instance, it was only agreed at the last minute. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it would embolden the opposition and showed there was a majority in Parliament against a ""hard Brexit"". Cabinet Minister Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the vote was ""not going to stop Brexit"". Labour joined forces with the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party in a cross-party alliance. If all Conservative and DUP MPs had voted against the amendment the government would have won. But 11 Conservatives resisted the arm-twisting by their party managers to vote with the opposition. The Tory rebels were Dominic Grieve, Heidi Allen, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Stephen Hammond, Sir Oliver Heald, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. Another Conservative MP, John Stevenson, officially abstained by voting for and against the amendment. Two Eurosceptic Labour MPs - Frank Field and Kate Hoey - voted with the Conservatives and the DUP. This video can not be played ""I'm in parliament to do my duty by my constituents and by my country"" said Tory rebel Dominic Grieve Emotions ran high before, during and after Wednesday's Commons debate, with Eurosceptic Conservatives accusing the rebels of trying to ""frustrate"" Brexit. In dramatic scenes, the rebels shouted ""too late"" as Justice Minister Dominic Raab announced a concession shortly before voting began and Tory whips could be seen attempting to twist the arm of MPs thinking of voting against the government. Leading rebel Anna Soubry said she had found a woman MP ""upset and shaken"" on Tuesday evening after a whip tried to persuade her not to revolt. She told MPs on Thursday morning, that none of the rebels took any pleasure in defeating the government, adding that ""nobody drank champagne"". After the result was announced, one of the rebels, former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, tweeted: ""Tonight Parliament took control of the EU Withdrawal process."" This did not go down well with Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who called for the deselection of rebel Tories for ""undermining the PM"", and accused their leader, Dominic Grieve of ""treachery"". Rebel Tory Sarah Wollaston hit back on Twitter, saying: ""Get over yourself Nadine."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dominic Grieve tried to calm the mood, insisting he was merely trying to ensure Brexit was carried out in an ""orderly, sensible way"". This video can not be played There were cheers from the opposition benches as the result was announced BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It's certainly true that the Tory party is so divided over how we leave the EU that the Parliamentary process was always going to be very, very choppy. But another minister told me the defeat is ""bad for Brexit"" and was openly frustrated and worried about their colleagues' behaviour. Read the rest of Laura's blog Theresa May has travelled to Brussels to attend a dinner with the 27 other EU leaders, at which she will urge them to approve an agreement to move Brexit talks on to a second phase. They are all but certain to agree.  Talks could then start next month on the two-year transition period the UK wants to ease it out of the EU after it formally leaves in March 2019. But the EU wants more detail from the UK government before starting talks on a future relations - including trade - with the UK. Brexit Secretary David Davis has said he wants to complete the ""substantive portion"" of trade negotiations by March 2019, leaving open the possibility that the detail will be hammered out during the two-year transition period. This video can not be played Is it game over for Brexit? The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. MPs have been making hundreds of attempts to change its wording - but Wednesday's vote was the first time one has succeeded. Unless the government manages to overturn it further down the line, it means a new Act of Parliament will have to be passed before ministers can implement the withdrawal deal struck with Brussels. Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer urged David Davis not to undermine Wednesday night's vote when the EU Withdrawal Bill reaches the next stage of its passage into law. Mr Davis said the vote would lead to a ""very compressed timetable"" for Brexit legislation and the government ""will have to think about how we respond to it"". There is also a row brewing over a vote next week on putting the precise date and time of Britain's exit from the EU - 11pm on 29 March 2019 - into law. Sir Keir described the vote as the next ""accident waiting to happen"", telling Mr Davis: ""Rather than repeat last night's debacle, will the government now commit to dropping that ill-conceived gimmick?"" Mr Davis told Sir Keir: ""Unlike him, I do not view votes of this House of Commons as accidents. They are decisions taken by the House, and that decision we respect, as we will the next one."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake also warned the prime minister she was heading for defeat if she did not drop the ""silly idea"" of enshrining the Brexit date and time in law, adding: ""Parliament has now shown it is not prepared to be bullied.""

"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have attended a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, alongside members of the Royal Family and PM Theresa May. Bereaved families, survivors and rescue workers were joined by the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin said he hoped the tragedy would represent a ""time we learnt a new, better way"". The fire, on 14 June, claimed 71 lives. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened The commemoration, marking six months since the tragedy, also gave thanks to all those who assisted at the time of the fire and since - including the emergency services, recovery teams, the community, public support workers and volunteers. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and singer Adele were also among the more than 1,500 guests. The families of victims held photographs of their loved ones outside the cathedral Singer Adele attended the service, among more than 1,500 guests As the memorial began, a Green For Grenfell banner adorned with a heart was carried into the cathedral. Opening the service ahead of a minute's silence, Dean of St Paul's Dr David Ison said: ""We come together as different faiths as we remember those whose lives were lost."" ""Be united in the face of suffering and sorrow,"" he added. He said the UK grieved ""at the unspeakable tragedy, loss and hurt of that June day"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined the congregation By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News, at St Paul's Cathedral Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Families held photographs of victims of the fire, while voice recordings from people at the scene of the fire were played to the congregation. The Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra Schools Girls' Choir then sang out the words: ""Never lose hope."" Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington and organiser of the memorial, told the congregation: ""Today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to."" But he said he looked ahead to the New Year with ""hope"" of change from ""a city that didn't listen"". He said he hoped the word ""Grenfell"" would change from a symbol of ""sorrow, grief or injustice"" to ""a symbol of the time we learnt a new and better way - to listen and to love"". This video can not be played Ebony Steel band plays at Grenfell Memorial Choirs featuring local children performed during the service Before the service, Bishop Tomlin told the BBC: ""There was a very strong desire within the local community to have the service here, because faith is very important to a lot of people in the local area, and that can bring a real sense of strength to people."" One of those in attendance was Tiago Alves, who escaped the blaze with his family. He told BBC Breakfast his thoughts would be with bereaved families during the ""emotional"" memorial: ""Today is a day not about survivors; today is purely about the bereaved, their families and the loved ones they have lost."" He said the memorial would bring back a lot of awful memories for many people, but added: ""The reason we are doing this today is so that people never forget - we want people to remember."" Families stood on the steps of St Paul's after the service Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also attended the service A young girl lights a memorial candle among tributes laid for the victims Firefighters also paid respects Portobello Road Salvation Army Band and St Paul's Cathedral Choir performed during the service, and the Ebony Steel Band, frequent performers at the Notting Hill Carnival, played a verse of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. At the end of the service, bereaved families and survivors left the cathedral in silence, holding white roses. Clarrie Mendy, who lost her cousin Mary and Mary's daughter, Khadija Saye, in the fire, said the memorial was ""what the community needs, what the survivors need"". ""It is a very emotional day,"" she said. ""I just hope everybody will get something from it."" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, did not attend the service, after some families said they did not want the council there in an official capacity. However, a minute's silence was held outside the town hall in High Street Kensington as the memorial service began.

"Among the refugees are many young children At least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the month after violence broke out in Myanmar in August, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says. Based on surveys of refugees in Bangladesh, the number is much higher than Myanmar's official figure of 400. MSF said it was ""the clearest indication yet of the widespread violence"" by Myanmar authorities. The Myanmar military blames the violence on ""terrorists"" and has denied any wrongdoing. More than 647,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since August, MSF says. Is the refugee crisis 'textbook ethnic cleansing'? Seeing through the official story in Myanmar The injured sheltering in Bangladesh What sparked the Rakhine violence? The aid group's survey found that at least 9,000 Rohingya died in Myanmar, also known as Burma, between 25 August and 24 September. ""In the most conservative estimations"" at least 6,700 of those deaths have been caused by violence, including at least 730 children under the age of five, according to MSF. Previously, the armed forces stated that around 400 people had been killed, most of them described as Muslim terrorists. Jonathan Head, South East Asia correspondent This video can not be played Rohingya Muslims displaced from Tula Toli village in Rakhine State gave disturbing accounts There have been plenty of detailed reports by journalists and researchers, based on interviews conducted with refugees, which make it hard to dispute that terrible human rights abuses took place at the hands of the security forces. But many of these reports focussed on the worst cases; there are several media reports about a massacre at one village called Tula Toli. Some Rohingya I interviewed told me they had fled in fear of violence, but had not actually experienced it. This well-researched figure by MSF suggests the operation conducted by the military was brutal enough to raise the possibility of taking a case to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against humanity. The problem would be that Myanmar has not ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC and is not bound to co-operate with it. Bringing a case would require the approval of all five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and China has until now given its full support to the Myanmar government's handling of the crisis. 'A Muslim village was burning' The truth about Rohingya militants The military crackdown began on 25 August after Rohingya Arsa militants attacked more than 30 police posts. After an internal investigation,the Myanmar army in November exonerated itself of any blame regarding the crisis. It denied killing any civilians, burning their villages, raping women and girls, and stealing possessions. The mostly Muslim minority are denied citizenship by Myanmar, where they are seen as immigrants from Bangladesh. The government does not use the term Rohingya but calls them Bengali Muslims. The government's assertions contradicted evidence seen by BBC correspondents. The United Nations human rights chief has said it seems like ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". MSF says the experiences recounted by refugees were ""horrific"" ""What we uncovered was staggering, both in terms of the numbers of people who reported a family member died as a result of violence, and the horrific ways in which they said they were killed or severely injured,"" MSF Medical Director Sidney Wong said. According to MSF: 69% of the violence-related deaths were caused by gunshots 9% were due to being burnt to death in their houses 5% were beaten to death. Among the dead children below the age of five, MSF says more than 59% were reportedly shot, 15% burnt to death, 7% beaten to death and 2% killed by landmine blasts. Many refugees have been subject to brutal violence ""The numbers of deaths are likely to be an underestimation as we have not surveyed all refugee settlements in Bangladesh and because the surveys don't account for the families who never made it out of Myanmar,"" Mr Wong said. In November, Bangladesh signed a deal with Myanmarto return hundreds of thousands of the refugees. MSF said the agreement was ""premature"" pointing out that ""currently people are still fleeing"" and reports of violence have come even in recent weeks. The group also warned there was still very limited access for aid groups into Rakhine state. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar.

"Thousands of offenders given community sentences are being supervised via a phone call every six weeks, the chief probation inspector has said. In a report, Dame Glenys Stacey said widespread use of the practice in England and Wales was ""not acceptable"". The findings also revealed some junior probation officers had 200 cases at once. Dame Glenys said poor supervision was ""a risk to the public"". The government said supervision by phone was only for low-risk cases. But it acknowledged that improvements were needed to raise the standard of probation services. Prisoners 'lack support after release' The government's probation reforms, known as Transforming Rehabilitation, launched three years ago and split offender supervision between a state-run service and 21 privately-operated companies. It created the National Probation Service (NPS) to deal with high-risk offenders, while Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) were assigned low and medium-risk cases. An offender given a community sentence may be required to undertake unpaid work or attend a government-sanctioned programme. In her annual report, Dame Glenys said the government's probation reforms had created a ""two-tier and fragmented"" system in which the private companies were ""struggling"" and she questioned whether the probation system could ""deliver sufficiently well"". Dame Glenys Stacey became the chief probation inspector in March 2016 It revealed some offenders were only met once before being placed on ""remote supervision"" by private probation providers. That could amount to no more than a telephone call every six weeks, with no further face-to-face meetings taking place. Inspectors said the calls were little more than ""checking in"" and made it difficult to assess any change in the risk posed to the public. These arrangements are allowed under the terms of the contracts, but the report emphasised that face-to-face work was vital. It also found that inexperienced probation staff were responsible for monitoring 200 offenders each, when the recommended maximum number is 60. Dame Glenys said: ""I find it inexplicable that, under the banner of innovation, these developments were allowed. ""We should all be concerned, given the rehabilitation opportunities missed, and the risks to the public if individuals are not supervised well."" Jacob Tas, chief executive of social justice charity Nacro, said there had been almost daily reports of problems and called for the government to act ""urgently"" to address failings. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw It is hard to see this report as anything other than a damning indictment of the probation reforms introduced in 2014, by Chris Grayling, when he was justice secretary. The 113-page document details how the privatised part of the new system simply is not functioning properly, with unmanageable caseloads and supervision-by-phone the most glaring examples. The significance of these failings should not be under-estimated. Successful rehabilitation hinges on having a relationship of trust between offender and probation officer. That is exceptionally difficult if they are not in regular face-to-face contact. The findings will also do little to inspire confidence in community sentences at a time when the government is encouraging judges and magistrates to consider non-custodial alternatives to the more costly option of imprisonment.

"This video can not be played The map reveals a hidden world of mountains and canyons Scientists have produced a stunning visualisation of Greenland â without its ice cover. It is made from decades of survey data that show the position and shape of the territoryâs bedrock, and the surrounding seafloor. This is critical information needed to understand how the huge island might respond to a warming world. Were all the ice on Greenland to melt, it would raise global sea-levels by 7.42m (24.34ft). This is one of the refined statistics to come out of the new compilation of data. It is a simple calculation: if you know the elevation of the top of the ice sheet and you subtract from that the height of the bedrock - you get a volume: 2.9 million cubic km. The 7.42m figure is seven cm more than previous estimates. ""[It's] a little bit more than we thought, but not a whole lot more,"" explained Dr Mathieu Morlighem from the University of California at Irvine, US. ""And the reason for that is that although we do find deeper fjords and deeper valleys, they're very narrow and constrained along the sides of the ice sheet. The interior hasn't changed a lot, however."" This video can not be played Mathieu Morlighem: ""Just seeing the detail the map has is absolutely beautiful"" Total ice area: 1.799 million sq km Total ice volume: 2.99 million cu km Mean thickness: 1,673m Thickest ice: 3,488m For comparison, theAntarctic ice sheet has a volume of 26.5 million cu km Greenland is currently losing about 260 billion tonnes of ice to the ocean every year. It sounds a lot - and it is, but no-one is expecting an immediate collapse - not for centuries, at least. Nonetheless, some of the answers as to how fast changes may come will be in this map's data. ""If you're trying to model an ice sheet, the single most important input is ice thickness,"" said Prof Jonathan Bamber. ""Why's that? Because velocity is proportional to the fourth power of thickness. So differences in thickness make for huge differences in the velocity of the ice in our models; and to things like thermodynamics, because thick ice is warmer than thin ice, and so on,"" the Bristol University, UK, glaciologist told BBC News. The colourful map is being distributed here at theFall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU),external, the largest annual gathering of Earth and planetary scientists. Ice drains from Greenland down deep narrow fjords It is a dramatic rendering of an initiative calledBedMachine,externalwhich has sought to pull together everything we know about what lies under and around the giant ice sheet. Kelly Hogan: Ice loss at Petermann is mostly from warm water incursion Scientists working on this project published a summary of their findings ina paper in Geophysical Research Letters,externallast month, and now the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS) mapping department, at the request of Prof Bamber, has put the data in a visually understandable form. Interesting features to peruse include the channelled terrain feeding the mighty Jakobshavn Glacier in the west. Jakobshavn spews countless icebergs into the North Atlantic, and is responsible for draining 6.5% of the ice sheet. Look at the spine of Greenland and you will see the mega-canyon that runs northwards towards another of the territory's big iceberg exporters - Petermann Glacier. In studying the hidden landscape, scientists are now pretty confident that both ice streams sit on top of valley systems that were cut by rivers that flowed across Greenland long before there was an ice sheet. And it is clear also that meltwater continues to run down these valleys, under the glaciers, lubricating their flow. New map traces Shackleton's footsteps Giant iceberg splits from Antarctic 'Upside-down ice canyon' revealed This video can not be played Greenland's mega-canyon was originally cut by an ancient river system The data for the map comes from three principal sources - from airborne radar that is able to penetrate the ice sheet to see the shape of the bed below; from ships surveying offshore, using sonar to map sea-bottom depths; and then there is a degree of modelling in some of the hard-to-reach places in fjords, explains BAS map-maker Dr Peter Fretwell. ""Around the coast it can be very difficult to get radio echo soundings (radar) because the surface is often crevassed and the radio waves won't penetrate through that. So in some fjords and bays, modelling is used, based on the speed of the glaciers. From their speed, you can estimate their thickness,"" he said. Wherever possible, though, scientists have endeavoured to get up the fjords to acquire direct data. This has been the imperative of the US-ledOMG (Oceans Melting Greenland),externalproject that is surveying large sections of the coastline. OMG is finding that many of the glaciers terminating in fjords are so thick they are at risk of melting from the intrusion of warm ocean water at depth. Great efforts are being made to get into fjords to map their shape Dr Kelly Hogan, a BAS co-author on the BedMachine paper, found a similar picture when she joined an expedition to study Petermann. ""Most of the losses for Petermann Glacier, for sure, about 80%, are the result of warm ocean water getting under the glacier and melting it from below - not from iceberg calving,"" she said. ""But if you get increased melting from below, you can get big channels forming on the underside of the floating front of the glacier and this can lead to thinning and fracturing that then make the glacier potentially more predisposed to breaking up."" Prof Bamber cautions, however, that there is a lot of complexity bound up in the new map. Some of the mouths to the deep fjords, he says, have tall ridges, or sills, that act as barriers to the invasion of warm bottom-water. ""What we're starting to understand is that adjacent marine-terminating glaciers that are experiencing the same changes in forcing - in other words, the same changes in the ocean - can respond in very different ways, depending on the geometry of the fjord in which they lie. ""So, the better we can constrain these geometries, the better we will be able to model the interaction between the ice sheet and the ocean. At AGU, there are lots of sessions on this interaction. It's kind of the big thing at the moment,"" the Bristol scientist told BBC News.

"The NHS in England is to become the first healthcare system in the world to publish figures on avoidable patient deaths, the health secretary has said. By the end of 2017, some 170 out of 223 trusts will publish data on deaths they believe could have been prevented. It is estimated there are up to 9,000 deaths in hospitals each year caused by failings in NHS care. The Department for Health said it wanted to ensure the NHS learned lessons from every case. There is no standard definition of an avoidable death and each hospital trust makes its own judgment. The data released by the organisations will include details of reviews and investigations into deaths, and information on any action taken as a result. As part of the release from more than three quarters of England's trusts, families of patients will also be given full explanations over relatives' deaths. These explanations, the department says, will be used to support bereaved relatives and carers, and will ensure they are treated with empathy, compassion and respect. Out of a total of around 240,000 deaths in hospital, the government says there are between 1,200 and 9,000 deaths each year caused by problems with care. Connor Sparrowhawk had epilepsy and experienced seizures Two cases highlighted by the government are that of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk and one-year-old William Mead. In 2013,Connor Sparrowhawk died in the care of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trustat Slade House in Oxford. The trust has accepted his death was ""entirely preventable"". Meanwhile, an NHS England report into the death of William Mead said he might have livedif 111 call handlers had realised the seriousness of his condition. William, from Cornwall, died of blood poisoning after a chest infection. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts in England, said it was ""right"" that patient safety was made a priority. ""It is important this work is carried forward in the spirit of learning and sharing good practice, rather than recriminations,"" he said. Some avoidable deaths are deemed to have occurred among terminally-ill patients who might have lived longer if they had spent their final weeks at home - and Mr Hopson added too many patients were still dying in hospital. Announcing the roll-out, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said each trust was being asked to use the same methodology to determine whether a death was preventable or not. But he added the data released could not be used to rank trusts against each other because of different reporting procedures used when mistakes happened. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""It's about hospitals creating a culture which makes it easy for staff on the frontline to say, 'look, something went wrong; I think it could have had a different outcome and we need to learn from this so it doesn't happen again'.""

"If your wine was served in a smaller glass, would you drink less of it? That is the question being posed ina study, published in the BMJ,,externalinto the growing size of wine glasses. University of Cambridge researchers found glass size grew from an average 66ml in the 1700s to 449ml today - a near sevenfold increase - and wine drinking nearly doubled from 1980-2004. ""When it comes to how much we drink, wine glass size probably does matter,"" says study author Prof Theresa Marteau. The increase in the capacity of wine glasses has been more rapid since the 1990s. The researchers think one reason for this could be that the demand for larger glasses by the US market was met by an increase in the size of glasses made in England. Pubs generally sell wine in measures of 125ml, 175ml and 250ml. Wine writer Jancis Robinson is one of those who believes that larger glasses and higher consumption are likely to go hand in hand. ""I have long been a critic of the 175ml wine glass,"" she says. ""Not just because it encourages people to drink more than they intended, but also because white and pink wines tend to warm up in them, encouraging people to finish their contents before they get too warm to be refreshing."" But a British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) spokesman told the BBC that pubs must offer smaller measures so that customers had a choice. Prof Marteau says that in the same way larger plates mean people eat more, evidence suggests a similar effect for wine glasses, although the researchers could not prove this. ""We speculate there are two main mechanisms: capacity - the larger a container, the more we pour into it, and perceptual - the same amount looks smaller in a larger container than a smaller one,"" she says. ""Given we often regulate our consumption in units such as one slice of cake or one cup of coffee, if we perceive we have not had a full glass of wine, this might lead to us having another glass.""

Prof Marteau and her team conducted experiments in three Cambridge bars to test the theory. They increased glass sizes while leaving serving sizes the same. In two of the three bars, sales increased. In the 1700s, you may have drunk your wine from an enamelled Jacobite portrait glass like this While alcohol is the third leading risk factor for death and disability,externalafter smoking and obesity, according to Public Health England, levels of drinking have actually dropped in Britain. A 2016 poll of nearly 8,000 Britons found that just under 60% had had a drink in the past week- the lowest rate since the survey began, in 2005. Part of this could be down to a campaign to remove a billion units of alcohol from the market in various ways. Queensland police python photo gains internet fame Daredevil climber dies in China fall 'I was saved from a Â£10,000 car scam' However, there is a practical reason for serving wine in different size glasses - to affect its taste and quality. Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, told the BBC: ""Red wine, for example, is served in a larger glass to allow it to breathe, something which perhaps wasn't a priority 300 years ago. ""It is widely recognised that moderate and responsible consumption of alcohol is compatible with a healthy lifestyle."" Mr Beale added that in the past decade, ""volume sales of wine in Britain have declined by 6%, and the volume of wine consumed per person has dropped 10%"". Seven standard 175ml glasses of wine is the weekly recommended limit Rosanna O'Connor, director of alcohol and drugs at Public Health England, told the BBC: ""It's important people understand how much alcohol is in what they drink, some glasses of wine can contain as many as three units. ""We recommend people try to follow the advice of the UK Chief Medical Officers and not to drink regularly more than 14 units a week.""

"This video can not be played Roads turned to rivers across Houston as Harvey hit Scientists have weighed the water that fell on Texas during the record-breaking Hurricane Harvey in August. They calculate, by measuring how much the Earth was compressed, that the Category 4 storm dropped 127 billion tonnes, or 34 trillion US gallons. ""One person asked me how many stadia is that. It's 26,000 New Orleans Superdomes,"" said Adrian Borsa from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His numbers were released as other scientists stated that this year's big hurricanes had a clear human influence. Harvey, Irma and Maria ripped through the US Gulf states and the Caribbean, leading to widespread flooding and wind damage. Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union here in New Orleans thatthe heavy rainfall seen in Harvey was very likely exacerbated by the extra warming,externalassociated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were particularly high in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico this hurricane season. Warm ocean water acts as a fuel for the storms. This video can not be played The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport Harvey devastated parts of the Texas coastline because it stalled, concentrating its deluge in a very narrow region. It was one of the heaviest precipitation events in recorded hurricane history. Four key effects of Hurricane Harvey Harvey: The climate link Standard rain gauges saw upwards of 1,270mm (50 inches) of precipitation in places. But these were point measurements and Dr Borsa attempted to get a much broader view by assessing how much the Earth moved in response to the weight of overlying water. This was detected by a network of high-precision GPS stations, which registered the vertical displacement of the land. ""It's like you sitting down on a mattress - it depresses; you stand up and it rebounds. The Earth behaves very similarly, like a rubber block. ""So the Earth is recording the effects of the loads acting on its surface."" The GPS network is dense enough that a very wide picture of activity can be discerned. ""It gives us a holistic view, not just point measurements,â Dr Borsa told BBC News. Maps of how Harvey changed Texas What is especially smart is that the system can see the immediate change after the storm as water runs off the land through rivers, but also captures the much slower effect of water removal through evaporation, driven by the warmth of the Sun. This takes several weeks. ""One of the big deficiencies in our models is that evapotranspiration - that's the Sun and plants doing their things - is not currently directly observed, and it's half of the total water budget. I think GPS is going to be able to provide very useful information about this."" At the same AGU gathering, the American Meteorological Association revealed that its annual report on extreme weather events had identified three that would ânot have been possibleâ without the influence of human-induced climate change. These were: the record-breaking global temperatures in 2016; the 2016 heat wave across Asia and the high ocean temperatures measured off the coast of Alaska. These were events that happened because âwe have created a new climate,â said National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) climate scientist Stephanie Herring. The report also concluded that other heat waves around the world were made more intense by climate change and that Arctic warming was âmost likelyâ not possible without it. The coral bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef and other marine ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean were also amplified by âhuman-caused warming of the oceanâ. The research is primarily based on comparing models, or simulations, of our climate. âWe run a model that shows what the world looks like today and we can validate those models against what is actually happening,â explained Dr Herring. âThen we compare it to a model of an âalternative worldâ in which - theoretically - climate change never happened; as if humans didnât emit greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution. âSo we can look at a world with climate change and a world without it.â Harvey's rain could have filled 26,000 New Orleans Superdomes In maps: Houston and Texas flooding Four key effects of Houston floods Hurricane Harvey: The climate link At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Salma Hayek, seen here promoting Frida in 2003, which she starred in and co-produced Actress Salma Hayek has described Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein as a rage-fuelled ""monster"", alleging he sexually harassed and threatened her. Writing in the New York Times,external, Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" Holly Baird, a spokeswoman for Weinstein, disputed Hayek's account. Dozens of actresses, including Rose McGowan, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, have accused Weinstein of harassment or assault. Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. How Weinstein scandal unfolded Writing in the New York Times, Hayek, 51, described working with the film mogul on what she called her ""greatest ambition"" - telling the story of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. She wrote that, after striking a deal with Weinstein for the rights of the film that would eventually become 2002's Frida, she was forced to repeatedly refuse sexual advances. ""No to me taking a shower with him. ""No to letting him watch me take a shower. ""No to letting him give me a massage. ""No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage. ""No to letting him give me oral sex. ""No to my getting naked with another woman,"" she wrote. She went on to accuse him of threatening to shut the film down unless she filmed a nude sex scene with another actress. ""I had to take a tranquilizer, which eventually stopped the crying but made the vomiting worse,"" she wrote of her emotional turmoil at filming a scene she thought unnecessary. ""As you can imagine, this was not sexy, but it was the only way I could get through the scene."" Weinstein's spokeswoman said in a statement: ""Mr Weinstein does not recall pressuring Salma to do a gratuitous sex scene with a female co-star and he was not there for the filming."" ""All of the sexual allegations as portrayed by Salma are not accurate and others who witnessed the events have a different account of what transpired."" Frida would eventually gather six Oscar nominations, including a Best Actress nod for Hayek. Mr Weinstein has been accused of rape, sexual assault and harassment, but has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual relationships.

He also admitted cheating on ""every wife and girlfriend I have ever had"". The US entertainment industry has been rocked by claims of sexual abuse and harassment going back decades. In a lengthy statement, Spurlock said that after months of such revelations he had come to the conclusion that ""I am not some innocent bystander, I am also a part of the problem"".

He said the allegations of rape took place at college. It did not lead to charges or investigations but he said the woman had written about the incident in a story writing class and had named Spurlock. The settlement for alleged harassment involved a female employee and took place about eight years ago, he said. ""It wasn't a gropy, feely harassment. It was verbal, and it was just as bad,"" he wrote. ""I would call my female assistant 'hot pants' or 'sex pants' when I was yelling to her from the other side of the office.

""Being who I was, it was the last thing I wanted, so of course I paid,"" he said. ""I paid for peace of mind. I paid for her silence and co-operation. Most of all, I paid so I could remain who I was."" Spurlock said he himself had been the victim of sexual abuse as a boy and a teenager, and also had a longstanding drink problem. ""I haven't been sober for more than a week in 30 years, something our society doesn't shun or condemn but which only served to fill the emotional hole inside me and the daily depression I coped with,"" he wrote. Spurlock said he hoped that by ""recognising and openly admitting what I've done to further this terrible situation, I hope to empower the change within myself"". ""We should all find the courage to admit we're at fault,"" he said. ""I will do better. I will be better. I believe we all can."" Responding to messages on Twitter, Spurlock said he was ""seeking help"".

"The NHS in England is to become the first healthcare system in the world to publish figures on avoidable patient deaths, the health secretary has said. By the end of 2017, some 170 out of 223 trusts will publish data on deaths they believe could have been prevented. It is estimated there are up to 9,000 deaths in hospitals each year caused by failings in NHS care. The Department for Health said it wanted to ensure the NHS learned lessons from every case. There is no standard definition of an avoidable death and each hospital trust makes its own judgment. The data released by the organisations will include details of reviews and investigations into deaths, and information on any action taken as a result. As part of the release from more than three quarters of England's trusts, families of patients will also be given full explanations over relatives' deaths. These explanations, the department says, will be used to support bereaved relatives and carers, and will ensure they are treated with empathy, compassion and respect. Out of a total of around 240,000 deaths in hospital, the government says there are between 1,200 and 9,000 deaths each year caused by problems with care. Connor Sparrowhawk had epilepsy and experienced seizures Two cases highlighted by the government are that of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk and one-year-old William Mead. In 2013,Connor Sparrowhawk died in the care of Southern Health NHS Foundation Trustat Slade House in Oxford. The trust has accepted his death was ""entirely preventable"". Meanwhile, an NHS England report into the death of William Mead said he might have livedif 111 call handlers had realised the seriousness of his condition. William, from Cornwall, died of blood poisoning after a chest infection. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts in England, said it was ""right"" that patient safety was made a priority. ""It is important this work is carried forward in the spirit of learning and sharing good practice, rather than recriminations,"" he said. Some avoidable deaths are deemed to have occurred among terminally-ill patients who might have lived longer if they had spent their final weeks at home - and Mr Hopson added too many patients were still dying in hospital. Announcing the roll-out, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said each trust was being asked to use the same methodology to determine whether a death was preventable or not. But he added the data released could not be used to rank trusts against each other because of different reporting procedures used when mistakes happened. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""It's about hospitals creating a culture which makes it easy for staff on the frontline to say, 'look, something went wrong; I think it could have had a different outcome and we need to learn from this so it doesn't happen again'.""

"Rex Tillerson is reportedly an increasingly marginalised figure as secretary of state US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appears to have been contradicted by the White House and his own department, after suggesting the US had softened its position on talks with North Korea. Mr Tillerson said on Tuesday that he was ready to open dialogue with Pyongyang, without preconditions. But within a day, the White House and State Department had reiterated the administration's hard line, stressing that North Korea must first commit to abandoning its nuclear weapons. The mixed messages mark the third time in recent months that Mr Tillerson has been publicly at odds with the White House. Speaking at a policy forum in Washington DC on Tuesday, the secretary of state told the audience: ""We've said from the diplomatic side we're ready to talk any time North Korea, would like to talk, and we're ready to have the first meeting without precondition."" He added: ""Let's just meet and let's talk about the weather if you want and talk about whether it's going to be a square table or a round table if that's what you're excited about."" Analysis: Tillerson's tumultuous year North Korea: What could tip the balance? What missiles does North Korea have? In response to the remarks, an unnamed White House official told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday: ""The administration is united in insisting that any negotiations with North Korea must wait until the regime fundamentally improves its behavior. ""As the secretary of state himself has said, this must include, but is not limited to, no further nuclear or missile tests."" And Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the State Department, tweeted to reiterate the administration position that preconditions apply regarding North Korea's nuclear programme. She said: ""Our policy on #DPRK has not changed. Diplomacy is our top priority through our maximum pressure campaign. ""We remain open to dialogue when North Korea is willing to conduct a serious & credible dialogue on the peaceful denuclearization, but that time is not now."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? The contradiction is the latest clash between the White House and the secretary of state. In August, then-White House advisor Sebastian Gorka criticised Mr Tillerson after the secretary of state attempted to moderate President Trump's remarks on North Korea. ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical, it is the job of Secretary Mattis, the secretary of defence, to talk about military matters,"" Mr Gorka told the BBC. Then in September, after Mr Tillerson said he had established direct lines of communication with Pyongyang, the president accused the secretary of ""wasting his time"". ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Mr Trump tweeted. Rex Tillerson - the wild card diplomat Tillerson's quiet diplomacy Mr Trump has been widely reported to be considering replacing Mr Tillerson, a former chief executive of energy giant Exxon Mobil.

"If your wine was served in a smaller glass, would you drink less of it? That is the question being posed ina study, published in the BMJ,,externalinto the growing size of wine glasses. University of Cambridge researchers found glass size grew from an average 66ml in the 1700s to 449ml today - a near sevenfold increase - and wine drinking nearly doubled from 1980-2004. ""When it comes to how much we drink, wine glass size probably does matter,"" says study author Prof Theresa Marteau. The increase in the capacity of wine glasses has been more rapid since the 1990s. The researchers think one reason for this could be that the demand for larger glasses by the US market was met by an increase in the size of glasses made in England. Pubs generally sell wine in measures of 125ml, 175ml and 250ml. Wine writer Jancis Robinson is one of those who believes that larger glasses and higher consumption are likely to go hand in hand. ""I have long been a critic of the 175ml wine glass,"" she says. ""Not just because it encourages people to drink more than they intended, but also because white and pink wines tend to warm up in them, encouraging people to finish their contents before they get too warm to be refreshing."" But a British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) spokesman told the BBC that pubs must offer smaller measures so that customers had a choice. Prof Marteau says that in the same way larger plates mean people eat more, evidence suggests a similar effect for wine glasses, although the researchers could not prove this. ""We speculate there are two main mechanisms: capacity - the larger a container, the more we pour into it, and perceptual - the same amount looks smaller in a larger container than a smaller one,"" she says. ""Given we often regulate our consumption in units such as one slice of cake or one cup of coffee, if we perceive we have not had a full glass of wine, this might lead to us having another glass."" Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality?Find out how your drinking measures up to the average from countries around the world. Prof Marteau and her team conducted experiments in three Cambridge bars to test the theory. They increased glass sizes while leaving serving sizes the same. In two of the three bars, sales increased. In the 1700s, you may have drunk your wine from an enamelled Jacobite portrait glass like this While alcohol is the third leading risk factor for death and disability,externalafter smoking and obesity, according to Public Health England, levels of drinking have actually dropped in Britain. A 2016 poll of nearly 8,000 Britons found that just under 60% had had a drink in the past week- the lowest rate since the survey began, in 2005. Part of this could be down to a campaign to remove a billion units of alcohol from the market in various ways. Queensland police python photo gains internet fame Daredevil climber dies in China fall 'I was saved from a Â£10,000 car scam' However, there is a practical reason for serving wine in different size glasses - to affect its taste and quality. Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, told the BBC: ""Red wine, for example, is served in a larger glass to allow it to breathe, something which perhaps wasn't a priority 300 years ago. ""It is widely recognised that moderate and responsible consumption of alcohol is compatible with a healthy lifestyle."" Mr Beale added that in the past decade, ""volume sales of wine in Britain have declined by 6%, and the volume of wine consumed per person has dropped 10%"". Seven standard 175ml glasses of wine is the weekly recommended limit Rosanna O'Connor, director of alcohol and drugs at Public Health England, told the BBC: ""It's important people understand how much alcohol is in what they drink, some glasses of wine can contain as many as three units. ""We recommend people try to follow the advice of the UK Chief Medical Officers and not to drink regularly more than 14 units a week.""

"This video can not be played Fly-tipping is on the increase but prosecutions are down in England The number of successful prosecutions brought by councils against fly-tippers has fallen to a record low, government figures show. Local authorities in England secured 1,571 fly-tipping prosecutions in 2016-17, compared to 2,209 in 2007-08, a fall of about a fifth. The government says councils now have more powers to fine fly-tippers. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, wants to see a ""more effective legal system"". There were more thanone million fly-tipping incidents in Englandin 2016-17, equivalent to 114 every hour according to figures published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Whilst the number of fly-tipping incidents has been increasing, the number of successful criminal prosecutions has fallen to a record low. In comparison, a change in the law has seen the number of fixed penalty notices issued to fly-tippers has more than doubled, with 55,997 notices being handed out in 2016-17 across England. Paul Castle, the service director for Barnsley Council, said cuts to council budgets and the introduction of fixed penalty notices means local authorities can now take a different approach. ""We have to clear up 400 tons of fly-tipped waste every year which costs us Â£300,000 a year. I don't think trying to take every fly-tipper to court works very well. We have a limited amount of time and money and I would say in lots of cases fining people is proving to be an effective deterrent"".

""Clearing up fly-tipping is costing councils more than Â£57m a year, money that could be spent on other services, like caring for the elderly, protecting children or tackling homelessness"". He continued: ""The government has responded to our call for councils to be able to apply fixed penalty notices for small scale fly-tipping - and this is a big step in the right direction. ""When they take offenders to court, councils need a faster and more effective legal system which means fly-tippers are given hard-hitting fines for more serious offences"". A Defra spokesman said: ""Fly-tipping is an unacceptable blight on our landscape, which is why we have cracked down on offenders by working with the Sentencing Council to strengthen sentencing guidelines and given councils the powers to hand out on-the-spot fines to fly-tippers. ""We have made it easier for vehicles suspected of being used for fly-tipping to be stopped, searched and seized and will continue to work with local partners to stop this inexcusable crime.""

"Lia Pearson died in hospital A three-year-old girl has become the fourth child to die after a house fire which also killed three of her siblings. Lia Pearson was left critically ill after the blaze in Walkden, Salford, on Monday. She died in hospital. Demi, 15, died at the scene on Jackson Street. Her brother and sister, Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, died later in hospital. Their mother Michelle, 35, remains under sedation. Posting on Facebook, Sandra Lever, who described Lia as her ""beautiful granddaughter"", said she ""had passed away peacefully"". Two people have been charged with the murder of the three older children. Zac Bolland, 23, and Courtney Brierley, 20, both of Worsley, Salford, were also charged with arson and four counts of attempted murder.

"This video can not be played What the Alabama upset will mean for Donald Trump's agenda US President Donald Trump has distanced himself from Roy Moore after the Republican suffered a historic defeat for the party in conservative Alabama. The victory for Democrat Doug Jones narrows the Republican majority in the Senate to 51-49, which could complicate Mr Trump's legislative plans. Mr Moore's campaign was rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct made by several women, which he denied. Mr Jones is the first Democrat to win a US Senate seat for Alabama in 25 years. Donald Trump tumbles to earth with a bump Republicans ponder 'humbling' result Despite top Republicans deserting ultra-conservative Mr Moore amid claims of child molestation, the US president had offered his full endorsement. Mr Trump even recorded an automated phone message for the embattled Senate candidate in the days leading up to the election. In his first reaction on Twitter,,externalMr Trump congratulated the Democratic victor Mr Jones. But he went on to remind his followers that he initially supported Mr Moore's mainstream Republican opponent, Luther Strange, in the party's primary election. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Jones added that he has not yet spoken to Mr Moore. ""I'm going to let him make that decision,"" he said. The Alabama seat was made vacant by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this year. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Alabama will have a Democrat in the US Senate. It's an outcome that seemed all but impossible a year ago and still seemed unlikely even as voters headed to the polls on Tuesday. The ramifications of this unexpected victory are clear. The Republican majority in the Senate will narrow, considerably improving the chances Democrats could gain control of the chamber in the 2018 mid-term elections. It could also be seen as a rebuke of President Donald Trump, who gave full-throated support to Roy Moore even when other leaders in his party were hesitant. After winning governor races in Virginia and New Jersey in November, some Democratic supporters will be hoping that an anti-Trump electoral wave is forming. But Mr Moore was such a flawed candidate that it may be too early to tell. Read more from Anthony Mr Jones won with 49.9% of the vote, to Mr Moore's 48.4%. All votes from precincts around the state have been counted. Mr Moore has refused to concede, with the 70-year-old former judge telling supporters ""realise that when the vote is this close that it's not over"".

But Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, quoted by the Washington Post, said a recount could still be ordered if a review of write-in votes and overseas ballots narrowed it to within this range.

He has never held elected office. Who is Alabama Democrat Doug Jones? Although, the election narrows the already slender Republican majority, Luther Strange - the Republican appointed to replace Mr Sessions as an interim senator in February - is likely to remain in the seat until January. This means the party will still have time to pass its tax-cut bill and vote on any year-end budgetary resolutions, but after that the window for legislative success narrows considerably, says the BBC's Anthony Zurcher.

" Warning: This article contains content that some readers may find distressing The fire at Grenfell Tower in west London on 14 June killed scores of people and left the block a charred ruin. It stands as a reminder of one of the most tragic days in modern British history. Each floor of the tower tells a story - about London and its inhabitants, about immigration and gentrification, about lives lived and tragically lost. It was a microcosm of life in the capital. Like most of Grenfell, the 21st floor housed four two-bedroom flats and two one-bedroom flats arranged around a central hallway, with the lifts on one side and the staircase on the other. We used to play in the hallways because it was pretty big. We’d play football. And ‘it’. We had a nice little group on that floor” Marcio Gomes, former Grenfell Tower resident Marcio and Andreia Gomes, both 38, are originally from Portugal.  Marcio’s parents moved to the UK in search of a better life when he was five. He grew up in west London near Grenfell Tower.  Andreia arrived from Madeira when she was 21, looking for a change of scene. She had come on holiday to England every year with her family. The couple lived with their daughters, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. They’d moved into their council flat 10 years before, but still considered themselves “babies in the tower - a lot of friends had been there 20 years plus”. They loved life in the tower - the amazing views of London and the close-knit community. Marcio Gomes “It was great.  The rooms were big,” says Marcio. “There were kids on every floor, of all different ages. The corridor space in between the flats, even though it was very small, they would play tag, or ride their scooters or play football. We’ve seen a lot of those kids grow up and become young women and men, and move on and get a job.” He works in IT and Andreia is a supervisor in a clothes shop. Seven months pregnant at the time of the fire, she was about to go on maternity leave.  Their son was to be called Logan. They believe that, since the fire, Grenfell has too often been portrayed in a one-dimensional way, as a place full of poor people, living on benefits, but they point out the majority were working. Before the fire, Marcio had done some renovations in preparation for Logan’s arrival, transforming a recessed storage area into a snug nursery. His daughters shared a big bedroom and were making plans to welcome their new brother.  “They were very excited,” says Marcio. “The diversity was great, you’d meet all sorts of different people – Irish, English, Arabic, Muslim, Portuguese, Spanish, Italians. You’d get to see different cultures.  You’d go up in the lift with lots of different people, you’d talk, the kids would play. The tower itself was a community, it was very family orientated.  It’s been portrayed as a poor tower, a broken tower.  It was far from that.” On the night of the fire, the Gomes family had been out for dinner, but had been asleep for several hours when they were woken up by Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya, 12, who lived across the corridor in Flat 186. Helen and Lulya had already tried to get out of the building and had met the El Wahabis from flat 182 on the way. By the time they knocked on the Gomeses' door, it was between 01:30 and 02:00. “[Helen] was panicking a little bit.  I closed the door to stop the smoke.  It was already thick, black smoke,” says Marcio. These two families - the Gomes family of four with Helen, her daughter, Lulya, and two dogs - spent the next two terrifying hours waiting as smoke started to fill the flat. Marcio filled the bath with water and ran the shower.  With all the windows open, the two families stayed low to the ground to try to keep beneath the smoke. All of the adults had conversations with the emergency services and were told to stay put, that firefighters would come to rescue them. They had friends outside the tower who were watching the building burn and were calling them to say they must get out, including Miguel and Fatima Alves who lived on the 13th floor.  They’re also from Portugal and Miguel and Marcio play football together every week. Once the Alves family had escaped from the building, they began to call Marcio to tell him he must get his family out. Tension grew as the fire spread and people became trapped by dense smoke, especially those residents on the top floors of the tower. “I’m very religious and I kneeled down and I begged our lady of Fatima to protect them, to protect everybody in the building, but especially them because they are Portuguese and we knew them,"" says Fatima Alves. Helen was increasingly anxious. “At one point I think I asked one of my friends, ‘Can we speak to the fire people or the police you know?’ And she let me talk to them and we asked them, ‘What shall we do?’ And they say to us, ‘Someone is going to come and take you out,’” says Helen. “That's what they say to us from two to three o'clock. So we've been waiting and waiting and waiting. And then we call again and we asked them. And they said, ‘No, stay in, do not come out. Don't come out, don't come out.’” So the Gomes family and the Gebremeskels waited. At about 03:30, Marcio and Andreia’s bedroom caught fire. “My room is on fire.  Just like that.  My curtains are on fire.  My Moses basket is on fire.  All that side of the window is on fire,” says Marcio. “I looked at them and I said, ‘We have to go now.  There’s no turning back.  It’s now or never.’” Marcio tied wet tea towels around everyone's faces, wrapped wet sheets around them and gave specific instructions about the order in which they should leave.  They began the descent in the pitch black, gagging as they attempted to get down 21 floors of smoke-filled stairs. They found themselves treading on the dead and the dying - other Grenfell residents who, like them, had tried to get out of the building before passing out on the stairs. “We were just going, just going and going, because if we don’t keep going, we’re going to die,” says Helen. Helen, Andreia and Megan, who were at the front, managed to get out.  But when they turned around, Marcio, Luana and Lulya weren’t behind them.  The girls had been overcome by smoke at about the 10th floor and Marcio was desperately trying to find them in the darkness. ""I said, 'I’m here, follow my voice.’ I tried to climb up. She said, ‘I can’t, Dad.’ Then she didn’t talk any more. The smoke was so heavy you couldn’t see.  I kept trying to shout, ‘I’m waiting.’” Marcio saw a light. Two firefighters were on their way upstairs.  They rescued the girls and brought them down to safety. All three children and Andreia Gomes were put into induced comas and treated for cyanide poisoning.  Logan, the Gomeses’ son-to-be, was stillborn in hospital.  It has been difficult to cope with his death - and the deaths of other close friends and neighbours. Andreia Gomes “To me, it’s like yesterday.  Sleeping is horrible.  It’s good to talk about it.  We do that every day,” says Andreia. Marcio is angry that concerns about safety were ignored by the council and the tenants' management organisation before the fire. “Yes, it was an accident, but it could have been avoided.  The residents never wanted cladding, we wanted sprinklers.  We said to them many times it didn’t feel safe after the regeneration work they spent three years doing.  They kept saying, ‘Be quiet, it’s fine.’” But Marcio and Andreia are clear they don’t blame the firefighters for any of what happened. And they are intensely grateful to the two who picked their way through the darkness to rescue Luana and Lulya. The London Fire Brigade rescued 65 people during the fire. Due to ongoing investigations and the public inquiry, it says it cannot go into details of what happened on the night. Now the Gomes family home is just ash.  Detectives showed them a 360-degree view of the flat. “It’s pretty much all gone. The only thing that remained was the metal frames of the beds,” says Marcio.  “There’s a huge crack in the floor.  The fire must have been so intense in that area.  It was difficult for me and my wife to see, but it was important, to close that chapter in the book.” Both the dogs that the Gomeses and Gebremeskels tried to rescue died - after the girls passed out, both dogs ran back to their flats. As for the material possessions they have lost, though everything is gone, it’s the sentimental things “you can’t put a price on” that are missed. “The first thing I thought of was the nursery books my daughters had done, and pictures of course,” says Andreia. “I had photos of my mum who passed away.  The negatives were there, but we lost them as well.” Three months on from the fire, the family are still living in a hotel. They’ve only been shown one potential new flat in all that time and the strain is beginning to show. Marcio believes they can rebuild their lives. “We have to for the sake of the girls,” says Andreia. But they are haunted by what happened and by the fine line between death and survival. “I am not sleeping too well at the moment and that’s because all those things keep running through my head,” says Marcio. But his actions on the night were key to their escape.  He was calm and organised, filling the bath, wetting towels, giving clear instructions to the others about how they might make it out of the building.  Six of the seven people who escaped from the 21st floor that night did so under his guidance. Helen Gebremeskel Born in Ethiopia, Helen Gebremeskel, 45, came to the UK as a political asylum seeker when she was a child.  She moved into Grenfell Tower 20 years ago. For 17 years she lived in a one-bedroom council flat and then in 2014 she moved down a floor, to the two-bed council flat on the 21st floor she shared with her daughter Lulya – Flat 186. “It was a very special building, Grenfell Tower, very special,” says Helen. Lulya misses the flat. “Like when I walk through, I open the door and I hear my dog bark.  And then I miss my friends that I would play with.” Lulya: “I miss my friends” Helen’s flat was painstakingly decorated - a haven of white with a few splashes of purple in the form of cushions and carpet. She was proud of the home she’d created with its corner sofa in the living room, its large television and its designed feel. “It was very nice.  Whoever comes in that house is shocked.  It was a beautiful house.  The living room was very big.  And the kitchen, it’s very big.  I have never seen a council flat that big.” Off the entrance corridor, Helen had created a prayer room - a quiet place for someone with a hectic working life. Every day Helen went to the beauty salon she ran in west London. “I’m always working, I always go home late.  The only day I have a day off is Sunday which is to spend time with my daughter.” Helen was always close to her neighbours, the Gomes family. Lulya often spent time with their daughters. The night of the fire began like many other evenings for the family in Grenfell.  Lulya had a shower and watched a movie while Helen cooked their dinner.  They ate together and then went to bed.  But Helen was woken just before 01:30 by her fire alarm and immediately smelled smoke.  When she looked out of her kitchen window, she could see the fire. She woke Lulya, who grabbed their dog, and they tried to go down the staircase. That attempt failed but ultimately they were to be successful. Helen talks wistfully of the community she’s lost. “It’s my home. I know a lot of the people there, my neighbours, and everyone there.   When you live somewhere for 20 years, it’s your home. It’s very difficult for us.” As well as her neighbours on the 21st floor, her best friends in the tower were the Choucair family - Nadia Choucair, her husband Bassem and their three children, Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab who was three.  They lived on the 22nd floor and were her neighbours for 17 years. Helen spoke to them a lot on the night of the fire as they sheltered in their flat one floor up. “The last time I called them and I say to them, ‘You need to get out, you need to get out.  No-one’s coming to rescue us, you need to get out.’ I explained to them, ‘Just cover them with a wet towel, just wet it and just get out.’ I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for Marcio. Her husband Bassem was crying.  He was crying and that was the last time I spoke to them.” Helen is devastated by their loss. “It’s very emotional, thinking you’ve got friends there who support you, is always there with you, you know. And then, all of a sudden, they’re not there.” Flat 182 was the home of NHS worker Abdulaziz El Wahabi, 52, and charity volunteer Faouzia El Wahabi, 42. They lived with their children Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 15, and Mehdi, eight. Abdulaziz worked long hours as a hospital porter. He was dedicated, with a great sense of fun, says his brother-in-law Chris Jones. “You have to have a sense of humour to work in the NHS.  He never complained, he got on with the job.  Being a porter, you’re someone who goes to the operating theatre, to X-rays.  It’s a very important job - you just don’t get well paid for it.” Abdulaziz at work in University College Hospital Faouzia volunteered at the Westway Trust, teaching people to knit and crochet. She was also an involved parent at her youngest son’s school. “His mum always came on our visits. She’d accompany the class.  The children got to know her very well.  She had a wonderful smile.  She was a lovely lady,” says Sara Cooper, head teacher at the Oxford Gardens primary school. Originally from the harbour town of Larache in northern Morocco, Abdulaziz moved to the UK when he was nine.  His father, who was also a hospital porter, came on a visit to London and liked it so much, he stayed and got a job.  Soon after, he brought his family over to live with him.  His son, Abdulaziz, had two brothers and six sisters who all live in Britain. Abdulaziz and Faouzia had three children, all born in the UK. The family moved to Grenfell  shortly after the birth of their oldest son Yasin, 20 years ago. “That flat was their home.  It was like they took Morocco and it was in the flat,” says Chris Jones. Flat 182 was full of Moroccan artefacts including carpets and ceramics gathered on the family’s trips back to north Africa. There were Moroccan paintings on the walls and mirrors with Moroccan frames. There was even a miniature electrically operated water fountain with ceramic tiles. “Abdulaziz loved plants,” says sister Hanan Wahabi, who lived in another part of the tower. “He had a range of plants and he took pride in how much they would grow. “Abdulaziz and Faouzia were both proud of their children and liked having their photos displayed showing the progression of how they had grown.” The couple had just finished redecorating their bedroom. They changed the flooring from carpet to laminate wood and bought new cupboards and drawers from Ikea which the older two children helped to put together. The oldest child, Yasin, was studying accountancy part-time at Greenwich University.  He’d also completed a course as a referee at football tournaments, worked in Subway and helped one of his uncles on his stall in Portobello market selling Moroccan rugs. “Yasin was a grafter.  He had lots of friends.  Everybody loved Yasin,” says Chris. Yasin on holiday in Morocco Nur Huda, their only daughter, was described by her teachers at Holland Park School as a “warm and good-spirited 15-year-old”. She loved playing football. Nur Huda had finished some of her GCSEs just before the fire. Her aunt, Hanan, picked up the results when they came.  Nur Huda got an A in additional science and Bs in core science, history, PE, maths, English language and literature. “Her parents would have been proud of her,” says Hanan. Nur Huda was taking her GCSEs in June Eight-year-old Mehdi was in year three at Oxford Gardens Primary School.  A keen judo fan, his friends made a collage to describe him.  It included the words “funny”, “loving”, “warm”, “beautiful person”. Mehdi, dressed for World Book Day The El Wahabis, the Gomes family say, were at the heart of the 21st floor community.   The children were in and out of each other’s homes and the adults often knocked on each other’s doors for a chat or to borrow something when they’d run out.  Faouzia’s generosity stands out. “I remember one Christmas, she came to knock on our door, with this huge chicken.  She said, ‘This is for you, it’s Christmas,’” says Andreia Gomes. On the night of the fire, the El Wahabis ate together as a family.  It was Ramadan and Yasin went to the mosque to perform the specific prayer that follows the fast.  He then went out with some cousins and friends to an American diner in west London before returning home.  Abdulaziz and the rest of the family stayed and prayed in their flat.  Nur Huda was revising for her GCSE exams. Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya saw the El Wahabis at about 01:30 as they all tried to escape the building.  But as they attempted to go downstairs, they were turned back by other Grenfell residents who were coming up the staircase. “People were telling us to go back up.  Because the firefighters had told them to go back up, to go to the top,” says Lulya. Relatives of the El Wahabis spoke to them by phone that night. Abdulaziz’s sister Hanan lived with her family on the ninth floor.  She escaped from the building at about 01:20 and then spoke to her brother at 01:25.  He said he was going to try and get out with his family.  They spoke again at about 01:30 and Abdulaziz told her they hadn’t been able to get out because it was pitch black and they were struggling to breathe outside the flat. When Hanan called again, the family said they’d been told by the emergency services to stay put and await rescue.  Another sister spoke to Faouzia El Wahabi at about 02:00.  Faouzia told her that the emergency services had advised the family to move into the bedroom and put towels under the door. Chris Jones and his wife also spoke to Abdulaziz that night. “He said, ‘There’s a lot of smoke, we’re not leaving.’  After that, that was it.  We tried ringing and ringing, but there was no answer,” says Chris. “I’ve thought a few times about being put in the position where you’ve made a decision for the family around you.  The last thing you would do is what we call the Shahada [prayer]. They would have got comfort out of that.” The surviving relatives have endured a long wait to find the remains of their loved ones.  All five members of the family - Abdulaziz, Faouzia, Yasin, Nur Huda and Mehdi - have now been identified in the flat.  Relatives received the news about Nur Huda only in the middle of September. The tragedy of the family’s demise has rippled out into the community. Head teacher Sara Cooper had to break the news to Mehdi’s class. “It was incredibly hard.  There was lots of sobbing, but I think it was important because they were ready – they were at the point where they could cry, because of all the amazing work their teachers had done. We all cried together.” A week after the fire, University College Hospital paid tribute to its missing porter.  The chief executive, Marcel Levi, said: “Abdulaziz is an extremely dedicated and hugely popular member of staff.  He is a larger than life character who never fails to show kindness and compassion to patients and colleagues.” Chris Jones is still trying to deal with what has happened. “If there was a good way to die, it would be among people who loved you and cared for you and would do anything on this earth to be with you.” “I can’t believe we won’t see them any more,” says Andreia Gomes. “The youngest one used to come and knock on our door every Sunday to play with our youngest. She used to go there as well to have dinner with them.  We used to see them every day, if not one of the children then the mum or dad.  I think I’m still just expecting to bump into one of them in the road.” Only 14 flats in Grenfell Tower were not in council hands - two were owned by housing associations and 12 had private owners. One of those was on the 21st floor. Flat 185 had been bought from the council in 2000 under right- to-buy rules by its tenant, Nigerian-born Tunde Adoweru. He had moved out a few years before and begun to rent out his property. The listing on the rental website described “a fabulous, bright two-bedroom flat, with panoramic views of London landmarks - 77 square metres in size, includes a contemporary fully fitted kitchen and open plan living room, two double bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, limestone bathroom and separate toilet.” Management consultant Julian Ng, 30, and IT platforms engineer Lee Stewart, 29, both British-born, had moved in 11 days before the fire. Their rent was more than £400 a week.  But the flat’s spacious rooms, chrome kitchen and surround sound stereo system immediately attracted them. “When you stepped into the flat itself, it was beautiful, tasteful, modern and because it was on the 21st floor, it had amazing views,” says Julian. “How do you describe London?  It’s very diverse.  And that’s what we got from this place.  It was a very nice place to live in.” Lee also liked the building. “It’s been painted as a very, kind of, poverty-stricken building.  Maybe parts of it were.  But that’s not the impression we had when viewing it.” The couple had started to plan for dinner parties. “We had a huge glass dining table, loads of windows.  You could take advantage of the views from so high up,” says Lee. They had a lucky escape on the night of the fire.  It was Lee’s birthday.  Julian was away for work and had invited his partner to spend the night in his hotel. They heard about the fire when their landlord called them at about 03:00. They watched the blaze on TV, horrified by what was happening and wondering about their new neighbours. “My last morning in there, I was late for work, it was 8.55.  The lifts took a really long time to get down - they were stopping at most floors and kids were piling in, going to the school just outside.  There were so many families and children in there.  You have a hazy memory of who you’ve seen, knowing not all of them will be OK,” says Lee. Julian and Lee have had moments of overwhelming sadness. “There’s a huge sense of loss,” says Lee. “It was my first night away from the flat.  I should have been home.  If I had been, when would I have heard?  Would I have been able to get out?  Would I have got messages to my family?  I keep thinking about the ‘what ifs’.  We were very lucky.” The couple have lost all their possessions and, like the Gomes family, it’s the more personal belongings that matter. “I had a stupid plant I carried around for 10 years,” says Lee. “It had a name, it is really daft. I’m terrible at gardening and can’t keep anything alive.  But this plant lived for 10 years.  It’s just stuff like that that’s irreplaceable.” Julian lost old photos from university and childhood.  “One of the things Lee liked was a T-shirt I had.  That’s lost.  OK, I can replace it, but not that specific T-shirt. [Or] the cuddly toy you had for 10 years.” Ligaya Moore’s friend, Nenita Bungay In one of the one-bedroom flats lived Ligaya Moore, who came to Britain from the Philippines about 45 years ago. Her friend Nenita Bungay says Ligaya had always dreamed of living in the UK. She came to work as a nanny and later was a waitress, and had married a British man, James Moore.  He died of cancer a decade ago and Ligaya, by then retired, continued to live in their council flat.  She was a keen ballroom dancer back in the day. A photo of Ligaya's wedding “She was an active person, she loved to dance, even at her age.  That’s why she loved our church because she loved dancing,” says Pastor Emil from the Jesus is Lord Church. Ligaya was well known to her neighbours on the 21st floor. “She was always sweet after school, because sometimes I’d come home by myself.  I’d see her in the lift and she would always offer me a sweet,” says Lulya. “She was lovely, she always played with the kids.  She was 80, something like that I think, and she used to use the stairs for exercise!  It was amazing.  From the 21st floor to the ground is a lot of steps,” says Marcio Gomes. On the night of the fire, none of the surviving neighbours saw Ligaya at all. Nenita was the last person to see her. “We had a wonderful dinner that night.  She peeled avocado.  We had a wonderful salad.  I brought some porridge.  She brought chocolate.  She was so happy.” After the meal, they went their separate ways at about 22:30.  Nenita got a call that night from another friend to say Ligaya’s building was on fire. “I call her every minute, no answer,” says Nenita. Nenita Bungay hopes her friend died peacefully in her sleep “I am thinking she was in a deep sleep, maybe in a deep sleep and being suffocated with fire and smoke.” The police showed Nenita footage of Ligaya’s burnt- out flat. “The ceiling, the walls, everything is rubble… everything is collapsed. The bed is only coils, the fridge is only a skeleton.” Forensic teams have located human remains inside Ligaya’s flat.  They haven’t yet been identified as hers. Very sadly, on 14 June, rescue never came for Ligaya Moore, or the El Wahabis in flat 182. Their neighbours will never forget them. “We used to see them every day,” says Andreia Gomes. “I can’t believe I won’t see them any more.” The occupant of Flat 184, who escaped the fire, chose not to take part in this report. Apart from the permanent residents, there have been reports of a woman from the Philippines, illegally in Britain, who claimed to live on the 21st floor. On contacting her, she said she was homeless and had spent time between two flats in Grenfell Tower - sometimes staying on the 21st floor but not on the night of the fire. She chose not to take part in this report. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9999999
"Hotel living has been a struggle, says Mohammed Rasoul It is only when you walk through the door of the hotel room that you even begin to understand what life has been like for so many of the survivors, six months on from the Grenfell fire. Stacked along a short corridor, past the wardrobe and door to the bathroom, they've piled up cases and boxes. Clothes on top. It's tidy, but a squeeze. This is the room that grandpa sleeps in. Then through the door into the adjoining room. You can't open it fully because of the single camp bed on the other side. Push through, however, and you're in another room, the same size. The single bed is for dad - Mohammed. A double is shared by mum, son and daughter. They are five and two years old respectively, and there's little space in which to play. They say there's nowhere for Mohammed's wife Munira to cook, so most of the time they get take-away meals. The plastic boxes are stacked up neatly on the side, ready to be washed. For the last six months this is how the Rasoul family has lived. ""It's a struggle,"" says the father, Mohammed Rasoul. ""At first, immediately after the fire you think, 'Oh, OK, hotels, we'll be comfortable for a while.' But the novelty soon wears off when you realise it's the place you're going to be living in. ""It comes to the point where you feel like a prisoner living in here."" Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Residents of the 21st floor Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Mohammed's father had lived in the Grenfell tower for 37 years. Now 86, he has vascular dementia, and he's confused. They have been offered a new home, but not close to where they used to live. ""All we want is to be rehoused in the same area. We want to be there back in the community, with our friends, my son's school,"" he says. Take the underground from the stop close to Mohammed's hotel, change at Notting Hill, and in half an hour you can be at another hotel, which is currently home to Rashida Ali and her 10-year-old daughter Hayam. The council needs to find homes for 208 Grenfell families ""I have lots of nightmares. Sometimes I cry in the middle of the night and wake my mum and she calms me down and she says 'Don't worry, at least we're safe.' ""I don't feel safe when I'm by myself or like in a closed room and there's no escape next to me. I just feel I can't breathe."" Hayam and her mother are about to move into temporary accommodation. Rashida didn't want that initially, because she preferred not to have to uproot them twice. But she's decided to move, for her daughter's benefit. ""She needs to pack her stuff everyday, open suitcase, close suitcase, tidy up because this is not our home. We live in a hotel but it feels like we are homeless."" Like many she says she doesn't trust the council to deliver on their promise to move people into permanent homes when a suitable one comes up. ""The system keeps changing,"" she says. ""I'm worried if I sign this (temporary accommodation contract) in a few months I'm not going to be allowed to move out."" Most of those made homeless by the fire are still in hotels - 28 of them are families with children. The council wants to move people out into temporary flats. The Alves family has taken up the offer. Miguel Alves says it allows them ""to have a family life, to have meals together."" Miguel Alves: ""Nobody answers my emails."" Miguel was one of the few leaseholders in the Grenfell Tower - he bought his flat in 2001 - and had 15 years of his mortgage left to pay. That adds another layer of complication. Despite all he's gone through, he says he's having to fight to get the council to accept his demand that the new home he eventually moves into will be the same size with the same number of bedrooms as his Grenfell flat. ""I asked for a meeting, and they take one week, nobody answers my emails."" This lack of communication isn't a one off. At a recent council meeting one woman - Lidia, whose elderly mother lived on the top floor and who survived because she was away that night - said she had had 11 different housing officers assigned to her in the last six months. Lidia's hands and legs were shaking uncontrollably with stress as she spoke. Many say the delays and uncertainty are taking a mental toll. Any local authority would be stretched by the task that faces Kensington and Chelsea Council. It needs to find homes for 208 households. It has set aside Â£235m to do that. It takes time to buy properties. Lawyers representing the former residents are striving to ensure that the new tenancy agreements and leaseholds match exactly the terms and conditions people had in Grenfell. The council's director of housing, Maxine Holdsworth, says she ""gets a huge amount of positive feedback about our frontline housing officers and how supportive they've been"". What then about the charges that officers change, that communications are difficult? ""Every single household has their own dedicated housing officer,"" she replies.  ""I would be confident that if someone rang up today their call would be answered they would get to speak to their housing officer."" The deputy leader of the council admitted last week that he felt embarrassed about the speed of the rehousing process. Back down the Tube line, in the Rasoul family's hotel room they are keeping their spirits up, somehow. ""I'm OK,"" says Mohammed. ""I have my moments, but there's so much that needs to be dealt with, so many things going on. ""It's not just our housing issues, it's our personal issues, living here. No personal space, the kids have to go to sleep at certain times, lights out for the children. But we stay positive."" And when he thinks about the home that he has lost? ""All my childhood memories, moments of happiness, laughter, food being enjoyed, my children being born there. I dare not delve into it too much, I know that will just break me.""

"This video can not be played There were cheers from the opposition benches as the result was announced The government has been narrowly defeated in a key vote on its Brexit bill after a rebellion by 11 Tory MPs. In a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May, MPs voted to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. The government had argued this would jeopardise its chances of delivering a smooth departure from the EU. Despite a last-minute attempt to offer concessions to rebels, an amendment to the bill was backed by 309 to 305. Ministers said the ""minor setback"" would not prevent the UK leaving the EU in 2019. As it happened - government loses Brexit vote What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do MEPs vote on Brexit: What we learned Of the Conservative MPs who voted against the government, eight are former ministers. One of them, Stephen Hammond, was sacked as Conservative vice chairman in the aftermath of the vote. ""Tonight I put country and constituency before party and voted with my principles to give Parliament a meaningful vote,"" he tweeted. The government said it was ""disappointed"" at losing - its first defeat on Brexit - despite the ""strong assurances"" it had offered. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the defeat was ""a humiliating loss of authority"" for Mrs May on the eve of an EU summit where leaders will discuss Brexit. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It's the first time that Theresa May has been defeated on her own business in the Commons. She has to front up in Brussels tomorrow with other EU leaders only hours after an embarrassing loss in Parliament. Beyond the red faces in government tonight, does it really matter? Ministers tonight are divided on that. Two cabinet ministers have told me while it's disappointing it doesn't really matter in the big picture. It's certainly true that the Tory party is so divided over how we leave the EU that the Parliamentary process was always going to be very, very choppy. But another minister told me the defeat is ""bad for Brexit"" and was openly frustrated and worried about their colleagues' behaviour. Read the rest of Laura's blog During the debate Conservative MPs from both sides of the Brexit debate clashed The defeat came after opposition parties joined forces with Conservative rebels during a heated debate in the Chamber on the amendment. Critics accused those behind the amendment - which was authored by former attorney general Dominic Grieve and championed by other pro-Remain campaigners - of trying to ""frustrate"" Brexit and tying the government's hands. After the result was announced, one of the rebels, former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, tweeted: ""Tonight Parliament took control of the EU Withdrawal process."" But other Conservative MPs reacted angrily, with one, Nadine Dorries, saying the rebels should be deselected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Tory rebels were Mr Grieve, Heidi Allen, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Stephen Hammond, Sir Oliver Heald, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. Another Conservative MP, John Stevenson, abstained by voting in both lobbies. Two Labour MPs, Frank Field and Kate Hoey, voted with the government. This video can not be played Is it game over for Brexit? The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what their relationship will be like in the future. The EU Withdrawal Bill is a key part of the government's exit strategy. Its effects include ending the supremacy of EU law and copying existing EU law into UK law, so that the same rules and regulations apply on Brexit day. MPs have been making hundreds of attempts to change its wording - but this is the first time one has succeeded. Unless the government manages to overturn it further down the line, it means a new Act of Parliament will have to be passed before ministers can implement the withdrawal deal struck with Brussels. Ministers had made several efforts to placate the Conservative rebels, and argued that Mr Grieve's amendment would put unnecessary time pressure on the government if talks with the EU continued until the last minute. They had already promised a vote on the final deal and to enshrine the withdrawal agreement in an Act of Parliament. But critics demanded a guarantee of a ""meaningful vote"" before the deal is agreed. They said the wording of the bill would allow ministers to bypass Parliament in implementing what is agreed with Brussels. And minutes before the vote, they offered a last-minute promise of action at a later stage of the bill's journey through Parliament. Some Conservatives said this had changed their minds but Mr Grieve said it was ""too late"". Speaking afterwards, the government said: ""We are disappointed that Parliament has voted for this amendment despite the strong assurances that we have set out. ""We are as clear as ever that this bill, and the powers within it, are essential. ""This amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day. We will now determine whether further changes are needed to the Bill to ensure it fulfils its vital purpose."" Justice Minister Dominic Raab said the defeat would not hold up the Brexit process. ""It's a setback but it's a fairly minor setback, it won't frustrate the Brexit process,"" he said, adding: ""It's not going to stop us leaving the EU in March 2019."" Mr Corbyn said ""Parliament has asserted itself"" amid a ""power grab"" by the prime minister. The European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt tweeted: ""British Parliament takes back control. European and British Parliament together will decide on the final agreement. Interests of the citizens will prevail over narrow party politics. A good day for democracy.""

"Theresa May must urgently agree a transitional deal with EU counterparts, say MPs An influential group of MPs has urged Britain and the European Union to agree a ""status quo"" transition period following Britain's departure from the EU. The Treasury Select Committee said that the temporary arrangement should be agreed as quickly as possible to ease business concerns over a ""no deal"" Brexit. The committee's report said it ""strongly supported"" the prime minister's push for a comprehensive free trade deal which would keep borders as ""frictionless"" as possible. But it said in order to reach that point, an implementation period would be necessary where the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was likely to retain supremacy over UK laws. ""An agreement between the UK and EU27 on 'standstill' transitional arrangements is now urgent,"" said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative chairwoman of the committee who campaigned for Remain before the referendum. ""The consequences of failing to reach an agreement are dramatic and damaging."" Fears grow across the Atlantic over Brexit fallout Did 'soft Brexit' just win? Failure to plan for post-Brexit borders is 'reckless' ""Many businesses will begin to prepare for a 'no deal' outcome - moving jobs and activity, and incurring potentially unnecessary expenditure - early next year,"" said Ms Morgan. ""Transitional arrangements must therefore be straightforward enough to negotiate in a matter of weeks. ""This may well include accepting EU rules beyond those of the single market and customs union and it is likely to involve retaining, on a temporary basis, the jurisdiction of the ECJ, and the direct effect and supremacy of EU law. ""That is a price worth paying for stability and certainty after 30 March 2019."" The government has said that it may agree to a strictly time-limited implementation phase after Brexit. Britain would leave the EU customs union and the single market but would retain equivalent rules. Mrs May has argued that if there is an agreement with the EU, it may mean the UK ""will start off with the ECJ governing the rules that we are part of"". And in her Florence speech in September the prime minister said an implementation period could last two years. Nicky Morgan says transition arrangements should be negotiated ""in a matter of weeks"" Earlier this week, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said that there was now a ""furious race against time"" to negotiate implementation arrangements and the framework for a new free trade deal. ""We are ready to move to the second phase, which will expand discussions to cover transition and the framework for the future relationship,"" he said on Monday. The select committee said a transition deal could be followed by a further ""adaption period"" for some sectors such as financial services. ""The difference between a 'no-deal' scenario and the temporary preservation of the status quo is dramatic,"" said John Mann, a Labour member of the committee who supported Britain leaving the EU in the run up to the referendum. ""A 'no-deal' scenario would be damaging to both sides; a 'standstill' transition is in the interests of both the UK and the EU27."" ""In particular, a 'standstill' transition would mitigate the major risk that Her Majesty's Revenue and Custom's Customs Declarations Service [a new system for controlling the flow of goods across borders] is not ready in time for 30 March 2019. ""If this project were to fail, the committee remains to be convinced that contingency plans exist to avoid the severe disruption to goods that would occur in an unplanned 'no-deal' scenario."" Many members of the financial services sector also support an implementation period. Miles Celic, chief executive of the financial services sector lobby group TheCityUK, said that both sides would suffer if implementation arrangements were not agreed. ""Now that talks seem likely to move on to the second phase, EU and UK negotiators must not delay discussing a transitional deal,"" he said. It's not just London that would suffer without a transition, says Miles Celic ""The longer it takes, the less value it has. ""Many firms are already well underway with their contingency plans. ""Those which remain are ready to press 'go' early in the new year. ""There is still time to slow or adapt these plans, but without progress soon, it may be too late. ""This isn't just about business leaving the UK. ""It is about the very high risk of jobs, capital and inward investment leaving Europe. ""The resulting fragmented markets will be of benefit to no-one, with costs likely to increase for customers right across the continent.""

"Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen has raised interest rates three times this year The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.25%, the third rate rise in 2017. The US central bank said the move, which was widely expected, underscores ""solid"" gains in the US economy. Officials also boosted their economic forecasts, projecting 2.5% growth in GDP in 2017 and 2018, due in part to planned tax cuts. The Fed said it anticipates three further increases in rates next year, unchanged from its previous forecast. The decision to raise interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing, takes the Fed farther away from the ultra-low rates it put in place during the financial crisis to boost economic activity. The Fed is targeting a range of 1.25% to 1.5% for its benchmark rate. But a majority of officials said they expect interest rates above 2% will be appropriate next year. Republicans say tax deal agreed The perils of a political Federal Reserve Alabama election: Trump says Senate loss proves him right The shift in policy comes as the US economy gains strength. US economic output has increased at an annual rate of more than 3% in recent quarters, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% last month - the lowest rate since 2001. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who is stepping down from her post in February, said the economy, labour market and financial system have grown stronger under her watch. ""There's less to lose sleep about now than has been true for quite some time, so I feel good about the economic outlook,"" she said. Ms Yellen said policymakers expect the economy to get a further lift from a package of tax cuts - one of President Trump's central campaign promises - and those expectations were factored in when they revised upwards their predictions for economic growth. The Fed is now forecasting 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, compared to a forecast it made in September of 2.1%. While Congress and President Trump's Administration continue to wrangle over tax reform, the Fed had to judge what the final outcome of that political process would mean for the economy.  Inevitably there is a lot of uncertainty in there but they have concluded that it would provide a boost over the next three years. The Fed's policy makers expect somewhat stronger growth than they did in September.  Janet Yellen said that reflected a view in the committee that the reforms would stimulate consumer spending and business investment. But there has not been much change in what the Fed's policy makers think of the longer term prospects.  The Fed publishes information showing the range of expectations that its policy makers have. The middle of that range for long term growth is unchanged at a rather modest 1.8%. Despite the acceleration in growth, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee said they expect interest rate increases to remain gradual - in part, a sign of ongoing concerns that inflation has remained below the Fed's 2% target. Ms Yellen said she continues to believe the lacklustre inflation growth is due to one-off factors, such as declines in costs for mobile phone plans. But she said the Fed will continue to watch those numbers and ""if necessary, re-think"" what is determining them. ""There's work undone there,"" she said.

"University leaders have been under pressure over high salaries University leaders have agreed to a new code on senior pay, which is expected to be published in the next few weeks. University representatives held a meeting with minister Jo Johnson on Wednesday where they accepted the need for more accountability. It follows fierce criticism of university leaders over claims of excessive senior pay, withthe head of the University of Bath stepping down. Mr Johnson says ""public confidence"" over pay had to be restored. The universities minister met leaders of Universities UK, the Russell Group and the Committee of University Chairs - with Mr Johnson calling for more restraint over pay. It is understood that a ""fair remuneration code"" will be published in January for university leaders, by the Committee of University Chairs. Mr Johnson told university leaders that there must be a more transparent and independent system for the setting of senior salaries - and an end to the ""upwards ratchet in pay"". He set out a series of requirements, including that vice chancellors must not sit on the committee that decides their pay. Jo Johnson has told universities they need to restore public confidence There will also have to be disclosure of benefits, such as subsidised housing and expenses. The size of pay gaps between university heads and academic staff will also have to be published. ""It is vital that pay arrangements command public confidence and deliver value for money for students and taxpayers,"" said Mr Johnson. Universities, under increasing public pressure and protests from their own academic staff, say they also want to ""rebuild public confidence"". ""We agree more needs to be done to ensure the process for deciding senior pay is viewed as open and accountable,"" a Russell Group spokesperson said. The group of leading universities says it is backing ""a new code to ensure pay-setting arrangements are as rigorous and transparent as they can be"". Universities UK said ""competitive pay is necessary to attract first rate leaders"" but a new code would be a ""welcome step"". ""As universities receive funding from taxpayers and through student fees, it is reasonable to expect pay decisions to be fair, accountable and justified,"" said a Universities UK spokesman. Mr Johnson last week warned the university sector that it needed to get pay under control - and that a new regulator would be used to enforce this. There have been a series of protests over vice-chancellors' pay in recent weeks - including at the University of Bath, the University of Southampton and at Bath Spa. ""Has there been a problem? Most definitely,"" said Mr Johnson last week. But he said universities now recognised the need to answer public concerns about value for money. ""I think they really are starting to get it.""
