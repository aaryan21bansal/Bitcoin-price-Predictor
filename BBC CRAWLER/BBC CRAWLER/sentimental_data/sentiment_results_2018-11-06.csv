"This video can not be played Social workers on the hardest part of their job A steep rise in vulnerable children needing protection over the past 10 years is pushing council children's services in England into crisis, suggests research. There has been a substantial increase in calls from the public and professionals worried about a child, according to a study for the Association of Directors of Children's Services. The number of investigations where a child is believed to be at risk of significant harm has also more than doubled. Over the past year, almost 2.4 million people contacted children's services because they were worried about a child - a 78% increase on 10 years ago, while serious investigations over concerns of significant harm are up from just under 77,000 in 2008 to almost 200,000 last year - a rise of 159%. Council leaders have warned they will have to overspend their budgets to meet demand,though the government says extra money was announced for children's services in the Budget and it is working with councils to ease the pressures and improve children's lives. So why are services designed to protect the most vulnerable children in society facing such a squeeze? The past decade has seen pressure increase across the board in the child protection system - the number of calls from people concerned about a child has nearly doubled. Some of that rise may be down to better awareness but there has also been a substantial increase in children placed on child protection plans, where social workers monitor the way a child is being looked after to keep them safe. The steepest rise has been in the most serious Section 47 investigations. These are carried out when there are fears that a child is at risk of significant harm. In such cases, the stakes couldn't be higher. Social workers, police and other agencies, involved in these investigations, will all remember the deaths of children such asVictoria ClimbiÃ© in 2000,externalandBaby Peter Connelly in 2007. Both were known by the authorities to be at risk but still died at the hands of people close to them. In nearly half of the cases, where social workers carry out an assessment, domestic violence is a factor. The next most common issue is mental health problems. Of the children then placed on child protection plans, the concern in most cases is that the child is being neglected. That is a failure to meet their basic needs, which could, for instance, mean they don't have enough food, the home is cold and they have nowhere to sleep. Throughout the era of austerity, while councils have made cuts elsewhere, they maintain they have tried to protect spending on children's services. But once inflation is taken into account, the money available to protect children has still fallen significantly. That combined with increasing demand and more complex cases has led to councils overspending their budget for children's services. With finances so tight, money has often been concentrated on statutory services, which protect children at risk of neglect or abuse. Councils under financial strain Funding of children's care services 'unsustainable' This has meant cuts to the early intervention teams, who might have been able to ease future pressures. In the last month's Budget, the government announced an extra Â£84m for children's services over five years. Finding and keeping front-line staff in this high-pressure world is a constant issue for local authorities. The most up-to-date figures show a slight increase in the number of social workers but a third will have been with their current local authority for less that two years and 15% will change jobs during the year. There are a high number of vacancies, with an average of 17% of posts empty. Many of these roles are taken on by the more than 5,300 agency social workers in the system but that comes at a cost. Agency staff are paid more than council staff andfigures collected by the BBC show between 2012-13 and 2016-17local authority spending on these temporary staff nearly doubled, reaching Â£356m. Council spent Â£6m on agency staff Abuse row council's staff bill hit Â£16m It is money cash-strapped councils can ill afford.  Even more importantly, frequent changes in social worker are damaging for a child. It is much harder to learn to trust the person there to help you, if they keep changing. Most children that social workers are involved with will remain with their families but the numbers removed from their home and taken into local authority care have risen by 24% in a decade. Of the more than 75,000 children looked after by the state, most will have faced abuse or neglect. Other reasons for a child being in care include family dysfunction or because their family is in acute distress. A small number of children will be there because of their disabilities. Most children in the care system are older, with the largest single group aged between 10 and 15. Boys are slightly more likely to be in care than girls. According to official statistics, an increase in the number of boys has largely been driven by a rise in unaccompanied asylum seeking children, who are more likely to be male. Although most children in care are white (75%), the slight over-representation of children from non-white backgrounds is also thought to reflect the rise in young asylum seekers. There is something of a North-South divide when it comes to the number of children looked after by councils. For instance, in Blackpool out of every 10,000 children there will be 184 in care. That compares with 34 in every 10,000 in Windsor and Maidenhead, part of the Prime Minister Theresa May's Berkshire constituency. Talk to social workers and many will say they are seeing families facing real financial hardship, with austerity and welfare cuts playing their part in pushing people into crisis. That's reflected by research that found children living in the poorest areas were at least 10 times more likely to be taken into care than those in the most affluent parts of the country. It is a pattern that is repeated across all the nations of the UK. TheChild Welfare Inequalities project,externalconcluded deprivation was the largest single factor in families becoming involved in child protection. In the most deprived areas about one child in every 60 was in care, compared with one in every 660 in the wealthiest areas. With poorer areas spending more money on those in care, the team also concluded these authorities had seen more cuts to preventative services. Nearly three-quarters of children being looked after by councils live with foster parents,which costs local authorities about Â£1.7bn a year,external. Since the 1960s, government policy has moved away from residential children's homes. Foster carers play a vital role but there aren't enough of them. A review published in February 2018 said that the shortage depended on what part of the country a child was in and the availability of foster carers able to take on the most challenging young people. Of the children who are not fostered, about 4,000 are placed with their own parents under supervision and nearly 8,000 spend time in children's homes, secure units or living semi-independently. Almost a third of the more than 31,000 children who left care in 2017 returned to their families. About 14% were adopted, after spending an average of two years in care. For 12% of the children, there were special guardianship orders, where a relative took on their care. The number of adoptions has fallen since its peak in 2015, which followed a high profile push to increase numbers by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron. Most of the children who were adopted in 2017 were aged between one and four years old. Only 1% of adopted children were aged 10 or over, even though this represents the largest age group of children being looked after by councils. About a quarter of children who cease to be looked after when they reach their 18th birthdays continue to live with their foster parents but the future for many care leavers is difficult. Of the 18- to 21-year-olds who stayed in touch with councils, 40% were not in education, training or employment. Although half of care leavers were in some form of education, training or employment, only 6% went to university. That compares with 33% of all 18-year-olds.  It's also estimated that about a quarter of inmates in youth prisons have spent time in care. Additional research by Ben Butcher and charts by Visual Journalism Unit.

"Vital home care services for the elderly and vulnerable could be disrupted, regulators say. The Care Quality Commission has issued a notice saying it has serious doubts about the future of Allied Healthcare. The CQC said it was concerned about its prospects from the end of this month, but the firm said the move was ""premature and unwarranted"". The company provides services, such as help washing and dressing, to more than 13,000 people across the UK. The CQC just has responsibility for England, where 9,300 people rely on Allied Healthcare services across 84 council areas, more than half the total. The regulator has written to all the affected local authorities as they would have responsibility to step in if services are disrupted. Allied Healthcare announced earlier this year it was struggling with debts blaming low fees paid by councils, but it did manage to restructure its finances on that occasion. But the CQC has now said the company had only be able to confirm it had funding in place until 30 November. The regulator said it had a legal duty to warn councils that business failure was likely and services could stop as a result in its view. It does not mean failure will definitely happen, just that as things stand it is deemed likely. The BBC understands there has already been an offer made from a new lender that could secure the firm's immediate future. This is the first time a notice like this has been issued to a whole provider - previous warnings have just related to individual services. Andrea Sutcliffe, from the CQC, said: ""I understand this is a very unsettling time for everyone who uses Allied Healthcare's services, their families and loved ones, and staff. ""We will continue to work closely with Allied Healthcare and all of our partners to make sure appropriate action is being taken in the interests of people's continuity of care if this proves necessary. ""It is of course possible that the company is able to avoid service disruption, and if that is the case, we will revise our position accordingly."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there was currently no disruption to any services provided by Allied Healthcare, and that local authorities were being given time to ensure continuity of care for people using services. But a spokesman for Allied Healthcare said the company was ""surprised and deeply disappointed"" by the move. He said it was ""premature and unwarranted"" as there was no risk to services because financing had been secured. ""The CQC has disregarded these assurances in spite of the robust evidence we have provided,"" he added. The news comes just weeks after the UK Homecare Association, the umbrella group for providers, warned services were being put at risk becausecouncils were trying to get care ""on the cheap"". Its report said only one in seven local authorities were paying a fair price for care, forcing a number of firms to pull out of contracts.

"This video can not be played An ex-employee claims Sir Philip was ""aggressive, fighting, bullish, bullying"" towards her A woman has accused Sir Philip Green of harassment by subjecting her to a barrage of verbal abuse during her time working for his Arcadia Group. And she told the BBC if she responded her replies were ""considered worthless"" and she felt there was nowhere to go because Sir Philip owned the firm. Other ex-employees called him a bully, saying he threw stuff at staff if he thought they were underperforming. Arcadia said it thoroughly investigates any accusations and grievances raised. In her interview with the BBC, the former senior staff member at Arcadia, who did not want to be named, said: ""It was the f-word all the time, just tripping out of him, rolling off his tongue. I found it really aggressive."" ""He verbally harassed people and it was a constant verbal barrage - it was an attack,"" she said. ""But when it becomes constant and you're not given the right to reply, and when you do reply, your reply is considered worthless, there's nowhere for you to go. And he owns the company that you're working for."" Sir Philip Green: From 'king of the High Street' to 'unacceptable face of capitalism' Sir Philip Green: 'There was only banter' This video can not be played Former Topshop manager Auna Irvine says she was ""tormented"" by Sir Philip Green Another former employee, Auna Irvine, 33, also said Sir Philip engaged in inappropriate behaviour. Ms Irvine was the manager of Topshop's Las Vegas store in 2012 before being sacked but denies she is seeking revenge. She said: ""It turned into things like him slapping my butt or him calling me fat or him calling me sexy or talking about my boobs or my ass. ""In the US it would definitely be classified as sexual harassment."" Last month, Sir Philip was named as the man behind a court injunction which prevented the Daily Telegraph from publishing allegations of sexual and racial harassment set out in complaints by other employees. He subsequently said that he wholly and categorically denied allegations that he has been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour. He later told the Mail on Sunday there had only ""been some banter"" which had ""never been offensive"". But the former employee, to whom the BBC spoke, said that, in her experience, it was ""absolutely not banter"". ""This was aggressive, it was threatening, it was constant and it just brought you down constantly,"" she said. Other former employees, who also did not want to be identified, told the BBC that while Sir Philip could be friendly and generous, he was also a bully. Several said he was known to throw things at staff if sales were not doing as well as expected. One woman said she had to complain to him about his behaviour after she saw him throw footwear at another member of staff. ""He picked up a pair of boots, shouting and swearing at her and threw them at her. Luckily she ducked,"" she said. ""This is in front of the whole team. ""He said 'what do you mean I can't do that.'"" Swearing, he said he was paying her wages so 'I can treat her how I want.'"" She also said Sir Philip used a Yiddish word often seen as a racial slur when describing a black man. The former employee said another colleague had been discovered trying to hide from him in a cupboard to avoid having to meet him. ""Everybody was on edge when they found out they'd have to be meeting him,"" said another former employee. ""He'd feel comfortable insulting people in large groups as well. He felt he owned everybody in the business."" But another former senior staff member was supportive, saying that Sir Philip was just a passionate businessman who wanted things to be done right. A spokesperson for Arcadia said it has a clear grievance policy in place across all its businesses for any colleagues wishing to raise concerns. ""We take accusations and grievances very seriously and in the event that one is raised with us, it is thoroughly investigated,"" they added.

"The company says the picture was staged, insisting that no crew slept on the floor Six Ryanair cabin crew members pictured sleeping on the floor of a Spanish airport office last month have been sacked, the airline says. The image, which Ryanair said was staged, was widely shared online. A Portuguese union that represents airline crews criticised the airline. The staff were dismissed for gross misconduct, a Ryanair spokesman said. Over 20 crew members were stranded in Malaga airport when their Porto-bound flights were diverted on 14 October. However Ryanair said that despite the issues, ""no crew slept on the floor"". ""The crew spent a short period of time in the crew room before being moved to a VIP lounge, and returned to Porto the next day,"" the company said after the image circulated. Confirming the sackings on Tuesday, Ryanair said the photo led to media reports that damaged the company's reputation and ""caused an irreparable breach of trust with these six persons"". Ryanair tops airline compensation claims 'Racial abuse passenger' referred to police Ryanair to shut online operations for upgrade The Portuguese union, SNPVAC, had earlier disagreed with Ryanair's summary of events, claiming that crew members were placed in a room between 01:30 and 06:00 ""without minimum rest facilities"". The union said that crew members were left ""without access to food, drinks and even a place to sit down, as there were only eight seats available for the crew"". However SNPVAC confirmed that the staff were moved to a VIP lounge at 06:00. The airline came under fire after the photo appeared on social media. It was first shared by Jim Atkinson on Twitter, who criticised Ryanair for not providing adequate accommodation for staff. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Prime Minster Theresa May has formed five new business councils to advise on how to create the best business conditions in the UK after Brexit. Big names on the forums include Tesco boss Dave Lewis, ITV chief Carolyn McCall, entrepreneur James Timpson, and CBI head Carolyn Fairbairn. Each council will meet three times a year, twice with Mrs May and once with a senior cabinet minister. They will provide advice and policy recommendations on big business issues. Each group will be co-chaired by two business leaders and have about ""10 members representing core sectors of the UK economy, as well as a representative from the UK's key business groups"". Mrs May said she had asked these new councils to ""advise us on the opportunities and challenges facing business as we shape the UK for the future"". Business leaders call for second EU vote Brexit deal could accelerate interest rate increases Car parts plants to close on Brexit worries The co-chairs will be at Downing Street on Wednesday to thrash out their forthcoming agendas and meetings timetables. Executives from BT, BAE, Rolls-Royce, Prudential, Santander, Tesco, Timpson, ITV and GSK will attend, as well as representatives from the CBI, Institute of Directors, EEF, British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Business. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems and co-chair of the committee looking at the industrial, manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, said: ""We are a vital part of the wealth creating machinery of the country where improved training, productivity and exporting will be the cornerstones of our global success. ""Engaging with the prime minister to tackle these issues in a focused and practical manner is a welcome and important step forward in achieving our collective growth ambitions."" Downing Street said the co-chairs would be responsible for preparing each council's agenda, ensuring all members were briefed and driving progress on major opportunities for their business sectors. The initiative comes days after more than 70 business figures signed a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a public vote on the UK's Brexit deal. The chief executive of Waterstones and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King were among those saying a ""destructive hard Brexit"" would damage the UK economy. A group called Business for a People's Vote will launch on Thursday. A Downing Street source said the prime minister was clear that there would be no new referendum. By Simon Jack, BBC business editor The government's overtures to business are rapidly becoming a symphony. After two years of feeling they were ""outside the tent"" when it came to Brexit strategy and policy, Theresa May is welcoming as many business big hitters back inside as she can. It's quite a change from 2016. One of first things Theresa May did when taking over from David Cameron was to disband his business council. The new prime minister and her advisers had watched voters, disillusioned with big business, ignore the Brexit warnings from industry and assessed that being seen as close to them was a political mistake. Fast forward to today's announcement that she is founding no fewer than FIVE new business councils to give ""regular, high level advice and policy recommendations"".

"A charity volunteer, who helped the Army veteran, said the attack was ""inhumane"" A homeless Army veteran suffered leg injuries after a youth allegedly put a lit firework in his pocket and said ""have a sparking good night mate"". The incident in Liverpool on 5 November is one in a series of attacks that have been reported across the UK. Fireworks have been thrown at police in London and at firefighters in Bradford and in Scotland. It comes as a petition calling for a ban on the sale of fireworks to the public has exceeded 160,000 signatures. The petition says fireworks can cause nuisance to the public as well as injuries and damage to buildings and property. A ban has already been called for by the parents of four-year-old Rosie-May Mason, who was scarred by a rocket let off at a back garden display last year in Wales, while senior doctors have called for graphic images of injuries to be displayed on packaging. But the British Fireworks Association has said a ban would be ""heavy handed"" and fireworks should be used responsibly. This video can not be played Footage from inside a fire engine shows the moment fireworks were thrown at firefighters. In Liverpool, volunteer Andy Shute, from homelessness charity the Paper Cup Project, said he helped the Army veteran victim after the ""appalling"" and ""inhumane"" attack in the city. He said he was giving the victim some food and drink in a nearby street when he told him about the incident. The veteran, who is in his late 30s, said he felt one of four teenagers brush past him and ""within seconds"" he could smell burning. Mr Shute said the man told him the firework burnt through his coat and trousers and ""it was only his wallet in his pocket that gave his leg a bit of protection"". He said he then grabbed the firework from his coat and suffered burns on his middle finger. Call to put shock images on fireworks 'I lost my eye after firework exploded' Fire crews attacked on Bonfire Night Ch Insp Paddy Kelly said the ""shocking incident"" would not be tolerated and they were determined to find the offenders and they were trying to find the victim. Elsewhere, a major fire that ripped through a former cattle market in Nottingham on Sundayis being treated as an arson attack involving fireworks. In London, the Metropolitan Police posted a video of fireworks being thrown at officers in Enfield. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Pipers was founded by Simon Herring, Alex Albone and James Sweeting PepsiCo is taking another step into the UK snack market by launching a bid to acquire Lincolnshire crisp company Pipers Crisps. PepsiCo already owns Leicester-based Walkers Crisps and American firm Doritos and wants to grow Pipers in the UK and develop its exports. The international food and drink company's bid is subject to approval by the Competition and Markets Authority. Farmers Alex Albone, Simon Herring and James Sweeting founded Pipers in 2004. Based in rural Lincolnshire, it employs more than 75 local people. Pipers' managing director, James McKinney, said: ""We've developed innovative products to suit evolving tastes while establishing a strong foothold in the market. ""PepsiCo's commitment to accelerating the growth of the Pipers brand means more people will be able to enjoy the unique, award-winning flavour of Pipers Crisps."" PepsiCo buys Sodastream for $3.2bn PepsiCo suggestion of 'lady-friendly' crisps mocked Crisps and snacks seen as a route to growth by US firms The UK is the top crisp market in Europe, worth some Â£1.46bn, ahead of Germany (Â£760m) and France (Â£550m), according to Mintel. Ian Ellington, PepsiCo UK's general manager, said: ""The Pipers' brand has a strong proposition within the market, with stand-out taste, flavours and appeal."" Pipers delivers directly from a number of its own regional hubs across the UK using its own vans, as well as supplying customers through selected distribution partners.

"In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward. What this all means for Trump Meanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats, while the Democrats gained seats in Nevada and Arizona. As it happened Key takeaways so far A really simple guide to the mid-terms There was talk before the election of a rising ""blue wave"" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country. The Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller. One Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district. The Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts. There will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.

The 2018 mid-terms is set to be historical for voter turnout. With just a few seats left to be re-counted, 49.2% of those allowed to vote have done so. This is higher than any year since 1914. In 2014, just 37% of those eligible voted. Some 115 million votes were cast in the House in 2018, according to estimates by the US Elections Project, up from 83 million in 2014. How the mid-term elections broke records In the House, Democrats increased their vote share in hundreds of seats, with vote share dropping in just 47 seats. Boundary changes also helped them, as changes in Pennsylvania saw them gain four seats in the state, compared to 2016. They also gained two seats in the southern tip of Florida, a classic swing state. Compared with the last Congressional election in 2016, Republicans lost support in those counties with the most university-educated white women. While minorities are much more likely to vote Democrat. And in rural areas, there was strong support for Republican candidates. President Trump's core constituencies of white working class voters also appear to have turned out for the party in House races.

"Popular wisdom suggests that Donald Trump expects to lose the House of Representatives, although Democrats don't believe anything is in the bag. In the lower chamber there are about 30-35 tight races right across the country. The key may be the liberal, affluent voters - if they vote for the economy they back Republicans. If they vote for their social values, they go Democrat. That's a big if which decides who controls one house of congress. Mid-term matters (with apologies to Alan Partridge) Why do so many Americans not vote? A really simple guide to the US mid-term elections The big election issue that's not Trump The senate is easier for Trump's party to keep, as a lot of the tight races are in states that went for him. Interesting ones will be places like Missouri, Indiana - Democrat senators sitting in very red states. Many of them are campaigning more like independents - cautious not to mention their own party , so they don't scare off Conservative voters. But all eyes are on Texas where a young skateboarding Democrat, Beto O'Rourke, has got a truly Republican state within his grasp. His opponent is Ted Cruz - who clashed with Trump in 2016. But the president has supported him this time around - campaigning there often. And Texas is a red meat, red heart state with open carry gun laws. It's almost unthinkable they could elect a democrat. But anything could happen there this race. In Arizona - state of the late John McCain - two women are vying for the senate. The Republican is a former fighter pilot and its neck and neck. In Nevada a Republican is trying to hold on in a state won by Hillary Clinton. And this part of the world is getting less white and more Latino - which often means more blue voters. Florida is always a nail biter. The fourth term Democrat fighting the former Republican governor. They've clashed sharply on gun violence in a state that saw the young rise up after a mass school shooting. There are nearly 500 races across the country. Will this be a referendum on Trump? The president would like to think so. The big US election issue that's not Trump Why do so many Americans not vote? Video, 00:01:52Why do so many Americans not vote?

"The Democrats' hopes of winning control of the US Senate have been dealt a blow in the mid-term elections. A Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, and two US networks predict they will take control of the chamber. Republicans currently control both legislative chambers. President Trump is not up for re-election until 2020, but Tuesday's poll will shape his agenda for the remainder of his two years in office. Republicans look likely now to retain control of the Senate - they currently have a slim 51-49 majority, but only nine of the party's seats were up for grabs, while Democrats were defending 26 seats. Republican businessman Mike Braun was projected to oust first-term incumbent Joe Donnelly, a moderate Democrat in Indiana. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump had ""closed the deal"" for Mr Braun after holding a rally in the state on Monday night. This video can not be played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont: 'President is a pathological liar' Republican Marsha Blackburn won a Senate seat in Tennessee against Democrat Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by pop star Taylor Swift. There was some consolation for Democrats as Senators Joe Manchin and Bob Menendez held on to their seats after tough campaigns in West Virginia and New Jersey respectively. Mr Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination narrowly survived sexual assault claims. A cliff-hanging vote count in Florida has Republican Rick Scott neck and neck with incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson. Republican Ted Cruz Cruz has a slight lead against his challenger, Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke.

Two US networks - Fox and NBC - are projecting that the Democrats are expected to win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House. In suburban Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton ousted incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock, while another Democrat, Donna Shalala, flipped a Florida constituency against Republican Maria Salazar, a news anchor. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is projected to have become the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old. If Democrats do win the House, they are expected to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest, while thwarting his legislative agenda.

Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams could become the first female African-American governor in the US. Her Republican opponent Brian Kemp's office has been accused of voter suppression. To add to polling day tensions, broken voting machines led to longer queues and a return to paper ballots in some parts of the state. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. Key takeaways from election so far After months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force. Around 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. In Texas, early voting exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. Some states showed signs of being overwhelmed by the voter influx, however. There were reports of electronic voting machine failures and congested polling stations - including in Georgia, Atlanta, Arizona, and New York. Relief at social networks as defences hold A Homeland Security official said the department had received ""sparse"" reports of tech failure, but that there seemed to have been no significant impact on people's ability to vote.

"Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by its founder Arron Banks face total fines of Â£135,000 over breaches of data laws. It follows anInformation Commissioner investigation,externalinto the misuse of personal data by political campaigns. The report says more than a million emails sent to Leave.EU subscribers contained marketing for the Eldon Insurance firm's GoSkippy services. Mr Banks defended himself on Twitter after the report's release. Data watchdog: Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), he said, had found ""we may have accidentally sent a newsletter to customers"" but ""no evidence of a grand data conspiracy"". He added: ""Gosh we communicated with our supporters and offered them a 10% Brexit discount after the vote! So what?"" The UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016. Since then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data. For its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to ""micro target"" voters. The ICO said this had been the ""most complex data protection investigation"" it had ever carried out, with ""an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public"". It said it had uncovered a ""disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy"". The investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts. The ICO said it had identified ""serious breaches of data protection principles"" and would have issued a ""substantial fine"" if the company had not already been in administration. Data firm closure won't stop Facebook probe The report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum. It said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a ""view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes"", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned. Elsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance. Both organisations face fines of Â£60,000 for emails which breached data laws. The ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent. It also imposed a Â£15,000 fine for a separate ""serious"" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database. A final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data. Leave campaigners celebrate the referendum result in June 2016 Vote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ. The ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws. It said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had ""transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects"". But it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered ""electronic marketing communications"" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules. ""We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,"" it added. The ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign. This includes looking at ""the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker"", as well as ""inadequate third party consents"", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said. It also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about Â£100,000. This was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign. ""We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,"" the report added. Remain lost the EU referendum by 51.9% to 48.1% The ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be ""transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process"". ""We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,"" it said. ""But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform."" The ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet. Although its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider. The watchdog's report said all the UK's 11 major political parties were engaged in risky behaviour and it had sent each a formal warning. Specifically, the ICO is worried about their use of third-party data brokers and analytics firms that pull in and process the public's personal information via a variety of sources without necessarily checking that consent has been properly obtained. In addition, it believes that self-regulation by Facebook and other social media firms has not been consistent or rigorous enough and now believes a code of practice ""enshrined by law"" is required to govern the way their data and platforms are used. The regulator also highlighted deep concerns about university researchers' handling of personal data. It said that while measures were in place to try to make sure academics behaved ethically, the same could not be said for whether they had taken enough steps to protect the public's information - particularly in cases where the same academics also did work for private companies. As a result, the ICO said it was now working with the higher education sector to make sure privacy rules are followed.

"The US mid-term elections on Tuesday will help define the rest of Donald Trump's presidency. Americans will vote for members of both chambers of Congress, as well as for governors in 36 out of 50 states. This is our last daily round-up ahead of the mid-terms, so we've pulled together all our material that matters. Wait...whatarethe mid-terms? (Don't worry, it's OK to ask.) It may feel like the US is always having elections, so what's at stake on Tuesday? What are people voting for? We're here to help.Here's our very simple guidethat hopefully answers everything you want to know. If you were to look at campaign videos alone, it would appear that the key issues on people's minds as they go to the polls were healthcare and immigration. But what do voters themselves say? We asked people in 12 different states what issues are on their minds as they select their candidates. This video can not be played What do American voters care about? Donald Trump's name isn't on the ballot this year, but it might as well be. One important thing to watch on Tuesday will be whether candidates who have embraced the president's rhetoric and tactics end up doing well. This could shape the direction of the Republican party over the next two years. Either way, we can expect these mid-terms, like all others, to be a referendum on the president. The parties of presidents who have low approval ratings tend to do poorly in the mid-terms - and President Trump's are very low indeed. This is one reason Democrats, with the House of Representatives in their sights, are optimistic this year. Here are other reasons Democrats are hopeful There are plenty we could have picked here - any of the close Senate races in Tennessee, Missouri or Arizona for example - but if there's one race that sums up the 2018 mid-terms, it is the close race for governor in Georgia. Like in a number of other states this year, Georgia could see a significant first: Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams would become the first female African-American governor in the US if she won. Her Republican opponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state. His office has been behind the cancellation of 1.5m voter registration applications in four years, and has been accused of voter suppression, one of the hot-button issues this year. As with the divisive race for governor in neighbouring Florida, the Georgia contest has also been laced with racist undertones (or even overtones). Just last week, the Washington Post reported,voters in Georgia received a fake robocall,externalpurporting to be from Oprah Winfrey ""asking you to make my fellow Negress Stacey Abrams the governor of Georgia"". Our correspondent Courtney Subramanian spent time in Georgia looking at how the bitter race has played out. You can read her piece here The first polls will close at 23:00 GMT on Tuesday (that's 18:00 on the east coast of the US). We'll be bringing you coverage live online, on TV and on radio as the results come in. How can you find out where to read, watch and listen? See the schedule for our mid-terms coverage here There are plenty of possible outcomes on Tuesday, and therefore plenty of possible consequences.

"This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? The looming US mid-term elections will shape American politics for the next two years and beyond. President Donald Trump himself is not up for re-election, so fewer voters are expected to turn out. But his ability to govern in the final two years of his first term will hinge upon the 6 November outcome. All 435 members of the House of Representatives, 35 seats in the 100-member Senate and 36 out of 50 state governors, along with many state and local offices. Republicans currently hold sway in both chambers of Congress and the White House. But there is giddy talk among Democrats of a ""blue wave"". With dozens of Republican lawmakers retiring this year, the minority party has a decent chance of taking over the House. Democrats need 20 or so seats to control the lower chamber. But in the Senate, Republicans are tipped to retain their majority and perhaps even consolidate it. That's because out of the upper chamber seats up for grabs this autumn, 26 are held by Democrats (including two independents who vote with them) and just nine by Republicans. Democrats may need to win all those races and pick up two Republican seats, leaving little margin for error. Ten of the Democratic seats are in states carried by Trump in 2016 - and five of those he won by double digits. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US Trump's invincible, but for how much longer? The president's party has lost an average of 32 seats in the House and two in the Senate in every mid-term election since the American Civil War. President Trump is also historically unpopular, according to opinion polls. As an energised liberal base clamours to give 'Trumpism' a bloody nose, Democratic challengers are out-fundraising and out-polling a host of Republican incumbents. There's a lot of new talent. Anecdotal evidence suggests more women are running for office than ever before, chiefly on the left, and in some races all the Democratic candidates are under 30. Your simple guide to the US mid-termsIn case you're just joining us Why US mid-term elections matterThe big issues explained Hour-by-hour guide to election nightWhat to expect when Can we tell yet who has the edge?Analysis of what we know so far Follow the US election on the BBCHow to keep up with the results The mid-term electorate is usually whiter, older and more conservative. Yes, Trump's approval rating is low, but the Democratic party has no obvious standard-bearer and is widely viewed as rudderless since Hillary Clinton's shock defeat in 2016. Above all, the US economy is roaring like a fighter jet engine at maximum torque, with unemployment rates at rock bottom, consumer confidence high and wages actually rising. Expect to hear a lot about how this election isa referendum on Trump. This summer's primaries - when the party faithful anoint their candidates for November's election - will be a tug-of-war on the right between establishment and anti-establishment conservatives - and on the left, between populist progressives calling for Trump's impeachment and pragmatic centrists. Immigrationremains a cultural touchstone that both main parties hope will play to their advantage. Democrats believe the president's hardline rhetoric on the topic will help them entice younger voters, suburban moderates and minorities. Republicans are counting on Trump's tough posture to turn out conservatives who think Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than US citizens. Thegun controlmovement launched in the aftermath of February's high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is also mobilising for the election. Meanwhile, a recentGallup poll,externalfound the top concern for US voters ishealthcare. Despite passing various measures to weaken the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have been unable to kill off Obamacare. Voters tend to punish the party in power for rising medical insurance costs, which under Trump are continuing to hit Americans in the pocket. If Republicans lose control of either chamber of Congress, the president's domestic agenda will be largely dead on arrival at Capitol Hill. If Democrats win the House, they get to decide which bills come to the floor and they'll control the committee chairmanships. That will entail aggressive oversight investigations of the president's administration, including alleged Russia collusion, Trump's business dealings and sexual assault allegations against him. But if Republicans hold on to the Senate, they will continue to approve Trump's cabinet nominees and appoint conservative judges to US courtrooms. If Democrats do do well in the mid-terms, it could actually work in Trump's favour. He will be able to pin blame on them for congressional gridlock, and there's a risk they could overplay their hand. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (R) and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer Governors wield considerable influence over politics in their state capitols - and the lives of their constituents. Republicans currently control 33 out of 50 gubernatorial mansions and two-thirds of 99 state legislature chambers. But of the 36 state governorships on the ballot this year, 23 are being defended by Republican incumbents, tantalising targets for Democrats. Among the gubernatorial prizes are the presidential swing states of Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. As Trump runs for re-election in 2020, governors will play a crucial role in mobilising donors, volunteers and activists. In 1994 the Republican party took control of the House and Senate, setting the stage for six years of battles with Democratic President Bill Clinton. The Democrats retook both chambers in 2006, enabling President Barack Obama to accomplish chunks of his agenda when he won office two years later. Republicans won back the House in 2010, curtailing Obama's ability to govern. In 2014, Republicans regained control of the Senate, and boosted their House majority to its largest since 1929.

"It can be tough to keep up with the deluge of information and analysis that comes with the US mid-term elections. Despite all the noise, the key question remains whether or not Republicans will be able to keep control of both chambers of Congress. But with so much to consider and thousands of races taking place, some interesting stories can be lost. That's why we've picked out some candidates who have had memorable journeys to the ballot box on November 6. Plus, a politics professor explains how a compelling personal story can make a difference. Who? Democrat Sharice Davids, a gay ex-mixed martial arts fighter, is running in Kansas's third congressional district. What makes her interesting? Ms Davids could become the first Native-American woman elected to Congress. She is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, was raised by a single mother who worked as a drill sergeant, and has a law degree from a top US university. The 38-year-old won her first mixed martial arts fight in November 2013, but began to focus on politics after she was rejected by the Ultimate Fighting Championship. One quote:""I've been put down, pushed aside, knocked out. I've had to fight my whole life because of who I am and who I love."" Who? Martha McSally, a two-term Republican representative from Arizona, is running for Senate in the state. What makes her interesting? Ms McSally is the first US female fighter pilot to fly in combat and the first to command a fighter squadron. She was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and earned six medals during her 26-year military career. If elected, she will become the first woman to represent Arizona in the Senate. One quote:""I'm a fighter pilot and I talk like one. That's why I told Washington Republicans to grow a pair of ovaries and get the job done."" Who? Randy Bryce, a trade union activist and cancer survivor, is the Democratic candidate for Wisconsin's first district. What makes him interesting? Mr Bryce - nicknamed Iron Stache - came to prominence whenhis biographical campaign video,externalwent viral earlier this year. He is an ironworker and former soldier who has emphasised his working-class roots, but he has drawn some notable opposition from close to home. His brother featured in a Republican attack ad and has said he is voting against him. Awkward. One quote:""I spent the last 20 years of my life building the district."" Who? Peter Boykin, founder of the Gays for Trump group, is running for North Carolina's state legislature. What makes him interesting? He is a major outlier, because the vast majority of LGBT candidates running this year are Democrats. There are no gay Republican nominees for Congress or governor, according tothe LGBT Victory Fund,externalorganisation. Mr Boykin has been forthright in addressing this issue, telling the New York Times that the Republican Party had ""totally embraced"" him. One quote:""The liberal gay community preaches peace, love, and tolerance but they only extend it to people who think like they do."" A really simple guide to the US mid-terms You choose what happens in the mid-terms Should Donald Trump be worried? Who? Christine Hallquist, 62, who defeated three candidates to win the Democratic nomination for governor of Vermont. What makes her interesting? She could become the first ever transgender governor of a US state. Ms Hallquist transitioned in 2015 while working as the head of a state-wide energy company, a job she held for 12 years. Her nomination comes during an election year that has seen a record number of lesbian, gay and transgender candidates run for political office. One quote:""I just happen to be a leader who is transgender. Vermonters know that."" Who? Will Hurd, a 40-year-old former CIA officer and Republican representative, is contesting a close race for Texas's 23rd district. What makes him interesting? He managed covert operations in Afghanistan during a nine-year career with the CIA, and has become a regular on political talk shows. His district covers an extensive part of the US-Mexico border, and he has been vocal in his opposition to President Trump's immigration policies. Mr Hurd is a moderate in the party and his seat is high on the list of those the Democrats are hoping to take. One quote:""I've seen Russian intelligence manipulate many people over my professional career and I never would have thought that the US President would become one."" Who? Democrat Mallory Hagan, 29, who has swapped beauty pageants for the ballot box in Alabama's third district. What makes her interesting? She was crowned Miss America in 2013, having previously won the Miss New York and Miss Manhattan titles. Last year, top figures in the Miss America Organization resigned after leaked emails showed they had mocked a number of contestants including Ms Hagan. The experience prompted her to give politics a try. ""It taught me a lot about the power of my voice,"" she says on her website. But she faces a tough test in trying to unseat her Republican opponent, Mike Rogers, who has held the district for more than 15 years. One quote:""After looking at the numbers of women throwing their hats in the ring, I decided to do it."" Who? Antonio Sabato Jr, a TV actor and former Calvin Klein model, is the Republican candidate in California's 26th district. What makes him interesting? Mr Sabato has been plastered on a 90ft [27m] billboard in Times Square and has shown off his ballroom skills on TV's Dancing with the Stars. But in recent years it's his political views that have been in the spotlight. He says he was blacklisted by Hollywood directors for his early support of Mr Trump's presidential run. Mr Sabato has also repeatedly claimed - without evidence - that former President Barack Obama is Muslim. One quote:[On President Obama] ""If he's not a Muslim, we should call him President Barry."" This year's pool of candidates is a diverse one, with more women and LGBT people running than ever before. But will it make a difference? Yes, says Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia who specialises in campaigns and elections. ""A lot of these more diverse candidates can generate levels of enthusiasm among voters that have traditionally not been part of the electoral environment,"" she says. Prof Lawless also points out that most of the new, diverse, candidates are Democrats. Why is this? ""A lot are running based on their concerns about the Trump administration,"" she says. ""Many have personal experience where they feel like they have been targeted themselves."" The women lining up to topple Trump The US state about to elect a woman There are also a number of candidates who have compelling personal stories to tell and Prof Lawless says this can be helpful - to an extent. ""In a lot of cases these personal stories are a way for candidates to talk about themselves in a way that is genuinely authentic,"" she says. ""But there's not much evidence to suggest that voters specifically look at individual life stories,"" she adds. ""The most important thing is the ability to convey that you have the background and the experience to be an effective representative of the people.""

"This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Millions in the US and across the world are following the election results as they come in. There are hundreds of races - which ones are worth keeping an eye on? Americans have been filling polling stations on Tuesday to elect 35 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives, as well as 36 state governors and countless state officials. Polls in many areas have closed. It is a crucial election for President Donald Trump, as his Republican Party currently controls both houses of Congress. Here are some of the key races to watch - and what's happened so far. A huge setback for Democrats as they lose their Senate seat in Indiana. That makes their path to seizing control of the upper chamber very narrow indeed. It's a state that Trump won easily in 2016. A key Kentucky district seen as a bellwether has been held by Republicans but there was some good news for Democrats in Virginia. Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock has lost her seat in the House to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton, and she's being seen by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher as the first possible casualty of a Democratic ""blue wave"". Democratic incumbent senators in the eastern part of the country have retained their seats, including Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Virginia's Tim Kaine. No surprises there. Independent Bernie Sanders has glided to an easy win in Vermont, securing a third term in the senate. Read Anthony's rolling blog How to follow the results on the BBC A really simple guide to the mid-terms Most polls closed in two of the most closely-watched governors' races,FloridaandGeorgia. In Florida,the Democratic Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, a left-wing progressive who wants to become the state's first black leader, faces Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trumpist conservative. Ron DeSantis (left) and Andrew Gillum are fighting to become Florida's governor The fight for a Senate seat has put incumbent Bill Nelson, a Democrat who has served since 2000, against outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott, in what is one of the most expensive races in the country. President Trump loves Florida. A double Republican win here would give the White House a huge morale boost. In neighbouringGeorgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams hopes to become the country's first black female governor in one of the most contentious races in this year's mid-term election. She faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, the top official overseeing the election. The race between Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R) is one of the most fiercely contested The campaign, which has drawn national attention, has been embroiled in claims of voter suppression, and may not even be over on Tuesday: if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote, the decision will go to a run-off election on 4 December. In a House race of note, Republican Rep Karen Handel, elected in a closely-fought special election in 2017, faces gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was killed in a dispute about loud music, in the suburban Atlanta 6th district. Polls also close inSouth Carolina,VermontandVirginia, where Republican Rep Dave Brat is fighting for re-election in the Richmond-area (7th district) against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer. Mr Brat won his seat after famously defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 in a Republican primary. A Brat defeat - if it comes on the heels of Democratic victories elsewhere - would be interpreted as a good sign for those cheering the Democratic cause. At 19:30, polls close inNorth Carolina,OhioandWest Virginia. An ugly, gloves-off fight that defines US election The Deep South woman vying to make history What are the claims of voter suppression? This was an action-packed hour that could decide who will control the Senate. But you'll need to pay close attention to know what's happening - there's a lot going on. Polls closed inNew Jersey, where the race for the 7th district is playing out between Rep Leonard Lance, who has represented the area since 2008, and Democrat Tom Malinowski. Democrats are hoping to make some gains in an area that is critical of President Trump. Democrats also have high hopes inPennsylvania, and one race worth watching is the 1st district. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate former FBI agent, faces Democrat Scott Wallace, who has spent huge sums of his own wealth to fund his campaign - his family's philanthropic foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, is reportedly worth more than $140m (Â£107m). This video can not be played What do American voters care about? Polls also closed inAlabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode IslandandTennessee. InMissouri, two-term Democratic Sen Claire McCaskill hopes to keep her seat against Republican Josh Hawley. First polls closed inKansas, Massachusetts, Michigan,where Democrat Rashida Tlaib hopes to become the first Muslim woman in Congress,New HampshireandSouth Dakota. At 20:30, polls closed inArkansas. Mid-terms in charts: Should Donald Trump be worried? The evangelical women who reject Trump What happened at21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) Polls closed inTexas. One to watch is the 7th district of west Houston suburbs, a former GOP stronghold that narrowly chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Republican Rep John Culberson faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. The race for the Senate in this traditional red state is between incumbent Ted Cruz, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a rising star who wants to become the party's first senator for Texas in three decades. He's been getting a lot of attention and raising loads of money, but a win for Mr O'Rourke looks unlikely. It would suggest there's been a big swing to the Democrats nationwide if he gets over the line. This video can not be played Apathy isn't the only reason why so many Americans don't vote Polls close inColorado,Louisiana,Nebraska,New Mexico,New York,WisconsinandWyoming. InMinnesota, Republican Rep Erik Paulsen faces a big challenge from Democrat Dean Phillips in the Twin Cities suburbs (3rd district). Mrs Clinton won in the area by nine points. You're doing well if you're still keeping up. You might have the state of play now in the Senate and the House, but don't bet on it. Democrats dazzled by rising star in Texas Why more Native Americans are running for office What happened at22:00 EST (03:00 GMT) Polls closed inIowa, and a key race to watch is in Des Moines (3rd district), one of the areas that swung for Barack Obama in 2012 but backed Mr Trump two years ago. Republican Rep David Young faces Democrat Cindy Axne, a small business owner. InNevada, Republican Sen Dean Heller faces Democrat Rep Jacky Rosen, and Democrats are optimistic about winning this seat. Polls also closed inMontana, andUtah. First polls close inIdahoandNorth Dakota. Jon Tester's attempt to keep his Senate seat in Montana has irked the president personally - Mr Trump said he has never forgiven the Democratic senator for raising questions about his personal doctor, Ronny Jackson, when he was in the frame to be secretary of veterans' affairs. The big election issue that's not Trump We've hit the west coast. If you don't know which party has had a good night so far, you've probably been napping. Polls close inCalifornia, and it will be interesting to see how traditionally Republican areas will vote. One of the key races is taking place in the 45th district, in Orange County. Mitt Romney won there in 2012 but Mrs Clinton was favoured here in the last election. Republican Rep Mimi Walters faces Democrat Katie Porter, a law professor. Polls also close inOregonandWashington. Polls close inHawaii. Polls close inAlaskabetween now and 01:00 (06:00 GMT). Some nail-biter races could still be in the balance - but there should be champagne corks popping somewhere by this stage.

"Staff have reported the vandalism to the police Staff at a farm shop offering a ""pick your own Christmas turkey"" service say they have received death threats. The words ""Murder"" and ""Go vegan"" have been spray-painted on the door at Greendale Farm Shop in Woodbury Salterton, Devon. Greendale is providing a service where people can name their own turkey and ""help look after it for the next two months"". The Vegan Society said it ""does not support"" any threats or abuse. Farmer Mat Carter, 35, said he wanted to ""offer people the chance to see where their food came from"". Pheasants hanging outside the shop were also spray-painted He said the backlash to the service started ""almost immediately"" after it was shared on Facebook and Instagram on Sunday. Mr Carter said staff arrived at work on Tuesday to find the spray paint across the shop and on pheasants for sale outside. The vandalism has been reported to police. He said they had also received ""very strange"" phone calls. One person reportedly called and asked the butcher: ""How would you like it if I cut you up and put you on the counter?"" Another caller is said to have shouted obscenities, before saying: ""You should be the ones being killed because your life is worth less than that of the innocent animals which you are murdering"".

"The Justice4Grenfell campaign group said the video ""has caused great alarm and distress"" A house linked to an ""offensive"" video showing a model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire has been searched by police. Six men - two aged 49, two aged 19 and the others 46 and 55 - were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and have been released under investigation. A video shared on social media shows a cardboard model of the tower being set alight by a laughing crowd. Prime Minister Theresa May had called the video ""utterly unacceptable"". The men were arrested after handing themselves in. The footage shows a large model bearing a Grenfell Tower sign, complete with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire. Footage shows a large flammable model marked ""Grenfell Tower"" with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire Laughter can be heard off camera as the effigy is set alight, with onlookers shouting ""Help me! Help me!"" and ""Jump out the window!"". As the blaze takes hold, a voice can be heard to say ""All the little ninjas getting it at the minute"" while the camera focuses on a paper cut-out with a face covering. At the end of the clip a person can be heard saying: ""That's what happens when they don't pay their rent."" Grenfell fire: When does causing offence become a crime? Police searched a house in South Norwood, south London, taking away two clear plastic bags which appeared to contain gaffer tape and white tags. The officers were at the house for around two hours. Police officers left the South Norwood property taking evidence Rukayet Mamadu, a survivor of the fire, called the video the ""climax of intolerance of the system and society"". She told theVictoria Derbyshire programme: ""It's chilling, it's cold-blooded. I feel so bad, let alone people who lost relatives. ""This should be brought to justice."" A total of 72 people were killedin the devastating blaze at the west London tower block in June 2017. The men have been arrested undersection 4a of the Public Order Act 1986,external, which covers intentional ""harassment, alarm or distress"" caused via the use of ""threatening, abusive or insulting"" words or signs. Offences committed on a private residence where a person ""had no reason to believe"" it would be ""heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling"" are protected from prosecution under the act.

Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: ""Not only is it extremely upsetting to survivors and people who lost family, it's hateful and offensive to everyone that has been affected by the tragic events of that night.""

"Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by its founder Arron Banks face total fines of Â£135,000 over breaches of data laws. It follows anInformation Commissioner investigation,externalinto the misuse of personal data by political campaigns. The report says more than a million emails sent to Leave.EU subscribers contained marketing for the Eldon Insurance firm's GoSkippy services. Mr Banks defended himself on Twitter after the report's release. Data watchdog: Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), he said, had found ""we may have accidentally sent a newsletter to customers"" but ""no evidence of a grand data conspiracy"". He added: ""Gosh we communicated with our supporters and offered them a 10% Brexit discount after the vote! So what?"" The UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016. Since then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data. For its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to ""micro target"" voters. The ICO said this had been the ""most complex data protection investigation"" it had ever carried out, with ""an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public"". It said it had uncovered a ""disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy"". The investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts. The ICO said it had identified ""serious breaches of data protection principles"" and would have issued a ""substantial fine"" if the company had not already been in administration. Data firm closure won't stop Facebook probe The report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum. It said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a ""view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes"", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned. Elsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance. Both organisations face fines of Â£60,000 for emails which breached data laws. The ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent. It also imposed a Â£15,000 fine for a separate ""serious"" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database. A final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data. Leave campaigners celebrate the referendum result in June 2016 Vote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ. The ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws. It said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had ""transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects"". But it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered ""electronic marketing communications"" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules. ""We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,"" it added. The ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign. This includes looking at ""the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker"", as well as ""inadequate third party consents"", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said. It also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about Â£100,000. This was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign. ""We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,"" the report added. Remain lost the EU referendum by 51.9% to 48.1% The ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be ""transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process"". ""We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,"" it said. ""But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.""

"Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by its founder Arron Banks face total fines of Â£135,000 over breaches of data laws. It follows anInformation Commissioner investigation,externalinto the misuse of personal data by political campaigns. The report says more than a million emails sent to Leave.EU subscribers contained marketing for the Eldon Insurance firm's GoSkippy services. Mr Banks defended himself on Twitter after the report's release. Data watchdog: Facebook treated voters with 'disrespect' The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), he said, had found ""we may have accidentally sent a newsletter to customers"" but ""no evidence of a grand data conspiracy"". He added: ""Gosh we communicated with our supporters and offered them a 10% Brexit discount after the vote! So what?"" The UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016. Since then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data. For its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to ""micro target"" voters. The ICO said this had been the ""most complex data protection investigation"" it had ever carried out, with ""an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public"". It said it had uncovered a ""disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy"". The investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts. The ICO said it had identified ""serious breaches of data protection principles"" and would have issued a ""substantial fine"" if the company had not already been in administration. Data firm closure won't stop Facebook probe The report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum. It said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a ""view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes"", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned. Elsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance. Both organisations face fines of Â£60,000 for emails which breached data laws. The ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent. It also imposed a Â£15,000 fine for a separate ""serious"" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database. A final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data. Leave campaigners celebrate the referendum result in June 2016 Vote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ. The ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws. It said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had ""transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects"". But it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered ""electronic marketing communications"" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules. ""We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,"" it added. The ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign. This includes looking at ""the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker"", as well as ""inadequate third party consents"", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said. It also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about Â£100,000. This was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign. ""We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,"" the report added. Remain lost the EU referendum by 51.9% to 48.1% The ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be ""transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process"". ""We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,"" it said. ""But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform."" The ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet. Although its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider.

"The face of the defendant, seen here in court, has been obscured by court order A former SS guard has gone on trial in Germany accused of complicity in mass murder at a Nazi death camp during World War Two. Identified as Johann Rehbogen, the 94-year-old served in the Stutthof camp in what is now northern Poland from June 1942 to September 1944. He denies knowing anything about atrocities committed there. Because he was not yet aged 21, he is being tried in a juvenile court in MÃ¼nster, western Germany. US deports Nazi camp guard to Germany The hidden graves of the Holocaust Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The Holocaust year by year The former guard, who uses a wheelchair, faces a sentence of 15 years if convicted but is unlikely to serve any time in prison because of his advanced age. His court appearances will be limited to two hours at a time for the same reason, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told AFP news agency. The defendant, along with another former SS guard, is suspected of involvement in the murder of hundreds of people at the camp. According to a court press release,the crimes include the use of Zyklon B poison gas,externalto kill: More than 100 Polish prisoners on 21-22 June 1944 At least 77 wounded Soviet prisoners-of-war during the summer of 1944 An unknown number of Jewish prisoners said to be ""probably several hundred"", between August and the end of 1944, some of whom were killed in railway carriages The indictment lists other atrocities including the shooting of ""several hundred"" Jews deemed unfit for work between June 1944 and April 1945, and the killing of 140 people, including Jewish women and children, between 1942 and the end of 1944 with poison injections to the heart. Other prisoners were deliberately left to freeze to death in the winter of 1943-44. Stutthof has been preserved as a museum Crematorium at Stutthof Bunks for inmates at Stutthof The defendant is ""accused in his capacity as a guard of participating in the killing operations"", said Mr Brendel. It has still to be determined whether the other former SS guard is fit to stand trial. SS leader Heinrich Himmler (centre) visited Stutthof Located near the city of Danzig (now Gdansk), it was originally an internment camp before being officially designated a concentration camp in 1942. From June 1944, prisoners were murdered in a gas chamber. More than 65,000 people died in Stutthof before it was liberated by the Soviet Army on 9 May 1945. Johann Rehbogen was captured by the US Army after the war but returned to civilian life, working as a landscape architect for the North Rhine-Westphalia state authorities. Questioned by police last year, he denied knowing about atrocities in the camp. Although he was not named by the court in MÃ¼nster, his name has been published by the Wiesenthal Center, which investigates Nazi war crimes. ""If one looks at how many evil doings and crimes were perpetuated, one can understand why elderly people too have to face prosecution,"" said Mr Brendel. ""Germany owes it to the families and victims to prosecute these Nazi crimes even today. That is a legal and moral question."" Relatives of those murdered at Stutthof are attending the trial. Among them is one of the plaintiffs, Ben Cohen, whose grandmother Judy Meisel is a survivor of the camp. He told the BBC it was good for her to see Germany pursue the case. ""Her being able to witness even some of this process, even from afar, is a sense of closure,"" he said. ""To have Germany listening to her is very powerful for her. ""I speak to her all the time and I can see a new perspective that this gives her on things, so that could maybe be considered a form of closure. But closure is a difficult word in this context.""

"This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? The looming US mid-term elections will shape American politics for the next two years and beyond. President Donald Trump himself is not up for re-election, so fewer voters are expected to turn out. But his ability to govern in the final two years of his first term will hinge upon the 6 November outcome. All 435 members of the House of Representatives, 35 seats in the 100-member Senate and 36 out of 50 state governors, along with many state and local offices. Republicans currently hold sway in both chambers of Congress and the White House. But there is giddy talk among Democrats of a ""blue wave"". With dozens of Republican lawmakers retiring this year, the minority party has a decent chance of taking over the House. Democrats need 20 or so seats to control the lower chamber. But in the Senate, Republicans are tipped to retain their majority and perhaps even consolidate it. That's because out of the upper chamber seats up for grabs this autumn, 26 are held by Democrats (including two independents who vote with them) and just nine by Republicans. Democrats may need to win all those races and pick up two Republican seats, leaving little margin for error. Ten of the Democratic seats are in states carried by Trump in 2016 - and five of those he won by double digits. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US Trump's invincible, but for how much longer? The president's party has lost an average of 32 seats in the House and two in the Senate in every mid-term election since the American Civil War. President Trump is also historically unpopular, according to opinion polls. As an energised liberal base clamours to give 'Trumpism' a bloody nose, Democratic challengers are out-fundraising and out-polling a host of Republican incumbents. There's a lot of new talent. Anecdotal evidence suggests more women are running for office than ever before, chiefly on the left, and in some races all the Democratic candidates are under 30. Your simple guide to the US mid-termsIn case you're just joining us Why US mid-term elections matterThe big issues explained Hour-by-hour guide to election nightWhat to expect when Can we tell yet who has the edge?Analysis of what we know so far Follow the US election on the BBCHow to keep up with the results The mid-term electorate is usually whiter, older and more conservative. Yes, Trump's approval rating is low, but the Democratic party has no obvious standard-bearer and is widely viewed as rudderless since Hillary Clinton's shock defeat in 2016. Above all, the US economy is roaring like a fighter jet engine at maximum torque, with unemployment rates at rock bottom, consumer confidence high and wages actually rising. Expect to hear a lot about how this election isa referendum on Trump. This summer's primaries - when the party faithful anoint their candidates for November's election - will be a tug-of-war on the right between establishment and anti-establishment conservatives - and on the left, between populist progressives calling for Trump's impeachment and pragmatic centrists. Immigrationremains a cultural touchstone that both main parties hope will play to their advantage. Democrats believe the president's hardline rhetoric on the topic will help them entice younger voters, suburban moderates and minorities. Republicans are counting on Trump's tough posture to turn out conservatives who think Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than US citizens. Thegun controlmovement launched in the aftermath of February's high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is also mobilising for the election. Meanwhile, a recentGallup poll,externalfound the top concern for US voters ishealthcare. Despite passing various measures to weaken the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have been unable to kill off Obamacare. Voters tend to punish the party in power for rising medical insurance costs, which under Trump are continuing to hit Americans in the pocket. If Republicans lose control of either chamber of Congress, the president's domestic agenda will be largely dead on arrival at Capitol Hill. If Democrats win the House, they get to decide which bills come to the floor and they'll control the committee chairmanships. That will entail aggressive oversight investigations of the president's administration, including alleged Russia collusion, Trump's business dealings and sexual assault allegations against him. But if Republicans hold on to the Senate, they will continue to approve Trump's cabinet nominees and appoint conservative judges to US courtrooms. If Democrats do do well in the mid-terms, it could actually work in Trump's favour. He will be able to pin blame on them for congressional gridlock, and there's a risk they could overplay their hand. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (R) and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer Governors wield considerable influence over politics in their state capitols - and the lives of their constituents. Republicans currently control 33 out of 50 gubernatorial mansions and two-thirds of 99 state legislature chambers. But of the 36 state governorships on the ballot this year, 23 are being defended by Republican incumbents, tantalising targets for Democrats. Among the gubernatorial prizes are the presidential swing states of Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. As Trump runs for re-election in 2020, governors will play a crucial role in mobilising donors, volunteers and activists. In 1994 the Republican party took control of the House and Senate, setting the stage for six years of battles with Democratic President Bill Clinton. The Democrats retook both chambers in 2006, enabling President Barack Obama to accomplish chunks of his agenda when he won office two years later. Republicans won back the House in 2010, curtailing Obama's ability to govern. In 2014, Republicans regained control of the Senate, and boosted their House majority to its largest since 1929.

"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced he is resigning from his role as the top law official It follows months of criticism from President Trump over the Department of Justice's handling of the Russia inquiry The announcement came a day after mid-term elections, in which Democrats took control of the House of Representatives But Republicans have retained control of the Senate, with key victories in Indiana, Texas and North Dakota Trump announced that Matthew Whitaker, chief of staff at the Department of Justice, will be the new acting attorney general Ritu Prasad and Max Matza Our main story will keep you up to speed on the aftermath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' firing.

Aleem MaqboolBBC North America correspondent He may be claiming a ""big victory"" in these mid-term elections, but it's clear Donald Trump recognises he's in for - if nothing else - lots of irritation over the next two years. Through winning control of the House of Representatives, Democrats will have much more power to scrutinise the actions of the White Houseâ¦ and things like the president's tax affairs or even alleged sexual misconduct by him. Having said that, an increase in the majority of his party in the Senate - he believes because he supported most of the Senators who won - means President Trump will continue to have his own way in cabinet and judicial appointments. Speaking of whichâ¦he'll very soon be asking the Senate to confirm a new attorney general. In his first major act after the election, Donald Trump fired his last one - Jeff Sessions. He was incensed that Mr Sessions stepped aside - to avoid conflict of interest - from overseeing the investigation into Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump's message to election candidates and political appointees alike today is that if they do his bidding, he'll stand by them and they'd survive. But if they didn't - they'd be out in the cold.

"Mosul, in Ninevah province, was a key IS stronghold in Iraq until July 2017 More than 200 mass graves containing thousands of bodies have been found in areas of Iraq that were once controlled by the Islamic State (IS) group, a UN investigation has found. The graves were found in the north and western governorates of Nineveh, Kirkuk, Salahuddin and Anbar. They could contain as many as 12,000 victims, the UN report said. IS seized parts of Iraq in 2014 and imposed brutal rule, commonly killing anyone of whom it disapproved. It was eventually vanquished by a US-led air campaign backed by Iraqi government forces and allied militias on the ground, although pockets of IS activity remain in some areas. The sites, the report notes, contain critical evidence that will not only identify the victims but also help prosecutors build cases for war crimes, crimes against humanity and possibly genocide. Where have IS fighters fled to? What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? How real is the threat of returning IS fighters? The report said 202 mass graves had been documented so far, including 95 in Ninevah, 37 in Kirkuk, 36 in Salah al-Din and 24 in Anbar. Investigators estimate between 6,000-12,000 victims are buried at the sites, including women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, foreign workers, and members of the Iraqi security forces. The war against IS in charts and maps ""The mass grave sites documented in our report are a testament to harrowing human loss, profound suffering and shocking cruelty,"" said JÃ¡n KubiÅ¡, the UN Secretary General's special representative for Iraq. ""Determining the circumstances surrounding the significant loss of life will be an important step in the mourning process for families and their journey to secure their rights to truth and justice."" Significant challenges facing families of the missing are also highlighted. Currently, they have to register with five separate Iraqi offices to try to establish the fate of their loved ones. The report calls for a public, centralised registry of missing persons as well as a federal Office of Missing Persons. It also urges the international community to provide more resources and support to the Iraqi government to help carry out a detailed forensic search of the sites.,external.

"The face of the defendant, seen here in court, has been obscured by court order A former SS guard has gone on trial in Germany accused of complicity in mass murder at a Nazi death camp during World War Two. Identified as Johann Rehbogen, the 94-year-old served in the Stutthof camp in what is now northern Poland from June 1942 to September 1944. He denies knowing anything about atrocities committed there. Because he was not yet aged 21, he is being tried in a juvenile court in MÃ¼nster, western Germany. US deports Nazi camp guard to Germany The hidden graves of the Holocaust Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The Holocaust year by year The former guard, who uses a wheelchair, faces a sentence of 15 years if convicted but is unlikely to serve any time in prison because of his advanced age. His court appearances will be limited to two hours at a time for the same reason, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told AFP news agency. The defendant, along with another former SS guard, is suspected of involvement in the murder of hundreds of people at the camp. According to a court press release,the crimes include the use of Zyklon B poison gas,externalto kill: More than 100 Polish prisoners on 21-22 June 1944 At least 77 wounded Soviet prisoners-of-war during the summer of 1944 An unknown number of Jewish prisoners said to be ""probably several hundred"", between August and the end of 1944, some of whom were killed in railway carriages The indictment lists other atrocities including the shooting of ""several hundred"" Jews deemed unfit for work between June 1944 and April 1945, and the killing of 140 people, including Jewish women and children, between 1942 and the end of 1944 with poison injections to the heart. Other prisoners were deliberately left to freeze to death in the winter of 1943-44. Stutthof has been preserved as a museum Crematorium at Stutthof Bunks for inmates at Stutthof The defendant is ""accused in his capacity as a guard of participating in the killing operations"", said Mr Brendel. It has still to be determined whether the other former SS guard is fit to stand trial. SS leader Heinrich Himmler (centre) visited Stutthof Located near the city of Danzig (now Gdansk), it was originally an internment camp before being officially designated a concentration camp in 1942. From June 1944, prisoners were murdered in a gas chamber. More than 65,000 people died in Stutthof before it was liberated by the Soviet Army on 9 May 1945. Johann Rehbogen was captured by the US Army after the war but returned to civilian life, working as a landscape architect for the North Rhine-Westphalia state authorities. Questioned by police last year, he denied knowing about atrocities in the camp. Although he was not named by the court in MÃ¼nster, his name has been published by the Wiesenthal Center, which investigates Nazi war crimes. ""If one looks at how many evil doings and crimes were perpetuated, one can understand why elderly people too have to face prosecution,"" said Mr Brendel. ""Germany owes it to the families and victims to prosecute these Nazi crimes even today. That is a legal and moral question."" Relatives of those murdered at Stutthof are attending the trial. Among them is one of the plaintiffs, Ben Cohen, whose grandmother Judy Meisel is a survivor of the camp. He told the BBC it was good for her to see Germany pursue the case. ""Her being able to witness even some of this process, even from afar, is a sense of closure,"" he said. ""To have Germany listening to her is very powerful for her. ""I speak to her all the time and I can see a new perspective that this gives her on things, so that could maybe be considered a form of closure. But closure is a difficult word in this context.""

"A charity volunteer, who helped the Army veteran, said the attack was ""inhumane"" A homeless Army veteran suffered leg injuries after a youth allegedly put a lit firework in his pocket and said ""have a sparking good night mate"". The incident in Liverpool on 5 November is one in a series of attacks that have been reported across the UK. Fireworks have been thrown at police in London and at firefighters in Bradford and in Scotland. It comes as a petition calling for a ban on the sale of fireworks to the public has exceeded 160,000 signatures. The petition says fireworks can cause nuisance to the public as well as injuries and damage to buildings and property. A ban has already been called for by the parents of four-year-old Rosie-May Mason, who was scarred by a rocket let off at a back garden display last year in Wales, while senior doctors have called for graphic images of injuries to be displayed on packaging. But the British Fireworks Association has said a ban would be ""heavy handed"" and fireworks should be used responsibly. This video can not be played Footage from inside a fire engine shows the moment fireworks were thrown at firefighters. In Liverpool, volunteer Andy Shute, from homelessness charity the Paper Cup Project, said he helped the Army veteran victim after the ""appalling"" and ""inhumane"" attack in the city. He said he was giving the victim some food and drink in a nearby street when he told him about the incident. The veteran, who is in his late 30s, said he felt one of four teenagers brush past him and ""within seconds"" he could smell burning. Mr Shute said the man told him the firework burnt through his coat and trousers and ""it was only his wallet in his pocket that gave his leg a bit of protection"". He said he then grabbed the firework from his coat and suffered burns on his middle finger. Call to put shock images on fireworks 'I lost my eye after firework exploded' Fire crews attacked on Bonfire Night Ch Insp Paddy Kelly said the ""shocking incident"" would not be tolerated and they were determined to find the offenders and they were trying to find the victim. Elsewhere, a major fire that ripped through a former cattle market in Nottingham on Sundayis being treated as an arson attack involving fireworks. In London, the Metropolitan Police posted a video of fireworks being thrown at officers in Enfield. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In Glasgow,riot police were deployed after masked youths threw fireworks at police officers. A 17-year-old boy will be reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with the incident. The chief constable of Greater Manchester Police has also backed a banon the public sale of fireworks, arguing that they should be restricted to professional displays to stop young people ""terrorising"" communities. Currently anyone over 18 can buy fireworks for use on private property such as their back garden. However it is against the law to set off fireworks in the street or other public places, unless it is part of an organised event by licensed professionals. Those who use fireworks illegally can be fined up to Â£5,000 and imprisoned for up to six months.

"The US mid-term elections on Tuesday will help define the rest of Donald Trump's presidency. Americans will vote for members of both chambers of Congress, as well as for governors in 36 out of 50 states. This is our last daily round-up ahead of the mid-terms, so we've pulled together all our material that matters. Wait...whatarethe mid-terms? (Don't worry, it's OK to ask.) It may feel like the US is always having elections, so what's at stake on Tuesday? What are people voting for? We're here to help.Here's our very simple guidethat hopefully answers everything you want to know. If you were to look at campaign videos alone, it would appear that the key issues on people's minds as they go to the polls were healthcare and immigration. But what do voters themselves say? We asked people in 12 different states what issues are on their minds as they select their candidates. This video can not be played What do American voters care about? Donald Trump's name isn't on the ballot this year, but it might as well be. One important thing to watch on Tuesday will be whether candidates who have embraced the president's rhetoric and tactics end up doing well. This could shape the direction of the Republican party over the next two years. Either way, we can expect these mid-terms, like all others, to be a referendum on the president. The parties of presidents who have low approval ratings tend to do poorly in the mid-terms - and President Trump's are very low indeed. This is one reason Democrats, with the House of Representatives in their sights, are optimistic this year. Here are other reasons Democrats are hopeful There are plenty we could have picked here - any of the close Senate races in Tennessee, Missouri or Arizona for example - but if there's one race that sums up the 2018 mid-terms, it is the close race for governor in Georgia. Like in a number of other states this year, Georgia could see a significant first: Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams would become the first female African-American governor in the US if she won. Her Republican opponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state. His office has been behind the cancellation of 1.5m voter registration applications in four years, and has been accused of voter suppression, one of the hot-button issues this year. As with the divisive race for governor in neighbouring Florida, the Georgia contest has also been laced with racist undertones (or even overtones). Just last week, the Washington Post reported,voters in Georgia received a fake robocall,externalpurporting to be from Oprah Winfrey ""asking you to make my fellow Negress Stacey Abrams the governor of Georgia"". Our correspondent Courtney Subramanian spent time in Georgia looking at how the bitter race has played out. You can read her piece here The first polls will close at 23:00 GMT on Tuesday (that's 18:00 on the east coast of the US). We'll be bringing you coverage live online, on TV and on radio as the results come in. How can you find out where to read, watch and listen? See the schedule for our mid-terms coverage here There are plenty of possible outcomes on Tuesday, and therefore plenty of possible consequences. If you want to see what those consequences are, choose a scenario right here... An election looms - should Trump be worried? Can we tell yet who has the edge?

"Derek Whyteside died after being assaulted A stepfather looking for two stolen bikes was murdered by a 16-year-old armed with a cricket bat, a jury has heard. The teenager ""crept up behind"" Derek Whyteside in Telford, Shropshire, attacking him with a full swing of the bat, Stafford Crown Court was told. Mr Whyteside, 42, suffered a skull fracture and died two days later. The accused denies murder. Two men, aged 41 and 39, previously admitted a charge of affray. Prosecutor Kevin Hegarty QC told jurors Mr Whyteside was attacked in Withywood Drive, Malinslee, on 18 June. ""He was looking for two stolen bicycles and also he was looking for those responsible for stealing them,"" Mr Hegarty said. ""Whilst he was there, he was struck across the back of the head with a bat. The impact fractured his skull and the fracture extended into his right eye socket. ""Before he could take another step, he then collapsed on the ground."" The teenager, who cannot be named due to his age, ""gave Derek Whyteside no chance to take any action to defend himself, to get away or to evade the blow"", Mr Hegarty said. Mr Whyteside suffered skull fractures in the attack, the jury was told on Tuesday Mr Whyteside's head struck the ground as he landed, Mr Hegarty alleged, causing him another fracture. He was then attacked by two men, the court was told. West Mids news: Man jailed for McDonald's attack, plus more The teenager was arrested and told police he had acted in self-defence, the court heard. Jurors were told that Mr Whyteside, of Chesterfield Road, Dawley, was seen carrying a knuckle-duster as he looked for the children's bicycles, which had been taken from outside his home earlier the same day. William Owens, 41, and Gareth Edward Owens, 39, both of Boulton Grange in Randlay, have each admitted a charge of affray. The trial continues.

"Senior ministers have agreed they want to reach a Brexit deal with the EU by the end of November, sources say. ""Everyone saw the difficulties of leaving it longer,"" a senior cabinet source told the BBC. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a detailed suggested timetable of how the government could try to sell a deal to MPs and the public. It includes speeches from Theresa May and support from business figures and foreign leaders. Kuenssberg: A plan for presenting a Brexit deal? In full: The notes of a plan for selling Brexit deal Ireland tells the UK to stick to its commitments The notes, which the government has dismissed, suggest the cabinet had hoped to review a Brexit withdrawal deal when it met earlier. Sources say a final deal was not presented to the cabinet but that ministers agreed they want a deal to be done this month and they could meet again later this week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but the two sides have not yet agreed on the terms of its departure, with the Irish border proving the main sticking point. If a deal can be reached with the EU in time, Mrs May will then need to persuade her party - and the rest of Parliament - to support it in a key Commons vote. The notes seen by the BBC outline how ministers could present the deal, saying: ""The narrative is going to be measured success, that this is good for everyone but won't be all champagne corks popping."" They refer to a speech by Mrs May to the CBI, saying: ""We have delivered on the referendum."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And they go on to talk about the government ""lining up 25 top business voices...and lots of world leaders eg Japanese PM to tweet support for the deal"". It suggests the government would hope to declare they had made decisive progress and to get the deal through Parliament in less than three weeks. Car parts plants to close on Brexit worries But a government spokesman said: ""The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn't represent the government's thinking. ""You would expect the government to have plans for all situations - to be clear, this isn't one of them."" The spokesman did not deny there were advanced plans for building support for a deal if and when it is concluded. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit select committee, said Mrs May should concentrate on securing a deal rather than on how to sell an agreement that was not yet done. ""When you get a deal, you can think about how you are going to tell people about it,"" he told the BBC. Earlier, No 10 said the prime minister assured ministers that the cabinet would meet before the UK agreed to any deal on the terms of the UK's exit. The withdrawal deal is said to be 95% complete but the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. There is disagreement on whether this ""backstop"" should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it should be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has dismissed claims that he might resign At the cabinet meeting it is understood ministers discussed the mechanism for governing the backstop and who should decide when it no longer applied. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is understood to have set out the legal position for an independent review mechanism for the backstop. He is believed to have told ministers there is a legal ""spectrum"" of what is possible to prevent the UK from being trapped ""in limbo"". The Irish border is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. EU negotiator Michel Barnier told a Belgian broadcaster that the Irish border remained the main hurdle to be overcome but if enough progress is made he would recommend that a summit is convened to finalise the deal. Meanwhile, the government has published the criteria for allocating scarce permits for British truckers who need to drive in the EU after Brexit. The permits will be shared out based on: vehicle emissions, number of international journeys in the previous year, number of international journeys as a percentage of all journeys, type of goods transported and an element of chance.

"Derek Whyteside died after being assaulted A stepfather looking for two stolen bikes was murdered by a 16-year-old armed with a cricket bat, a jury has heard. The teenager ""crept up behind"" Derek Whyteside in Telford, Shropshire, attacking him with a full swing of the bat, Stafford Crown Court was told. Mr Whyteside, 42, suffered a skull fracture and died two days later. The accused denies murder. Two men, aged 41 and 39, previously admitted a charge of affray. Prosecutor Kevin Hegarty QC told jurors Mr Whyteside was attacked in Withywood Drive, Malinslee, on 18 June. ""He was looking for two stolen bicycles and also he was looking for those responsible for stealing them,"" Mr Hegarty said. ""Whilst he was there, he was struck across the back of the head with a bat. The impact fractured his skull and the fracture extended into his right eye socket. ""Before he could take another step, he then collapsed on the ground."" The teenager, who cannot be named due to his age, ""gave Derek Whyteside no chance to take any action to defend himself, to get away or to evade the blow"", Mr Hegarty said. Mr Whyteside suffered skull fractures in the attack, the jury was told on Tuesday Mr Whyteside's head struck the ground as he landed, Mr Hegarty alleged, causing him another fracture. He was then attacked by two men, the court was told. West Mids news: Man jailed for McDonald's attack, plus more The teenager was arrested and told police he had acted in self-defence, the court heard. Jurors were told that Mr Whyteside, of Chesterfield Road, Dawley, was seen carrying a knuckle-duster as he looked for the children's bicycles, which had been taken from outside his home earlier the same day. William Owens, 41, and Gareth Edward Owens, 39, both of Boulton Grange in Randlay, have each admitted a charge of affray. The trial continues.

"Pipers was founded by Simon Herring, Alex Albone and James Sweeting PepsiCo is taking another step into the UK snack market by launching a bid to acquire Lincolnshire crisp company Pipers Crisps. PepsiCo already owns Leicester-based Walkers Crisps and American firm Doritos and wants to grow Pipers in the UK and develop its exports. The international food and drink company's bid is subject to approval by the Competition and Markets Authority. Farmers Alex Albone, Simon Herring and James Sweeting founded Pipers in 2004. Based in rural Lincolnshire, it employs more than 75 local people. Pipers' managing director, James McKinney, said: ""We've developed innovative products to suit evolving tastes while establishing a strong foothold in the market. ""PepsiCo's commitment to accelerating the growth of the Pipers brand means more people will be able to enjoy the unique, award-winning flavour of Pipers Crisps.""

"This video can not be played Social workers on the hardest part of their job A steep rise in vulnerable children needing protection over the past 10 years is pushing council children's services in England into crisis, suggests research. There has been a substantial increase in calls from the public and professionals worried about a child, according to a study for the Association of Directors of Children's Services. The number of investigations where a child is believed to be at risk of significant harm has also more than doubled. Over the past year, almost 2.4 million people contacted children's services because they were worried about a child - a 78% increase on 10 years ago, while serious investigations over concerns of significant harm are up from just under 77,000 in 2008 to almost 200,000 last year - a rise of 159%. Council leaders have warned they will have to overspend their budgets to meet demand,though the government says extra money was announced for children's services in the Budget and it is working with councils to ease the pressures and improve children's lives. So why are services designed to protect the most vulnerable children in society facing such a squeeze? The past decade has seen pressure increase across the board in the child protection system - the number of calls from people concerned about a child has nearly doubled. Some of that rise may be down to better awareness but there has also been a substantial increase in children placed on child protection plans, where social workers monitor the way a child is being looked after to keep them safe. The steepest rise has been in the most serious Section 47 investigations. These are carried out when there are fears that a child is at risk of significant harm. In such cases, the stakes couldn't be higher. Social workers, police and other agencies, involved in these investigations, will all remember the deaths of children such asVictoria ClimbiÃ© in 2000,externalandBaby Peter Connelly in 2007. Both were known by the authorities to be at risk but still died at the hands of people close to them. In nearly half of the cases, where social workers carry out an assessment, domestic violence is a factor. The next most common issue is mental health problems. Of the children then placed on child protection plans, the concern in most cases is that the child is being neglected. That is a failure to meet their basic needs, which could, for instance, mean they don't have enough food, the home is cold and they have nowhere to sleep. Throughout the era of austerity, while councils have made cuts elsewhere, they maintain they have tried to protect spending on children's services. But once inflation is taken into account, the money available to protect children has still fallen significantly. That combined with increasing demand and more complex cases has led to councils overspending their budget for children's services. With finances so tight, money has often been concentrated on statutory services, which protect children at risk of neglect or abuse. Councils under financial strain Funding of children's care services 'unsustainable' This has meant cuts to the early intervention teams, who might have been able to ease future pressures. In the last month's Budget, the government announced an extra Â£84m for children's services over five years. Finding and keeping front-line staff in this high-pressure world is a constant issue for local authorities. The most up-to-date figures show a slight increase in the number of social workers but a third will have been with their current local authority for less that two years and 15% will change jobs during the year. There are a high number of vacancies, with an average of 17% of posts empty. Many of these roles are taken on by the more than 5,300 agency social workers in the system but that comes at a cost. Agency staff are paid more than council staff andfigures collected by the BBC show between 2012-13 and 2016-17local authority spending on these temporary staff nearly doubled, reaching Â£356m. Council spent Â£6m on agency staff Abuse row council's staff bill hit Â£16m It is money cash-strapped councils can ill afford.  Even more importantly, frequent changes in social worker are damaging for a child. It is much harder to learn to trust the person there to help you, if they keep changing. Most children that social workers are involved with will remain with their families but the numbers removed from their home and taken into local authority care have risen by 24% in a decade. Of the more than 75,000 children looked after by the state, most will have faced abuse or neglect. Other reasons for a child being in care include family dysfunction or because their family is in acute distress. A small number of children will be there because of their disabilities. Most children in the care system are older, with the largest single group aged between 10 and 15. Boys are slightly more likely to be in care than girls. According to official statistics, an increase in the number of boys has largely been driven by a rise in unaccompanied asylum seeking children, who are more likely to be male. Although most children in care are white (75%), the slight over-representation of children from non-white backgrounds is also thought to reflect the rise in young asylum seekers. There is something of a North-South divide when it comes to the number of children looked after by councils. For instance, in Blackpool out of every 10,000 children there will be 184 in care. That compares with 34 in every 10,000 in Windsor and Maidenhead, part of the Prime Minister Theresa May's Berkshire constituency. Talk to social workers and many will say they are seeing families facing real financial hardship, with austerity and welfare cuts playing their part in pushing people into crisis. That's reflected by research that found children living in the poorest areas were at least 10 times more likely to be taken into care than those in the most affluent parts of the country. It is a pattern that is repeated across all the nations of the UK. TheChild Welfare Inequalities project,externalconcluded deprivation was the largest single factor in families becoming involved in child protection. In the most deprived areas about one child in every 60 was in care, compared with one in every 660 in the wealthiest areas. With poorer areas spending more money on those in care, the team also concluded these authorities had seen more cuts to preventative services. Nearly three-quarters of children being looked after by councils live with foster parents,which costs local authorities about Â£1.7bn a year,external. Since the 1960s, government policy has moved away from residential children's homes. Foster carers play a vital role but there aren't enough of them. A review published in February 2018 said that the shortage depended on what part of the country a child was in and the availability of foster carers able to take on the most challenging young people. Of the children who are not fostered, about 4,000 are placed with their own parents under supervision and nearly 8,000 spend time in children's homes, secure units or living semi-independently. Almost a third of the more than 31,000 children who left care in 2017 returned to their families. About 14% were adopted, after spending an average of two years in care. For 12% of the children, there were special guardianship orders, where a relative took on their care. The number of adoptions has fallen since its peak in 2015, which followed a high profile push to increase numbers by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron. Most of the children who were adopted in 2017 were aged between one and four years old. Only 1% of adopted children were aged 10 or over, even though this represents the largest age group of children being looked after by councils. About a quarter of children who cease to be looked after when they reach their 18th birthdays continue to live with their foster parents but the future for many care leavers is difficult. Of the 18- to 21-year-olds who stayed in touch with councils, 40% were not in education, training or employment. Although half of care leavers were in some form of education, training or employment, only 6% went to university. That compares with 33% of all 18-year-olds.  It's also estimated that about a quarter of inmates in youth prisons have spent time in care. Additional research by Ben Butcher and charts by Visual Journalism Unit.

"Zamira Hajiyeva is said to have spent more than Â£4,000 pounds a day at Harrods A woman who spent Â£16m at Harrods and became the subject of the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order has been arrested and faces extradition. Zamira Hajiyeva, 55, is the wife of an ex-state banker who is serving a 15-year prison sentence for embezzlement in their home country of Azerbaijan. Mrs Hajiyeva, who lives in a Â£15m house near the London store, became the first person to be served a UWO by the National Crime Agency last month. Her lawyers say she is no ""fraudster"". The UWO means she has to explain the origin of her fortune. It was revealed at Westminster Magistrates Court in London that Mrs Hajiyeva was arrested last week by officers from the Metropolitan Police acting on an extradition request from the authorities in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku. She faces two charges of embezzlement and has been held in custody since giving herself up voluntarily last Tuesday. At a bail hearing, prosecutors argued that she should not be released, claiming she posed a flight risk. Her legal team argued that though she was clearly a ""spendthrift"", she was not ""a fraudster"" or likely to flee the country. Hugo Keith QC added that her children were based in the UK, where she has also lived for almost a decade having left Azerbaijan after surviving a violent kidnapping. Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot agreed that Mrs Hajiyeva could be released on bail - if she pays Â£500,000 as a guarantee, stays at her home in Knightsbridge, does not travel outside the M25 and reports to police every day. But prosecutors immediately appealed, meaning she will remain in custody. The appeal hearing is expected to take place on Thursday at the High Court. Mrs Hajiyeva also remains under investigation by the NCA. Last week, the agency seized jewellery belonging to her family that was worth more than Â£400,000 and was due to be auctioned at Christie's auction house.

"Fashion blogger Sarah Benziane wears New Look More than 120 New Look stores may close at it tries to revive its fortunes. The fashion retailer said in March it wouldshut 60 storesthrough a restructuring deal with its creditors, to cut costs and improve profitability. On Tuesday it said that had risen to 85, because landlords have been exercising their rights under the deal to take back stores and relet them. Talks with landlords on 13 stores continue, while the fate of 26 shops trading rent-free is unclear. Comparable sales at New Look, which will be left with about 500 UK stores following the closures, fell 3.7% for the 26 weeks to 22 September. That was an improvement on the 8.6% slump for the same period last year. Despite falling sales, underlying operating profits improved to Â£22.2m compared with a loss of Â£10.4m last year. Executive chairman Alistair McGeorge said retailers continued to face ""significant headwinds and uncertainties, including Brexit"". ""Clearly the wider retail environment remains challenging and we are not expecting that to change anytime soon. However, we are on the right track and continue to drive further efficiencies across the business,"" he said. New Look aimed to improve profitability with more full-price sales and an expanded online operation. Savings of Â£70m had been achieved, and a further Â£8m identified, it added. Of the 60 stores earmarked for closure, 24 have gone, the company has renegotiated rents on 10 and 26 remain open and are trading rent free, at least until after Christmas. The current plans will leave the retailer with 508 stores. Last month the chain said it was bailing out of China, with other international operations also under review. South African retail magnate Christo Wiese's investment vehicle Braitbought 90% of New Look in 2015for Â£780m from private equity firms Apax and Permira. The remaining stake was held by Tom Singh, who founded New Look in 1969, and senior managers. Apax and Permira abandoned plans to float the highly indebted chain on the London stock exchange in 2010 due to market volatility in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr Wiese also controls Steinhoff, whose shares crashed in December 2017 following the revelation of accounting irregularities. Steinhoff owns Poundland, Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK and 40 other local brands in about 30 countries.

"The Democrats' hopes of winning control of the US Senate have been dealt a blow in the mid-term elections. A Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, and two US networks predict they will take control of the chamber. Republicans currently control both legislative chambers. President Trump is not up for re-election until 2020, but Tuesday's poll will shape his agenda for the remainder of his two years in office. Republicans look likely now to retain control of the Senate - they currently have a slim 51-49 majority, but only nine of the party's seats were up for grabs, while Democrats were defending 26 seats. Republican businessman Mike Braun was projected to oust first-term incumbent Joe Donnelly, a moderate Democrat in Indiana. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump had ""closed the deal"" for Mr Braun after holding a rally in the state on Monday night. This video can not be played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont: 'President is a pathological liar' Republican Marsha Blackburn won a Senate seat in Tennessee against Democrat Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by pop star Taylor Swift. There was some consolation for Democrats as Senators Joe Manchin and Bob Menendez held on to their seats after tough campaigns in West Virginia and New Jersey respectively. Mr Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination narrowly survived sexual assault claims. A cliff-hanging vote count in Florida has Republican Rick Scott neck and neck with incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson.

Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams could become the first female African-American governor in the US. Her Republican opponent Brian Kemp's office has been accused of voter suppression. To add to polling day tensions, broken voting machines led to longer queues and a return to paper ballots in some parts of the state. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. Key takeaways from election so far After months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force. Around 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. In Texas, early voting exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. Some states showed signs of being overwhelmed by the voter influx, however. There were reports of electronic voting machine failures and congested polling stations - including in Georgia, Atlanta, Arizona, and New York. Relief at social networks as defences hold A Homeland Security official said the department had received ""sparse"" reports of tech failure, but that there seemed to have been no significant impact on people's ability to vote.

"Ashley Roberts (left) and Katie Piper (right) with Stacey Solomon at the launch of her Primark collection last month Primark has blamed three periods of unseasonable weather for sliding sales over the past year. The fast fashion retailer, owned by Associated British Foods, said sales fell 2.1% for the year to 15 September at stores open more than 12 months. The decline compared with a 1% increase for the previous year. As well as the cold snap at the start of this year and the summer heatwave, trading was also hit by an unusually warm autumn in Europe in 2017. However, total Primark sales were up 5%, driven by opening 15 new stores in nine countries totalling another 900,000 sq ft of trading space. In the UK, like-for-like sales rose 1.2% and the chain won a ""significantly"" bigger share of the clothing market, but sales in Europe slid 4.7%. Primark is unusual in not selling online and uses its website to direct customers to one of its 360 stores. ABF chief executive George Weston told the BBC it had no plans to change: ""We don't see the business need to go online... it's too costly at our price points."" Sophie Lund-Yates, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said Primark ""continues to open up new stores, which given the challenges other bricks and mortar retailers are facing looks a bold move - but it's working"". ""Overall sales growth is continuing despite declining like-for-like sales, and a popular summer range means margins and profits continue to climb."" ABF's retail operations accounted for just under half of its Â£15.6bn in revenues, which were up 1% from last year, with the remainder divided between its sugar, ingredients, grocery and agriculture divisions. Adjusted pre-tax profit rose 5% to Â£1.37bn. Mr Weston said strong profits at Primark and the grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses more than offset the decline in returns from sugar, which was caused mainly by low prices following EU rule changes. Primark plans to open another one million sq ft of retail space in the next financial year, including a huge 160,000 sq ft store in Birmingham that will become its biggest outlet. The city centre store had been due to open before Christmas, but that has been pushed back to the spring. After its store in central Belfast was destroyed by fire in August, the retailer will open an outlet in Commonwealth House in the city and plans to restore the damaged Bank Buildings in the longer term. Primark's Belfast store was destroyed by fire in August The chain plans to open large new stores in Bordeaux, Brussels, Utrecht and Milton Keynes in 2019, along with its first in Slovenia - Primark's 12th territory. It is also aiming to enter more central and eastern European markets and has signed a lease in Warsaw for its first store in Poland. The company now has nine stores in the US after opening in Brooklyn in July. That site has been trading ""very strongly"" and ABF said it was ""very pleased with our US performance in the second half of this year"". New stores will open in New Jersey next year and another in Florida in 2020, while more are planned. Meanwhile, a barometer of UK retail spending found sales growth was almost flat in October. The British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor found like-for-like sales rose by just 0.1% compared with the same month last year. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: ""Grocery sales - which have been a ray of light - actually showed signs of restraint. However, clothing sales were more promising, with the colder weather towards the end of the month prompting a wardrobe rethink.""

"The Justice4Grenfell campaign group said the video ""has caused great alarm and distress"" A house linked to an ""offensive"" video showing a model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire has been searched by police. Six men - two aged 49, two aged 19 and the others 46 and 55 - were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and have been released under investigation. A video shared on social media shows a cardboard model of the tower being set alight by a laughing crowd. Prime Minister Theresa May had called the video ""utterly unacceptable"". The men were arrested after handing themselves in. The footage shows a large model bearing a Grenfell Tower sign, complete with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire. Footage shows a large flammable model marked ""Grenfell Tower"" with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire Laughter can be heard off camera as the effigy is set alight, with onlookers shouting ""Help me! Help me!"" and ""Jump out the window!"". As the blaze takes hold, a voice can be heard to say ""All the little ninjas getting it at the minute"" while the camera focuses on a paper cut-out with a face covering. At the end of the clip a person can be heard saying: ""That's what happens when they don't pay their rent."" Grenfell fire: When does causing offence become a crime? Police searched a house in South Norwood, south London, taking away two clear plastic bags which appeared to contain gaffer tape and white tags. The officers were at the house for around two hours. Police officers left the South Norwood property taking evidence Rukayet Mamadu, a survivor of the fire, called the video the ""climax of intolerance of the system and society"". She told theVictoria Derbyshire programme: ""It's chilling, it's cold-blooded. I feel so bad, let alone people who lost relatives. ""This should be brought to justice."" A total of 72 people were killedin the devastating blaze at the west London tower block in June 2017. The men have been arrested undersection 4a of the Public Order Act 1986,external, which covers intentional ""harassment, alarm or distress"" caused via the use of ""threatening, abusive or insulting"" words or signs. Offences committed on a private residence where a person ""had no reason to believe"" it would be ""heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling"" are protected from prosecution under the act. Moyra Samuels, from the Justice For Grenfell campaign group, called the video a ""disgusting attack"" Moyra Samuels, part of the Justice For Grenfell campaign group, told the BBC the video was ""a disgusting attack on vulnerable people"".

""But there is a worrying rise of racism in this country at the moment. And that is concerning, because it's now starting to impact on us directly, which means that we actually need to be thinking what we do about this, and how we respond to this as a whole."" Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: ""Not only is it extremely upsetting to survivors and people who lost family, it's hateful and offensive to everyone that has been affected by the tragic events of that night."" Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who is leading the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, said he was ""very pleased to hear the authorities are taking the matter seriously"" at the start of Tuesday's evidence session.

"Correlations between screen time and lack of sleep are ""extremely modest"", says the report The amount of time children spend on devices has little effect on how long they sleep, a study from Oxford University suggests. It runs counter to previous research that suggested excessive screen time was linked to children failing to get sufficient rest. The survey concluded that the relationship between sleep and screen use in children was ""extremely modest"". But one UK GP said the findings did not tally with his clinical experience. The study, conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute, relied on data from a 2016 US study into children's health, in which parents from across the country completed surveys about their households. The children's ""digital screen time"" was based on answers to two questions about the weekday habits of children aged between six months and 17 years: how much time they spent on computers, mobile phones, handheld video games and other electronic devices how much time they spent in front of a TV watching programmes and other content as well as playing video games The findings indicate that the tech-abstaining teenagers slept only slightly longer than their counterparts who had spent much of their day in front of a screen. For example, teenagers who had not been in front of a screen for any part of the day got a total of eight hours and 51 minutes of sleep. Those who had spent eight hours of their day glued to a screen got eight hours and 21 minutes of slumber. The sample size for the survey was more than 50,000 youngsters from every state in the US. The study,published in the Journal of Pediatrics,external, said every hour of screen time was linked to between three to eight fewer minutes of sleep a night. Screens are now a fixture of modern childhood and both professionals and parents are increasingly expressing concerns that the amount of time children devote to devices affects their physical and mental health. When it comes to sleep, there are concerns that children take devices to bed and continue to use them when they should be sleeping. Others have expressed worries about the role the blue light emitted from such devices plays on sleep habits and a related hormone. The US National Sleep Foundation has told parents that it is important to stop children using electronic devices before bedtime ""because the blue light emitted from these screens can delay the release of sleep-inducing melatonin"". ""This is an especially big problem for teens whose circadian rhythms are already shifting naturally, causing them to feel awake later at night. The end result: sleep-deprived or poorly rested kids who have essentially given themselves a mini case of jet lag,""it writes on its website.,external But the study author thinks other factors should be considered. ""Focusing on bedtime routines and regular patterns of sleep, such as consistent wake-up times, are much more effective strategies for helping young people sleep than thinking screens themselves play a significant role,"" said study author Prof Andrew Przbylski. Prof Przbylski told the BBC that many of the studies suggesting links between screen time and lack of sleep had very small sample sizes and need ""much larger studies"" to find conclusive evidence of a problem. ""Because the effects of screens are so modest, it is possible that many studies with smaller sample sizes could be false positives - results that support an effect that in reality does not exist,"" he said. He acknowledged that the data used in the study was ""imperfect"" because it relied on reports from parents. A further study into the time that children turn off their devices before bedtime will be published shortly. Many of the large technology firms, including Apple, Google and Facebook, have introduced dashboards allowing people to keep a check on the amount of time they spend on screens. Some leading technology executives have banned their own children from using devices. The late Apple chief Steve Jobs's young children were notably not allowed iPads. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates banned phones until his children were teenagers. And Tim Cook, Apple's current leader, has said he would not let his nephew join social networks. One UK GP, Rangan Chatterjee, said the Oxford University study was ""welcome"" but that he did not plan to change his advice to parents, which was to turn off devices an hour before bedtime. ""The more research on this area, the better because screens are here to stay,"" he told the BBC. ""But the findings don't replicate what I see in clinical practice which is that the use of screens right before bed has a significant impact on the quality of sleep.""

"MPs on DCMS Committee hold inquiry into fake news Treasury questions at start of day in Commons MPs to hold general debate on Armistice Peers start day in Chamber at 11am House of Lords to examine statutory instruments Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage of the Commons today. Earlier, the Chancellor faced questions on the increased investment in Universal Credit and the treasury's plans for a possible no-deal scenario. After this, shadow Home Office minister Louise Haigh asked an urgent question on police pension liabilities and the impact on the front line. Shadow mental health and social care minister Barbara Keeley then asked the second urgent question of the day on the long-term seclusion and deaths of autistic people and those with learning disabilities in assessment and treatment units. Following a short suspension of the sitting so MPs could attend a service marking the centenary of the Armistice at St. Margaret's church, the SNP's Marion Fellows then introduced her Child Maintenance Bill as a ten minute rule motion. Since then, MPs have been engaged in a passionate and emotional general debate marking the centenary of the Armistice. MPs now have a three day recess from the House of Commons and business will resume on Monday at 2.30pm with questions to education ministers.  Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Freshly appointed Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister Mims Davis is now wrapping up the debate for the government, paying tribute to those that have spoken. ""It really has been the most poignant and often painful afternoon,"" she says, particularly praising the ""magnificent"" speech by shadow culture secretary Tom Watson. She pays tribute to the Royal British Legion, mentioning her constituent Norman Brown who has raised over Â£1 million for the charity. ""It has been heartening to see this house come together to pay tribute to those who tragically paid the ultimate price"", she says. ""We will remember them."" The debate comes to a close and the house adjourns until next week. Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Summing up the debate, shadow arts and heritage minister Kevin Brennan says it is ""fantastic"" that the debate has included comments from members representing all areas of the UK, as the First World War affected all communities and ""we all must remember."" ""What we've heard has been an honest appraisal of the Great War, of all its aspects, good and bad,"" he says. Mr Brennan says he is ""glad that the 1.7 million Indian personnel have rightfully been recognised"". ""On the centenary of the Armistice we should honour those who died, be grateful that the event came to an end, and be committed to ensuring it does not happen again,"" he adds. Mr Brennan says ""we must not forget the role of women during the war effort, and the enfranchisement of some women. ""These were the stars of the home front,"" he says, ""it's because of these sacrifices that commemorating the war is such an essential event every year."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Vicky Ford is the last back bencher to speak in the debate, telling MPs how she first sold poppies when she was growing up in Northern Ireland, when there were armed servicemen in the streets, and joined poppy sellers last week in Chelmsford. She pays tribute to the Quakers, who took a moral stand to war and created the Friends Ambulance Service, providing a way that conscientious objectors were able to help. In 1947 they were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, she says. ""Jesus said ""greater love have no man than this, than a man who lays down his life for his friends"" but he also said ""blessed are the peace makers"", and we must remember them, and we must remember them all."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Stephen Kerr says Stirling's contribution to the war effort ""was not unsubstantial"". He says it is important that all soldiers and those involved in the war effort and remembered around the UK this weekend. ""This generation put themselves last and community and their country first,"" he says, ""they have us the country we have today."" Mr Kerr says ""it is our duty and privilege to honour them and to build a country they would feel proud of."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Jim Shannon says it is an honour to follow ""incredible speeches"" from MPs, and that he is proud to have served in the armed forces, ""I'm proud to have worn the uniform."" He speaks of those from Ireland that fought, ""the German bullet did not distinguish between Catholic and Protestant, of nationalist and unionist."" ""I am tired of this remembrance of it being politicised"", he says, ""and turned so that wearing a poppy is considered a display of allegiance...Wearing a poppy is merely being respectful."" He says he is pleased things are changing, with more than previously did in on the island of Ireland marking the Armistice. Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Kevin Foster says it is ""particularly poignant"" that many of the soldiers who died were under 20 years old. ""This was a war on an industrial scale for the first time in human history,"" he says. Mr Foster says ""bodies laid in the field for three years, in a field where so many comrades had fallen. ""By the time they were recovered, most of those bodies could not be identified."" He says ""thankfully today Europe is a very different place, some of our former foes are now are friends."" ""It is right that the German president has been invited to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Day,"" he adds.  Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP for Reading East Matt Rodda says he, like many others, lost relatives in the wars and has found today's debate ""incredibly moving"". He mentions his wife's relative who died on the Somme and whose body was never found ""Britain owes a huge debt of honour to the Commons and what was then the British Empire"", he says, focusing his further remarks on those in Reading that fought. He talks of Fred Pots, the only man from Reading to be awarded a Victoria Cross, whose family he later came to know, ""in a strange way, our history is all around us."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative peer Kevin Hollinrake says ""even a century later every family is touched by the events of the First World War"". Mr Hollinrake says ""it is paramount therefore that we all remember these events."" He tells the story of his grandfather's father who survived the war and stayed in the army until 1922 ""he was lucky, but suffered the severe consequences of being involved in such a deadly war"". ""Today all we can do is salute the soldiers, and all those who made such sacrifices,"" he says, ""today, and every day, lest we forget."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament SNP culture spokesman Brendan O'Hara talks of his grandfather John O'Hara, who joined the war in 1916 aged 17, sent to fight in 1917. He says he was injured at Passchendaele and tells MPs how he returned home, and of the life he lived after. ""Ours is just one of the millions of stories that families across the UK have,"" he says. Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Alex Burghart says this week's commemorations of the centenary of the Armistice has made him think of his Grandma and her friend Ms H who never married. Mr Burghart recalls a census from 1921 which found there were 1.7 million more women than men in Britain, and how they were known as ""surplus women"" and ""were told they would never marry as all the men had died in the war"". ""These women went out and made sure their future was not defined by relationships to men,"" he says. He adds that the sacrifice of these women ""deserves no less remembrance"". Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Vernon Coaker begins referencing ""a man my grandfather referred to as Sergeant Vernon Coaker"", who was killed in 1914, and his wife's grandfather, who also served in the war. What would people like that think looking at our commemorations today, he asks, adding that ""one thing we should be particularly proud of"" is the number of young people involved with commemorations. ""These people died because there was a failure of people to work together,"" he says, ""they sacrificed themselves in order to win back that, but it also was because of a failure to respect those values."" He says it is with great pride that he sees the conversations being had with young people about the need to work together. Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone says his grandfather's youngest brother Walter Stone joined the war effort in 1914 and was at the front of an attack on 30th November 1917. ""He died fighting to the last along with those soliders who stayed with him, a source of great family pride,"" he says, ""he was awarded the prestigious Victoria Cross."" Mr Stone adds that ""their bodies were not found, but it is hoped that the Germans may have buried them."" He adds that he recognises many family names from the area when he looks at the memorial in his constituency as ""it is a close knit community, and this puts it all into perspective."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP John Redwood says when he lays wreaths he will be conscious of the war memorials he can't visit, and how long the lists on them are. ""What scale of loss that is difficult to comprehend and wrestle with,"" he says. He speaks of his relatives who fought in the war and survived, who tried to protect him from the horrors they had experienced when he asked them about it. ""We owe it to them to have a proper analysis and discussion of how we can do better in the future. ""I'm no pacifist...but we fought in too many wars and too often we sent our army into wars where they had limited chances of winning."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he is proud to wear the poppy embedded into a three leaved shamrock, ""with the shamrock representing Irish people who died fighting for the United Kingdom, which of course, we were part of in the First World War"". ""I wear the shamrock poppy with pride,"" he says. He says Irishmen should be remembered alongside those nearer to Westminster, as ""there were 200,000 of us."" ""We have made progress in the last four years in commemorating and remembering the First World War and making it a shared experience in Ireland, for all parts of Ireland, acknowledging that everyone suffered losses,"" he says. Sir Jeffrey adds that ""we fought in common cause for the freedom of so many in Europe and that should be commemorated by us all."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Gillian Keegan says she welcomes the work of the Maritime Archaeology Trust alongside other organisations who are ""spreading the knowledge of the forgotten ships that were lost during the war"". ""Many British servicemen died on the ships, and now the ships are their coffins,"" she says. ""The Maritime Archaeology Trust are doing great work in mapping where these ships sank,"" she adds, encouraging more work to be done in this area ""so the public have more knowledge of those who died at sea"". Ms Keegan says ""everything should be done to preserve war graves"", and that whilst it is ""fantastic"" that centenary commemorations are so wide spread, ""we must not forget the names and stories of these individuals next year."" Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says he wants to highlight the role of those who came ""from far flung parts of our globe"" to fight in WWI, as often they are ""forgotten or understated in modern day Britain"". Even in war movies, there is a ""palpable lack of brown and black faces"", he says, suggesting this is one of the reasons why ""we are not able to effectively counter the rise of the far right that seeks to divide us"". Over one and a half million people came from the Indian subcontinent, he says, ""the largest volunteer army in history"". As ""the first ever turbaned Sikh MP"", he says he feels he should pay tribute to the Sikhs in particular, ""we are so proud of our forefathers."" ""Sikhs made up just over 2% of pre-division India,"" he says, but 20% of the Indian army in WWI. More than 83,000 turbaned Sikh soldier died in the First World War, he adds, with many in the first months of the war refusing to take shelter in the trenches because they felt it suggested cowardice. He asks where their war memorial is in London, adding that the government has now pledged their support for one. Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative John Howell says he wants to focus on how we should remember the fallen. He says in his constituency of Henley there is a choir who are commemorating the centenary of the Armistice and he sang with them at a Cathedral in Ypres, which was ""extremely poignant"". Mr Howell says reading the names of the individuals who have lost their lives ""is incredibly powerful"" and ""a great way of remembering their identity"". ""Each solider who fought for our country should have their story heard,"" he says. Mr Howell adds that the First World War inspired the Council of Europe which ""is an important institution which helps to uphold peace around the world today"".  Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Bob Stewart talks of attending the funerals of men and women in his company who had served under his command in Northern Ireland in 1982. After one funeral, he says, he spoke with an older lady who was weeping outside the church, who told him that when she was young she saw eight hundred local boys enter the church, and after WWI ""there were only enough of them to fill three pews in the church."" ""That lady was recalling hundreds of boys who certainly didn't want to die in battle...those soldiers had very little choice. ""Of course we must remember them, but personally I always remember everyone, soldiers and civilians, killed in all conflicts."" ""Right now"", he says, ""I'm always remembering the soldiers and girls and one boy"" who at Ballykelly were killed on the 6th of December, 1982. Centenary of the Armistice Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Hilary Benn says he wants to talk about his great uncle Oliver who never came home from the war. Mr Benn says Oliver was posted missing after a battle, and all of his mothers letters were sent back to her. He says his son has compiled these unreceived letters into a book to learn more about his great uncle Oliver. ""His body was never found, he was 38 years old,"" Mr Benn says, wiping a tear from his eye. He also pays his respects to George Ellison from Leeds who died at 9.30am ""just an hour and a half before the armistice"". ""May those who fell forever rest in peace, as we who are left will always remember them.""  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Gates used the beaker of faeces to highlight bacteria and sanitation-related disease Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates had his hands full on-stage in Beijing on Tuesday, showing a jar of human faeces. The stunt was part of his speech at the Reinvented Toilet Expo event - a showcase for new toilet technologies. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has spent more than $200m on researching the field across the last seven years. Twenty cutting-edge sanitation products were on display, intended to destroy harmful bacteria and prevent disease. ""I have to say, a decade ago I never imagined that I'd know so much about poop,"" Mr Gates joked at the conference. ""And I definitely never thought that Melinda would have to tell me to stop talking about toilets and faecal sludge at the dinner table."" The entrepreneur was helping to launch the three-day event in China - where leader Xi Jinping has made a so-called ""toilet revolution"" across the country a policy priority. Bill Gates reduces Microsoft stake with donation Bill Gates drinks water distilled from faeces BBC Innovators- Game Changers - BBC News The showcased products aim to revolutionise sanitation technology by operating off-grid to separate liquid and solid waste and remove harmful by-products. ""It's no longer a question of if we can reinvent the toilet and other sanitation systems,"" he said. ""It's a question of how quickly this new category of off-grid solutions will scale."" The entrepreneur described the inventions on display as the ""most significant advances in sanitation in nearly 200 years"". The technology giant pointed out the jar of faeces beside him could contain ""as many as 200 trillion rotavirus... 20 billion Shigella bacteria, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs"". Mr Gates' foundation - which he has donated billions to - operates in 130 countries According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 2.3 billion people around the world still don't have access to basic sanitation facilities. This can cause diseases like cholera, diarrhoea and dysentery which kill hundreds of thousands of people every year. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gates discussed the inequalities in sanitation access. ""In rich countries we have sewers that take clean water in, flush some of the dirty water out, in almost all cases there's a treatment plant,"" he said. ""As we have these newer cities with lots of less wealthy people in them, those sewers have not been built and in fact, it's not likely they ever will be, so the question is, could you do it? Could you process human waste without that sewer system?"" The foundation has said they hope the reinvented toilet will first roll out in buildings like schools and apartment buildings, before costs gradually decline and they become affordable in households. Crypto-currencies cause deaths, says Gates ""You're only going to pay hundreds of dollars for a toilet - if it's really fantastic maybe $500,"" Mr Gates told the BBC. ""You're saving all the costs of the waters, the processing products, but we have to bring it down by almost a factor of 10 from what the models are like - but that's not atypical for new product markets."" On his trip, Mr Gates also appeared at the First China International Import Expo in Shanghai, at a time of tension between the US and China. The world's two largest economies have been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war over tariffs for much of the year. Gates: Pathogen could kill 30m in a year.

"Vital home care services for the elderly and vulnerable could be disrupted, regulators say. The Care Quality Commission has issued a notice saying it has serious doubts about the future of Allied Healthcare. The CQC said it was concerned about its prospects from the end of this month, but the firm said the move was ""premature and unwarranted"". The company provides services, such as help washing and dressing, to more than 13,000 people across the UK. The CQC just has responsibility for England, where 9,300 people rely on Allied Healthcare services across 84 council areas, more than half the total. The regulator has written to all the affected local authorities as they would have responsibility to step in if services are disrupted. Allied Healthcare announced earlier this year it was struggling with debts blaming low fees paid by councils, but it did manage to restructure its finances on that occasion. But the CQC has now said the company had only be able to confirm it had funding in place until 30 November. The regulator said it had a legal duty to warn councils that business failure was likely and services could stop as a result in its view. It does not mean failure will definitely happen, just that as things stand it is deemed likely. The BBC understands there has already been an offer made from a new lender that could secure the firm's immediate future. This is the first time a notice like this has been issued to a whole provider - previous warnings have just related to individual services. Andrea Sutcliffe, from the CQC, said: ""I understand this is a very unsettling time for everyone who uses Allied Healthcare's services, their families and loved ones, and staff. ""We will continue to work closely with Allied Healthcare and all of our partners to make sure appropriate action is being taken in the interests of people's continuity of care if this proves necessary. ""It is of course possible that the company is able to avoid service disruption, and if that is the case, we will revise our position accordingly."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there was currently no disruption to any services provided by Allied Healthcare, and that local authorities were being given time to ensure continuity of care for people using services. But a spokesman for Allied Healthcare said the company was ""surprised and deeply disappointed"" by the move. He said it was ""premature and unwarranted"" as there was no risk to services because financing had been secured. ""The CQC has disregarded these assurances in spite of the robust evidence we have provided,"" he added. The news comes just weeks after the UK Homecare Association, the umbrella group for providers, warned services were being put at risk becausecouncils were trying to get care ""on the cheap"". Its report said only one in seven local authorities were paying a fair price for care, forcing a number of firms to pull out of contracts.

"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced he is resigning from his role as the top law official It follows months of criticism from President Trump over the Department of Justice's handling of the Russia inquiry The announcement came a day after mid-term elections, in which Democrats took control of the House of Representatives But Republicans have retained control of the Senate, with key victories in Indiana, Texas and North Dakota Trump announced that Matthew Whitaker, chief of staff at the Department of Justice, will be the new acting attorney general Ritu Prasad and Max Matza Our main story will keep you up to speed on the aftermath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' firing. As things stand, there's a whole slew of questions about the fate of Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry now that Trump's pick for acting attorney general appears to favour an end to the investigation. With Democrats soon to be in control of the House, they'll have the ability to launch investigations and consider impeachment. However, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - who could become the next House Majority Speaker - and President Trump have vowed to work together. But will the drama around America's top law enforcement official coupled with the new makeup of Congress lead to more compromise or commotion? Jeff Sessions is the latest official to leave the Trump team. Here's our running list of everyone who has left - or been asked to leave - by Donald Trump.

Aleem MaqboolBBC North America correspondent He may be claiming a ""big victory"" in these mid-term elections, but it's clear Donald Trump recognises he's in for - if nothing else - lots of irritation over the next two years. Through winning control of the House of Representatives, Democrats will have much more power to scrutinise the actions of the White Houseâ¦ and things like the president's tax affairs or even alleged sexual misconduct by him. Having said that, an increase in the majority of his party in the Senate - he believes because he supported most of the Senators who won - means President Trump will continue to have his own way in cabinet and judicial appointments. Speaking of whichâ¦he'll very soon be asking the Senate to confirm a new attorney general. In his first major act after the election, Donald Trump fired his last one - Jeff Sessions. He was incensed that Mr Sessions stepped aside - to avoid conflict of interest - from overseeing the investigation into Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump's message to election candidates and political appointees alike today is that if they do his bidding, he'll stand by them and they'd survive. But if they didn't - they'd be out in the cold.

Six men - two aged 49, two aged 19 and the others 46 and 55 - were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and have been released under investigation. A video shared on social media shows a cardboard model of the tower being set alight by a laughing crowd. Prime Minister Theresa May had called the video ""utterly unacceptable"". The men were arrested after handing themselves in. The footage shows a large model bearing a Grenfell Tower sign, complete with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire.

"Bullying and harassment is such a problem in the world of chemistry that a dedicated helpline is being set up for victims, a scientific body says. TheRoyal Society of Chemistry,externalsays people were being denied opportunities because of ""a culture of secrecy"" and the 'unchecked power of managers'. The research showed both men and women have been bullied and harassed by colleagues. But it was mostly women who were discriminated against. It's hoped the helpline will increase the number of women chemists. Professor Rachel O'Reilly is now Head of the Chemistry School at the University of Birmingham. But, in previous roles, she says she's ""had issues or witnessed others"" facing discrimination. ""I've been called 'little woman' a lot."" Rachel O'Reilly hopes the helpline will bring changes to her industry At a previous university, she was told that having children would create more work for other people in her department. ""It makes me really cross and really disappointed."" She says: ""Academics can be a bit like rock stars. You hear about all the bad behaviours, but they're untouchable because of what they do."" ""Young people can see this happening and think that's what you have to do to be successful, and it's this awful cycle."" This problem isn't exclusive to chemical sciences, or science in general, but this is the first time a professional science organisation has taken such a step. Research shows that just under half of students studying the subject at university are women, but the numbers working in senior roles in chemical sciences are ""exceptionally poor"". The RSC says this is partly because of the way funding is allocated, but their latest survey found there is a ""culture of secrecy"", a ""lack of accountability around harassment' and an 'unchecked power of a managers in some teams and institutions"". The society's director of science and communities, Dr Jo Reynolds, says they were surprised by their findings as they hadn't asked any questions about bullying or harassment. ""We weren't looking for evidence of bullying and harassment [in this report] but it was one of the things that came out unprompted,"" she said. ""It's really disappointing to learn we are losing talent because of these cultural issues. We need to fix the environment in which this culture exists"" The society also wants institutions and individuals to be denied funding when evidence of bullying has been found. This helpline is expected to be running by Summer 2019 and the society hopes it'll help all chemists reach their full potential. It's also promising to do more to recognise departments which make significant progress when it comes to diversity and inclusion, create carers grants and launch a gender equality forum. When it comes to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), women make up just 21% of the UK workforce. In October, asenior scientist was criticisedafter giving a workshop where he said ""physics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation."" Prof Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University, in Italy, was suspended after the presentation at the particle physics laboratory Cern, which is based in Geneva, Switzerland. A recent report into allegations of bullying and gender discrimination at theWellcome Sanger Institute,external, a genomics and genetics research institute, concluded no wrongdoing took place, but that the institute's policies could be improved.

"Officers were called to reports of a shooting in Greenleaf Close, Tulse Hill A 16-year-old boy has died in a suspected stabbing in south London. The Metropolitan Police said initial inquiries suggested the teenager died of stab wounds in Tulse Hill on Monday. Officers were first called to reports of a shooting in Greenleaf Close at 22:53 GMT where the boy was found unconscious. He died shortly after. The Met has deployed hundreds of extra officers on the streets of the capital in the wake of recent deaths. The victim's parents saw their son dying as they waited up to 15 minutes for emergency crews to arrive, an eyewitness said. The victim's parents saw their son dying as they waited up to 15 minutes for emergency crews to arrive The teenager, who did not live on the estate according to eyewitnesses, was being collected by his parents to take him home when ""an attack"" took place. Detectives believe the victim was attacked by a number of suspects. Paulina Wedderburn, who lived in the area, said she thought she heard a gunshot and a ""big black Audi"" driving away before finding the teenager in a driveway, looking like an ""angel"". She said: ""I just feel sorry for the mum. The mum's screams I can't get out of my head. ""What's going on? What is it? Why do they have to be killing each other?"" One of the boy's friends, who had dinner with him on Monday evening, described the victim as ""bubbly"" and a ""friendly type"" who was ""respectful"". Another friend, who also did not want to be named, said he heard a person say ""we got him, we got him"", after hearing what he thought was a gunshot. BBC Radio London correspondent Greg McKenzie said he had been told by one of the boy's friends that the victim ""was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time"". No arrests have been made over Monday's killing and the boy's next-of-kin have been informed. Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward. Ch Supt Simon Messinger, commander of the Central South Command Unit, said extra officers were being assigned to south London. This latest death comes after four people - two teenagers and two men - died in knife attacks in London in five days. London violence 'to take 10 years to solve' The suspected murder means the number of homicides in the capital during 2018 has now reached 119 - three more than in 2017.

"This video can not be played Michelin workers in Dundee react to factory closure Dundee Michelin factory workers have spoken of their shock after the company announced its intention to close the plant, with the loss of all 845 jobs. The tyre factory will close by mid-2020 after the French firm deemed it ""unsuitable"" in the current climate. Scotland's economy secretary Derek Mackay said he will convene an action group to ""explore all options to secure a sustainable future for the site."" Workers were sent home until Thursday following a meeting at the factory. Some employees told BBC Scotland they were angry that they first learned about the decision from the media on Monday. A dark day in Dundee One worker said: ""When we heard yesterday we thought it was a wind up. ""I heard it through social media, which is a big disappointment. ""The factory manager said he's disgusted at how it's been handled, how it's been leaked to the press. "" Workers were told of the factory's closure at a morning meeting Workers spoke of a ""sombre and subdued"" mood at the meeting, which came 46 years to the day after the first tyre was produced at the factory. One said: ""NCR shut years ago, Timex - Michelin's the biggest factory left in Dundee. 850 have lost their jobs. ""The unions say they'll fight, but what can they do? France has made their decision."" This video can not be played Michelin Dundee factory boss reflects on ""difficult day"" Mr Mackay met representatives of the workforce, trade unions and Dundee City Council on a visit to the factory. He later spoke in parliament about the issue following an urgent question from local MSP Jenny Marra. The minister said the Scottish government ""will leave no stone unturned"" and would do all it could to protect the workforce. Look back on what Derek Mackay said at Holyrood After his visit to the factory, Mr Mackay said: ""I have met members of Michelin's group executive and they have agreed to consider a proposition that we will bring forward, to secure a sustainable future for the plant. ""Having spoken to the council, the unions, local politicians and UK government, I am confident there is a shared desire to work together to secure the best possible future for the site and its workforce."" Derek Mackay said the Scottish government ""would do all it could"" to protect the workforce Michelin Dundee manager John Reid said the company made its decision on 9 October and it was ""never the intention"" for staff to find out the news in the manner that they did. He said: ""I think it's unacceptable they were put in that position. ""Clearly we have been operating in a very difficult market context for more than a year. ""We've had our volume cut three times this year. ""This year we actually produced the lowest volume we've ever produced in the factory, so it was clear that something fairly fundamental was happening."" By Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland business and economy editor If you've needed new tyres recently, you probably found that they had to be ordered and trucked from a distant warehouse. It used to be that you could go into a garage, you might get a choice of three manufacturers, and there and then, the mechanics could haul any of the three off a storage rail. What used to take 20 minutes now takes days, and often a lot more money. The change is partly down to the business practice of limiting stock to reduce costs, and having car parts delivered to order. But it has more to do with the growth in the range of tyres. Read more from Douglas The union Unite has said the closure would be a ""hammer-blow"" to the city. Michelin said the Dundee site, which opened in 1971 and specialised in smaller tyres, has suffered because of a shift in the market towards low-cost products from Asia. The company praised its Dundee employees' dedication but said that, in spite of that and its own ""continuous efforts"", the plant could not be saved. The factory produced its first tyre 46 years ago today The trade union representing many of the Dundee workers said it had not given up the fight to keep the factory open. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: ""Unite has been aware of the challenging market situation facing the Michelin Group. ""This has been primarily due to the cheap foreign imports from Asia and as a result falling demand for premium tyres in smaller dimensions, which the Dundee factory specialises in producing. ""This will be hammer-blow for Dundee."" He added: ""The workforce can be assured Unite will fight tooth and nail to save our factory, we will leave no stone unturned to keep this factory open. ""Unite will work day and night to ensure that all options remain on the table.""

"A rising number of patients are facing long waits for key NHS tests as UK hospitals struggle with staff shortages, a BBC investigation shows. Tests such as scans and biopsies are crucial for diagnosing illnesses. But tens of thousands of patients are waiting weeks - sometimes months - for them, leading to potentially harmful delays before treatment can start. Figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of  Information Act suggest a lack of radiographers is a key cause. They carry out scans and ultrasounds which can detect problems such as tumours, heart disease and multiple sclerosis. But the data provided by hospitals show one in 11 posts are unfilled. In total, 124 NHS trusts and boards across the UK - four in five of those asked - responded to the BBC's request for information. The figures provided showed there were 14,067 funded posts in April, but 1,283 were vacant. The Society of Radiographers said the shortages were causing significant delays in diagnosing illnesses.  Currently there are more than one million patients waiting for tests, such as MRI and CT scans, ultrasounds and endoscopies across the UK. In England and Scotland they are meant to have them within six weeks of referral. But the number of patients waiting longer than that has risen by 9,000 in England to nearly 29,000 in the past year. One in seven has waited more than three months. The performance in Scotland and Northern Ireland is even worse. In Scotland the numbers waiting more than six weeks have jumped by more than a third to more than 18,500. Northern Ireland has set a target of nine weeks, but has seen the numbers waiting longer than that rise by nearly a fifth in the past year to more than 56,000. Some 22,000 of these have waited more than six months. Only in Wales has the situation improved. The prime minister made early diagnosis of cancer a major part of her speech to the Conservative Party conference this year The findings come only a month after Prime Minister Theresa May said early diagnosis of cancer was going to be a key focus of the forthcoming long-term NHS plan in England. In her speech to the Conservative Party conference, she said she wanted to see three-quarters of cancers diagnosed early by 2028 - currently only half are. Richard Evans, head of the Society of Radiographers, said he was concerned about the situation. ""If we are going to identify things like cancer early we need more diagnostics. ""We are struggling to cope with demand and that creates delays for patients. ""It is not just about staffing either. We have ageing machines that are not as efficient as they should be."" Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK director of policy, was urgently needed. ""The diagnostic bottleneck is already threatening the care of many and presents a challenge which must be faced head on if we are serious about improving care for cancer patients."" But the Department of Health and Social Care said plans were already in place to increase the number of radiographers and invest in ""state-of-the-art technology"". Health Education England's Cancer Workforce Plan published last year set out plans to recruit an extra 300 diagnostic radiographers, while university applications for courses are rising, a spokesman said. ""Cancer is a priority for this government, and we are radically transforming how we screen, diagnose and treat the disease,"" he added. A spokesman for the Scottish government said investment was also being made to reduce diagnostic waiting times as part of the Â£4 million Radiology Transformation Programme.

"Lewis Bennett was given a seven-month jail sentence for smuggling stolen coins A British man who claimed his American wife had disappeared at sea after their catamaran sank off the coast of Cuba has admitted killing her. Lewis Bennett and Isabella Hellmann had been married three months when she was reported missing by her husband. Detectives later learnt that the boat had been deliberately sunk. Her body has never been found. On Monday Bennett, 41, admitted a charge of involuntary manslaughter at a hearing in Miami, Florida. The British-Australian dual citizen, from Poole, Dorset, had been due to stand trial in December charged with second degree murder. But he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of unlawful killing without malice after striking a plea deal. The couple had been sailing the 37ft (11m) catamaran from Cuba to their home in Delray Beach, Florida, when Bennett reported Ms Hellmann missing in an SOS call on 15 May 2017. He claimed their catamaran was sinking and his 41-year-old wife was nowhere to be seen. Bennett reported his wife missing in an SOS call as their catamaran was sinking However, the authorities soon suspected that Bennett had killed his wife, who was the mother of his child. In the months after her disappearance he asked for her to be declared dead. Prosecutors alleged thathe was motivated by money,as he would have inherited Ms Hellmann's apartment in Florida and the contents of her bank account. During his rescue investigators also found that he had been smuggling stolen antique coins, worth nearly Â£30,000. He had reported the coins as being stolen from a former employer in St Maarten a year earlier. Bennett is currently serving a seven-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to transporting the coins. He faces a maximum eight-year prison term when he is sentenced over his wife's death next year.

"The couple were killed in a helicopter crash after departing their own wedding A young couple from Texas were killed when a helicopter carrying them away from their own wedding crashed late on Saturday night, according to officials. Will Byler and Bailee Ackerman Byler were both students at Sam Houston State University. Their deaths were first reported by the student newspaper. The crash occurred near Uvalde, about 85 miles (135km) west of San Antonio. On social media, wedding attendees have been posting their condolences in the captions of wedding photos. ""I'm absolutely devastated!"" wrote one friend on Facebook, adding that the pilot of the aircraft was also killed. In a statement, the university's student president said the married couple will ""always be remembered by their kind hearts and uplifting spirits"". Allow Facebook content?

"The attack took place at Cid Harbour, in Queensland's Whitsunday Islands An Australian man has died after being attacked by a shark at a popular tourist spot in Queensland. The location - Cid Harbour in the Whitsunday Islands - was also the scene of two non-fatal shark attacks in September. Police said the latest victim, 33, had been swimming with friends when the attack happened on Monday. He was pulled from the water with leg and arm injuries and later died in hospital, authorities said. ""He had suffered very serious bites, significant blood loss as well as cardiac arrest,"" said Ben McCauley from Central Queensland Rescue. In September, a 12-year-old girl and a 46-year-old woman were mauled in separate attacks at Cid Harbour within a 24-hour period. The girl later had a leg amputated. Woman and girl bitten in Whitsunday Islands Surf event cancelled after shark incidents Tips on surviving a shark attack Excluding Monday's incident, unprovoked shark attacks have killed one person and injured 16 others in Australia this year,according to the Australian Shark Attack File,external. There is insufficient evidence to explain it, say shark researchers. Prof Colin Simpfendorfer, from James Cook University, said shark attacks were ""extremely rare"" in the Whitsundays - an area popular for sailing and water activities. He said sharks could be drawn by fishing activity or dirty water, but no theories had ""so far been supported by real substantial information"". Prof Simpfendorfer noted, however, that it was not unusual to see ""clusters"" of attacks in one area. ""We see this pattern time and time again - all around the world - and we don't really understand why it is,"" he said. ""There's just a period of time when conditions are such that it maybe causes attacks to be more frequent."" He also noted that contrary to popular assumptions, sharks typically avoided places with lots of swimmers. Authorities responded to the incidents in September by culling six sharks in the area and installing drum lines - baited hooks suspended underwater - for a week. Now, some have called for further action - but it is a contentious debate. A local lawmarker, Jason Costigan, has described the absence of permanent drum lines as ""madness"". But Prof Simpfendorfer said it was debatable whether drum lines and nets were effective in stopping attacks. Such measures also harmed other marine life, he added. This video can not be played The shark net debate ""There will always be sharks in these sorts of spaces, so the important thing is for people to educate themselves on how to minimise the risk,"" he said. He noted that the latest attack had taken place at dusk, a period known to be more dangerous because sharks can be more active. Read more: How do you stop sharks attacking?

"Women whose body clocks mean they are ""morning people"" have a lower risk of developing breast cancer, say UK researchers. The team at the University of Bristol says the reason why still needs to be uncovered. It adds the findings are important as they may affect every woman's risk. Experts said the study presented at theNCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow,externaladded to a growing understanding of the importance of sleep in all health. Everybody has a body clock, which governs how the body works in a roughly 24-hour pattern. It's also known as a circadian rhythm. It affects everything from when we sleep, to our mood and even our risk of a heart attack. But not everybody's clock tells the same time. Morning people or ""larks"" are early to rise, peak earlier in the day and are tired earlier in the evening. Evening people or ""owls"" find it harder to get up in the morning, are productive later into the evening and prefer to go to sleep late. Body clock linked to mood disorders Weekend camping resets body clock Take our quizto find out whether you are a morning type, or an evening owl. The researchers think so. They used a clever new way of analysing data - called Mendelian randomisation. They looked at 341 snippets of DNA (the instructions for the human body) that control whether we are likely to be a lark or an owl. They used this knowledge to perform an experiment on more than 180,000 women in the UK Biobank project and nearly 230,000 women in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium study. They showed people genetically programmed to be ""larks"" were less likely to have breast cancer than those programmed to be owls. Because these bits of DNA are set at birth and are not linked to other known causes of cancer, like obesity, it means the researchers are reasonably confident body clocks are involved in cancer. Around one in seven women in the UK will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. But this study only looked at a small, eight-year snapshot of a woman's life. In that time it showed two in 100 owls developed breast cancer compared with one in 100 larks. Dr Rebecca Richmond, one of the researchers from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: ""The findings are potentially very important because sleep is ubiquitous and easily modified. ""Previous research has looked at the impact of shift work, but this is showing there may be a risk factor for all women."" Age and family history are some of the main risk factors for breast cancer. According to Cancer Research UK, around a quarter of cases might be preventable. It's not that simple. Dr Richmond said it was said it was still too soon to give clear advice to women. She told the BBC: ""We still need to get at what makes an evening person more at risk than a morning personâ¦ we need to unpick the relationship."" Is it something about the body clock itself? Or do ""owls"" cause damage by living out of time with their body clocks in order to get up and go to work? Does the body clock affect hormone levels to alter cancer risk, or the immune system, or metabolism? There are still many unanswered questions. Science is never 100% sure, but this fits with an emerging picture. TheWorld Health Organization,externalalready says disruption to people's body clocks because of shift work is probably linked to cancer risk. Dr Richard Berks, from Breast Cancer Now, said: ""These intriguing results add to the growing body of evidence that there is some overlap between the genetics of when we'd prefer to sleep and our breast cancer risk, but more research is required to unravel the specifics of this relationship."" Similar studies have revealed a role for sleep preferences and mental health, including schizophrenia risk. Cliona Kirwan, consultant breast surgeon and researcher at the University of Manchester, said: ""The use of Mendelian randomisation in this study enables the researchers to examine the causal effect on breast cancer of different sleep patterns. ""These are interesting findings that provide further evidence of how our body clock and our natural sleep preference is implicated in the onset of breast cancer."" The findings have been published on researchers' websitebioRxiv,externalbut have not yet gone through scientific peer review.

"This video can not be played Price cap will be good deal for customers, says Ofgem boss The new energy price cap will come into force on 1 January, saving 11 million customers an average of Â£76 a year on their gas and electricity bills. Regulator Ofgem has set the final level of the cap at Â£1,137 a year for an average dual fuel customer who pays by direct debit. It means suppliers will have to cut the price of their default tariffs to the level of the cap or below it. But Ofgem said the cap could rise in April 2019, reducing the annual saving. Households in England, Scotland and Wales on default tariffs - such as standard variable tariffs - should be better off after the cap is introduced. Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap. More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs because they have never switched or have not done so recently. Five million customers who have pre-payment meters, or are judged to be vulnerable, already have their energy costs capped. The government introduced legislation earlier this year to establish the price cap following concerns about how efficiently the energy market was working. How much you save will depend on how much energy you use, which tariff you are on, if you have both gas and electricity, and how you pay for your energy. The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less. Households using a typical amount of gas and electricity will save about Â£76 on average, while those on the most expensive tariffs will save about Â£120. But experts say households could still save more money if they switch supplier, and take out a fixed price tariff. Savings of up to Â£285 a year are possible, according to the government. ""While the price cap will ease the financial burden for some households, people shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security that it will mean they are getting the best deal,"" said Alex Neill of Which? ""Switching is still the best way to save money on your energy bills."" Ofgem will review the tariff in February, and then adjust it in April and October each year. It has said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower than Â£76. ""Unfortunately, any joy that long-suffering households feel today is likely to be short-lived,"" said Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySupermarket. ""Ofgem is attempting to protect consumers by launching this cap with a Â£76 savings message, but it's simply not sustainable. The cap will be reviewed again in February, when market forces look likely to dictate it will rise significantly."" Cap to rise for vulnerable customers Ofgem said that customers could be confident that any rise in the cap ""would only reflect changes in the actual costs of providing the gas and electricity they use rather than supplier profiteering"". Those who have argued against the introduction of a price cap have said it will be counter-productive, as it will lead to fewer people switching - where the potential savings are greater. Ofgem has admitted that is a concern. ""It will probably lead to less switching,"" Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of Ofgem, told the BBC's Today programme. ""But if you choose not to switch you can still get a fair level of protection."" The cap may not last long. Ofgem will review its effect on the energy market in 2020, and the secretary of state will then decide whether to extend it by another year. The cap is on the unit price of energy, and the standing charge. So the cost of electricity - for those on default tariffs - will be capped at 17p per kWh. Gas will be capped at 4p per kWh. Dual fuel users will pay no more than Â£177 a year for a standing charge; electricity-only users will pay no more than Â£83, and gas users Â£94.

"This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Millions in the US and across the world are following the election results as they come in. There are hundreds of races - which ones are worth keeping an eye on? Americans have been filling polling stations on Tuesday to elect 35 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives, as well as 36 state governors and countless state officials. Polls in many areas have closed. It is a crucial election for President Donald Trump, as his Republican Party currently controls both houses of Congress. Here are some of the key races to watch - and what's happened so far. A huge setback for Democrats as they lose their Senate seat in Indiana. That makes their path to seizing control of the upper chamber very narrow indeed. It's a state that Trump won easily in 2016. A key Kentucky district seen as a bellwether has been held by Republicans but there was some good news for Democrats in Virginia. Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock has lost her seat in the House to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton, and she's being seen by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher as the first possible casualty of a Democratic ""blue wave"". Democratic incumbent senators in the eastern part of the country have retained their seats, including Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Virginia's Tim Kaine. No surprises there. Independent Bernie Sanders has glided to an easy win in Vermont, securing a third term in the senate. Read Anthony's rolling blog How to follow the results on the BBC A really simple guide to the mid-terms Most polls closed in two of the most closely-watched governors' races,FloridaandGeorgia. In Florida,the Democratic Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, a left-wing progressive who wants to become the state's first black leader, faces Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trumpist conservative. Ron DeSantis (left) and Andrew Gillum are fighting to become Florida's governor The fight for a Senate seat has put incumbent Bill Nelson, a Democrat who has served since 2000, against outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott, in what is one of the most expensive races in the country. President Trump loves Florida. A double Republican win here would give the White House a huge morale boost. In neighbouringGeorgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams hopes to become the country's first black female governor in one of the most contentious races in this year's mid-term election. She faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, the top official overseeing the election. The race between Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R) is one of the most fiercely contested The campaign, which has drawn national attention, has been embroiled in claims of voter suppression, and may not even be over on Tuesday: if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote, the decision will go to a run-off election on 4 December. In a House race of note, Republican Rep Karen Handel, elected in a closely-fought special election in 2017, faces gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was killed in a dispute about loud music, in the suburban Atlanta 6th district. Polls also close inSouth Carolina,VermontandVirginia, where Republican Rep Dave Brat is fighting for re-election in the Richmond-area (7th district) against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer. Mr Brat won his seat after famously defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 in a Republican primary. A Brat defeat - if it comes on the heels of Democratic victories elsewhere - would be interpreted as a good sign for those cheering the Democratic cause. At 19:30, polls close inNorth Carolina,OhioandWest Virginia. An ugly, gloves-off fight that defines US election The Deep South woman vying to make history What are the claims of voter suppression? This was an action-packed hour that could decide who will control the Senate. But you'll need to pay close attention to know what's happening - there's a lot going on. Polls closed inNew Jersey, where the race for the 7th district is playing out between Rep Leonard Lance, who has represented the area since 2008, and Democrat Tom Malinowski. Democrats are hoping to make some gains in an area that is critical of President Trump. Democrats also have high hopes inPennsylvania, and one race worth watching is the 1st district. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate former FBI agent, faces Democrat Scott Wallace, who has spent huge sums of his own wealth to fund his campaign - his family's philanthropic foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, is reportedly worth more than $140m (Â£107m). This video can not be played What do American voters care about? Polls also closed inAlabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode IslandandTennessee. InMissouri, two-term Democratic Sen Claire McCaskill hopes to keep her seat against Republican Josh Hawley. First polls closed inKansas, Massachusetts, Michigan,where Democrat Rashida Tlaib hopes to become the first Muslim woman in Congress,New HampshireandSouth Dakota. At 20:30, polls closed inArkansas. Mid-terms in charts: Should Donald Trump be worried? The evangelical women who reject Trump What happened at21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) Polls closed inTexas. One to watch is the 7th district of west Houston suburbs, a former GOP stronghold that narrowly chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Republican Rep John Culberson faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. The race for the Senate in this traditional red state is between incumbent Ted Cruz, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a rising star who wants to become the party's first senator for Texas in three decades. He's been getting a lot of attention and raising loads of money, but a win for Mr O'Rourke looks unlikely. It would suggest there's been a big swing to the Democrats nationwide if he gets over the line. This video can not be played Apathy isn't the only reason why so many Americans don't vote Polls close inColorado,Louisiana,Nebraska,New Mexico,New York,WisconsinandWyoming. InMinnesota, Republican Rep Erik Paulsen faces a big challenge from Democrat Dean Phillips in the Twin Cities suburbs (3rd district). Mrs Clinton won in the area by nine points. You're doing well if you're still keeping up. You might have the state of play now in the Senate and the House, but don't bet on it. Democrats dazzled by rising star in Texas Why more Native Americans are running for office What happened at22:00 EST (03:00 GMT) Polls closed inIowa, and a key race to watch is in Des Moines (3rd district), one of the areas that swung for Barack Obama in 2012 but backed Mr Trump two years ago. Republican Rep David Young faces Democrat Cindy Axne, a small business owner. InNevada, Republican Sen Dean Heller faces Democrat Rep Jacky Rosen, and Democrats are optimistic about winning this seat. Polls also closed inMontana, andUtah. First polls close inIdahoandNorth Dakota. Jon Tester's attempt to keep his Senate seat in Montana has irked the president personally - Mr Trump said he has never forgiven the Democratic senator for raising questions about his personal doctor, Ronny Jackson, when he was in the frame to be secretary of veterans' affairs. The big election issue that's not Trump We've hit the west coast. If you don't know which party has had a good night so far, you've probably been napping. Polls close inCalifornia, and it will be interesting to see how traditionally Republican areas will vote. One of the key races is taking place in the 45th district, in Orange County. Mitt Romney won there in 2012 but Mrs Clinton was favoured here in the last election. Republican Rep Mimi Walters faces Democrat Katie Porter, a law professor. Polls also close inOregonandWashington. Polls close inHawaii. Polls close inAlaskabetween now and 01:00 (06:00 GMT). Some nail-biter races could still be in the balance - but there should be champagne corks popping somewhere by this stage.

"Problems at the Oroville dam in California in 2017 saw 10,000 people evacuated A new study says that many large-scale hydropower projects in Europe and the US have been disastrous for the environment. Dozens of these dams are being removed every year, with many considered dangerous and uneconomic. But the authors fear that the unsustainable nature of these projects has not been recognised in the developing world. Thousands of new dams are now being planned for rivers in Africa and Asia. 'They dammed everything' - hydropower gone sour Are too many hydropower dams being built? Hydropower is the source of 71% of renewable energy throughout the world and has played a major role in the development of many countries. But researchers say the building of dams in Europe and the US reached a peak in the 1960s and has been in decline since then, with more now being dismantled than installed. Hydropower only supplies approximately 6% of US electricity. Dams are now being removed at a rate of more than one a week on both sides of the Atlantic. The problem, say the authors ofthis new paper,external, is that governments were blindsided by the prospect of cheap electricity without taking into account the full environmental and social costs of these installations. More than 90% of dams built since the 1930s were more expensive than anticipated. They have damaged river ecology, displaced millions of people and have contributed to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases from the decomposition of flooded lands and forests. The Elwha river dam in Washington State was removed in 2011 ""They make a rosy picture of the benefits, which are not fulfilled and the costs are ignored and passed on to society much later,"" lead author Prof Emilio Moran, from Michigan State University, told BBC News. His report cites the example of two dams on the Madeira river in Brazil, which were finished only five years ago, and are predicted to produce only a fraction of the power expected because of climate change. In the developing world, an estimated 3,700 dams, large and small, are now in various stages of development. The authors say their big worry is that many of the bigger projects will do irreparable damage to the major rivers on which they are likely to be built. On the Congo river, the Grand Inga project is expected to produce more than a third of the total electricity currently being generated in Africa. However, the new study points out that the main goal for the $80bn installation will be to provide electricity to industry. ""Over 90% of the energy from this project is going to go to South Africa for mining and the people in the Congo will not get that power,"" said Prof Moran. ""The people that I study in Brazil, the power line goes over their heads and goes 4,000km from the area and none of the energy is being given to them locally."" The Hoover dam at Lake Mead in the US has seen water levels decline in recent years ""The nice goal of rural electrification has become completely subverted by large-scale interests who are pushing this technology, and governments are open to being convinced by them that this is the way to go."" The report points our that the large installations on these great rivers will destroy food sources, with 60 million people who live off the fisheries along the Mekong likely to be impacted with potential loss of livelihoods greater than $2bn. The authors also believe that dams will destroy thousands of species in these biodiversity hotspots. In Brazil, which gets 67% of its electricity from hydropower, the response to reduced water capacity because of climate change is to build more dams. With the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, a temporary halt to building new hydro projects is likely to be overturned. Plans for 60 new dams are already in place. The authors say that with huge pressure on countries to press ahead with renewable energy developments, a mix of energy sources including hydro is the most sustainable approach. ""Large hydropower doesn't have a future, that is our blunt conclusion,"" said Prof Moran. ""To keep hydropower as part of the mix in the 21st Century we should combine multiple sources of renewable energy,"" said Prof Moran. ""There should be more investment in solar, wind and biomass, and hydro when appropriate - as long as we hold them to rigorous standards where the costs and benefits are truly transparent."" The study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"From Tuesday women in the UK will begin to qualify for their state pensions at the same age as men - currently 65. The move to equalise male and female pension ages began 25 years ago, under John Major's government, and has been gradually phased in. Women who are 65 on 6 November will therefore be the first to wait for as long as men. But critics say that women are still a long way from pension equality, as the amount they typically receive is lower. For more than 60 years - up until 2010 - women received their pensions at the age of 60, but that has been rising ever since. State pension age to rise to 68 Reality Check: The fight over women's state pensions From now on, men and women will see their state pension ages go up in tandem - increasing to 66 by October 2020, and 67 by 2028. The government has also accepted the findings of theCridland review,,externalwhich recommended that the pension age should rise further - to 68 - by 2039. The move to increase the state pension age is the result of increasing longevity. A girl born in 1951 had a life expectancy of 82 years. A girl born today can expect to reach the age of 93. Over the same period, boys' life expectancy has increased from 77 years to 90. State pension calculator - check your age and entitlement,external Successive governments have accepted that unless the qualifying age went up, the state pension would become unaffordable. The changes have therefore saved the Treasury at least Â£30bn. ""No-one wants to be told they have to work longer into their 60s - or even their 70s - before they'll get their state pension, but that is the inevitable consequence of rising longevity,"" said Nathan Long at Hargreaves Lansdown. Others have warned that even though their state pension ages may now be the same, men and women are still far from equal when it comes to pensions. Figures from aParliamentary briefing document,externalshow that in 2017 the average woman's state pension was worth Â£126 a week, compared with the average man's at Â£154. However these exclude claims for Pension Credit, which has more female recipients than male. Women typically earn less from their state pension than men, as they tend to work in more lowly-paid and part-time jobs and therefore pay lower National Insurance Contributions. Some who take time off work to have a family fail to claimNational Insurance Credits,external. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann said women lose out on workplace and private pensions as well. Many with part-time jobs miss out on auto-enrolment pensions, for example, as they do not earn enough to qualify. ""Women in their 50s and older have lost out most, but younger women face penalties too, as all pensions - state, workplace and private pensions - discriminate against women,"" she said. ""Some of the inequalities date back many decades, but others are new problems created by recent legislation."" Full timetable of pension age changes,external Women Against State Pension Age Inequality (WASPI) said they would continue their campaign to win compensation for those who were unaware that their state pension age was going to rise. ""Equalisation is not just about the age you reach retirement, but also your ability to generate a full state pension entitlement, and pay into a private pension, to have any hope of security in retirement,"" said Debbie de Spon, a spokesperson for WASPI.

"Two candidates who represent the beating hearts of their party's ideological base - a left-wing progressive and a Trumpist conservative - are locked in a brawl thatspeaks volumesabout the first US election campaign in the Trump era. The Florida governor's race veered toward theatre of the absurd last Wednesday night, following the second debate between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis at the Miami area's Broward College. The post-debate ""spin-room"" - that typically animated media scrum where representatives of the two candidates offer a positive take on their side's performance - devolved into a shouting match. Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz stood cheek-to-jowl with former Miami Beach Mayor (and recently defeated Democratic governor candidate) Philip Levine, as the volume went up. ""Andrew Gillum was a liar,"" Gaetz exclaimed. ""We just saw Cassius Clay knock out Sonny Liston!"" Levine shouted, reaching back to the famous 1964 heavyweight boxing match in Miami for his comparison of Mr Gillum to Muhammad Ali. This video can not be played A beautiful look at an ugly race: Sights and sounds from the campaign trail in Florida If the 2018 Florida governor's race is a prize fight for the top job in the third-largest state in America, the two contestants couldn't offer a more distinct contrast of styles and substance. Andrew Gillum, the 39-year-old mayor of Tallahassee - Florida's capital and seventh-largest city - was a surprise winner in the August Democratic primary, beating Mr Levine and former Congresswoman Gwen Graham (daughter of former Florida Governor and Senator Bob Graham) by 3%. He campaigned as an avowed progressive, supporting universal government-provided healthcare, increasing public school teacher pay, a $15 minimum wage, marijuana legalisation and dismantling the controversial federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. In the past, Florida Democrats have tended to nominate middle-of-the-road candidates for statewide office, banking on the notion that the broadest possible appeal will garner the most votes. With Mr Gillum, they've opted for a different strategy. Supporters of Andrew Gillum listen during a recent debate between Mr Gillum and Ron DeSantis ""His message is that we can't continue to conduct Democratic politics the way the state has done,"" says Khari Pestaina, a graduate student who attended a Gillum rally at Florida International University. ""He's willing to fight, and that's what we need on the left, especially in a state like Florida, which owes so much to its people who put in the work day in and day out and don't get back much in return."" The A-Z of US mid-terms What's it all about? US mid-terms in seven charts You choose what happens If he wins, Mr Gillum would be the first black governor of Florida and only the third elected in US history. His campaign attracted a broad spectrum of young and minority voters - a coalition reminiscent of Barack Obama's winning Florida presidential campaigns - as the 2018 Democratic primary turnout in the state set a record high. ""There's definitely real enthusiasm around Gillum,"" says Steve Schale, a Florida-based political strategist who served as state director of the Obama 2008 presidential campaign. ""It's unfair to compare him to Obama, but it's enthusiasm I haven't seen a governor's race in a long time. The marriage of things that happened in 2008 is there."" This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? On the other side of the ballot, 40-year-old Mr DeSantis - who represented the eastern Florida congressional district centred around Daytona Beach from 2013 until resigning in September - is trying to recreate Donald Trump's successful 2016 presidential campaign in the state. Facing off against a more established Republican in his primary, Mr DeSantis touted his close ties to Mr Trump - including an influential presidential endorsement. He frequently defends Mr Trump on cable news shows, his campaign website is chock full of pictures of the then-congressman and the president, and he aired a television advert that featured him teaching his daughter how to ""build a wall"" out of toy blocks and reading Mr Trump's The Art of the Deal to his infant son. As the president likes to note, Mr DeSantis is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School and served as a lawyer in the US Navy, including a deployment as the legal adviser to a Seal commando team, where he was awarded a Bronze Star. Trump and DeSantis embrace at a rally ""DeSantis has a pretty good record in Congress. He has a pretty good record as a human being,"" says Steve 'Bubba' Cohen, a former Miami financier and television personality. ""This is a guy who, if you were a girl, you would want to bring home to mom."" While in Congress, Mr DeSantis was a member of the Freedom Caucus, the hard-right group of House legislators who frequently bedevilled his own party's leadership by blocking compromises with Democrats and pushing for sharp spending and tax cuts. Mr Schale says Mr Trump won Florida in 2016 - and helped secure the White House - by flipping suburban and exurban counties in the central part of the state that had in the past opted for Democrats. ""Trump completely changed the map,"" Mr Schale says. ""For DeSantis, his math is to make up for losses among independents, blacks and Hispanics by really just leaning in as hard as humanly possible to his position as the Trump backer."" Given that Republicans have controlled the Florida governor's office for 20 years, his campaign has focused on sustaining the state's currently robust economy, limiting undocumented migration, crime prevention and warnings of financial misfortune if voters opt for a progressive Democrat to lead the state. Within the confines of Broward College, as the two candidates prepared for their debate, the stark contrast between the two candidates left some undecided students torn. ""Both candidates are polar opposites of each other,"" says Rahjanni Lusi, a 32-year-old former military enlistee. ""I like to see a little bit of common ground because at least we would know there's one issue that we can all move forward with."" Rahjanni Lusi Outside of campus, in a grassy area near the main entrance, common ground was hard to find. In one area, a knot of a few dozen DeSantis supporters, decked out in red, white and blue and carrying a mix of homemade and official campaign signs, chanted ""We want Ron!"" and ""USA! USA!"". One sign warned that Mr Gillum would turn Florida into Venezuela - the socialist dictatorship that has become the bogeyman of many on the right, including the president himself. Another said ""Fake News, Fake Bombs"" - a reference to what was then the ongoing rash of pipe bombs delivered to Democratic politicians and supporters across the US. (Two days later, Cesar Sayoc- an avid Trump supporter - would be arrested for the crimes just a few miles from the debate site.) Supporters of Ron DeSantis rally before a debate in Miami An electronic billboard truck circled nearby, blaring patriotic songs and rotating a glossy photo of Mr DeSantis, a less flattering one of Mr Gillum and, for good measure, a photoshopped image of Hillary Clinton behind bars. ""We will lose everything if Gillum gets in,"" warned Medora Reading, a former small-business owner from Stuart - a town about two hours up the Florida coast - and now full-time conservative activist. She says Mr Gillum has made a mess of Tallahassee and is a ""pawn"" for deep-pocketed liberal donor George Soros (one of the people targeted by the bomber). This video can not be played The billionaire financier and philanthropist has become a divisive figure in global politics in recent years Linda Stoch, an interior designer from Palm Beach who organised the pro-DeSantis rally and made the Venezuela sign, echoes that sentiment. ""I don't want to take the future away from my children and grandchildren,"" she says. ""And Andrew Gillum will do that. The stakes are that high."" As the DeSantis supporters marched toward where more media were gathered, pro-Gillum activists began to gather. The truck's ""God Bless the USA"" was drowned by hip-hop, and the gloomy predictions of a future with Gillum were replaced with a darker view of the current state of affairs - and hope for a change of fortune. ""Things are going great for wealthy people,"" says Natalia Perez Santos of For Our Future Florida, the liberal activist group that put together the Gillum rally. Natalia Perez Santos ""They're not going great for the average working family. Florida actually is the second-worst state for economic inequality, only behind New York."" Mr Gillum, she adds, is talking about issues people care about. ""He's someone who is really able to articulate well what he would do to help families."" Edward Leuchs, a retired schoolteacher at the pre-debate demonstration, has been canvassing voters in southern Florida - typically a bastion for Democrats - and says some aren't fully engaged yet, but they're getting there. ""There are a lot of low-information voters who don't understand the difference between Democrats and Republicans,"" he says. ""And when you say Trump is a Republican, they know they're Democrats."" Edward Leuchs Among the DeSantis supporters, on the other hand, the affinity for Mr Trump is overflowing. ""I love Donald Trump,"" says Ms Reading. ""I am so amazed at what that man has been able to achieve with the Hollywood idiots, with the Clintons, the Democrat Party and the Republican Rinos (Republicans in Name Only)."" The president's presence looms over all of American politics, but his shadow is particularly long in the Florida gubernatorial race. Mr DeSantis's ties are clear, but Mr Gillum has in part defined himself by his differences with the businessman-turned-commander-in-chief. He's repeatedly called for Mr Trump's impeachment and removal from office - a fact that became a topic of animated discussion in the first candidate debate. The Deep South woman vying to make history Democrats dazzled by rising star in Texas The most surprising candidates Truth-seeking scientists run for office ""You need to be able to work with the president, and Andrew can't do that,"" Mr DeSantis said. ""I think I will be better positioned to advance Florida's priorities because I have a productive relationship with the administration."" Gillum countered: ""This is not Russia. You shouldn't have to kiss the ring of the president of the United States for the president to see to the goodwill of the third largest state in all of America."" Early voting started in Florida more than a week ago, and both candidates are criss-crossing the state in public events and rallies. Time and again, the subject of the president comes up. ""Anybody who is a Trump supporter or follower who doesn't have the backbone to stand alone and speak out against his bizarre pronouncements and ideas, I don't want to be governor of any state, let alone Florida,"" says Carol Reiter, a retired schoolteacher who cast her ballot at a public library in the toney Miami Suburb of Coral Gables. She says she likes Mr Gillum, but the opportunity to ""stick a finger in Trump's eye"" is just frosting on the cake. Carol Reiter Pauline Sholk, a retiree who voted at a public library in Aventura - a strip-mall laden area north of Miami - calls Mr Trump a ""terrible person"". ""There's no ethics,"" she says. ""There's no honour. Anything that my parents taught me, he does not have."" At a DeSantis pro-Israel rally at a bagel shop near that Aventura library, film producer Hera Becker of Fort Lauderdale has a different view. ""I think Donald Trump is doing a fantastic job,"" she says. ""We need co-operation from the federal government, and I don't see Mayor Gillum being able to do that."" Stephen Fiske, who runs a pro-Israel political action committee, also loves Mr Trump's accomplishments - but has some reservations about the man. Obamacare: The big election issue that's not Trump What are the claims of voter suppression? US economy under Trump: Is it the best in history? The Republican who changed his mind over guns ""Do I appreciate all the tweets, his demeanour, his mannerisms? No. However, the results are the results - and all the rest are noise."" On Wednesday night, the president held a rally for Mr DeSantis and other Florida Republicans in the Gulf Coast town of Fort Meyer. He'll return to the state, up north in Pensacola, on Saturday - one of only two states in which he's making multiple stops. Most of the destinations in Mr Trump's last-minute national barnstorming tour are deeply conservative states where incumbent Democratic senators are on the ropes. Sharply divided Florida is different. For the president, who refers to his private club in Palm Beach as the ""Southern White House"", Florida - and the governor's race in particular - is personal. One of the ways the president has injected himself into the governor's election is by repeatedly calling Mr Gillum a ""thief"" and contrasting him with ""Harvard/Yale educated"" DeSantis. (Mr Gillum went to Florida A&M University). The president is referencing allegations that as mayor Mr Gillum improperly took benefits from individuals with business before the Tallahassee government, including accepting a ticket to the Broadway musical Hamilton from an undercover FBI agent investigating corruption in the city. At Mr Trump's Fort Myers rally, the crowd responded to mention of the Democrat by chanting ""lock him up!"" Mr Gillum denies the accusations and says he is not under FBI investigation - and the president provided no evidence to support his accusation of theft. Instead, Mr Gillum and his supporters allege that Mr Trump's statements are thinly veiled racism. It was perhaps inevitable that race would become a factor in the governor's contest given the ground-breaking nature of Mr Gillum's campaign, but it became an issue long before the president's tweets. The day after the Florida primary, Mr DeSantis said during a Fox News interview that Florida voters should not ""monkey up"" the state's economy by electing a Democrat who supports tax increases and a ""socialist agenda"". Mr DeSantis also declined to return a campaign donation from a conservative activist who once called President Obama a racist slur. He also spoke at a 2012 conference organised by a different right-wing activist who said that blacks owe their freedom to white people. ""How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?"" Mr DeSantis said when the subject was brought up during the second debate. ""I'm not calling Mr DeSantis a racist,"" Mr Gillum quickly countered. ""I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist."" Black voters make up 16% of Florida's population - and their turnout could be pivotal to Mr Gillum's campaign. Black people support Democrats in overwhelming numbers and, in 2012, 74% participated in the presidential election. In 2016, that number dropped to 65% - a decline that contributed to Hillary Clinton's narrow defeat. In mid-terms, the numbers are even lower. In 2014 42% voted, while in 2010 - a wave election for Republicans nationwide - 33% cast ballots. In heavily black Miami-Dade County, early voting turnout is already up more than 160% from 2014, and Mr Gillum could be the reason. Recent opinion polls show Mr Gillum with a small but steady lead - playing in to the candidate's constant exhortations that his voters can prevail if they ""bring it home"". Jean Louis Jean Louis walked out of the Aventura public library and into the balmy south Florida evening after casting his ballot for Mr Gillum last week. He notes that 28 August was a historic day in American history - when Martin Luther King Jr gave his 1963 ""I have a dream"" speech in Washington, Mr Obama received the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in 2008 and the night Mr Gillum secured the governor's nomination earlier this year. He says he feels Andrew Gillum is the man for the hour in Florida. ""It will give me goosebumps to see the first black governor here,"" he says with a smile. If Mr Gillum wins, however, it won't have been without a fight. Video and uncredited photos by Hannah Long-Higgins . A beautiful look at an ugly campaign.

"This video can not be played Social workers on the hardest part of their job A steep rise in vulnerable children needing protection over the past 10 years is pushing council children's services in England into crisis, suggests research. There has been a substantial increase in calls from the public and professionals worried about a child, according to a study for the Association of Directors of Children's Services. The number of investigations where a child is believed to be at risk of significant harm has also more than doubled. Over the past year, almost 2.4 million people contacted children's services because they were worried about a child - a 78% increase on 10 years ago, while serious investigations over concerns of significant harm are up from just under 77,000 in 2008 to almost 200,000 last year - a rise of 159%. Council leaders have warned they will have to overspend their budgets to meet demand,though the government says extra money was announced for children's services in the Budget and it is working with councils to ease the pressures and improve children's lives. So why are services designed to protect the most vulnerable children in society facing such a squeeze? The past decade has seen pressure increase across the board in the child protection system - the number of calls from people concerned about a child has nearly doubled. Some of that rise may be down to better awareness but there has also been a substantial increase in children placed on child protection plans, where social workers monitor the way a child is being looked after to keep them safe. The steepest rise has been in the most serious Section 47 investigations. These are carried out when there are fears that a child is at risk of significant harm. In such cases, the stakes couldn't be higher. Social workers, police and other agencies, involved in these investigations, will all remember the deaths of children such asVictoria ClimbiÃ© in 2000,externalandBaby Peter Connelly in 2007. Both were known by the authorities to be at risk but still died at the hands of people close to them. In nearly half of the cases, where social workers carry out an assessment, domestic violence is a factor. The next most common issue is mental health problems. Of the children then placed on child protection plans, the concern in most cases is that the child is being neglected. That is a failure to meet their basic needs, which could, for instance, mean they don't have enough food, the home is cold and they have nowhere to sleep. Throughout the era of austerity, while councils have made cuts elsewhere, they maintain they have tried to protect spending on children's services. But once inflation is taken into account, the money available to protect children has still fallen significantly. That combined with increasing demand and more complex cases has led to councils overspending their budget for children's services. With finances so tight, money has often been concentrated on statutory services, which protect children at risk of neglect or abuse. Councils under financial strain Funding of children's care services 'unsustainable' This has meant cuts to the early intervention teams, who might have been able to ease future pressures. In the last month's Budget, the government announced an extra Â£84m for children's services over five years. Finding and keeping front-line staff in this high-pressure world is a constant issue for local authorities. The most up-to-date figures show a slight increase in the number of social workers but a third will have been with their current local authority for less that two years and 15% will change jobs during the year. There are a high number of vacancies, with an average of 17% of posts empty. Many of these roles are taken on by the more than 5,300 agency social workers in the system but that comes at a cost. Agency staff are paid more than council staff andfigures collected by the BBC show between 2012-13 and 2016-17local authority spending on these temporary staff nearly doubled, reaching Â£356m. Council spent Â£6m on agency staff Abuse row council's staff bill hit Â£16m It is money cash-strapped councils can ill afford.  Even more importantly, frequent changes in social worker are damaging for a child. It is much harder to learn to trust the person there to help you, if they keep changing. Most children that social workers are involved with will remain with their families but the numbers removed from their home and taken into local authority care have risen by 24% in a decade. Of the more than 75,000 children looked after by the state, most will have faced abuse or neglect. Other reasons for a child being in care include family dysfunction or because their family is in acute distress. A small number of children will be there because of their disabilities. Most children in the care system are older, with the largest single group aged between 10 and 15. Boys are slightly more likely to be in care than girls. According to official statistics, an increase in the number of boys has largely been driven by a rise in unaccompanied asylum seeking children, who are more likely to be male. Although most children in care are white (75%), the slight over-representation of children from non-white backgrounds is also thought to reflect the rise in young asylum seekers. There is something of a North-South divide when it comes to the number of children looked after by councils. For instance, in Blackpool out of every 10,000 children there will be 184 in care. That compares with 34 in every 10,000 in Windsor and Maidenhead, part of the Prime Minister Theresa May's Berkshire constituency. Talk to social workers and many will say they are seeing families facing real financial hardship, with austerity and welfare cuts playing their part in pushing people into crisis. That's reflected by research that found children living in the poorest areas were at least 10 times more likely to be taken into care than those in the most affluent parts of the country. It is a pattern that is repeated across all the nations of the UK. TheChild Welfare Inequalities project,externalconcluded deprivation was the largest single factor in families becoming involved in child protection. In the most deprived areas about one child in every 60 was in care, compared with one in every 660 in the wealthiest areas. With poorer areas spending more money on those in care, the team also concluded these authorities had seen more cuts to preventative services. Nearly three-quarters of children being looked after by councils live with foster parents,which costs local authorities about Â£1.7bn a year,external. Since the 1960s, government policy has moved away from residential children's homes. Foster carers play a vital role but there aren't enough of them. A review published in February 2018 said that the shortage depended on what part of the country a child was in and the availability of foster carers able to take on the most challenging young people. Of the children who are not fostered, about 4,000 are placed with their own parents under supervision and nearly 8,000 spend time in children's homes, secure units or living semi-independently. Almost a third of the more than 31,000 children who left care in 2017 returned to their families. About 14% were adopted, after spending an average of two years in care. For 12% of the children, there were special guardianship orders, where a relative took on their care. The number of adoptions has fallen since its peak in 2015, which followed a high profile push to increase numbers by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron. Most of the children who were adopted in 2017 were aged between one and four years old. Only 1% of adopted children were aged 10 or over, even though this represents the largest age group of children being looked after by councils. About a quarter of children who cease to be looked after when they reach their 18th birthdays continue to live with their foster parents but the future for many care leavers is difficult. Of the 18- to 21-year-olds who stayed in touch with councils, 40% were not in education, training or employment. Although half of care leavers were in some form of education, training or employment, only 6% went to university. That compares with 33% of all 18-year-olds.  It's also estimated that about a quarter of inmates in youth prisons have spent time in care. Additional research by Ben Butcher and charts by Visual Journalism Unit.

"Benefit claimants can have their payments stopped if they break the rules The government must urgently reassess its ""pointlessly cruel"" benefit sanctions, a committee of MPs has said. Benefit sanctions are penalties imposed on claimants who do not meet conditions such as attending job centre meetings. The Work and Pensions Committee found single parents, care leavers and people with disabilities and health conditions were ""disproportionately vulnerable"" to, and affected by, sanctions. The Department for Work and Pensions insisted its scheme was ""reasonable"". A DWP spokesman added that sanctions were ""only used in the minority of cases"". However,the committee's report,externalstated the human cost of the current system was ""too high"". 'I was sanctioned for going to a funeral' 'Limited evidence' for benefit sanctions You're losing everything - but don't understand why As well as missing appointments, sanctions can be imposed for failure to show efforts to find work, and can see claimants lose 100% of their jobseeker's allowance or universal credit standard allowance. In some ""higher level"" cases - such as a failure to take up paid work - claimants can lose benefits for as long as three years. The committee's report recommended the maximum period for such sanctions should be two months for the first failure to comply and four to six months for subsequent breaches. It also warned that children risked becoming ""collateral damage"" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare. Without clear evidence that sanctions were driving a return to work by single parents, it was ""hard to justify"" their inclusion in the system, the report said. The committee received more than 500 responses detailing claimants' experience of the sanctions regime, which included cases of ""extreme hardship and distress"". These included a wheelchair user who ""sofa-surfed"" with friends or slept in a college library for a year when her entire benefit was wrongly taken away. And the committee heard from a man who was sanctioned when he missed a job centre appointment three days after being taken to hospital suffering from severe epileptic seizures. This video can not be played Lee Curry: 'Benefit sanctions harmed my mental health' Another respondent, a single parent named Samantha, told the MPs she was sanctioned after childcare problems meant she had to move from full-time to part-time work. She described how her monthly income fell from an average of Â£800 per month to Â£300, leaving her relying on food parcels from friends. Frank Field, who chairs the committee, said he had heard accounts of ""terrible and unnecessary hardship"" from people who had been sanctioned. The committee said that ministers had ""no idea"" how many people were suffering as a result of the sanctions regime, because of an ""unacceptable"" failure to adequately evaluate its impact.

"The Democrats' hopes of winning control of the US Senate have been dealt a blow in the mid-term elections. A Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, and two US networks predict they will take control of the chamber. Republicans currently control both legislative chambers. President Trump is not up for re-election until 2020, but Tuesday's poll will shape his agenda for the remainder of his two years in office. Republicans look likely now to retain control of the Senate - they currently have a slim 51-49 majority, but only nine of the party's seats were up for grabs, while Democrats were defending 26 seats. Republican businessman Mike Braun was projected to oust first-term incumbent Joe Donnelly, a moderate Democrat in Indiana. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump had ""closed the deal"" for Mr Braun after holding a rally in the state on Monday night. This video can not be played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont: 'President is a pathological liar' Republican Marsha Blackburn won a Senate seat in Tennessee against Democrat Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by pop star Taylor Swift. There was some consolation for Democrats as Senators Joe Manchin and Bob Menendez held on to their seats after tough campaigns in West Virginia and New Jersey respectively. Mr Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination narrowly survived sexual assault claims. A cliff-hanging vote count in Florida has Republican Rick Scott neck and neck with incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson. Republican Ted Cruz Cruz has a slight lead against his challenger, Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has won election to US Senate from Utah, as expected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two US networks - Fox and NBC - are projecting that the Democrats are expected to win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House. In suburban Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton ousted incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock, while another Democrat, Donna Shalala, flipped a Florida constituency against Republican Maria Salazar, a news anchor. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is projected to have become the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old. If Democrats do win the House, they are expected to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest, while thwarting his legislative agenda.

The Sunshine State's governor race is too close to call between a left-wing progressive, Andrew Gillum, and a Trumpist conservative, Ron DeSantis. Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams could become the first female African-American governor in the US. Her Republican opponent Brian Kemp's office has been accused of voter suppression. To add to polling day tensions, broken voting machines led to longer queues and a return to paper ballots in some parts of the state. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. Key takeaways from election so far After months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force. Around 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. In Texas, early voting exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. Some states showed signs of being overwhelmed by the voter influx, however. There were reports of electronic voting machine failures and congested polling stations - including in Georgia, Atlanta, Arizona, and New York. Relief at social networks as defences hold A Homeland Security official said the department had received ""sparse"" reports of tech failure, but that there seemed to have been no significant impact on people's ability to vote.

"From Tuesday women in the UK will begin to qualify for their state pensions at the same age as men - currently 65. The move to equalise male and female pension ages began 25 years ago, under John Major's government, and has been gradually phased in. Women who are 65 on 6 November will therefore be the first to wait for as long as men. But critics say that women are still a long way from pension equality, as the amount they typically receive is lower. For more than 60 years - up until 2010 - women received their pensions at the age of 60, but that has been rising ever since. State pension age to rise to 68 Reality Check: The fight over women's state pensions From now on, men and women will see their state pension ages go up in tandem - increasing to 66 by October 2020, and 67 by 2028. The government has also accepted the findings of theCridland review,,externalwhich recommended that the pension age should rise further - to 68 - by 2039. The move to increase the state pension age is the result of increasing longevity. A girl born in 1951 had a life expectancy of 82 years. A girl born today can expect to reach the age of 93. Over the same period, boys' life expectancy has increased from 77 years to 90. State pension calculator - check your age and entitlement,external Successive governments have accepted that unless the qualifying age went up, the state pension would become unaffordable. The changes have therefore saved the Treasury at least Â£30bn. ""No-one wants to be told they have to work longer into their 60s - or even their 70s - before they'll get their state pension, but that is the inevitable consequence of rising longevity,"" said Nathan Long at Hargreaves Lansdown. Others have warned that even though their state pension ages may now be the same, men and women are still far from equal when it comes to pensions. Figures from aParliamentary briefing document,externalshow that in 2017 the average woman's state pension was worth Â£126 a week, compared with the average man's at Â£154. However these exclude claims for Pension Credit, which has more female recipients than male. Women typically earn less from their state pension than men, as they tend to work in more lowly-paid and part-time jobs and therefore pay lower National Insurance Contributions. Some who take time off work to have a family fail to claimNational Insurance Credits,external. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann said women lose out on workplace and private pensions as well. Many with part-time jobs miss out on auto-enrolment pensions, for example, as they do not earn enough to qualify. ""Women in their 50s and older have lost out most, but younger women face penalties too, as all pensions - state, workplace and private pensions - discriminate against women,"" she said. ""Some of the inequalities date back many decades, but others are new problems created by recent legislation."" Full timetable of pension age changes,external Women Against State Pension Age Inequality (WASPI) said they would continue their campaign to win compensation for those who were unaware that their state pension age was going to rise. ""Equalisation is not just about the age you reach retirement, but also your ability to generate a full state pension entitlement, and pay into a private pension, to have any hope of security in retirement,"" said Debbie de Spon, a spokesperson for WASPI.

"Singer Aretha Franklin in 1970 A long-awaited Aretha Franklin documentary will premiere in New York City - 46 years after being filmed. Amazing Grace was shot by director Sydney Pollack in 1972, but it spent decades in an unedited form. Years of legal complications followed, and now it will finally debut at the DOC NYC festival on 12 November, with the support of the singer's estate. The ""queen of soul"" - known for hits like Respect and Think - died of cancer in August, aged 76. Aretha Franklin: A life in pictures Obituary: Aretha Franklin Stars and fans say goodbye to Aretha The film Amazing Grace was only finished in 2011 because of technical problems. After that, Franklin and her lawyers blocked the film's release repeatedly, once suing producer Alan Elliot for using her likeness without her permission. Legal clearance finally came after the singer's death, when her family members were open to seeing the film. This video can not be played Aretha Franklin: In her own words It was filmed over two nights at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, when Franklin recorded her Amazing Grace album. However, Pollack - who later won an Oscar for Out of Africa - made a mistake during the 1972 recording. By not using clapper boards, an essential tool to match sound with footage in a pre-digital age, he made the 20 hours of raw film frustratingly hard to edit. The Warner Bros studio, which financed the shoot, ultimately gave up, according to the New York Times. Elliot secured the film's rights in 2007, a year before Pollack died. The producer then assembled a team, who were able to put it together using digital technology. ""Aretha's fans will be enthralled by every moment of the film as her genius, her devotion to God and her spirit are present in every frame,"" said Elliot in a statement. To qualify for the 2019 Academy Awards, the 87-minute film will run in Los Angeles and New York for one week this year. Elliot told the New York Times a wider release would likely take place in January, potentially coinciding with the birthday of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. ""Amazing Grace is the heart and soul of Aretha Franklin,"" the singer's niece and estate's executor Sabrina Owens told media on Monday. ""Her fans need to see this film, which is so pure and joyous."" Franklin won 18 Grammys and had 17 Top Ten US chart hits over a music career spanning seven decades.

"This video can not be played ""We start buying Christmas presents in the January sales!"" Whisper itâ¦ but almost one in five of us has already done almost all the Christmas shopping. Some 18% of Britons are reckoned to have bought most of their gifts by the end of October - a much higher proportion than any of our European neighbours. The figures are based on a survey of 1,000 shoppers undertaken by the Centre for Retail Research for VoucherCodes.co.uk Indeed, 11% of Brits start their shopping in September or earlier and another 18% did so last month - though almost two in five of us will leave it until December. Those behind the survey believe it's because British families want to spread the cost. ""Savvy shoppers seem to be planning ahead, taking advantage of flash sales and the wealth of ways to save, including discount sites and vouchers,"" says Jimmy New, director of marketing at VoucherCodes.co.uk But this is not only about spending. The two million-strong Association of British Credit Unions (ABCUL) network across the country has a long history of supporting saving schemes for Christmas. Matt Bland, head of policy at ABCUL, says this is because paying for Christmas is a key source of financial stress and worry. ""Everyone wants to give their children a Christmas to remember but finding the money to do so is not always easy with the pressures on family finances."" Being organised means families do not have to worry about how they will pay for Christmas in January. The popularity of November events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday are also behind Christmas coming early, explains Mr New, with a third of Brits starting their shopping this month. ""This is promising news for retailers who will see sales continue to ramp up in the run-up to Christmas."" The research puts the UK in line with the United States and Canada, where more than 20% of shoppers expect to complete the vast majority of their spending before the end of November. Almost two in five of us will have completed most of our Christmas shopping by the end of this month. But this does not include spending on all the food and booze. Last Christmas, we spent an estimated Â£22bn on groceries, with two-thirds of shoppers seeing the festive period as a time to splash the cash, according to analysts IGD. ""Until you've been a butcher you've not experienced Christmas,"" says Jon Howarth But independent food shops have long been supporting organised families to spread the cost over the entire year. One is PJ Howarth butchers in the Manchester suburb of Urmston. ""We've been running a payment scheme as long as I can remember,"" says owner Jon Howarth. ""Christmas is off the scale really - until you've been a butcher you've not experienced Christmas. ""If you're organised it's a dream. If not it's a nightmare."" Jon estimates customers can spend an average of Â£150 at Christmas time and his scheme allows them to pay a few pounds at a time from January onwards. ""It's popular, it's steady,"" he says. ""But next year I want to expand it to a general loyalty scheme so families can save and spread costs all year round. And they can't do that at a big supermarket.""

"Lloyds Banking Group has confirmed that it is cutting 6,240 jobs and creating 8,240 new ones as it overhauls its digital services. Lloyds said that 75% of the new roles would be filled by existing staff, but that some specialist roles such as data scientists would come from outside. Branches will be unaffected but its site in Gillingham will close. Britain's biggest High Street lender has been reorganising as more people bank online, rather than in branches. Lloyds said some existing jobs would be refreshed and some new ones created, with staff being retrained. It added: ""This forms part of the Â£3bn commitment the group has made to invest heavily in its technology and people over the course of its three-year strategic plan."" Lloyds replacing debit cards for some Lloyds Banking Group to close 49 branches Unite union national officer Rob MacGregor said the news would ""undoubtedly hit the morale of staff who have had to endure round after round of job cuts, branch closures and constant upheaval"". He added: ""Unite will be pressing Lloyds to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and ensure that staff who move into new roles are given the support and skills that enable them to continue delivering the best possible customer service."" Lloyds has been shutting High Street outlets as more customers do their banking through apps or on the internet. This year it earmarked more than 60 branches for closure, while in 2017 it closed 54 Lloyds branches, 24 from its Bank of Scotland brand and 22 belonging to the Halifax. However, the lender has also been creating new jobs, and this summer promised to invest Â£3bn in technology and staff training as part of a three-year plan to transform the business. In the three months to 30 September, total revenue at the bank rose to Â£4.7bn from Â£4.6bn a year previously, while profit before tax fell 7% to Â£1.8bn.
