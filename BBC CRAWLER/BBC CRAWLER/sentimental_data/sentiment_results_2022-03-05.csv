"This video can not be played Watch: Locals clear out a shopping mall in Mariupol as the city remains under siege by Russian forces On day 10 of the invasion, people hoping to escape besieged cities in Ukraine were forced back to shelters after plans for a brief truce went awry. The BBC's Joel Gunter says Russian forces continued to shell the city of Mariupol on Saturday, despite agreeing to a ceasefire just hours earlier - throwing an attempted mass evacuation of civilians into chaos. ""I'm right now in Mariupol, I'm on the street, I can hear shelling every three to five minutes,"" said Alexander, a 44-year-old engineer and resident of the city. The green corridor set up to get people out was not working, he said. ""I can see cars of people who tried to flee, and they are coming back. It is chaos."" Three hours after the ceasefire was supposed to begin, at 09:00 (07:00 GMT), Mariupol authorities announced they had postponed a planned mass evacuation because of the continued bombardment. Mr Putin was meeting Aeroflot flight attendants near Moscow Russian President Vladimir Putin has described sanctions imposed by Western nations over his invasion of Ukraine as ""akin to a declaration of war"". ""But thank God it has not come to that,"" he added. Mr Putin also warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine would be seen as participation in the armed conflict. And he rejected suggestions that he would introduce a state of emergency or martial law in Russia. Mr Putin made the remarkswhile speaking to a group of flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow. Buildings in Kharkiv in ruins after sustained Russian bombings For one seasoned BBC correspondent, Russian tactics in Ukraine bring to mind other wars not so long ago. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen, who covered the first Chechen war in 1994-95, says it could get much worse - that ""Russia answers resistance with firepower"". Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, has already felt the effects. So has Mariupol and other cities in the east. ""Russia's invasion has once again been slowed by logistical bottlenecks, tactical mistakes and terrified teenagers who had not been told they were going to war - as well as resistance as fierce as anything the Chechens offered in 1995,"" he writes. Kevin Connolly, who was a correspondent for the BBC in Moscow in the 1990s, is also reflecting on history. He says there are moments when the tectonic plates of history shift beneath our feet and Europe is violently remade. It is time to recognise that we are at such a moment, he adds. But drawing the right lessons from those big moments when everything changes is not easy. Read more from Kevin here. In the Black Sea port of Kherson, the first Ukrainian city to fall to the Russians, protests against the occupiers have broken out. About 2,000 people marched through the city centre, waving flags and singing the Ukrainian national anthem. They shouted patriotic slogans including ""Russians go home"" and ""Kherson is Ukraine"". Kherson, a key port on the Black Sea and the Dnieper River, fell to Russian troops earlier this week. Videos of the protest on social media show Russian troops firing into the air to deter the approaching crowd. One local resident, Yevhen, told the BBC the protest was a march for freedom and Ukrainian independence. This video can not be played ""Kherson is Ukraine"": Protests against Russian occupation take place in the only big city captured so far Ukrainian civilians, assisted by the country's military, are evacuating the small city of Irpin, which sits just 20km (12 miles) north-west of Kyiv. The route is a difficult one, with many having to travel by foot along shelled roads and damaged bridges. Artillery and air strikes have caused severe damage in the area, with at least one attack leaving a residential tower block almost completely destroyed. You can see more images of the evacuation here. Russia's 86 Zara stores are to close from Sunday, including this one in St Petersburg Zara, Paypal and Samsung are the latest international firms to suspend trading in Russia after it invaded Ukraine. Zara's owner,Inditex, will shut all 502 stores of its eight brands, which also include Bershka, Stradivarius and Oysho, from Sunday. Payment giant Paypal cited ""violent military aggression in Ukraine"" as the reason to shut down its services. Samsung - Russia's top supplier of smartphones - is suspending shipments over ""geopolitical developments"". Other global brands, including Apple, H&M and Ikea, have alreadystopped selling in Russia. The clothes store closures are expected to hit more than 9,000 of Inditex's employees who work in Russia. The Spanish-owned business told the BBC it was drawing up a plan to support them. The billionaire businessmen perceived to be in President Putin's inner circle now find themselves scrambling to hold on to their assets amid the most comprehensive economic penalties imposed in the modern era. Mr Putin has warned his allies for many years they should protect themselves against such measures, particularly as relations soured with the US and EU countries after the annexation of Crimea. But while some took his advice and remained invested in Russia, others kept their money in palatial properties overseas and football clubs, and their companies remained listed on foreign stock exchanges.

In addition, many multinational firms have ceased operations in Russia, On Saturday,Zara, Paypal and Samsungbecame the latest global brands to suspend trading there. The economic measures have already caused the rouble to plunge in value and forced the Russian central bank to double interest rates. In his latest comments, Mr Putin sought to justify the war in Ukraine, repeating his assertion that he was seeking to defend Russian speaking communities there through the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of the country. Responding to Western defence analysts' allegations that the Russian military campaign was going less well than expected, he said: ""Our army will fulfil all the tasks. I don't doubt that at all. Everything is going to plan."" He added that only professional soldiers were taking part in the hostilities and there were no conscripts involved, despite reports to the contrary. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? SCENARIOS:Five ways the war in Ukraine might end INNER CIRCLE:Who's in Putin's entourage, running the war? IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict The Russian leader said efforts to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would be considered by Russia to be a step into the military conflict and those responsible would be treated as enemy combatants. ""The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood,"" he added. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned Nato for ruling out the no-fly zone. However, Western leaders say introducing the measure would be an escalation. Mr Putin also said he had no plans to declare martial law in Russia. adding that such a step would only be taken in ""instances of external aggression, in defined areas of military activity"". ""But we don't have such a situation and I hope we won't have one,"" he said. There had been rumours that Mr Putin was planning to declare martial law, which is when normal civil law is suspended or the military takes control of government functions. He said there were other special emergency states which could be used in the case of a ""large-scale external threat"", but that he had no plans to introduce these either. Meanwhile, diplomatic moves have continued on the sidelines of the conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met Mr Putin in Moscow on Saturday and had a three-hour discussion on the war. Mr Bennett then headed to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  As an Orthodox Jew, he broke Shabbat in order to travel, which is allowed under Jewish law if human life is at stake. Although Israel is a key ally of the US, Mr Bennett has tried to preserve a good relationship with Russia.  Ukraine's President Zelensky, who is Jewish, has called on Israel to mediate in the crisis. And the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has met Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, telling him he was in awe of his courage in standing up to Russia. The two men met on the Polish-Ukraine border. Mr Kuleba reiterated his desire and optimism for more military backing from Nato, including a no-fly zone.

"Women who were seeking IVF treatment were deferred if they were unvaccinated Women who are unvaccinated for Covid should no longer be deferred for IVF treatment in Scotland. Chief Medical Officer Sir Gregor Smith has written to all health boards confirming the decision. In January the Scottish governmentpaused the treatment,externalfor all patients who were not fully vaccinated unless they were waiting for a booster. It said the decision was based on uncertainty about how pregnant women were affected by the Omicron variant. If a patient had started to receive IVF, they were told they could resume the treatment when the suspension was lifted. However, many women - particularly those who were older - said the delay could reduce their chance of conceiving. On Friday, a Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The chief medical officer wrote to all NHS Scotland health boards this afternoon to advise them that fertility treatment for unvaccinated patients should no longer be deferred, and treatment of patients can recommence. ""This follows a review of deferral recommendations that was put in place from 7 January."" I'm unvaccinated and can't get fertility treatment The vaccine fertility myths that just won't go away IVF treatment delays 'heartbreaking' Vaccines are deemed safe to give in pregnancy and cut the risk of severe Covid - however, doctors were cautious about advising pregnant patients to get vaccinated early last year. A great deal of safety data has become available since then and pregnant women have been offered the vaccine since April. In December, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) put pregnant women on the priority list for jabs, similar to people with underlying health conditions. A number of false and misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines, fertility and miscarriages have been circulated online, despite not being supported by evidence. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson Jackie Baillie previously said some women had concerns about the vaccine due to early advice that pregnant women should not be vaccinated. Jemma McDonald's IVF was deferred because she wasn't vaccinated against Covid-19 Jemma McDonald was due to begin IVF almost five years after she and her partner started trying to have a baby. Two days before Christmas, the 25-year-old discovered she could no longer be treated because she was unvaccinated. Jemma, from Glasgow, said the news was devastating, particularly because she had not had a chance to share her concerns about getting vaccinated with her doctor. ""I'm not anti-vaccine, I'm just in limbo,"" she said. ""I was unsure of why or even when to get them [the vaccine]. I hadn't had a chance to speak to any doctors or nurses regarding this with fertility treatment. ""At first they were saying if you're planning on being pregnant when the vaccines first came out it was advised not to get them. It all seems so quickly changed around."" ""We thought when you get your consents it's only a couple of months after if your treatment was successful then you'd end up being pregnant - so we thought we're almost there. ""But to hear the news about the vaccines we feel like we've been kicked right back to the start again."" A review of the Scottish government's decision to defer IVF for unvaccinated patients was due on 28 February, but no update was given for several days. One woman told the BBC she believed the government had been ""completely inhumane"" and questioned why the same decision had not been made for unvaccinated patients in England. She said: ""It's an absolute disgraced. Personally I feel like the Scottish government is holding us at ransom. ""I'm not an anti-vaxxer, however I am pro-choice - it is my body, I should have the right to decide what goes into my body, not forced into something so I can start a family."" Meanwhile, Jackie Baillie said she had been in contact with a number of women who were desperate to have children and extremely upset at the Scottish government's ""blanket approach"". Speaking after the rule was lifted, Ms Baillie said: ""This is a welcome decision to lift this callous policy, but it should never have been introduced in the first place. ""The decision to suspend treatment only happened in Scotland and no other part of the UK, and it was the only service in the NHS in Scotland on which vaccination was made a pre-condition. ""The SNP must make sure that every woman who had their treatment delayed because of this cruel policy gets the support they need to get their treatment back on track."" Going forward, unvaccinated women who have IVF will be asked to sign a consent form saying they are aware of the risks of being unvaccinated. Chief Medical Officer Sir Gregor Smith said that Public Health Scotland data had suggested that Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations were stabilising and that the risk of becoming severely ill with the virus had reduced. He added: ""I am recommending that this treatment can recommence so long as women affected are fully informed both of the risks of non-vaccination and also of the extensive evidence concerning the safety of vaccines in pregnant women, those planning pregnancy or undergoing fertility treatment. ""I strongly support the recommendation that people get the vaccine when offered. The Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective and there is no evidence to suggest that the Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility in women or men."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Ukraine's president has attacked Nato leaders over their refusal to implement a no-fly zone around the country. In a fiery speech, Volodymyr Zelensky said the West's reluctance to intervene had given Russia ""a green light"" to continue bombarding towns and villages. Nato has argued that a no-fly zone will result in confrontation with Moscow. And Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, said on Saturday that any such move would be seen ""as participation in an armed conflict by that country"". Referring to sanctions imposed on Russia by the West, the Russian leader said they were ""akin to a declaration of war, but thank God it has not come to that"". In his speech from Kyiv, Mr Zelensky said he disagreed that direct action could ""provoke Russia's direct aggression against Nato"". In angry comments, he said the argument reflected the ""self-hypnosis of those who are weak, under-confident inside"" and that Western reservations indicated that ""not everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe's number one goal"". ""All the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness, because of your disunity,"" a furious Mr Zelensky added. On Friday, Nato's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned that the introduction of a no-fly zone could lead to a ""full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering"". The only way to impose a no-fly zone would be ""by shooting down Russian planes,"" Stoltenberg said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also ruled out the introduction of a no-fly zone, buttold the BBC he was convinced Ukraine could winits war with Russia. ""I can't tell you how long this will go on,"" America's top diplomat said. ""I can't tell you how long it will take. But the idea that Russia can subjugate to its will 45 million people who are ardently fighting for their future and their freedom, that does not involve Russia having its thumb on Ukraine, that tells you a lot."" As Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its 10th day, Moscow's forces continue to heavily shell many cities. In the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, the city's mayor has said that residents are under a ""blockade"" after days of ""ruthless"" attacks from Russian forces which has seen power and water shut off to the city's 450,00 strong population. Vadim Boychenko wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the city was ""simply being destroyed"" and said officials were prioritising ""the establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city"". In Kyiv, a massive convoy stretching out over 40 miles (64km) remains stalled outside the city, but the Ukrainian capital has come under renewed assault, with explosions caused by intense shelling audible in the city centre. There have also been unconfirmed reports of fresh fighting on Saturday in the north-eastern city of Sumy and of rocket attacks on the train station in Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, above a metro station where city residents are sheltering from shelling, and in the northern city of Chernihiv. And the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has warned that Russian troops have advanced within20 miles (32km) of Ukraine's second biggest nuclear facility. Russian forces have been shelling the city of Kharkiv for over a week Her comments follow Friday's attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which she said reflected a ""dangerous new escalation"" in Russia's invasion. Moscow's ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, dismissed reports that Russian troops attacked the plant as ""lies"" and ""disinformation"". Meanwhile in Russia, a new law signed by President Vladimir Putin that would impose prison terms of up to 15 years on people charged with spreading ""fake news"" about the war in Ukraine has seen several western media outlets, including the BBC, suspend operations in the country. Tim Davie, the BBC's director-general, said the legislation ""appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism"" in Russia, while the Washington Post said it would remove bylines from pieces written by its reporters in Russia. It comes asSky News released dramatic footageof their correspondent Stuart Ramsey coming under fire outside Kyiv. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Meanwhile, Mr Zelenskyaddressed massive rallies in support of Ukraine in several cities across Europe,including the Czech capital, Prague, and the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. He warned demonstrators: ""If Ukraine does not survive, the whole of Europe will not survive."" But in the Serbian capital of Belgrade,some 4,000 people have taken part in a pro-Russian rallythat marched from a monument of Russian Tsar Nicholas II to the Russian embassy. Demonstrators sang the Serbian and Russian national anthems and carried Russian flags and pictures of President Vladimir Putin. The pro-Russia march in Belgrade Elsewhere, in a sign that Western sanctions are starting to have a tangible impact, Italian police haveseized the yachts of two of Russia's wealthiest oligarchs. Officers seized a 213-ft (65-m) yacht worth $27m (Â£20m) owned by Alexey Mordashov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and Russia's richest man, in the northern port of Imperia, officials told local media. Another yacht, owned by Gennady Timchenko, another oligarch with close ties to Putin, has been impounded in Imperia, officials said. Mordashov is worth an estimated $29bn and built his wealth around the Russian steel producer Severstal, while Timchenko is said to hold around $17bn of assets and made his fortune in oil trading.

"Women who were seeking IVF treatment were deferred if they were unvaccinated Women who are unvaccinated for Covid should no longer be deferred for IVF treatment in Scotland. Chief Medical Officer Sir Gregor Smith has written to all health boards confirming the decision. In January the Scottish governmentpaused the treatment,externalfor all patients who were not fully vaccinated unless they were waiting for a booster. It said the decision was based on uncertainty about how pregnant women were affected by the Omicron variant. If a patient had started to receive IVF, they were told they could resume the treatment when the suspension was lifted. However, many women - particularly those who were older - said the delay could reduce their chance of conceiving. On Friday, a Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The chief medical officer wrote to all NHS Scotland health boards this afternoon to advise them that fertility treatment for unvaccinated patients should no longer be deferred, and treatment of patients can recommence. ""This follows a review of deferral recommendations that was put in place from 7 January."" I'm unvaccinated and can't get fertility treatment The vaccine fertility myths that just won't go away IVF treatment delays 'heartbreaking' Vaccines are deemed safe to give in pregnancy and cut the risk of severe Covid - however, doctors were cautious about advising pregnant patients to get vaccinated early last year. A great deal of safety data has become available since then and pregnant women have been offered the vaccine since April. In December, the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) put pregnant women on the priority list for jabs, similar to people with underlying health conditions. A number of false and misleading claims about Covid-19 vaccines, fertility and miscarriages have been circulated online, despite not being supported by evidence. Scottish Labour's health spokesperson Jackie Baillie previously said some women had concerns about the vaccine due to early advice that pregnant women should not be vaccinated. Jemma McDonald's IVF was deferred because she wasn't vaccinated against Covid-19 Jemma McDonald was due to begin IVF almost five years after she and her partner started trying to have a baby. Two days before Christmas, the 25-year-old discovered she could no longer be treated because she was unvaccinated. Jemma, from Glasgow, said the news was devastating, particularly because she had not had a chance to share her concerns about getting vaccinated with her doctor. ""I'm not anti-vaccine, I'm just in limbo,"" she said. ""I was unsure of why or even when to get them [the vaccine]. I hadn't had a chance to speak to any doctors or nurses regarding this with fertility treatment. ""At first they were saying if you're planning on being pregnant when the vaccines first came out it was advised not to get them. It all seems so quickly changed around."" ""We thought when you get your consents it's only a couple of months after if your treatment was successful then you'd end up being pregnant - so we thought we're almost there. ""But to hear the news about the vaccines we feel like we've been kicked right back to the start again."" A review of the Scottish government's decision to defer IVF for unvaccinated patients was due on 28 February, but no update was given for several days. One woman told the BBC she believed the government had been ""completely inhumane"" and questioned why the same decision had not been made for unvaccinated patients in England. She said: ""It's an absolute disgraced. Personally I feel like the Scottish government is holding us at ransom. ""I'm not an anti-vaxxer, however I am pro-choice - it is my body, I should have the right to decide what goes into my body, not forced into something so I can start a family."" Meanwhile, Jackie Baillie said she had been in contact with a number of women who were desperate to have children and extremely upset at the Scottish government's ""blanket approach"". Speaking after the rule was lifted, Ms Baillie said: ""This is a welcome decision to lift this callous policy, but it should never have been introduced in the first place. ""The decision to suspend treatment only happened in Scotland and no other part of the UK, and it was the only service in the NHS in Scotland on which vaccination was made a pre-condition. ""The SNP must make sure that every woman who had their treatment delayed because of this cruel policy gets the support they need to get their treatment back on track."" Going forward, unvaccinated women who have IVF will be asked to sign a consent form saying they are aware of the risks of being unvaccinated. Chief Medical Officer Sir Gregor Smith said that Public Health Scotland data had suggested that Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations were stabilising and that the risk of becoming severely ill with the virus had reduced. He added: ""I am recommending that this treatment can recommence so long as women affected are fully informed both of the risks of non-vaccination and also of the extensive evidence concerning the safety of vaccines in pregnant women, those planning pregnancy or undergoing fertility treatment. ""I strongly support the recommendation that people get the vaccine when offered. The Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective and there is no evidence to suggest that the Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility in women or men."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The UK, EU, and US governments have responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with devastating sanctions against the billionaire businessmen perceived to be in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. Mr Putin has warned his allies for many years they should protect themselves against such measures, particularly as relations soured with the US and EU countries after the annexation of Crimea. But while some of those closest to him took his advice and remained invested in Russia, others kept their money in palatial properties overseas and football clubs, and their companies remained listed on foreign stock exchanges. They now find themselves scrambling to hold on to their assets amid the most comprehensive economic penalties imposed in the modern era. Here's what we know about some of them. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Said to be one of Mr Putin's favourite oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov is also one of the richest, worth an estimated $17.6bn, according toForbes,external. A former professional fencer, the EU describes him as a ""businessman-official"" who helps the president solve his business problems. Born in Uzbekistan while it was still part of the Soviet Union, he runs USM Holdings, a huge conglomerate that involves mining and telecoms, including Russia's second biggest mobile network MegaFon. TheEU announced sanctions against him,externalon 28 February, and theUS,externalandUK,externalhave followed suit. He has called the sanctions unfair and said all the allegations against him were false. Igor Sechin, left, with Vladimir Putin in 2017 USM Holdings appears to be hoping to avoid EU sanctions as he owns just under 50% of the shares. His superyacht Dilbar, named after his mother, is undergoing a refit in Hamburg and is at risk of being seized. In the UK, his main visible investments are in property. In London he owns Beechwood House, a Â£65m country house with grounds in the heart of the city, and just outside London in Surrey, he owns a Tudor mansion, Sutton Place. Both have been frozen by UK authorities. His business partner Farhad Moshiri owns Everton, and Mr Usmanov's companies USM, MegaFon and Yota have been key sponsors at the club, with suggestions his involvement was even closer. Everton suspended the sponsorship deal last week, and Mr Moshiri quit as a USM board member. SANCTIONED BY: UK, EU One of the most high-profile Russian billionaires because of the phenomenal success of his football club Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich was sanctioned later than some others, possibly because he is less obviously influential than other Putin allies. How influential he is in the Kremlin is much debated. Some suggest he is merely tolerated by Mr Putin, butthe UK believes the two are close,externaland that Mr Abramovich has made money out of the relationship, being awarded lucrative contracts for the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, for example. Mr Abramovich strongly denies having close ties to Mr Putin or the Kremlin, butÂ the UK portion ofÂ hisÂ estimated $12.4bn fortuneÂ isÂ now frozen. Just before the UK sanctions were announced, he put Chelsea up for sale for Â£3bn. His Â£150m house in London's Kensington Palace Gardens in London was also reportedly up for sale. Mr Abramovich made his money in the 1990s and was one of the original oligarchs during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. His biggest break was buying the oil company Sibneft at a knockdown price. His assets include the third-longest yacht in the world, Eclipse, which recently left the British Virgin Isles, heading east across the Atlantic. His otherÂ mega-yacht, Solaris, is in the Mediterranean. He had started to withdraw from the UK in recent years. In 2018 he decided not to apply to renew his UK visa, and has instead been using his newly acquired Israeli passport to visit London. And while he used to go to every Chelsea home game, in recent years he was rarely seen at Stamford Bridge - and now he is banned from entering the UK. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK When President Putin came to power, Oleg Deripaska was immensely rich, his wealth peaking at about $28bn - but he is now thought to be worth a mere$3bn,external. Oleg Deripaska, right, with Mr Putin in 2017 He fought his way to a fortune in the 1990s, coming out on top in a vicious battle for the aluminium industry. The US said he was involved in money laundering, bribery, extortion and racketeering, and reported allegations that he had ""ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group"". He denies the allegations. He suffered badly in the 2008 financial crisis and needed Mr Putin to bail him out. In 2009, President Putin humiliated him by suggesting publicly that he had stolen a pen. Since then, he seems to have worked himself back into favour and was described in the Mueller report - a US investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election - as being ""closely aligned"" with the president. When it announced its sanctions, the UK also described him as closely associated with Mr Putin. He founded a green energy and metals company, En+ Group, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but  reduced his stake in it to below 50% when he was subjected toUS sanctions in 2018,external. At the time, one of Mr Deripaska's companies, Basic Element, released a statement calling the sanctions ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd"". He owns a vast art deco property, Hamstone House in Weybridge, Surrey, which he has been trying to sell for Â£18m but has now been taken off the market. He also owns a yacht, Clio, which was recently seen in the Maldives. Unlike many sanctioned oligarchs Mr Deripaska has been vocal about his view on the war, taking to social media to call for peace. ""Negotiations need to start as soon as possible!"" he wrote. SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Igor Sechin's connections to Vladimir Putin run long and deep, according to the EU which announced sanctions against himon 28 February,external. He is said to be one of Mr Putin's most trusted and closest advisors, as well as a personal friend, and the two are thought to be in daily contact. His progress was made through ruthlessly pushing aside opponents - his nickname in the Russian press is Darth Vader. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 described him as ""so shadowy that it was joked he may not actually exist but rather was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman, invented by the Kremlin to instil fear"". The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014, which he called ""totally unjustified and illegal"". They announced newsanctions against him on 24 February,external. Mr Sechin has spent his career alternating between jobs in politics and business, sometimes holding senior jobs in both at the same time. When Putin was prime minister, he was a deputy prime minister, and now runs the state oil giant Rosneft. Mr Sechin worked with Mr Putin in the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s, and is widely believed to have been in the much-feared intelligence service, the KGB, although has never openly admitted it. Based in Russia, no-one knows how much money Mr Sechin has, but the French have seized a yacht called Amore Vero that was linked to him after his second wife Olga Sechina kept posting photographs of herself on board. They have since divorced. Beyond that there is little sign he has substantial wealth overseas that could be easily uncovered, and it may be hard to track down and freeze any more of his assets. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK Alexey Miller is another old friend of Vladimir Putin's. Something of a grey man, he too has built his career on loyalty to the president, starting when he was Mr Putin's deputy on the foreign relations committee of the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. Alexey Miller, right, with Mr Putin in February this year He has run the immensely powerful state-owned gas company Gazprom since 2001, but it was a surprise appointment and it is widely assumed that he is just carrying out the orders of his old boss. The US ambassador to Moscow in 2009 described Gazprom as ""inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt"". Mr Miller was not sanctioned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but when he wasadded to the list in the US in 2018,external, he said he was proud. ""Not being included in the first list. I even had some doubts - maybe something is wrong? But I am finally included. This means we are doing everything right,"" he said. He does not appear to have easily traceable assets outside Russia and there is no information about his net worth. SANCTIONED BY: EU, UK The EU describes Pyotr Aven (pictured on the left) as one of President Putin's closest oligarchs, and Mikhail Fridman as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. Together the two men created Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. The Mueller report said Mr Aven met with Putin in the Kremlin about four times a year, saying he ""understood any suggestions or critiques Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow through"". They were warned by Mr Putin in 2016 to protect their interests from future sanctions. This week the pair stood down from the London-headquartered LetterOne investment group they founded almost 10 years ago because their shares werefrozen by EU sanctions on 28 February,external. Mr Aven also stood down as a trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The two businessmen said they would ""contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them"". Mr Fridman, thought to be wortharound $12bn,external, lives in London in a house next to Lord's Cricket Ground and also owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, that he paid Â£65m for in 2016. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"" but would not criticise the Kremlin directly saying to do so could put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of employees at risk.

SANCTIONED BY: US, EU, UK Igor Sechin's connections to Vladimir Putin run long and deep, according to the EU which announced sanctions against himon 28 February,external. He is said to be one of Mr Putin's most trusted and closest advisors, as well as a personal friend, and the two are thought to be in daily contact. His progress was made through ruthlessly pushing aside opponents - his nickname in the Russian press is Darth Vader. A leaked US embassy cable from 2008 described him as ""so shadowy that it was joked he may not actually exist but rather was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman, invented by the Kremlin to instil fear"". The US imposed sanctions on him in 2014, which he called ""totally unjustified and illegal"". They announced newsanctions against him on 24 February,external. Mr Sechin has spent his career alternating between jobs in politics and business, sometimes holding senior jobs in both at the same time. When Putin was prime minister, he was a deputy prime minister, and now runs the state oil giant Rosneft. Mr Sechin worked with Mr Putin in the mayor's office in St Petersburg in the 1990s, and is widely believed to have been in the much-feared intelligence service, the KGB, although has never openly admitted it. Based in Russia, no-one knows how much money Mr Sechin has, but the French have seized a yacht called Amore Vero that was linked to him after his second wife Olga Sechina kept posting photographs of herself on board. They have since divorced. Beyond that there is little sign he has substantial wealth overseas that could be easily uncovered, and it may be hard to track down and freeze any more of his assets. SANCTIONED BY: US, UK Alexey Miller is another old friend of Vladimir Putin's. Something of a grey man, he too has built his career on loyalty to the president, starting when he was Mr Putin's deputy on the foreign relations committee of the St Petersburg mayor's office in the 1990s. Alexey Miller, right, with Mr Putin in February this year He has run the immensely powerful state-owned gas company Gazprom since 2001, but it was a surprise appointment and it is widely assumed that he is just carrying out the orders of his old boss. The US ambassador to Moscow in 2009 described Gazprom as ""inefficient, politically driven, and corrupt"". Mr Miller was not sanctioned after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but when he wasadded to the list in the US in 2018,external, he said he was proud. ""Not being included in the first list. I even had some doubts - maybe something is wrong? But I am finally included. This means we are doing everything right,"" he said. He does not appear to have easily traceable assets outside Russia and there is no information about his net worth. SANCTIONED BY: EU, UK The EU describes Pyotr Aven (pictured on the left) as one of President Putin's closest oligarchs, and Mikhail Fridman as an enabler of Putin's inner circle. Together the two men created Alfa-Bank, the largest private bank in Russia. The Mueller report said Mr Aven met with Putin in the Kremlin about four times a year, saying he ""understood any suggestions or critiques Putin made during these meetings were implicit directives, and there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow through"". They were warned by Mr Putin in 2016 to protect their interests from future sanctions. This week the pair stood down from the London-headquartered LetterOne investment group they founded almost 10 years ago because their shares werefrozen by EU sanctions on 28 February,external. Mr Aven also stood down as a trustee of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The two businessmen said they would ""contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them"". Mr Fridman, thought to be wortharound $12bn,external, lives in London in a house next to Lord's Cricket Ground and also owns a huge property, Athlone House in north London, that he paid Â£65m for in 2016. At a London press conference on 1 March, he said the Ukraine war was a ""huge tragedy"" but would not criticise the Kremlin directly saying to do so could put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of employees at risk.

"The number of fuel poor households in the UK will double in a year if the crisis in Ukraine leads to higher energy bills, charities are warning. Analysts are predicting that the war has pushed up wholesale prices, and could mean the average domestic bill in the UK hits Â£3,000 in October. National Energy Action said that would put 8.5 million households in serious financial difficulty from fuel bills. That would be twice the number of a year earlier, equating to 30% of homes. Charity Age UK said such an increase would have a ""devastating"" impact on the health and wellbeing of older people, many of whom could go without heating for weeks. The cost of gas and electricity for the typical household, on a tariff governed by the energy regulator Ofgem's price cap in England, Wales and Scotland, is already rising by 54% to nearly Â£2,000 from the start of April. Pricesare also rising sharply in Northern Ireland. A string of energy analysts have predicted that the conflict in Ukraine, and the knock-on for gas supplied by Russia, could have a relatively sustained impact on the wholesale price of energy. UK suppliers, and ultimately consumers, are not immune to those global price rises, even though Russiaonly provides about 5% of the UK's gas supplies. Analysts have suggested that could be reflected in the next calculation of Ofgem's price cap, which would take effect at the start of October. Many, including the suppliers' own trade body, say the average household billcould get close to, or reach Â£3,000 a year. National Energy Action, which campaigns for warm, dry homes, said the number of households in fuel poverty was already expected to go up from four million in October 2021, to 6.5 million after April's price rise. That would go up again to 8.5 million in October this year, if the typical bill increases to Â£3,000. That is a possibility but still far from certain, owing to the volatility of the war, the international picture, and wholesale prices. The charity's definition of fuel poverty is a household which needs to spend more than 10% of their household income on fuel to heat their home to a satisfactory standard. Similar definitions are used officially in parts of the UK, although in England the definition of fuel poverty used by the government is a more complex calculation. When George Mycock, moved to London from Stoke-on-Trent, he ended up having to pay Â£950 a month for a room in a four-bedroom flat share. With bills included, it works out at about 70% of his monthly income. His flatmates have already seen bills go up by between Â£50 and Â£100 each in the last few months. But he says the rise in energy bills is ""scary"". ""We don't know how much we're going to have to pay [on our default tariff],"" he says. ""It's plunged people into uncertainty."" Read more: How you are coping with rising prices National Energy Action has joined with 50 charity and campaign groups to call for support from the government for financially-stretched bill-payers. The coalition has claimed that further price rises could lead to more people dying prematurely across the UK next winter. ""This is a disaster and, inevitably, will lead to more needless winter deaths. The government must act now, to protect the most vulnerable, and to save lives,"" said Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action. Bill shock as energy price rises hit home What help with bills is there in my council tax band? A government spokeswoman said: ""It is hard to predict what longer term impacts the current situation in Ukraine will have on energy costs. However, the energy price cap will continue to insulate millions of customers from volatile global gas prices ""We are also taking decisive action to help more than 27 million households with rising energy costs, with a Â£200 reduction on bills this autumn and a Â£150 non-repayable reduction in council tax bills.""

"This video can not be played Naomi Long was speaking at the Alliance Party's conference in Belfast on Saturday The assembly election in May will be a chance to say no to ""political soap operas"" and deliver politics that works, Naomi Long has said. The Alliance Party leader said it was not a time to walk away from government, but ""lead in government"". Mrs Long is leading the party into the second assembly election since she took over in 2016. She addressed the party's annual conference on Saturday - its first since the Covid pandemic began. The party currently has seven assembly members (MLAs) at Stormont, but is hoping that will rise following successful local government, European and Westminster elections in 2019. Mrs Long has also been Stormont's justice minister since January 2020, remaining in post despite the absence of an executive after the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister. She said it was ""hard to fathom"" that Stormont was again without an executive after being restored just two years ago. ""It seems some politicians are addicted to crisis and conflict and simply not up to the job of actually governing,"" Mrs Long said. ""People have had enough of the constant dramas and political soap operas. ""They want politicians who don't just identify more problems - or worse still, add to them - but who are focused on finding solutions."" As it happened: Naomi Long's speech Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis MPs pass bill to prevent future Stormont collapse She added that Alliance had so far been ""punching well above its weight"" in the assembly but needed to ""finish the job"". She citeda private members bill her party had brought seeking to ban hunting of animals with dogs, and said ""four more Alliance"" MLAs could have helped pass the bill after other parties voted against it. ""May's election won't just determine how our politics works for the next five years - it will determine if it works."" Party members gathered at a Belfast hotel Alliance is part of the bloc that designates as other in the assembly, but Mrs Long has previously said that system means her party's views are not considered on controversial issues that require cross-community support, i.e. a majority of both unionists and nationalists. Deputy leader Stephen Farry also addressed conference. He was elected as the party's sole MP for North Down in the 2019 general election. He described Alliance as ""protocol realists"". TheNorthern Ireland Protocol puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. North Down MP Stephen Farry took to the stage before his party leader Mr Farry said: ""In the absence of an alternative, the only course of action is to try and make it work. ""We are protocol realists. ""We are committed to doing all we can to reduce the level and impact of the resultant checks down the Irish Sea through seeking closer alignment between the UK and the EU, and achieving further mitigations, flexibilities and derogations from EU requirements."" The conference took place in Belfast on Saturday. The assembly election is due to take place on 5 May.

"Greg Robinson loved ""the simple things"", like spending time with his family From sausage rolls to sweeties and a coffee with a bun, there were many things that made Greg Robinson smile. But none more so than his family, who he adored, and in particular his grandson, who allowed him to be a big kid. When the father-of-two, who was in his 50s, died suddenly in March 2021, his family's life was turned upside down. ""Granda Greg"" was fit and healthy and along with his wife, Nikki, ran a gift shop in his hometown of Donaghadee in County Down. Whether it was at work, walking the dog, with his local flute band or just out in his beloved town, his family say Greg made time for everyone. After his death, the community rallied around his family - particularly Nikki and their two daughters, Jess and Sam. Now, on the week of his first anniversary, they are giving back to their community by sharing some of the things that made him smile. The little gifts have been being found around the town, each with a simple message: ""An act of kindness in memory of Greg Robinson"". ""We - Nikki, Jess and Sam - wanted to plan something together that allowed us to put our energy into something positive and give us something practical to do which we knew would have an impact on others,"" they told BBC News NI. ""We knew that by making others smile that we, in turn, would feel the benefit of that too. ""We wanted to give back to the community of Donaghadee that helped us. ""We have realised the importance of little things that have made us smile throughout the past year."" As Greg was ""a Donaghadee man, he loved his town and the community"", all the gifts were purchased locally. Among them are chocolate bars; scents from the family's gift shop; flowers; and vouchers for a bakery, for some of his favourite sausage rolls, an ice-cream shop where he used to buy a quarter of sweets on a Saturday night, and a cafe because ""a wee coffee and a bun would have made dad's face light up with excitement"". The family at Jess's wedding Many recipients, including some who did not know Greg, have posted photos of their finds on a local Facebook page, prompting others to share memories. ""When someone dies, it is often the case that people are scared to mention the loved one in case it makes you sad, but the grief journey has taught us that this isn't the case and that the wonderful stories and chat about dad brings so much comfort,"" his family said. ""We love those times when we hear how dad had impacted their lives, from showing kindness as a teenager at high school, to chatting away to customers in his shop."" Nikki remembers her husband as being ""a true gentleman"" who was always making people laugh. ""He was so charismatic, lighting up the room whenever he walked in,"" she added. For Jess and Sam, they will be forever grateful for him teaching them ""to focus on the positive parts of the day, looking for ways that we can express gratitude for every day things"". Nikki says her husband was ""a raker"" who was always joking Greg's wife and daughters have decided that they will continue to mark his anniversary in this way. ""Our hope is that the finders of the envelopes will feel a wee rush of happiness and that it will bring a smile to their face. ""It would also be our hope that it sparks conversations about dad and how his legacy can live on in the community of Donaghadee.""

"Graham Bonham-Carter is said to be linked to Oleg Deripaska through five properties, according to the NCA A judge has frozen UK bank accounts operated by a British businessman amid allegations they are linked to one of Russia's most controversial oligarchs. Accounts linked to Graham Bonham-Carter, second cousin of actress Helena, and part of the extended famous family, were put on hold on Friday. National Crime Agency investigators believe the accounts were being used to help Oleg Deripaska avoid sanctions. It is alleged Mr Bonham-Carter manages property on behalf of the oligarch. Granting the order, Westminster Magistrates Court has given the National Crime Agency six months to investigate the accounts, in one of the first public court moves against an oligarch since the Ukraine crisis began. Mr Bonham-Carter's lawyers have been contacted for comment. There is no suggestion anyone else in the Bonham-Carter family is being investigated by the NCA. Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Oleg Deripaska is one of the richest men associated with President Putin - having made billions from his stake in Russia's aluminium industries. He's been subjected to US sanctions since 2018 - but is not under any sanctions in the UK. He first became widely known in the UK in 2008, when it emerged he had been involved in talks over a donation to the Conservative Party via George Osborne. The donation was never made - but the story triggered a huge row at the time about links between British politicians and Russia's elites. Mr Bonham-Carter is described, on his Linkedin profile, as the director of a company that runs private homes and estates. Andrew Chadwick, a National Crime Agency investigator, told Westminster Magistrates Court that it wanted to freeze five bank accounts associated with Mr Bonham-Carter, of Surrey, to allow Mr Chadwick to investigate suspected links to Oleg Deripaska. ""The application is in respect of account-freezing orders for several bank accounts, held by Graham Bonham-Carter, of Surrey,"" said Mr Chadwick. ""My investigation is that he is heavily linked with a well-known Russian oligarch, who is linked to various crimes and criminality and is currently subject to sanctions in the United States. ""My submission is that funds in accounts held by Mr Bonham-Carter may be for the use of, or from, criminal activity."" ""Oleg Deripaska is a Russian national subject to sanctions since 2019,"" said Mr Chadwick. The officer told the court theUS Treasury alleges Mr Deripaska has been involved in money laundering,external, threatening rivals, wiretapping a government official, extortion, racketeering, ordering a murder and having links to Russian organised crime. Mr Deripaska has called the US allegations and sanctions absurd. The court heard that Mr Bonham-Carter had no criminal record and was not under investigation for taking part in organised crime. He was said to be linked to Mr Deripaska through five properties - two in the United States and three in the UK, all of which are suspected to be ultimately held for the oligarch's benefit. In London, Mr Chadwick said two properties, worth a combined Â£50m, were owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. That company benefited Mr Deripaska and the 'care-of' mailing address had been to Mr Bonham-Carter. Hamstone House, near Weybridge in Surrey, is on the market for Â£18m The third UK property is Hamstone House, a mansion near Weybridge, Surrey, currently on the market for Â£18m. Mr Chadwick said that it was owned by Edenfield Investments and, according to public research, Mr Bonham-Carter's name had appeared on Land Registry documentation for the property when it was purchased. One of the aforementioned London properties had also been the forwarding address for mail to Hamstone House. The two US properties, in New York and Washington, are owned by a company headed by Mr Bonham-Carter. ""Based on that information [about Mr Deripaska's apparent property] I have reasonable grounds to suspect that the accounts are being held for unlawful conduct,"" said Mr Chadwick. ""Mr Bonham-Carter has well-documented strong links to Mr Deripaska. ""The suspicion is that property held in the name of Mr Bonham-Carter, or companies that he is linked to, in fact belongs to Mr Deripaska - and the reason for the structure is to mask the true ultimate beneficial owner and to evade the sanctions."" District Judge Tan Ikran approved the National Crime Agency's freezing order for the next six months - allowing the agency time to investigate. The accounts hold just over Â£100,000, but the NCA has established that nearly Â£800,000 has additionally flowed through them since November 2020. Mr Bonham-Carter will have the chance to make representations to the court at a date to be fixed. Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions?

Mr Deripaska has called the US allegations and sanctions absurd. The court heard that Mr Bonham-Carter had no criminal record and was not under investigation for taking part in organised crime. He was said to be linked to Mr Deripaska through five properties - two in the United States and three in the UK, all of which are suspected to be ultimately held for the oligarch's benefit. In London, Mr Chadwick said two properties, worth a combined Â£50m, were owned by a company based in the British Virgin Islands. That company benefited Mr Deripaska and the 'care-of' mailing address had been to Mr Bonham-Carter. Hamstone House, near Weybridge in Surrey, is on the market for Â£18m The third UK property is Hamstone House, a mansion near Weybridge, Surrey, currently on the market for Â£18m. Mr Chadwick said that it was owned by Edenfield Investments and, according to public research, Mr Bonham-Carter's name had appeared on Land Registry documentation for the property when it was purchased. One of the aforementioned London properties had also been the forwarding address for mail to Hamstone House. The two US properties, in New York and Washington, are owned by a company headed by Mr Bonham-Carter. ""Based on that information [about Mr Deripaska's apparent property] I have reasonable grounds to suspect that the accounts are being held for unlawful conduct,"" said Mr Chadwick. ""Mr Bonham-Carter has well-documented strong links to Mr Deripaska. ""The suspicion is that property held in the name of Mr Bonham-Carter, or companies that he is linked to, in fact belongs to Mr Deripaska - and the reason for the structure is to mask the true ultimate beneficial owner and to evade the sanctions."" District Judge Tan Ikran approved the National Crime Agency's freezing order for the next six months - allowing the agency time to investigate. The accounts hold just over Â£100,000, but the NCA has established that nearly Â£800,000 has additionally flowed through them since November 2020. Mr Bonham-Carter will have the chance to make representations to the court at a date to be fixed. Why have there been delays to UK Russia sanctions?
