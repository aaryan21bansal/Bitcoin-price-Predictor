"Dr Catherine Monaghan says she fears for the future ""We are planning for war and praying for peace."" Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge. ""We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,"" she said. ""People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."" Staff, already exhausted, she said, were demoralised at having to reopen a Covid ward which required full protective equipment. ""Nurses understandably are really distressed at having to go through this again - having to put on the full PPE - it's very stressful."" Covid: South Tyneside case rate now highest in England Why has the Delta variant spread so quickly in UK? The hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week. The average ages are lower than during the first two waves, and at least two of the seriously ill patients are in their 30s and unvaccinated. The north-east of England has seen a surge in cases with eight out of the current top 10 hotspots in the UK. Almost all the cases nationally involve the Delta variant which first started surging in the north-west of England and Glasgow, so its spread through the North East is unsurprising. The demographics in urban areas are similar, with health inequalities and social deprivation and underlying health conditions leaving some patients vulnerable. The number of hospital patients with Covid is above where it was in early April, a trend already seen in the north-west of England. Services are being stretched because of high demand and staff needing to isolate. Health leaders in South Tyneside and Sunderland have made an appeal to the public to stick carefully to social distancing guidelines, to wear face masks in all health settings and to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Visits to adult wards have been suspended at three sites. On Teesside there has been a plea to people to act with caution,and to continue with face coverings when recommendedeven after legal restrictions in England are lifted on 19 July. Andy Preston, the elected mayor of Middlesbrough, told the BBC: ""We are putting a message out in Middlesbrough that rates are ballooning. This thing is spreading like wildfire across the whole region. ""We are not saying to panic, we are not saying for people to be terrified. We are saying to people just be really careful. ""This is now about schools, it's about businesses, it's about jobs and it's about mental wellbeing. People are getting pinged on apps left right and centre. They are being frightened, confused, don't know what to do."" This video can not be played Sandra Forsyth says she regretted not getting vaccinated when she contracted Covid Local resident Sandra Forsyth told us that she regretted not getting vaccinated when she contracted Covid: ""It's a nightmare. Out of breath. Just awful. I was hospitalised for a day and we've had the ambulance out to me as well because it's all on the chest."" She said she would get a jab as soon as possible and she urged others who hadn't done so to think again. Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? At the University Hospital of North Tees, they are continuing to provide normal cancer services and non-urgent care. But Chris Tulloch, deputy medical director of North Tees and Hartlepool Foundation Trust, says with case numbers predicted to continue rising into August, the situation could become more challenging. ""We are coping, but I would say we are just coping. And if things get more serious I think it will be more difficult to deal with, and we may have to make difficult decisions about what we are treating. Chris Tulloch says a further deterioration will make things very difficult ""We did have to stop our elective surgery programme last year because we needed the staff from theatre, who have the expertise in ventilation and looking after the critically ill, to look after patients with Covid."" Hospital staff say they understand the desire of people to regain some of the freedoms lost during lockdown, but they are worried about the implications if all social distancing is immediately abandoned. Dr Monaghan says the NHS will cope but the behaviour of local communities from 19 July will determine how serious the challenge will be. ""We are praying that the public do maintain some sense of perspective on this - somewhere between everybody being locked down and getting what they want."" Mask wearing urged as borough's Covid cases double Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire?

"The singer had previously expressed a preference to select her own legal team Britney Spears has told a US court she wants to charge her father Jamie for his alleged ""conservatorship abuse"". ""I'm here to press charges. I'm angry and I will go there,"" the singer said over a lawyer's phone on Wednesday. Her emotional statement came as a Los Angeles judge ruled Spears can choose her own lawyer in her fight to end the controversial legal arrangement. A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Conservatorship abuse can involve financially exploiting or imposing excessive personal restrictions on someone in your care. If a court rules that abuse has taken place, the appointed conservator could be removed/suspended and may face financial penalties such as reimbursement payments and legal costs. Following the ruling, the singer posted an Instagram video of herself doing cartwheels in celebration with a caption thanking her fans and adding ""#FreeBritney"". It is the first time she has used the hashtag, which has been used by her supporters to campaign against the conservatorship she has been subject to since 2008. This week's hearing saw Spears address a court for the second time in less than a month. In court last month, she made a dramatic plea to demanded that her father be removed from the legal agreement that has controlled her affairs for years. ""You're allowing my dad to ruin my life,"" she reiterated on Wednesday. ""I have to get rid of my dad and charge him with conservatorship abuse."" The conservatorship was put in place in 2008, when concerns over Spears' mental health prompted her father to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life. Explainer: Britney Spears' conservatorship case Spears' supporters rallied outside the court, and also gathered on the other side of the country in central Washington DC as the hearing was being held. Last month a judge denied the pop star's request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship. Judge Brenda Penny said she could not make a ruling until the singer files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement. Wednesday's court ruling paves the way for Spears' lawyer of choice, former federal prosecutor Mathew Rosengart, to take charge of the complex legal battle. He will replace Samuel Ingham, the court-appointed lawyer who had been representing Spears since 2008 beforestepping down last week. During the hearing, Mr Ingham interrupted the court to say Spears was texting him. The singer wanted to address the court again, he said. The judge officially accepted Mr Ingham's resignation before inviting Spears to speak. Mr Rosengart, the high-powered Hollywood lawyer who has previously represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, was also in court. A tearful Spears told the court that under the conservatorship, her hair vitamins and coffee had been confiscated. ""Ma'am, that's not abuse, that's just [expletive] cruelty,"" she told Judge Penny. ""Excuse my language, but it's the truth."" The singer said her top priority was removing her father from his role in the legal arrangement that governs her personal and financial affairs. She said she did not wish to submit to a ""stupid"" medical assessment and would be ""happy"" for co-conservator Jodi Montgomery to remain. Spears continued: ""I just want you to understand how much of my time they have taken by forcing me to do these psyche tests and nothing comes of it."" She said she has ""extreme abandonment issues"" because of her father. The singer also told the court she was ""extremely scared of my dad"", who is a recovering alcoholic, and feared he was always going to ""show up drunk somewhere and embarrass me"". Jamie Spears is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter' $60m (Â£43m) estate. This video can not be played What we can all learn from Britney Spearsâ case But his lawyers have previously denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life. The singer, a mother of two, said at last month's hearing that she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to do so. She claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed, to make sure that she didn't get pregnant. While her father has overseen her estate for 13 years, his legal team say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health. He was replaced on a temporary basis by Ms Montgomery, the co-conservator and care-giver of the singer. His lawyers have requested an inquiry to establish the accuracy of his daughter's testimony. The lawyers said the father was ""concerned "" about his daughter's well-being. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Ed Sheeran is currently the most-streamed artist in the UK, with his comeback single Bad Habits The music industry is weighted against artists, with even successful pop stars seeing ""pitiful returns"" from streaming, a committee of MPs has said. They are calling for a ""complete reset"" of the market, with musicians given a ""fair share"" of the Â£736.5 million that UK record labels earn from streaming. In a report, they said royalties should be split 50/50, instead of the current rate, where artists receive about 16%. The findings came after a six-month inquiry into music streaming. ""While streaming has brought significant profits to the recorded music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out,"" said Julian Knight, MP, who chairs parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee. ""Only a complete reset of streaming that enshrines in law their rights to a fair share of the earnings will do."" The findings will be seen as a victory by pop stars like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Melanie C, Wolf Alice and Jessie Ware, whorecently called on the Prime Ministerto reform the way musicians get paid when their songs are streamed. Musician Tom Gray, whose #BrokenRecord campaign prompted the inquiry, said he was ""overjoyed"" by the findings. ""It feels like a massive vindication,"" he said. ""They've really come to the same conclusions that we've been saying for a very long time."" The BPI, which represents the UK recorded music industry, was more cautious. It said streaming was ""enabling more artists than ever"" to earn a ""long-term, sustainable income"" and that new policies should be properly examined to ensure against ""unintended consequences for investment into new talent"". At present, Spotify is believed to pay between Â£0.002 and Â£0.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about Â£0.0059. YouTube pays the least - about Â£0.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream. All that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. That money is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record. Often, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest. Artists who release their own music, or who work with independent labels and distribution companies, tend to get a higher share. A survey by the Ivors Academy and Musicians' Union found that in 2019, 82% of professional musicians made less than Â£200 from streaming, whilst only 7% made more than Â£1,000. This video can not be played Nile Rodgers says that streaming numbers are meaningless when it comes to getting paid The hearings were full of testy exchanges. Some witnesses said they were scared to speak out for fear of reprisals; and the head of one record label was described as ""living in cloud cuckoo land"" after he claimed artists were happy with the music streaming model. Mercury Prize nominee Nadine Shah made headlines after telling the committee she had been forced to move back in with her parents because ""earnings from my streaming are not significant enough to keep the wolf away from the door"". Pop songwriter Fiona Bevan revealed she'd earned just Â£100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number one album, Disco. ""Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,"" she told MPs. ""It's quite shameful."" Chic's Nile Rodgers said that the finances of streaming are shrouded in secrecy, adding: ""We don't even know what a stream is worth and there's no way you could even find out what a stream is worth, and that's not a good relationship."" 'Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers' Streaming 'is threatening the future of music' Stones and Jones call for streaming reforms The three major labels - Sony, Universal and Warner Music - faced some of the toughest questioning of the inquiry, and were accused of a ""lack of clarity"" by MPs. They largely argued to maintain the status quo, saying any disruption could damage investment in new music, and resisted the idea that streaming was comparable to radio - where artists receive a 50/50 royalty split. ""Streaming is 24-7 in every country in the world, you can listen to the greatest record store ever - it's clearly a sale, it's not radio, it's on-demand,"" said David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK. Representatives from the streaming companies suggested they were ""open-minded"" about changing the royalty system, but noted that 70% of their income already goes to labels, publishers and artists. ""It is a narrow-margin business, so it wouldn't actually take that much to upset the so-called apple cart,"" said Apple Music's Elena Segal. Streaming now accounts for 80% of music consumption in the UK The committee's report said streaming had ""undoubtedly helped save the music industry"" after decades of piracy, ""but it is clear that what has been saved does not work for everyone"". They recommended that the government pass legislation to give performers the right to ""equitable remuneration"", whereby labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties. The report called it a ""simple yet effective solution"", as the right already exists in UK law when songs are played on radio and TV. MPs also raised ""deep concerns"" about the dominance of the major music companies, and urged the government to refer the case to the Competition and Markets Authority. Other recommendations included: Musicians and songwriters should be allowed to reclaim the rights to their work from labels after a set period of time. Artists should be given the right to adjust their contract if their work is successful beyond the remuneration they received. The government should explore ways to ensure songwriters, who receive minimal streaming royalties, can have sustainable careers. Curators who make playlists on services like Spotify and Apple Music should adhere to a ""code of conduct"" to avoid bribes and favouritism. The government should require publishers and royalty societies to inform artists about how much money is flowing through the system. Warner and Universal Music should follow Sony's example, andcancel their artists' historical debts. The committee also expressed concerns that ""the economics of streaming entrench historically successful artists and create barriers for new performers"", with perennial hits by Abba, Queen and Fleetwood Mac starving up-and-coming musicians of opportunities. Figures released yesterday showed thatnew music accounted for just 33% of the music streamed,externalin the US this year, with older songs dominating people's listening choices. The streaming services themselves largely escaped criticism, but MPs said YouTube's dominance was a cause for concern - citing figures that it accounts for 51% of music streaming while contributing 7% of music industry revenue. They warned that users' ability to upload music to YouTube without licensing it from record labels gave it an ""unfair advantage""; and urged the government to introduce ""legally enforceable obligations to normalise licensing arrangements"" on sites that host user-generated videos, such as YouTube, TikTok and Facebook. Kate Bush was one of more than 230 artists who wrote to the Prime Minister asking for reforms Tom Gray said the report confirmed what his#BrokenRecordcampaign had been telling record labels all along: ""That their business model needs to change and that they need to face the reality of that and get on with it"". He said he hoped the government would enact the recommendations quickly, potentially by acting on a private member's bill by Labour MP Kevin Brennan that seeks to change copyright laws around streaming. ""This is something that they can do for the British cultural sector, where they don't have to go and negotiate with Brussels,"" he told the BBC. ""If they want to help British creators, inventors and performers, this is something they can just do."" TheAssociation of Independent Music(AIM) welcomed the report's praise for independent record labels, who traditionally pay higher royalty rates to their artists. ""However, our view is that equitable remuneration will not deliver the outcome they are hoping for,"" said CEO Paul Pacifico. ""It is a 20th Century solution not fit for the 21st Century digital market and will leave the next generation of artists worse off."" TheBPIargued that streaming worked in artists' favour - with 2,000 artists set to achieve 10 million streams this year, the equivalent of selling 10,000 CDs, or making about Â£29,000. It warned unpicking the current system could damage investment in new music. ""When considering this report, the Government also needs to consider the vital role that labels play as the leading investors into artists' careers, with investment in artists by record labels growing year-on-year,"" said CEO Geoff Taylor. ""We will carefully examine the findings of this report, but it is essential that any policy proposals avoid unintended consequences for investment into new talent, and do not imperil this country's extraordinary global success in music."" Meanwhile, theMusicians Unioncalled the report ""revolutionary"". ""It grasps the issue, identifies the problems and recommends achievable and practical solutions, which won't cost the taxpayer a penny,"" said general secretary Horace Trubridge. In a joint statement, theFeatured Artists CoalitionandMusic Managers Forumsaid the ""landmark"" report could ""fundamentally improve"" the economic situation for thousands of musicians. ""This is a once in a lifetime moment to reset our business along fairer and more equitable lines, it is not an opportunity to be wasted.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Levelling up is not a jam-spreading exercise"" Boris Johnson has set out the ""skeleton"" of a plan to ""level up"" the country, by spreading power and opportunity more evenly. In a speech in Coventry, the PM insisted his flagship policy will not make the ""rich parts"" of the UK poorer but would be a ""win win"" for everyone. He also pledged to hand more power to local leaders, with the possibility of elected mayors for counties. Labour described Mr Johnson's speech as ""gibberish nonsense"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner dismissed the PM's promises as a ""PR exercise"", adding that Mr Johnson ""does not do detail, he does soundbites"". ""It is all jam tomorrow and a load of baloney. What he pretends and what he says he is going to do, is not what happens in reality."" PM must level up the North at pace, say Tory MPs By-election loss a warning shot - Tory co-chairman Levelling up must be more targeted, say peers What is levelling up and how is it going? In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to ""rewrite the rulebook"" on local devolution and offer county areas in England ""new deals"" to give them the same powers as those currently given to major cities. And he promised a flexible approach to those deals, including the option for directly elected mayors, but said there was no ""one-size-fits-all"" template. This video can not be played The prime minister âpromises jam tomorrowâ but fails to deliver says the Labour leader. The former London mayor urged local leaders with ideas for how to improve their communities to come forward, promising to give them ""the tools to make things happen for their communities"".. He said he did not want to see the return of what he called ""loony-left"" councils, but added: ""We will deal with anybody."" The Conservatives first promised to ""level up"" the country in their manifesto for the 2019 general election, in which they targeted - and won - so-called ""red wall"" parliamentary seats in the Midlands and northern England previously dominated by Labour. The plan, some of which has already been outlined, involves investing in transport, skills and businesses to address regional disparities. The government is expected to publish more details in September. Asked what his clear strategy was for ""levelling up"", he said: ""I am respectfully going to urge you to just go back over some of what I said because I do think that in all fairness there was at least the skeleton of what to do."" Boris Johnson again tried to explain the purpose of the ""levelling up"" agenda and talked about the UK's huge regional imbalances, entrenched inequalities and squandered opportunities. In well-trailed remarks he also said that the aim of getting more government spending and private investment into poorer parts of the UK would not come at the detriment of London and the south east - an attempt to reassure traditional Tory voters who might be feeling left out themselves. In terms of policy prescription the speech was fairly thin. A White Paper is promised in the autumn and today Mr Johnson clattered through a list of things - from tackling crime, building football pitches, laying railway lines - that he seemed to say all fell under the umbrella of levelling up. But he also proposed greater regional devolution and suggested county leaders could get new powers. He said if anyone could think of a better title than county mayors they should email him, which rather summed up the speech. In his speech, the prime minister said the government will have ""made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people's sense of pride in their community"". Investing in more deprived areas will relieve pressure on parts of the UK that are ""over-heating"" and that previous governments focused too much on ""areas where house prices are already high and where transport is already congested"", he added. But he insisted that there will not be ""levelling down"" in prosperous places, adding: ""We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies. ""We don't think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer."" He said that ""levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation. It's not robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's not zero-sum. It's win-win"". The PM's speech was welcomed by county councils. County Councils Network spokesman Martin Hill said: ""Local areas should be able to decide the most appropriate devolution arrangements for counties"". He added: ""We are pleased that this looks firmly on the table.""

"Furloughed worker Lisa Harding from Coningsby, Lincolnshire, says she is being ""unfairly penalised"" Some of Britain's biggest high street banks are refusing to give mortgages to self-employed people who received government grants during the pandemic. Mortgage brokers say those working in sectors like entertainment, hospitality and travel are the worst affected. Many lenders spoken to by the BBC are not accepting mortgage applications from people on furlough. Brokers said that banks often see people who have received Covid-related grants as high risk. ""I almost feel like I am being treated like a bankrupt, in some way, that I am being penalised for something that wasn't my fault,"" said hospitality worker Lisa Harding. Ms Harding, 49, is a first time buyer with a 10% deposit. She said she is unable to get a mortgage because she was previously furloughed from her job in the hospitality industry. She has now returned to her permanent, full-time job, but has still been turned down by lenders. ""I feel unfairly penalised. Furlough has been brilliant in that it has protected my job. But I didn't expect to come out of the other side - with a deposit, no debt, a perfect credit rating, all of the things that should make me an ideal first time buyer - only to find out that banks just will not lend to me at all,"" Ms Harding told the BBC. Banks must help as furlough unwinds, says report Planned job cuts at lowest level since 2015 Two of the UK's biggest high street lenders, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland, are refusing mortgage applications from people who took the government's self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) grant. ""As it stands we aren't accepting applications from customers who have applied for a SEISS grant on or after 14 July 2020,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""As a responsible lender this is part of the bank's affordability criteria,"" they said. Yorkshire Building Society and TSB said they would need to see evidence of the businesses having recovered from the pandemic, such as a good turnover. Lenders traditionally look at the last two years of accounts to work out how much was earned. This means the Covid pandemic could still be impacting self-employed peoples' mortgage applications until 2023. Self-employed people are also being asked to stump up larger deposits. Metro Bank, for example, said any customers who have taken out an SEISS grant will need a deposit of 20% or more. At Santander a deposit of 25% is the minimum for those who are self-employed. Most of the lenders the BBC contacted, including Lloyds, Yorkshire Building Society, TSB and Virgin Money, said they will not accept mortgage applications from people currently on furlough. They also do not include furloughed income as part of their affordability assessment. Andrew Montlake, a broker at Coreco, said those working in hospitality, tourism and events will face these challenges for ""some time"" and that lenders need to be more ""proactive."" ""We are calling on lenders to look at how businesses were performing before the pandemic, as a more likely guide for how they will perform afterwards."" Some of these policies go against assurances from the Financial Conduct Authority, the banking watchdog. An FCA spokesperson said the SEISS grant or support of this kind ""should not, of themselves, prevent people from being able to access credit."" ""Lenders are required to treat customers fairly when they apply for a mortgage,"" the spokesperson added. There are concerns that millions of people who took advantage of the Covid support schemes did not fully understood the long-term impact. Freelance theatre designer Daniel Ellis was also shocked to find he was not eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out an SEISS grant. The 28-year-old has been saving to buy his first home with his wife Emily in Derby. The couple's prospective monthly mortgage payments would be a third less than what they are currently paying each month in rent. But his bank, NatWest, told him he wasn't eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out the grant when theatres were forced to close. ""The mortgage system needs to change to reflect evidence of successful recurring rent payments, and we also feel it's wrong that the self-employed are scrutinised more than the employed,"" Mr Ellis explained. The couple say they have, with difficulty, managed to secure a mortgage in principle with another lender. Consumer groups, including Fairer Finance, are now calling on the financial regulator to urgently investigate which lenders are penalising borrowers in this way and to take action. According to data from the Office for National Statistics, there are currently just over five million self-employed workers in the UK. Almost 60% of self-employed borrowers said they felt penalised by lenders because they worked for themselves when applying for a mortgage, according to a survey carried out by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-employed (IPSE). More than two-thirds of freelancers (70%) who had got a mortgage said some lenders would not consider them at all because they are self-employed. UK Finance, which represents the industry, said lenders must carry out a thorough income check to ensure mortgages are affordable in the long term. ""Each lender will consider a range of factors such as the type of borrower, their employment status, income history, the sector they work in and the type of property they are looking to purchase when deciding how much to lend,"" a UK Finance spokesperson said. The Treasury told the BBC that its Â£350bn financial package had supported jobs and livelihoods throughout this crisis.

"Insurers could replace written-off or stolen petrol cars with electric vehicles as part of a wide-ranging plan to improve sustainability. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said the plans could ""herald a new approach"" to the many thousands of claims settled each year. Damaged gas boilers could also be replaced with more sustainable models. Consumers would also be encouraged to accept recycled parts as part of a roadmap to tackle climate change. Members of the ABI settled 2.6 million motor insurance claims last year, and 737,000 property claims. The sector has been widely criticised for its approach on pricing, particularlyrising premiums for loyal customers. However, it believes it can have a significant impact on improving transport emissions and other environmental issues. On Wednesday, the governmentunveiled its own green transport policy, although it was ridiculed by environmentalists. The ABI'sClimate Change Roadmap,externalis a plan to get insurers moving towards a net-zero target. It reflects the huge range of sectors in which insurers operate. It includes educating pension savers about their choices of investment, and the resulting environmental impact. However. the most eye-catching aspect of the plan is the proposal that insurers should consider replacing written-off or stolen petrol cars with electric vehicles. Road transport is one of the heaviest polluting areas of society. Insurers are also hoping to encourage the development of a sustainable secondary market for electric vehicles, and work on consistent policies for re-using and recycling charging equipment. PM needs our help to meet climate test - mayors EU unveils sweeping climate change plan Customers may also be encouraged to accept repaired or recycled items as part of a settlement for damaged or stolen property, rather than brand new items. They will also investigate how items damaged during a flood or storm could be sent for re-use or repair. Huw Evans, director general of the ABI, said: ""We all know the environmental crisis is the greatest threat facing our planet and all sectors need to challenge themselves like never before. ""We accept that our sector's emission are amongst the most of any industry in the economy but, conversely, this means we are uniquely placed to drive the transition including through huge investment potential in the green economy and our reach to millions of customers.""

"Flu and other winter viruses will make a comeback in autumn, but vaccines should help A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, warns a report by leading medics. They say testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly. The Academy of Medical Sciences report,externalcalls for people with any symptoms to isolate and stay at home. This will help protect against all respiratory viruses this winter. The report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter. During lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up. Already this summer, there has beena rise in winter viruses in children coming to A&E. Report author Prof Azra Ghani, from Imperial College London, says their modelling suggests a summer peak of Covid-19 infections ""with subsequent local outbreaks over winter"". But ""we can't completely rule out another winter wave"", she said. ""Whilst we expect the peak in deaths to be considerably lower than last winter, under some scenarios we could see hospital admissions rise to similar levels."" Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Where will I have to carry on wearing a mask? In a worst-case scenario this could mean around twice the levels of flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a normal autumn and winter, the report says. There are between 10,000 and 30,000 deaths from flu in a normal winter, and about 20,000 children under five are admitted to hospital each year with RSV, which can cause a lung infection called bronchiolitis. The authors say these viruses often produce similar symptoms, so testing for all three at once would help distinguish between them. This could be done through Test and Trace or in GP practices, but the turnaround would need to be very fast so that anti-virals could be used to treat flu in the most vulnerable. Dr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said the ""triple tests"" had ""great appeal"", but the logistics could be a challenge. ""Whether there will be enough instruments and testing capacity available for this to be available widely in primary care remains to be seen,"" he said. The report also recommends booster Covid vaccines alongside flu vaccines this autumn to reduce the spread of the virus,which is already being planned by the NHS for the over-50s,and improving infection control in hospitals. It says all adults need to be vaccinated against Covid by September. Currently, two-thirds of UK adults have received two doses and 87% have had one dose. But the number one way to reduce transmission is for people to have a test when they have symptoms and stay at home if they are ill, says Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences. ""We are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the financial and practical support that will allow all people to self-isolate if they need to, whatever their circumstances,"" she said. The medics also emphasise the importance of face coverings, social distancing and meeting friends outdoors - to protect against Covid as well as other respiratory viruses, as society opens up.

"Louis Rees-Zammit came within inches of a potentially match-winning try after slipping Faf de Klerk's tackle South Africa A v British and Irish Lions South Africa A (17) 17 Try:Nkosi, AnCon:M Steyn 2Pen:Steyn British and Irish Lions (3) 13 TryW JonesCon:FarrellPen:Farrell 2 A Test-strength South Africa A inflicted the 2021 British and Irish Lions' first defeat to serve up a sobering reminder of what awaits when the series starts later this month. Tries from Sbu Nkosi and Lukhanyo Am gave the hosts a 14-point lead after a powerful first-half display. The Lions made inroads when Wyn Jones scored with South Africa A down to 13 men after two yellow cards. But South Africa A regained control and ran down the clock to see out the win. Louis Rees-Zammit came closest to snatching victory from the hosts, but the Wales wing could not quite stretch enough to dot down after stepping inside scrum-half Faf de Klerk. The Lions will take heart, however, from their improvement in the second half. The series winner may be the side who can find their feet fastest, with the Springboks having played only one match in the last 18 months and Covid potentially causing more disruption before the first Test on 24 July. Players 'bullish' for Test series - what did we learn from Test dress rehearsal? Adams misses match to attend child's birth - by video link Eben Etzebeth's chargedown triggered the counter from which South Africa A scored their first try South Africa's side was an A team in name alone, with 18 Rugby World Cup winners in a squad. After three comfortable wins over Springbok-less provincial sides in which they have scored an average of more than 60 points, the step up in physicality, intensity and class was immediately evident for the Lions Inside the first minute, second row Eben Etzebeth crashed into a huge tackle on Liam Williams. Inside the first four minutes, South Africa's furious attack of the breakdown turned over possession three times. And, there was no let-up in the air either as scrum-half De Klerk's pinpoint kicking probed space and piled pressure on the tourists' back three. The hosts' trademark blitz defence was as suffocating as ever despite South Africa having only played one Test since their World Cup final win in Yokohama in November 2019. It delivered the first try when the looming Etzebeth charged down a kick from Owen Farrell - in as a late replacement because of Dan Biggar's minor ankle sprain - and Sbu Nkosi scampered upfield to score. Reaction as 2021 Lions lose for the first time Skipper Jones completes remarkable return to Test contention The second came from Kolbe, who adds a sparkle of stardust to South Africa's grit. The winger's dancing feet took him ghosting through the slimmest of holes outside Chris Harris before feeding inside for Lukhanyo Am to trot in. The Lions scrum stood up well to their counterparts at the set-piece and the tourists enjoyed 65% possession before the break, but could not make an impression on the scoreline during a 10-minute period of pressure, heading down the tunnel 17-3 adrift. De Klerk saw yellow for a headlong charge into Josh Navidi South Africa A's defence was hugely committed but not as disciplined. De Klerk and flanker Marco van Staden both finished the first half in the sin-bin for infringements on their own whitewash in the final minutes of the first half. It felt as the tourists had to make use of the two-man power play if they were to get back in the contest and prop Wyn Jones duly rumbled over from close range inside three minutes of the restart. When Farrell landed a penalty, the gap was down to four points. The Lions seemed to have acclimatised and adapted, getting to the edge of the defence and deploying more men into the breakdown. Rees-Zammit was mere inches away as he squirmed and stretched for the corner, but South Africa showed resolve and street smarts to stunt the Lions' growing dominance. The timely return of tour captain Alun Wyn Jones aftera remarkable 18-day recovery from a partially dislocated shoulderwill boost the Lions' belief and quality. The tour continues with a meeting with the Stormers on Saturday. BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones:A first defeat for the Lions on tour, and plenty for Warren Gatland to ponder. Individually there have been some strong performances - Wyn Jones, Tom Curry, Maro Itoje, Chris Harris and Anthony Watson among those to excel - but big questions remain about the Lions' best combinations and their best tactics. But above all, the physicality and intensity from the South Africans suggests that this Lions tour, for all its many setbacks and obstacles and lack of fans, may still be able to throw up a compelling Test series.

"Furloughed worker Lisa Harding from Coningsby, Lincolnshire, says she is being ""unfairly penalised"" Some of Britain's biggest high street banks are refusing to give mortgages to self-employed people who received government grants during the pandemic. Mortgage brokers say those working in sectors like entertainment, hospitality and travel are the worst affected. Many lenders spoken to by the BBC are not accepting mortgage applications from people on furlough. Brokers said that banks often see people who have received Covid-related grants as high risk. ""I almost feel like I am being treated like a bankrupt, in some way, that I am being penalised for something that wasn't my fault,"" said hospitality worker Lisa Harding. Ms Harding, 49, is a first time buyer with a 10% deposit. She said she is unable to get a mortgage because she was previously furloughed from her job in the hospitality industry. She has now returned to her permanent, full-time job, but has still been turned down by lenders. ""I feel unfairly penalised. Furlough has been brilliant in that it has protected my job. But I didn't expect to come out of the other side - with a deposit, no debt, a perfect credit rating, all of the things that should make me an ideal first time buyer - only to find out that banks just will not lend to me at all,"" Ms Harding told the BBC. Banks must help as furlough unwinds, says report Planned job cuts at lowest level since 2015 Two of the UK's biggest high street lenders, NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland, are refusing mortgage applications from people who took the government's self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) grant. ""As it stands we aren't accepting applications from customers who have applied for a SEISS grant on or after 14 July 2020,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""As a responsible lender this is part of the bank's affordability criteria,"" they said. Yorkshire Building Society and TSB said they would need to see evidence of the businesses having recovered from the pandemic, such as a good turnover. Lenders traditionally look at the last two years of accounts to work out how much was earned. This means the Covid pandemic could still be impacting self-employed peoples' mortgage applications until 2023. Self-employed people are also being asked to stump up larger deposits. Metro Bank, for example, said any customers who have taken out an SEISS grant will need a deposit of 20% or more. At Santander a deposit of 25% is the minimum for those who are self-employed. Most of the lenders the BBC contacted, including Lloyds, Yorkshire Building Society, TSB and Virgin Money, said they will not accept mortgage applications from people currently on furlough. They also do not include furloughed income as part of their affordability assessment. Andrew Montlake, a broker at Coreco, said those working in hospitality, tourism and events will face these challenges for ""some time"" and that lenders need to be more ""proactive."" ""We are calling on lenders to look at how businesses were performing before the pandemic, as a more likely guide for how they will perform afterwards."" Some of these policies go against assurances from the Financial Conduct Authority, the banking watchdog. An FCA spokesperson said the SEISS grant or support of this kind ""should not, of themselves, prevent people from being able to access credit."" ""Lenders are required to treat customers fairly when they apply for a mortgage,"" the spokesperson added. There are concerns that millions of people who took advantage of the Covid support schemes did not fully understood the long-term impact. Freelance theatre designer Daniel Ellis was also shocked to find he was not eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out an SEISS grant. The 28-year-old has been saving to buy his first home with his wife Emily in Derby. The couple's prospective monthly mortgage payments would be a third less than what they are currently paying each month in rent. But his bank, NatWest, told him he wasn't eligible for a mortgage because he'd taken out the grant when theatres were forced to close. ""The mortgage system needs to change to reflect evidence of successful recurring rent payments, and we also feel it's wrong that the self-employed are scrutinised more than the employed,"" Mr Ellis explained. The couple say they have, with difficulty, managed to secure a mortgage in principle with another lender. Consumer groups, including Fairer Finance, are now calling on the financial regulator to urgently investigate which lenders are penalising borrowers in this way and to take action. According to data from the Office for National Statistics, there are currently just over five million self-employed workers in the UK. Almost 60% of self-employed borrowers said they felt penalised by lenders because they worked for themselves when applying for a mortgage, according to a survey carried out by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-employed (IPSE). More than two-thirds of freelancers (70%) who had got a mortgage said some lenders would not consider them at all because they are self-employed. UK Finance, which represents the industry, said lenders must carry out a thorough income check to ensure mortgages are affordable in the long term. ""Each lender will consider a range of factors such as the type of borrower, their employment status, income history, the sector they work in and the type of property they are looking to purchase when deciding how much to lend,"" a UK Finance spokesperson said. The Treasury told the BBC that its Â£350bn financial package had supported jobs and livelihoods throughout this crisis.

"Renewable energy, like wind power, is gradually replacing coal in many EU countries The European Union has announced a raft of climate change proposals aimed at pushing it towards its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. A dozen draft proposals, which still need to be approved by the bloc's 27 member states and the EU parliament, were announced on Wednesday. They include plans to tax jet fuel and effectively ban the sale of petrol and diesel powered cars within 20 years. The proposals, however, could face years of negotiations. The plans triggered serious infighting at the European Commission, the bloc's administrative arm, as the final tweaks were being made, sources told the AFP news agency. ""By acting now we can do things another way... and choose a better, healthier and more prosperous way for the future,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday. ""It is our generational task... [to secure] the wellbeing of not only our generation, but of our children and grandchildren. Europe is ready to lead the way."" The measures are likely to push up household heating bills, as well as increase the cost of flights in the EU. Financial assistance will be available for people to install insulation and make other long-term changes to their homes. ""We're going to ask a lot of our citizens,"" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said. ""We're also going to ask a lot of our industries, but we do it for good cause. We do it to give humanity a fighting chance."" Opposition is also expected from some industry leaders, such as airlines and vehicle manufacturers, as well as from eastern member states that rely heavily on coal. One EU diplomat told Reuters that the success of the package would rest on its ability to be realistic and socially fair, while also not destabilising the economy. ""The aim is to put the economy on a new level, not to stop it,"" they said. ANALYSIS: Have countries kept their climate change promises? UN climate change goal now 'within reach' Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 The measures, billed as the EU's most ambitious plan yet to tackle climate change, have been named the Fit for 55 package because they would put the bloc on track to meet its 2030 goal of reducing emissions by 55% from 1990 levels. By 2019, the EU had cut its emissions by 24% from 1990 levels. Some of the key proposals include: Tighter emission limits for cars, which are expected to effectively end new petrol and diesel vehicle sales by 2035 A tax on aviation fuel, and a 10-year tax holiday for low-carbon alternatives A so-called carbon border tariff, which would require manufacturers from outside the EU to pay more for importing materials like steel and concrete More ambitious targets for expanding renewable energy around the bloc A requirement for countries to more quickly renovate buildings that are not deemed energy efficient But corporate lobby BusinessEurope denounced the plan, saying it ""risks destabilising the investment outlook"" for sectors such as steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers and electric power ""enormously"". And Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said: ""Aviation is committed to decarbonisation as a global industry. We don't need persuading, or punitive measures like taxes to motivate change."" At the same time, environmentalist campaigners have said the proposals don't go far enough. ""Celebrating these policies is like a high-jumper claiming a medal for running under the bar,"" Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss said in a statement. ""This whole package is based on a target that is too low, doesn't stand up to science, and won't stop the destruction of our planet's life-support systems."" Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said that unless the EU ""tears up"" its proposals, ""the world will not stand a chance of staying below 1.5C of global heating"". This video can not be played What is climate change? In Septemberthe EU Commission set out its blueprint for reaching the 55% reduction,externalby 2030, and said at least 30% of the EU's â¬1.8tn (Â£1.64tn; $2.2tn) long-term budget would be spent on climate-related measures. The targets are part of a global effort to tackle climate change by cutting atmospheric pollution, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Paris climate deal, signed in 2016, aims to keep global temperature rise well under 2C, and preferably within a maximum rise of 1.5C, to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The scale of this 12-pronged plan is breathtaking. It will likely have an impact on every citizen of Europe in almost every aspect of their lives. The scope is so huge because the target is so tough. From 1990 to 2019 the EU cut carbon emissions by 24% - now it proposes to slash CO2 by another 31% in just 9 years. That's what's needed if the 2050 net-zero target is to be achieved. So as well as boosting renewables, the EU is now set to tackle the really tough issues of home heating and transport. The proposals would see the end to new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Europe's emissions trading scheme will also be reformed to include heating and road transportation. Fossil fuels used in shipping and aviation will face tax rises. One of the most eye-catching proposals is a carbon border tax on goods like steel, cement and fertiliser to ensure that European industry, which has to pay for permits to use carbon, can compete. However, the proposal is contentious and could spark a trade war with China and the US. The ambitious package will now face months of negotiations with member states, with poorer countries wary of new policies that could raise costs for consumers. The commission is betting that instead of hordes of yellow-vest protesters taking to the streets, citizens will be willing to pay a price for cleaner air, lower emissions, and more sustainable lifestyles. The rest of the world will watch this huge gamble with interest. How bad is Nato's climate change problem?

After three comfortable wins over Springbok-less provincial sides in which they have scored an average of more than 60 points, the step up in physicality, intensity and class was immediately evident for the Lions Inside the first minute, second row Eben Etzebeth crashed into a huge tackle on Liam Williams. Inside the first four minutes, South Africa's furious attack of the breakdown turned over possession three times. And, there was no let-up in the air either as scrum-half De Klerk's pinpoint kicking probed space and piled pressure on the tourists' back three. The hosts' trademark blitz defence was as suffocating as ever despite South Africa having only played one Test since their World Cup final win in Yokohama in November 2019. It delivered the first try when the looming Etzebeth charged down a kick from Owen Farrell - in as a late replacement because of Dan Biggar's minor ankle sprain - and Sbu Nkosi scampered upfield to score. Reaction as 2021 Lions lose for the first time Skipper Jones completes remarkable return to Test contention The second came from Kolbe, who adds a sparkle of stardust to South Africa's grit. The winger's dancing feet took him ghosting through the slimmest of holes outside Chris Harris before feeding inside for Lukhanyo Am to trot in. The Lions scrum stood up well to their counterparts at the set-piece and the tourists enjoyed 65% possession before the break, but could not make an impression on the scoreline during a 10-minute period of pressure, heading down the tunnel 17-3 adrift. De Klerk saw yellow for a headlong charge into Josh Navidi South Africa A's defence was hugely committed but not as disciplined. De Klerk and flanker Marco van Staden both finished the first half in the sin-bin for infringements on their own whitewash in the final minutes of the first half. It felt as the tourists had to make use of the two-man power play if they were to get back in the contest and prop Wyn Jones duly rumbled over from close range inside three minutes of the restart. When Farrell landed a penalty, the gap was down to four points. The Lions seemed to have acclimatised and adapted, getting to the edge of the defence and deploying more men into the breakdown. Rees-Zammit was mere inches away as he squirmed and stretched for the corner, but South Africa showed resolve and street smarts to stunt the Lions' growing dominance. The timely return of tour captain Alun Wyn Jones aftera remarkable 18-day recovery from a partially dislocated shoulderwill boost the Lions' belief and quality. The tour continues with a meeting with the Stormers on Saturday. BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones:A first defeat for the Lions on tour, and plenty for Warren Gatland to ponder. Individually there have been some strong performances - Wyn Jones, Tom Curry, Maro Itoje, Chris Harris and Anthony Watson among those to excel - but big questions remain about the Lions' best combinations and their best tactics. But above all, the physicality and intensity from the South Africans suggests that this Lions tour, for all its many setbacks and obstacles and lack of fans, may still be able to throw up a compelling Test series. Itoje carried 12 times more than any other Lions player and was a constant nuisance on the other side of the ball, disrupting Faf de Klerk British and Irish Lions:Williams; Rees-Zammit, Harris, Aki, A Watson; Farrell, Murray (capt); Jones, Owens, Sinckler, Itoje, Henderson, Navidi, Curry, Faletau.

"The singer had previously expressed a preference to select her own legal team Britney Spears has told a US court she wants to charge her father Jamie for his alleged ""conservatorship abuse"". ""I'm here to press charges. I'm angry and I will go there,"" the singer said over a lawyer's phone on Wednesday. Her emotional statement came as a Los Angeles judge ruled Spears can choose her own lawyer in her fight to end the controversial legal arrangement. A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Conservatorship abuse can involve financially exploiting or imposing excessive personal restrictions on someone in your care. If a court rules that abuse has taken place, the appointed conservator could be removed/suspended and may face financial penalties such as reimbursement payments and legal costs. Following the ruling, the singer posted an Instagram video of herself doing cartwheels in celebration with a caption thanking her fans and adding ""#FreeBritney"". It is the first time she has used the hashtag, which has been used by her supporters to campaign against the conservatorship she has been subject to since 2008. This week's hearing saw Spears address a court for the second time in less than a month. In court last month, she made a dramatic plea to demanded that her father be removed from the legal agreement that has controlled her affairs for years. ""You're allowing my dad to ruin my life,"" she reiterated on Wednesday. ""I have to get rid of my dad and charge him with conservatorship abuse."" The conservatorship was put in place in 2008, when concerns over Spears' mental health prompted her father to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life. Explainer: Britney Spears' conservatorship case Spears' supporters rallied outside the court, and also gathered on the other side of the country in central Washington DC as the hearing was being held. Last month a judge denied the pop star's request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship. Judge Brenda Penny said she could not make a ruling until the singer files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement. Wednesday's court ruling paves the way for Spears' lawyer of choice, former federal prosecutor Mathew Rosengart, to take charge of the complex legal battle. He will replace Samuel Ingham, the court-appointed lawyer who had been representing Spears since 2008 beforestepping down last week. During the hearing, Mr Ingham interrupted the court to say Spears was texting him. The singer wanted to address the court again, he said. The judge officially accepted Mr Ingham's resignation before inviting Spears to speak. Mr Rosengart, the high-powered Hollywood lawyer who has previously represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, was also in court. A tearful Spears told the court that under the conservatorship, her hair vitamins and coffee had been confiscated. ""Ma'am, that's not abuse, that's just [expletive] cruelty,"" she told Judge Penny. ""Excuse my language, but it's the truth."" The singer said her top priority was removing her father from his role in the legal arrangement that governs her personal and financial affairs. She said she did not wish to submit to a ""stupid"" medical assessment and would be ""happy"" for co-conservator Jodi Montgomery to remain. Spears continued: ""I just want you to understand how much of my time they have taken by forcing me to do these psyche tests and nothing comes of it."" She said she has ""extreme abandonment issues"" because of her father. The singer also told the court she was ""extremely scared of my dad"", who is a recovering alcoholic, and feared he was always going to ""show up drunk somewhere and embarrass me"". Jamie Spears is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter' $60m (Â£43m) estate. This video can not be played What we can all learn from Britney Spearsâ case But his lawyers have previously denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life. The singer, a mother of two, said at last month's hearing that she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to do so. She claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed, to make sure that she didn't get pregnant. While her father has overseen her estate for 13 years, his legal team say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health. He was replaced on a temporary basis by Ms Montgomery, the co-conservator and care-giver of the singer. His lawyers have requested an inquiry to establish the accuracy of his daughter's testimony. The lawyers said the father was ""concerned "" about his daughter's well-being. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Covid: What are the latest rules to be relaxed? Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August. The Welsh government said all laws on the number of people who can meet will end but First Minister Mark Drakeford warned against ""a free for all."" Nightclubs would be able to reopen, but face masks will still be required in most indoor public places except in pubs, restaurants andschools. Some rules will change on Saturday, meaning six people can to meet in private homes and holiday homes. Despite the plan to ease many rules, people will be asked to continue working from home wherever possible. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Fans could return in Wales for new season Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca moved to amber list Meanwhile, specific social distancing in workplace laws are expected to end from 7 August, with businesses left to decide if they still need to keep customers and workers apart through risk assessments. Mr Drakeford warned the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and was ""spreading quickly"", with ""real dangers"" that could not be ignored. He told a press conference: ""This is not a free-for-all."" Face masks will still be required in shops in Wales after 7 August ""There will continue to be some important protections to help keep us all safe, especially those who are clinically vulnerable and who are perhaps the most anxious about an easing of restrictions."" The Welsh plan to move to its current lowest level of Covid restrictions - known as alert level 0 - on Saturday, 7 August, depends on the country's public health situation. It means there will be more rules in Wales than in England. Mr Drakeford said while he was ""reasonably confident"" vaccinations had weakened the link between infections and serious illness, with the number of Covid patients in hospital relatively low, there was still ""a risk that this third wave of the pandemic could cause real harm"". Although the case rate is rising Wales, the country has the lowest infection rate of the UK nations and has one of the world's highest vaccination rates. Wales will move into the alert level one set of restrictions on Saturday - allowing for six people to meet in private homes and holiday accommodation. Ice rinks will be able to reopen, and the limits on numbers that can meet in public places or at events outdoors will be removed. Outdoor indoor events can take place for up to 1,000 seated and up to 200 standing from the same day. Fully vaccinated people will also no longer need to self-isolate if they are returning from an amber list country from Monday, following decisions taken in England and Scotland. But people returning from an amber list country will need to have a PCR test on day two of their arrival - and cannot visit a hospital or care home within 10 days of returning from abroad. Mr Drakeford criticised the UK government for having originally introduced the move, only putting it in place in Wales because it would have been ""untenable"" not to. ""The risk of re-importation of coronavirus from other parts of the world, and especially further new variants, has not gone away,"" he said. ""The removal of a defence against that risk, and especially at a time when the virus is in such rapid circulation, is hard to understand."" Under plans for alert level zero, ministers have proposed: No legal limits on the number of people who can meet others All businesses and premises will be able to reopen Face masks will be required in shops, on public transport and when accessing health care, but not in hospitality or education Pubs will no longer be obliged to provide table service The face mask rules will remain in place despite the UK government's decision to scrap them in England. Ministers are also planning, during August, to allow people who are fully vaccinated not to self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who has tested positive. While the specific laws requiring social distancing in workplaces and hospitality are expected to go, the issue will be left for organisations to work out. Specific social distancing laws are expected to be scrapped outdoors this Saturday, and indoors on 7 August. The Welsh government's coronavirus control plan states it will be for organisations to assess the risks, ""depending on the nature of the premises and the risks of exposure"". Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""Whilst we regret the Welsh Labour government has been the last government in Britain to publish a plan, it is a case of better late than never, and the lifting of restrictions will ensure we can get our economy and public services on the road to recovery."" Rhun ap Iorwerth, deputy leader of Plaid Cymru in the Senedd, added: ""The important thing is that Welsh government doesn't follow the ill-judged timetable being set by UK Government in lifting all restrictions during a period of increasing cases."" Wales moving to 'increasing normality' on Covid Should I still wear a mask after 19 July? Some firms to insist people still wear face masks According to the control plan, moving to 7 August will be ""subject to no new variants of concern being identified in Wales, hospital admissions and deaths from Covid-19 remaining at relatively low and manageable levels and if the vaccination programme continues as expected"". Hospital admissions have risen in the past month but remain significantly lower than earlier in the pandemic. Covid rates in Wales stood at 145.3 per 100,000 people on Wednesday, compared to 138.2 the day before. There are 69 patients with confirmed cases of Covid in hospital, compared to 39 a week before. That number is at its highest since mid-April. ""The balance of harm is changing,"" says the Welsh government's new Coronavirus control plan, meaning the harms of restrictions are beginning to outweigh the harms of Covid. Nevertheless, the tone remains laden with caution and an emphasis on collective, as well as personal responsibility. While Mark Drakeford has rejected the idea of a ""spurious freedom day"", he has also acknowledged that all the home nations are heading broadly in the same direction. But the first minister continues to stress the differences - keeping the requirement for face masks in most indoor settings and obligations on employers to undertake Covid risk assessments. Throughout the pandemic, ministers in Cardiff Bay have been convinced that voters want to see a cautious approach and even as we head into what everyone hopes might be the end game, that continues to be the note they want to strike. Restaurant boss Georgina Heffernan said customers may feel ""vulnerable"" if all social distancing measures were eased at once ""It feels like a long time coming,"" said Georgina Heffernan, from Cardiff restaurant The Potted Pig which had to halve its capacity to comply with social distancing. However, she said some customers may feel ""vulnerable"" if all social distancing measures were eased at once. ""We're lucky as a business that we can still implement certain social distancing standards,"" she said. ""I think for us that will stay. ""Obviously, we do want more customers but we also want the customers we do have to feel as safe as possible. ""We do not want to alienate customers who do still feel vulnerable and that don't want to come out into a really busy setting,"" she said. ""It has been a struggle. It has been hard on us as a business,"" she said ""A lot of people don't see what goes on behind the scenes. ""We have gone above and beyond to try and deal with the pandemic and live the pandemic."" Industry body UK Hospitality Cymru said lifting restrictions in August was ""brilliant"", but warned a more cautious approach in Wales at the height of the holiday season could lead to ""difficulties for customers and staff alike"". Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium warned that caution on returning to offices would likely ""further push back the recovery for city centres and high streets where footfall remains over a quarter lower than pre-pandemic levels"". ""Ministers needs to be prepared to consider how best to support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to take longer than anticipated,"" she said. CBI Wales called for the Welsh Government ""to provide clear and consistent guidance on safety proposals as soon as possible to give firms time to plan ahead"". The Federation of Small Businesses said that from 7 August, ""almost all businesses in Wales will be able to trade at capacity due to the easing of social distancing requirements"".

"John Lewis and Waitrose are planning to cut 1,000 jobs as part of a shake-up of store management. The move follows the closure of eight John Lewis shops earlier this year, which put almost 1,500 jobs at risk. John Lewis, which owns Waitrose and the department store chain, is trying to cut costs as shopping habits change and more people shop online. It said it would help affected staff find new roles and wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies. The proposed job cuts ""will allow us to reinvest in what matters most to our customers"", a John Lewis Partnership spokesperson said. It will invest in customer service roles and ""visual merchandising to make our shops look their best to entice customers"", the retailer said. The cuts, which work out at nearly three management roles per store, will ""reduce the number of layers between our most senior leaders and non-management"" shop floor staff, it added. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated a trend towards people shopping online instead of in stores. Last year the retailer said it would close eight stores with the loss of 1,300 jobs, and put in place a plan to adapt to the boom in online shopping. It then announced a further eight department store closures this year, after the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. Earlier this month, the partnership announced plans tobuild 10,000 rental homes over the next few yearsto give it a stable long-term income. At the moment, it has 34 John Lewis shops and 331 Waitrose stores and across the UK. Its 80,000 staff are also partners in the business and usually get a share of the profits. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that for John Lewis, ""pivoting quickly to keep up with the accelerated shift in shopping habits brought on by the pandemic has been far from easy"". Last year was the first time since 1953 that the company did not pay a bonus, ""highlighting the once-in-a-generation challenge the partnership is facing"", she said. The firm is spending Â£1bn over five years to speed up the move to online sales. ""To do that, it needs to make significant cost savings elsewhere,"" Ms Streeter said. ""Closing underperforming stores and reducing headcount is an inevitable consequence as chair Dame Sharon White tries to steer the ship towards the online shopping future."" She added: ""It's becoming increasingly clear that John Lewis faces a future with a much smaller retail footprint.

"Wales stands to lose out financially from HS2 because it is currently classed as an England and Wales project A cross-party group of MPs has called for HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project so Wales receives proportional funds. They said the UK government's own analysis concluded the rail project would produce ""an economic dis-benefit to Wales"". The Welsh government called the classification of HS2 as an England and Wales project ""unfair and biased"". The UK government said it had committed Â£1.5bn to Welsh railways. HS2 is a high-speed rail line planned to link London with Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds. The multi-billion pound project, which could seecosts rise to Â£106bn, has been controversial after estimates that theWelsh economy could lose out due to inferior transport infrastructure. The MPs want HS2 to be reclassified as an England-only project despite rail infrastructure not being devolved in Wales beyond the core valleys lines. The Welsh government receives a proportional top-up to the budget when new spending is announced for devolved areas in England which will not apply to Wales, through what is known as ""Barnett consequentials"". Why is getting a train into England so expensive? Transport for Wales to get extra Â£70m help 'The best days of my working life' Cash for new rail - but will Wales get on track? The report says while the Welsh government received ""approximately Â£755m in Barnett consequentials"" between 2015 and 2019 as a result of the Department for Transport spending money on HS2, it will not receive a proportionate amount because it has been classified by the Treasury as an ""England and Wales project"". This has attracted criticism from the MPs because the rail line will run solely in England. The Welsh Affairs Committee said: ""It is a project of unprecedented size and complexity and has already created several thousand jobs as part of a supply chain that spans the country, including Wales."" But it said Wales would ""not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials arising from the HS2 project. This is despite the fact that UK government's own analysis has concluded that HS2 will produce an economic dis-benefit for Wales"". Trains would reach speeds of up to 250mph between London and Birmingham and beyond It said HS2 could ""yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancements to the North Wales mainline, including upgrades at Chester and Crewe stations which will be required for full electrification of the North Wales mainline to proceed"". The report also calls for a new Wales Rail Board of Welsh and UK government bodies to identify areas where Welsh railways could be improved and invested in. The MPs also have called on the UK government to bring forward proposals for greater connectivity between Swansea, Cardiff and Bristol by the end of 2021, calling the decision to cancel the electrification of the Cardiff-Swansea mainline ""short-sighted and regrettable"". The group, chaired by Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, said if clear benefits for passengers and freight users could be delivered by transferring powers over rail infrastructure from the UK government to the Welsh government then ""the case for further devolution would be compelling"". But they said ""few benefits to rail users have been identified"" and the benefits of ""existing management arrangements are considerable"". The Welsh government welcomed the calls to ""address unfair and biased categorisation of HS2 as an England and Wales project, which continues to disadvantage rail investment in Wales"". The Welsh government said it was ""unfair and biased"" for HS2 to be considered an England and Wales project A spokesman said their ""long term objective remains full devolution of the rail network and a fair funding settlement for rail infrastructure in Wales"". But they said ""irrespective of where responsibility rests in the short term"" they supported ""close strategic collaboration"" to ""meet passenger needs"" and ""support our decarbonisation commitments"". A spokesperson for the UK government's Department for Transport said: ""We have already committed  a record Â£1.5bn to the Welsh railways in recent years and the recently announced Union Connectivity Review will look at how best to enhance transport links across the United Kingdom to improve connectivity.""

"Local residents in Soweto have been volunteering to clear up looted shops Long queues have formed outside shops and petrol stations in South Africa's port city of Durban following days of unrest sparked by the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma. Firefighters are cleaning up the mess, helped by local residents wielding brooms. Rioters looted and destroyed shops, leading to severe shortages of basics. Some petrol stations have limited the amount motorists can buy, as fuel transportation has been disrupted. Local media are also reporting queues in Johannesburg. Meanwhile, Northern Cape and Mpumalanga have become the latest provinces to be hit by violence. The BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Durban says the city's business owners are slowly returning to their shops to evaluate the damage following days of unrest. Empty shoe boxes, broken dishes, rotting food and debris litter virtually every street in this normally bustling city centre, she says. Zuma, 79, was convicted of contempt of court last month after failing to attend an inquiry into corruption during his presidency. He handed himself in to police last Wednesday to start serving his 15-month prison sentence, but this sparked violent protests, arson attacks, and opportunistic looting in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. The protests spread to other towns and cities, including Johannesburg. President Cyril Ramaphosa has described it as some of the worst violence South Africa has witnessed since the 1990s, before the end of apartheid. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent WATCH: Why has the violence broken out? Looting and shooting in South Africa 'war zone' From freedom fighter to president to jail The authorities said at least 72 people have died, 10 of whom were killed in a stampede during looting at a shopping centre in Soweto. The deployment of soldiers to support the police did not seem to deter looters. The BBC filmed a baby being thrown from the first floor of a a building in Durban that was on fire after ground-floor shops were looted. This video can not be played A mother in Durban is forced to throw her baby from a building after it was set on fire South African police said in a statement on Tuesday that it had identified 12 people suspected of provoking the riots, and that a total of 1,234 people had been arrested.

It said it had made the decision ""due to safety concerns of its staff and damages to their vehicles on the roads"".

"This video can not be played Government proposals on the legacy of the past will ""draw a line under the Troubles"" - PM The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly. Some victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals. However, Mr Lewis said it was ""the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation"". In his Commons statement, he outlined a ""statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents"". It is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries. A statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. The plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. The government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts. This video can not be played ""A painful recognition of where we are"" - NI Secretary Brandon Lewis Mr Lewis said: ""We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly. ""But we have arrived at the view that this would be the best way to facilitate an effective information retrieval and provision process, and the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation. ""It is a painful recognition of the reality of where we are."" Political reaction to PM's Troubles prosecutions plan Mr Lewis said that the proposals also include a body to help families recover information on Troubles incidents and an oral history initiative. ""Ongoing litigation processes often fail to deliver for families and victims, and their continued presence in a society which is trying to heal from the wounds of its past risks preventing it being able to move forward,"" he said. In terms of ""drawing a line"", this is incredibly far-reaching. It goes beyond a ban on Troubles-era prosecutions, of which there have been just nine in the past six years. Ending legacy inquests and civil actions is arguably of greater impact when you consider the figures. Currently, there around 36 inquests relating to the Troubles due to be heard. Many of these relate to killings by the Army and police. Alongside this, there are more than 1,000 civil claims lodged against the Ministry of Defence and other state agencies. The government is proposing all this is closed down in a new approach which is sweeping in scope. However, the opposition is loud. The Irish government says it is not a fait accompli or a done deal. But with a big majority at Westminster, the government has set off in a direction of travel which few predict will be reversed. Northern Ireland's five main political parties, the Irish government and several victims' groups have been highly critical of any suggested blanket ban on prosecutions for Troubles-era offences. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said a meeting of the Stormont Party Leaders Forum is expected to take place with Mr Lewis on Friday. He said he hoped the parties would use it to express their joint opposition to the proposals. Earlier, the prime minister defended the government's plans as ""measured and balanced"". Boris Johnson told MPs: ""The sad fact remains that there are many members of the armed services who continue to face the threat of vexatious prosecutions well into their 70s and 80s. ""We are finally bringing forward a solution to this problem, to enable the people of Northern Ireland to draw a line under the Troubles and to enable the people of Northern Ireland to move forward."" A statute of limitations would end all prosecutions in Troubles-related cases Prior to the announcement, Northern Ireland's largest cross-community victims' group, Wave, said ""victims and survivors should not be treated this way"". It added that if Mr Lewis ""is serious about effectively dealing with legacy he must talk to those most impacted by pain and trauma"". Reports that the secretary of state was to announce a plan to end Troubles prosecutions also angered relatives of the1974 Birmingham pub bombings. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, was among 21 people killed in the IRA bomb attacks, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to protest against the reported proposal. ""At what point did your government lose all sight of its moral, ethical and judicial backbone?â¯,"" Ms Hambleton's letter asks. Two IRA bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town in Birmingham in November 1974 John Teggart, whose father Danny was one of the victims of the Ballymurphy shootings in 1971, said the proposals were a ""slap in the face"" for victims. ""It dances on the graves of all our loved ones and all those who affected in the conflict,"" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra. Serena Hamilton, whose father Cpl David Graham was an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier killed by the IRA in Coalisland, County Tyrone, in 1977, said she was ""absolutely disgusted"". ""How can you move forward when you haven't got justice in the first place for such heinous crimes that happened to the likes of my father?,"" she asked on Evening Extra. Lord Dannatt, a former Army chief, who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said the proposals represented the ""least worst option"" and offered families a way to get answers about what happened. ""There is now a mechanism where questions can be asked, facts can be ascertained and they will be able to get some degree of closure in knowing what happened because the people answering those questions, whether they're paramilitaries or retired soldiers, will be able to answer those questions truthfully and honestly without the fear of being prosecuted and dragged through the courts."" Amnesty International rejected the proposals as showing an ""appalling and offensive disregard for victims"". Its Northern Ireland campaign manager, Grainne Teggart, said: ""Many victims are having their worst fears realised in these proposals, the government is closing down paths to justice."" Ian Simpson, from the Northern Ireland Veterans' Association, said ""today is a shameful day"". He continued: ""Today, the veterans and innocent victims have been betrayed to the uttermost by Boris Johnson and the British government. ""People who held the line in Northern Ireland, who gave us peace in Northern Ireland, have been put on a pedestal with terrorists, people who went out on a daily basis to murder and to maim."" The government statement followed significant recent developments in a number of high-profile Troubles prosecution cases. In May,two former paratroopers were acquitted of the 1972 murder of Official IRA man Joe McCann after their trial collapseddue to the inadmissibility of prosecution evidence. Joe McCann was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972 Both soldiers had been interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case. But the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible and as the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) did not appeal against that decision, the case could not proceed. Then, earlier this month, the McCann murder trial collapse had implications for two other high-profile cases - the Bloody Sunday trial and the prosecution for the murder of 15-year-old Daniel Hegarty. What happened on Bloody Sunday? Why did prosecutors drop cases against ex-soldiers? The PPS met the families of Daniel Hegarty and two men killed on Bloody Sunday to explain that given ""related evidential features"" to the McCann case, prosecutors no longer believed there was a reasonable prospect that key evidence against the soldiers accused of their loved one's murders would be ruled admissible. The Bloody Sunday case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but instead it was adjourned following a legal challenge by a brother of one of the men shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

"Wales' first minister has set out his Covid plan for the summer, with fewer legal restrictions Wales will move fully into alert level one from 17 July, meaning up to six people can meet indoors in private homes and holiday accommodation Organised indoor events will be able to take place for up to 1,000 seated and 200 standing, plus ice rinks can reopen The Welsh government is also publishing plans for an alert level zero which would mean all premises can reopen and most - but not all - restrictions will be removed If the public health situation allows, Wales will move to alert level zero on 7 August Under alert level zero there will be no legal limit on the number of people who can meet others, but face masks will still be required in shops, on public transport and when accessing health care Rhiannon Beacham, Rachel Flint and Carys Betteley Thank you for following our live coverage as major changes to Covid restrictions in Wales were announced. Today we learnt that from 7 August, subject to variants and case rates, many restrictions, including social distancing laws will have been scrapped. However some measures look set to remain for months, with people in Wales having to continue to wear face masks after 7 August, apart from in pubs and restaurants. So what is happening and when? From Saturday, 17 July  From 7 August (if conditions allow) Social distancing will be one of many measures a business can take to keep customers and staff safe, the first minister told the press conference. Mark Drakeford said workplaces would still be required to carry out a risk assessment as measures ease in August. He said this would include a requirement to take ""reasonable measures"" to help keep staff and customers safe from Covid. Since April 2020 businesses, such as shops,have had to do everything they can to keep staff and customers two metres apart under law. Mr Drakeford added: ""Up until now, social distancing has been a slightly separate standalone requirement ""From now on, it will be one of the measures which a business can take. ""So it will not have disappeared from the repertoire of measures here in Wales, but it'll be navigated alongside all the other things which a business can choose to do."" It will be up to nightclubs and festival organisers to decide if people need to show proof they have had their vaccine to enter, the first minister has told a press conference. UK ministers have advised nightclubs and other event organisers in England, opening from 19 July, to ask for proof that revellers have had two jabs or tested negative for Covid. However, Mark Drakeford told the briefing it was not a matter for governments to encourage businesses to require so-called ""vaccine passports"" for entry. It comes as Wales prepares to head into Alert Level Zero - the lowest level of restrictions - from 7 August, with nightclubs then allowed to reopen. Mr Drakeford said if firms ""do decide to require a certificate, then citizens will be able to receive such a certificate here in Wales"". People in Wales have been able to access their Covid-19 vaccination status online since 25 June for essential travel abroad. Paper vaccine certificates have also been available since May, with documents posted to those requesting them. Businesses have welcomed ""a level of optimism"" in the Welsh government's announcement on easing restrictions. Ben Francis, of FSB Wales, said it was ""helpful"" to have clarification on the way forward. ""With todayâs announcement, there is a clearer picture and timetable for businesses which is something we have been requesting of the government. ""Businesses running outdoor events and festivals will very much welcome the lifting of the cap in numbers from this Saturday, allowing them to plan for and benefit from activities into the summer. ""Similarly, the opportunity to have greater flexibility for indoor events is very welcome."" Mr Francis added the easing of social distancing requirements from 7 August will also help businesses who have not been able to fully operate because of restrictions. ""This will be reassuring for many businesses facing a number of pressures including starting to pay back debt, the reduction in support for the furlough scheme and the winding down of Welsh governmentâs own coronavirus business support,"" he said. A retail trade union is calling on customers to follow the rules on continuing to wear face masks in shops. Usdaw is asking retailers to promote face coverings, hand hygiene and social distancing in their stores and asks shoppers to adhere to the law. Regional secretary Nick Ireland said: âUsdaw called for customers to continue to be required to wear face coverings in shops, so we very much welcome the Welsh governmentâs decision today. ""Wearing a face covering in a shop is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with the public as a part of their job. âMany retail workers are at a greater risk of catching the virus and bringing it home to their families, while working throughout the pandemic to keep the country fed. ""These key workers deserve to be valued, respected and protected.â âThe balance of harm is changingâ says the Welsh governmentâs new coronavirus control plan, meaning the harms of restrictions are beginning to outweigh the harms of Covid. Nevertheless, the tone remains laden with caution and an emphasis on collective, as well as personal responsibility. While Mark Drakeford has rejected the idea of a âspurious freedom dayâ he has also acknowledged that all the home nations are heading broadly in the same direction. But the first minister continues to stress the differences â keeping the requirement for face masks in most indoor settings and obligations on employers to undertake Covid risk assessments. Throughout the pandemic, ministers in Cardiff Bay have been convinced that voters want to see a cautious approach and even as we head into what everyone hopes might be the end game, that continues to be the note they want to strike. First Minister Mark Drakeford is about to give a press briefing on the Covid rules relaxations, which will see the easing of social distancing in Wales. You can watch coverage livehere.  People in Wales will still be advised to continue working from home, even when Wales enters alert level zero. The Welsh government has said it is clear working from home is key to minimise transmission rates, and will allow for more freedoms in other areas. When people do have to go into work, ""employers must continue to carry out a specific coronavirus risk assessment
and take all reasonable measures to minimise the risk of exposure to
coronavirus"". The Welsh government has also said it will explore whether giving employees a right work from home could be ""enshrined in reserved employment law"". Advice against non-essential international travel must be ""urgently reviewed"", a trade association has said. A spokesman for ABTA said:
âIt is good that self-isolation restrictions will ease on 19 July for fully vaccinated individuals returning to Wales from amber list countries, however the first minister must urgently review the continuing advice against ânon-essentialâ international travel for vaccinated travellers. ""While this advice remains, confidence to travel from Wales will remain low and further financial support must be given to travel agents and tour operators, who continue to face the toughest trading conditions of all sectors.â Responding to the announcements, Macmillan's Richard Pugh said people with cancer may be feeling anxious but welcomed the cautious approach from the Welsh government. ""While many people in Wales will welcome these new freedoms, many people with cancer may be feeling anxious and uncertain about these changes. âMacmillan welcomes the cautious approach taken by Welsh government which will help to reassure people. âIt's vital that people with cancer, who are clinically extremely vulnerable, are communicated with clearly by Welsh government and supported when restrictions ease."" Welsh clubs could be allowed to hostcapacity crowds for the start of the new football season, the Welsh government has announced. Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - will be scrapped from 7 August if coronavirus rates allow. The English Football League season resumes on that weekend. The Welsh government allowed for crowds of up to 10,000 to return to sporting stadiums from 7 June, but those restrictions could be further eased in August. Cardiff City say the announcement from the Welsh government means they will be able to welcome 8,000 supporters for pre-season friendlies with Southampton on 27 July and Newport County on 31 July. The Bluebirds say ""further updates will follow in the coming days in respect of permitted attendance numbers for competitive EFL fixtures"". The news of restrictions potentially being lifted would also mean the possibility of full houses for Wales' autumn international rugby matches against New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Fiji in October and November.  While Wales is set to move into alert level zero from 7 August, the wearing of face masks will remain law in most places. People will still have to wear them on public transport in Wales, as well as in ""most indoor public spaces"", the first minister said. But the Welsh government added that people will not legally have to wear them in hospitality settings. Meanwhile in England, people will no longer be required to wear the coverings by law in most places, as restrictions end next week.  There are worries over ""confusion"" within the hospitality industry and staffing, UKHospitality Cymru has said. The body, which represents the sector, welcomed the latest Welsh government lockdown easing but said its businesses were ""deeply concerned"" that holidaymakers may not understand differences between the rules in Wales and elsewhere. âWe already
have a severe staffing shortage, so our
employees are very hard pressed while trying to cope with additional labour for servicing the
remaining table service and other restrictions, not to mention additional
demands due to self-isolations. âMany of
our staff are young and so
ineligible for the double jab
exemption from 10-day self-isolation announced by
the first minister today."" As restrictions ease the Welsh government has said it hopes to end self-isolation rules for those who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Currently anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive has to self-isolate. However, official guidance now says the government hopes to eventually remove this requirement for those who have been double-jabbed. If you have symptoms of coronavirus or if you test positive, you will need to
self-isolate whether you have been fully vaccinated or not. ""We will discuss with partners putting additional safeguards
in place for people who work in health and social care settings,"" the new guidance says. ""We are also
having further discussions with stakeholders on the requirements for children
and young people who are contacts to self-isolate."" Current rules will apply until any announcement is made, after the next review at the start of August. Winston Evans is ""delighted"" Winston
Evans, owner of Dolphin Spotting Boat Trips in New Quay, says he is ""absolutely
delighted"" with the Welsh government's announcement. Ending social distancing means his company can now carry about 50 passengers - more than four times what was allowed under previous
rules He says revenue has been down by 60% this year. Under plans to enter the lowest level of restrictions in Wales - planned for 7 August -  businesses will have to decide how to keep people safe. While social distancing laws are planned to end, businesses will still have to undertake a risk assessment. In the Welsh government's revised guidance it says that under alert level zero, ""reasonable measures to be taken"" will be down to each organisation to decide. This will ""depend on the
nature of the premises and the risks of exposure to coronavirus identified"". One restaurant boss said some customers may feel ""vulnerable"" if all social distancing  measures were eased at once. Georgina Heffernan, from Cardiff restaurant The Potted Pig, said it was likely to keep some measures in place in the venue which has almost halved its capacity due to social distancing rules. ""Obviously we do want more customers, but we also want the customers we do have to feel as safe as possible,"" she said. ""We do not want to alienate customers who do still feel vulnerable and that don't want to come out into a really busy setting."" For Plaid Cymru, Rhun ap Iorwerth said he ageed with the Welsh goverment's ""cautious"" approach and was pleased that face coverings were still to be used in shops, public transport and health settings. He said face coverings should not be a matter of ""public choice"" as their ""primary purpose is to protect those around us"". ""To be led by our own individual choices is rather a selfish way to go about things in a collective pandemic,"" he said. Impact on the NHS is still driving decisions, Mark Drakeford says Responding to the Conservatives' call for greater speed in relaxing measures,
Mark Drakeford said the impact of Covid on the NHS was
""incredibly sensitive"" to both the effectiveness of vaccines and the
extent to which people continue to observe ""sensible actions"" during
the pandemic. He
said a ""shift of just two or three per cent"" in the effectiveness of
jabs was the ""difference between large numbers of people needing or not
needing hospitalisation"". ""If
people continue, as people in Wales have, to do their best to look after
themselves and others, that will suppress the number of people needing
hospitalisation,"" he said. ""If
people act as though coronavirus has gone away, and there's no risk to
themselves or others, that will drive more numbers into the hospital
sector. ""At
the better end of that spectrum"", he said, the impact on the NHS was
""manageable"". ""If
the dial gets set at the other end of that spectrum, then we will be back where
we were in the winter, with very large numbers of people needing to be cared
for in a hospital, with all the impact that that would make on the ability of
the NHS to go on doing all of those other things."" Conservative Senedd leader
Andrew RT Davies said he would have liked to have seen ""greater speed and
greater urgency in bringing some of these measures forward"". ""But I appreciate the
difficult decisions that the cabinet have had to take, based on the scientific
evidence that they've had before them,"" he told the first minister. Mr Davies sought clarity from
Mark Drakeford on issues including what the scientific modelling showed the
impact of rising Covid infection rates might have on the NHS over the summer. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.7739787e-13
"Five of England's metro mayors call for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after rules change on Monday Face coverings will stay compulsory in areas they have control over, like Manchester's trams and West Yorkshire bus stations They will also be compulsory on London's transport network after England's restrictions ease on 19 July Masks will no longer be a legal requirement in England from Monday but you have to wear them on transport in Scotland and Wales The Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca move onto the government's amber travel list It means from Monday, those not double-jabbed or under 18 have to quarantine on their return A further 42,302 Covid cases are reported across the UK and another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Two thirds of UK adults have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - will be scrapped from 7 August if coronavirus rates allow Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by George Bowden, Chris Clayton, Robert Greenall, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright and Claire Heald. Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Here's a recap of the day's main stories in the UK: Protests have taken place in Paris We're wrapping up our coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the biggest developments from around the world today: The government hasconfirmed nearly all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July. It means all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed. The legal requirement to wear face masks in some public spaces will be dropped, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and limits on how many people can meet will be ditched. Several countries around the world have already tried easing their coronavirus restrictions this year - with mixed results. So what has happened in places where rules have been relaxed? Read more here. Senegal is experiencing an
""unprecedented"" surge in Covid infections, the health
ministry has warned. The country hit a new daily record
of 733 cases on Wednesday. The previous record was 529 cases on Sunday. Senegal has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, but is struggling with its vaccine rollout. ""The situation is unprecedented. We have never seen such an
increase in cases,"" says health ministry spokesman Mamadou
Ndiaye. Measures must be taken urgently to reverse the trend ahead of Eid al-Adha - a Muslim holiday that will be celebrated next week - Ndiaye says. The holiday is the biggest in Senegal and is usually marked with large family gatherings. There are currently no
measures in place to restrict such events. French police have used tear
gas to disperse a protest against President Emmanuel Macron's
plan to require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR
test to gain entry to bars, restaurants and cinemas from August. Macron has announced new measures to combat a surge in infections. These included the
mandatory vaccination of health workers and new health pass
rules for the wider public. These rules have gone further than most of France's neighbours and some have accused the government of stamping on freedoms. Protesters marched through Paris, with some wearing badges saying ""no to the health pass"", before clashes started. The debate over face coverings is not confined to public transport. Under new advice from House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, masks are compulsory for parliamentary staff from next Monday - but will be optional for MPs as they are not employed by Parliament. Unions say the Speaker could stop those who don't wear a face covering from entering the Commons chamber. From 19 July, the legal requirement to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces in England will be removed. Instead, PM Boris Johnson has said the government ""expects and recommends"" that face coverings are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. Read morehere. Asked whether central government could change its mind on masks on public transport, Tracy Brabin says: ""It does feel to me as though there is going to be a shift."" As reasoning, she says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps showed support forSadiq Khan's decision to make masks mandatory on London's transport network. No-one would criticise the government if the the PM did change his mind, says Andy Burnham, adding: ""It would help everyone if there was a change of heart at the national level. ""None of us is saying this is going to be easy, we're all trying to act where we can."" The
Balearic Islands ofMajorca,IbizaandMenorcaare to move to the UK's amber travel list just three weeks after quarantine-free travel to the popular destinations was granted. Following a rise in local cases, the Spanish islands - which attract millions of UK visitors in a normal year - will move to the amber list from 04:00 BST on Monday 19 July. TheBritish Virgin Islandswill also move to the amber list at the same time. Meanwhile,BulgariaandHong Kongwill move to the green list, meaning no arrivals need to quarantine, andCroatiaandTaiwanmove to the
green watchlist, putting travellers on notice of potential future changes. Cuba,Indonesia,MyanmarandSierra Leonewill be moved to the red list, with arrivals required to carry out their quarantine in a government-run hotel at a cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The announcement applies to England, but the other UK nations are expected to follow suit. Separate changes to the travel list system mean that, from Monday and in England, Scotland and Wales, those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantining at home on their return from an amber country. Returning to the metro mayor's press conference, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is asked whether it is fair to ask transport staff to enforce mask-wearing when it is not a legal requirement. She says she doesn't want to put staff in a difficult position, and can't fine people who refuse. It is a matter of persuasion and encouragement, she says. Bus operators are going to be ""strongly encouraging"" passengers to wear masks on buses, she adds, but it will not be mandatory. Brabin goes on to say doesn't want to put staff in a vulnerable position and if people don't want to wear one, then ultimately they won't. Meanwhile, speaking in the House of Commons, in Westminster, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warns current Covid hospital admissions ""have increased to over 500 a day, up 50% in a week"", with waiting lists at their ""highest level seen on record, currently at 5.3 million"". During a debate on a new Health and Care Bill in England, he said the planned ""top down reorganisation"" is coming ""when we are not even through the pandemic"". He described the proposals as a ""Trojan horse to hide a power grab"" by ministers, with patients ""treated like ghosts in the machine"". Previously the government said the planned changes would mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Read more about themhere. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is asked what changed his mind about calling for masks on public transport, after initially suggesting he would not call for such a move. ""When we originally looked at it, I did say I thought this was going to be difficult to do but you do the job [well] if you're listening to people,"" he says. Burnham adds he has been ""inundated with messages"" from vulnerable people saying 19 July is ""fear day"" for them, not ""freedom day"". ""I've been hearing their voices loud and clear,"" he says He mentions the guidance for vulnerable people, which tells them to avoid those who have not been vaccinated, and questions what an unvaccinated person is supposed to look like? If things go on as they are, people will feel they can't go out ""and that's not right"", says Burnham. Liverpool mayor Steve Rotherham says, unlike Sadiq Khan, he does not have the power to make masks mandatory. However, he says he will be asking all transport operators in his constituency to enforce mask-wearing on their services. ""I'll be asking all of them... to do the right thing,"" he says. ""I don't think we can put a price on public safety."" Wearing face masks ""costs nothing"" and they are a ""minor inconvenience"", he adds. Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis and West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin say they will make masks mandatory at the bus stations within their control, but like Burnham and Rotherham, say they do not have the power to make them a requirement across all public transport. West of England Mayor Dan Norris says he has no power to make masks mandatory but he has written to the prime minister to complain about the ""ridiculous"" decision not to enforce mask wearing on public transport. He adds he is calling on people in the West of England to wear masks when they travel. Mayors across England have together called for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after the legal requirement for them ends on Monday. Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, West Yorkshire's Tracy Brabin, Liverpool City Region's Steve Rotheram, North of Tyne's Jamie Driscoll, Dan Jarvis in the Sheffield City Region and the West of England's Dan Norris are holding a joint press conference. Burnham says the people of Greater Manchester should ""work with us"" to protect each other and supporting members of the community who may be concerned by the end of mandatory mask rules. Masks will stay compulsory on Manchester's Metrolink tram services and at West Yorkshire bus stations, for example. They are places the metro mayors have powers over. It comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khandeclared masks mandatoryon the capital's public transport network even after 19 July, and West Midlands Mayor Andy Street said he isexpecting local passengers to wear them on all forms of transport.,external You can read more aboutwhich rules are changing on Monday here. The US State Department is ""surging"" staffing levels to address a backlog of as many as two million passport applications due to the pandemic. Americans have been left waiting between 12 and 18 weeks for new passports,
an official tells the Reuters news agency. Rachel Arndt, deputy assistant secretary for passport services in the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, says the availability of vaccinations in the US has led to many more than usual applying for
passports to travel overseas. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge. ""We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,"" she said. ""People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."" And now nurses are donning their high-grade PPE once more.

Covid, the UK is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world - but many
challenges still remain. The spread of the Delta variant and a sharp rise in cases as
restrictions are lifted means vaccinating as many people as possible before the
onset of autumn is now urgent. A third of adults, mostly people in their 20s and 30s, are not yet
fully protected. But there are other communities where uptake is low, for example
some ethnic minorities, particularly people from black backgrounds, those
living in some poorer areas and working in certain jobs, who have not yet been
jabbed. Convincing them to come forward and get a vaccine will help
increase the height of the wall of immunity which is going to help hold back
the tide of hospital admissions come the winter. Every adult in England has been offered at least one dose, but
only 87% have had one. That gives an indication of the scale of challenge
ahead. Even with one of the fastest vaccination programmes on the planet,

"John Lewis and Waitrose are planning to cut 1,000 jobs as part of a shake-up of store management. The move follows the closure of eight John Lewis shops earlier this year, which put almost 1,500 jobs at risk. John Lewis, which owns Waitrose and the department store chain, is trying to cut costs as shopping habits change and more people shop online. It said it would help affected staff find new roles and wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies. The proposed job cuts ""will allow us to reinvest in what matters most to our customers"", a John Lewis Partnership spokesperson said. It will invest in customer service roles and ""visual merchandising to make our shops look their best to entice customers"", the retailer said. The cuts, which work out at nearly three management roles per store, will ""reduce the number of layers between our most senior leaders and non-management"" shop floor staff, it added. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated a trend towards people shopping online instead of in stores. Last year the retailer said it would close eight stores with the loss of 1,300 jobs, and put in place a plan to adapt to the boom in online shopping. It then announced a further eight department store closures this year, after the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. Earlier this month, the partnership announced plans tobuild 10,000 rental homes over the next few yearsto give it a stable long-term income. At the moment, it has 34 John Lewis shops and 331 Waitrose stores and across the UK. Its 80,000 staff are also partners in the business and usually get a share of the profits. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that for John Lewis, ""pivoting quickly to keep up with the accelerated shift in shopping habits brought on by the pandemic has been far from easy"". Last year was the first time since 1953 that the company did not pay a bonus, ""highlighting the once-in-a-generation challenge the partnership is facing"", she said. The firm is spending Â£1bn over five years to speed up the move to online sales. ""To do that, it needs to make significant cost savings elsewhere,"" Ms Streeter said. ""Closing underperforming stores and reducing headcount is an inevitable consequence as chair Dame Sharon White tries to steer the ship towards the online shopping future."" She added: ""It's becoming increasingly clear that John Lewis faces a future with a much smaller retail footprint. ""By evolving to become part of campus-style developments [with housing], the partnership may help distressed city centres find new leases of life and bring fresh energy back into the retail ecosystem.""

"Five of England's metro mayors call for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after rules change on Monday Face coverings will stay compulsory in areas they have control over, like Manchester's trams and West Yorkshire bus stations They will also be compulsory on London's transport network after England's restrictions ease on 19 July Masks will no longer be a legal requirement in England from Monday but you have to wear them on transport in Scotland and Wales The Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca move onto the government's amber travel list It means from Monday, those not double-jabbed or under 18 have to quarantine on their return A further 42,302 Covid cases are reported across the UK and another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Two thirds of UK adults have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - will be scrapped from 7 August if coronavirus rates allow Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by George Bowden, Chris Clayton, Robert Greenall, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright and Claire Heald. Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Here's a recap of the day's main stories in the UK: Protests have taken place in Paris We're wrapping up our coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the biggest developments from around the world today: The government hasconfirmed nearly all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July. It means all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed. The legal requirement to wear face masks in some public spaces will be dropped, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and limits on how many people can meet will be ditched. Several countries around the world have already tried easing their coronavirus restrictions this year - with mixed results. So what has happened in places where rules have been relaxed? Read more here. Senegal is experiencing an
""unprecedented"" surge in Covid infections, the health
ministry has warned. The country hit a new daily record
of 733 cases on Wednesday. The previous record was 529 cases on Sunday. Senegal has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, but is struggling with its vaccine rollout. ""The situation is unprecedented. We have never seen such an
increase in cases,"" says health ministry spokesman Mamadou
Ndiaye. Measures must be taken urgently to reverse the trend ahead of Eid al-Adha - a Muslim holiday that will be celebrated next week - Ndiaye says. The holiday is the biggest in Senegal and is usually marked with large family gatherings. There are currently no
measures in place to restrict such events. French police have used tear
gas to disperse a protest against President Emmanuel Macron's
plan to require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR
test to gain entry to bars, restaurants and cinemas from August. Macron has announced new measures to combat a surge in infections. These included the
mandatory vaccination of health workers and new health pass
rules for the wider public. These rules have gone further than most of France's neighbours and some have accused the government of stamping on freedoms. Protesters marched through Paris, with some wearing badges saying ""no to the health pass"", before clashes started. The debate over face coverings is not confined to public transport. Under new advice from House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, masks are compulsory for parliamentary staff from next Monday - but will be optional for MPs as they are not employed by Parliament. Unions say the Speaker could stop those who don't wear a face covering from entering the Commons chamber. From 19 July, the legal requirement to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces in England will be removed. Instead, PM Boris Johnson has said the government ""expects and recommends"" that face coverings are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. Read morehere. Asked whether central government could change its mind on masks on public transport, Tracy Brabin says: ""It does feel to me as though there is going to be a shift."" As reasoning, she says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps showed support forSadiq Khan's decision to make masks mandatory on London's transport network. No-one would criticise the government if the the PM did change his mind, says Andy Burnham, adding: ""It would help everyone if there was a change of heart at the national level. ""None of us is saying this is going to be easy, we're all trying to act where we can."" The
Balearic Islands ofMajorca,IbizaandMenorcaare to move to the UK's amber travel list just three weeks after quarantine-free travel to the popular destinations was granted. Following a rise in local cases, the Spanish islands - which attract millions of UK visitors in a normal year - will move to the amber list from 04:00 BST on Monday 19 July. TheBritish Virgin Islandswill also move to the amber list at the same time. Meanwhile,BulgariaandHong Kongwill move to the green list, meaning no arrivals need to quarantine, andCroatiaandTaiwanmove to the
green watchlist, putting travellers on notice of potential future changes. Cuba,Indonesia,MyanmarandSierra Leonewill be moved to the red list, with arrivals required to carry out their quarantine in a government-run hotel at a cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The announcement applies to England, but the other UK nations are expected to follow suit. Separate changes to the travel list system mean that, from Monday and in England, Scotland and Wales, those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantining at home on their return from an amber country. Returning to the metro mayor's press conference, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is asked whether it is fair to ask transport staff to enforce mask-wearing when it is not a legal requirement.

"The North West of England recorded fastest rising house prices House prices have risen sharply across the UK, driven by an increase of more than 15% in the year to May in the North West of England. Official figures show property prices also rose at a rapid rate in Scotland, Wales and the North East of England. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average UK home cost Â£255,000 in May. That was Â£23,000 more than the typical value a year earlier. The 10% rise was the fastest rate for 14 years. Detached and terraced homes recorded the biggest price increases, data from the Land Registry in England and Wales show. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic House prices dip as stamp duty holiday ends Estate agents have reported huge demand from property buyers during the year so far. This picked up when many buyers wanted to complete their purchases before stamp duty holidays were wound down. In May, the tax breaks were still in place for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. However, that it not the only explanation for rising prices. Scotland's property tax break was withdrawn at the end of March. People's changing priorities as a result of the pandemic mean they are looking for bigger homes in which to live and work. A lack of homes being put on the market to match demand has also led to rising prices. A majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year for that reason. ""The market was being powered by ultra-low mortgage rates, valuable stamp duty savings and people rethinking what they want from their homes due to the pandemic,"" said Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance. ""Demand was as rampant as supply was weak, which sent prices skywards."" The ONS said that house prices in the UK rose by 10% in the year to May. The North West was the region with the highest annual house price growth, with average prices increasing by 15.2%. There were also big rises in Wales (up 13.3%), Scotland (up 12.1%) and the North East of England (up 11.8%). At the other end of the scale, London recorded the slowest property price rise over the year, of 5.2%. Ged McPartlin, managing director of Ascend Properties, said: ""It's clear that the north-south divide has never been wider. ""While this momentous rate of price growth must inevitably slow at some point, we expect this vast difference in property pedigree to remain as buyers in the north continue to benefit from a far more affordable market with, or without, the benefit of a stamp duty saving."" In Wales, terraced houses rose in price by 15.2% over the same period. That was the fastest rise of any property type, which was mirrored in England, where the value of terraced homes went up by 11.2%. This was closely followed by a 14% rise in the cost of detached homes in Wales, and an 11% increase in England. Properties with gardens have proved popular among buyers looking for space inside and outside homes.

That was the fastest rise of any property type, which was mirrored in England, where the value of terraced homes went up by 11.2%. This was closely followed by a 14% rise in the cost of detached homes in Wales, and an 11% increase in England. Properties with gardens have proved popular among buyers looking for space inside and outside homes.

"Dr Catherine Monaghan says she fears for the future ""We are planning for war and praying for peace."" Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge.

Covid: South Tyneside case rate now highest in England Why has the Delta variant spread so quickly in UK? The hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week. The average ages are lower than during the first two waves, and at least two of the seriously ill patients are in their 30s and unvaccinated. The north-east of England has seen a surge in cases with eight out of the current top 10 hotspots in the UK. Almost all the cases nationally involve the Delta variant which first started surging in the north-west of England and Glasgow, so its spread through the North East is unsurprising. The demographics in urban areas are similar, with health inequalities and social deprivation and underlying health conditions leaving some patients vulnerable. The number of hospital patients with Covid is above where it was in early April, a trend already seen in the north-west of England. Services are being stretched because of high demand and staff needing to isolate. Health leaders in South Tyneside and Sunderland have made an appeal to the public to stick carefully to social distancing guidelines, to wear face masks in all health settings and to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Visits to adult wards have been suspended at three sites. On Teesside there has been a plea to people to act with caution,and to continue with face coverings when recommendedeven after legal restrictions in England are lifted on 19 July. Andy Preston, the elected mayor of Middlesbrough, told the BBC: ""We are putting a message out in Middlesbrough that rates are ballooning.

"Five of England's metro mayors call for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after rules change on Monday Face coverings will stay compulsory in areas they have control over, like Manchester's trams and West Yorkshire bus stations They will also be compulsory on London's transport network after England's restrictions ease on 19 July Masks will no longer be a legal requirement in England from Monday but you have to wear them on transport in Scotland and Wales The Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca move onto the government's amber travel list It means from Monday, those not double-jabbed or under 18 have to quarantine on their return A further 42,302 Covid cases are reported across the UK and another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Two thirds of UK adults have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - will be scrapped from 7 August if coronavirus rates allow Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by George Bowden, Chris Clayton, Robert Greenall, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright and Claire Heald. Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Here's a recap of the day's main stories in the UK: Protests have taken place in Paris We're wrapping up our coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the biggest developments from around the world today: The government hasconfirmed nearly all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July. It means all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed. The legal requirement to wear face masks in some public spaces will be dropped, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and limits on how many people can meet will be ditched. Several countries around the world have already tried easing their coronavirus restrictions this year - with mixed results. So what has happened in places where rules have been relaxed? Read more here. Senegal is experiencing an
""unprecedented"" surge in Covid infections, the health
ministry has warned. The country hit a new daily record
of 733 cases on Wednesday. The previous record was 529 cases on Sunday. Senegal has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, but is struggling with its vaccine rollout. ""The situation is unprecedented. We have never seen such an
increase in cases,"" says health ministry spokesman Mamadou
Ndiaye. Measures must be taken urgently to reverse the trend ahead of Eid al-Adha - a Muslim holiday that will be celebrated next week - Ndiaye says. The holiday is the biggest in Senegal and is usually marked with large family gatherings. There are currently no
measures in place to restrict such events. French police have used tear
gas to disperse a protest against President Emmanuel Macron's
plan to require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR
test to gain entry to bars, restaurants and cinemas from August. Macron has announced new measures to combat a surge in infections. These included the
mandatory vaccination of health workers and new health pass
rules for the wider public. These rules have gone further than most of France's neighbours and some have accused the government of stamping on freedoms. Protesters marched through Paris, with some wearing badges saying ""no to the health pass"", before clashes started. The debate over face coverings is not confined to public transport. Under new advice from House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, masks are compulsory for parliamentary staff from next Monday - but will be optional for MPs as they are not employed by Parliament. Unions say the Speaker could stop those who don't wear a face covering from entering the Commons chamber. From 19 July, the legal requirement to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces in England will be removed. Instead, PM Boris Johnson has said the government ""expects and recommends"" that face coverings are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. Read morehere. Asked whether central government could change its mind on masks on public transport, Tracy Brabin says: ""It does feel to me as though there is going to be a shift."" As reasoning, she says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps showed support forSadiq Khan's decision to make masks mandatory on London's transport network. No-one would criticise the government if the the PM did change his mind, says Andy Burnham, adding: ""It would help everyone if there was a change of heart at the national level. ""None of us is saying this is going to be easy, we're all trying to act where we can."" The
Balearic Islands ofMajorca,IbizaandMenorcaare to move to the UK's amber travel list just three weeks after quarantine-free travel to the popular destinations was granted. Following a rise in local cases, the Spanish islands - which attract millions of UK visitors in a normal year - will move to the amber list from 04:00 BST on Monday 19 July. TheBritish Virgin Islandswill also move to the amber list at the same time. Meanwhile,BulgariaandHong Kongwill move to the green list, meaning no arrivals need to quarantine, andCroatiaandTaiwanmove to the
green watchlist, putting travellers on notice of potential future changes. Cuba,Indonesia,MyanmarandSierra Leonewill be moved to the red list, with arrivals required to carry out their quarantine in a government-run hotel at a cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The announcement applies to England, but the other UK nations are expected to follow suit. Separate changes to the travel list system mean that, from Monday and in England, Scotland and Wales, those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantining at home on their return from an amber country. Returning to the metro mayor's press conference, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is asked whether it is fair to ask transport staff to enforce mask-wearing when it is not a legal requirement. She says she doesn't want to put staff in a difficult position, and can't fine people who refuse. It is a matter of persuasion and encouragement, she says. Bus operators are going to be ""strongly encouraging"" passengers to wear masks on buses, she adds, but it will not be mandatory. Brabin goes on to say doesn't want to put staff in a vulnerable position and if people don't want to wear one, then ultimately they won't. Meanwhile, speaking in the House of Commons, in Westminster, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warns current Covid hospital admissions ""have increased to over 500 a day, up 50% in a week"", with waiting lists at their ""highest level seen on record, currently at 5.3 million"". During a debate on a new Health and Care Bill in England, he said the planned ""top down reorganisation"" is coming ""when we are not even through the pandemic"". He described the proposals as a ""Trojan horse to hide a power grab"" by ministers, with patients ""treated like ghosts in the machine"". Previously the government said the planned changes would mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Read more about themhere. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is asked what changed his mind about calling for masks on public transport, after initially suggesting he would not call for such a move. ""When we originally looked at it, I did say I thought this was going to be difficult to do but you do the job [well] if you're listening to people,"" he says. Burnham adds he has been ""inundated with messages"" from vulnerable people saying 19 July is ""fear day"" for them, not ""freedom day"". ""I've been hearing their voices loud and clear,"" he says He mentions the guidance for vulnerable people, which tells them to avoid those who have not been vaccinated, and questions what an unvaccinated person is supposed to look like? If things go on as they are, people will feel they can't go out ""and that's not right"", says Burnham. Liverpool mayor Steve Rotherham says, unlike Sadiq Khan, he does not have the power to make masks mandatory. However, he says he will be asking all transport operators in his constituency to enforce mask-wearing on their services. ""I'll be asking all of them... to do the right thing,"" he says. ""I don't think we can put a price on public safety."" Wearing face masks ""costs nothing"" and they are a ""minor inconvenience"", he adds. Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis and West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin say they will make masks mandatory at the bus stations within their control, but like Burnham and Rotherham, say they do not have the power to make them a requirement across all public transport. West of England Mayor Dan Norris says he has no power to make masks mandatory but he has written to the prime minister to complain about the ""ridiculous"" decision not to enforce mask wearing on public transport. He adds he is calling on people in the West of England to wear masks when they travel. Mayors across England have together called for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after the legal requirement for them ends on Monday. Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, West Yorkshire's Tracy Brabin, Liverpool City Region's Steve Rotheram, North of Tyne's Jamie Driscoll, Dan Jarvis in the Sheffield City Region and the West of England's Dan Norris are holding a joint press conference. Burnham says the people of Greater Manchester should ""work with us"" to protect each other and supporting members of the community who may be concerned by the end of mandatory mask rules. Masks will stay compulsory on Manchester's Metrolink tram services and at West Yorkshire bus stations, for example. They are places the metro mayors have powers over. It comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khandeclared masks mandatoryon the capital's public transport network even after 19 July, and West Midlands Mayor Andy Street said he isexpecting local passengers to wear them on all forms of transport.,external You can read more aboutwhich rules are changing on Monday here. The US State Department is ""surging"" staffing levels to address a backlog of as many as two million passport applications due to the pandemic. Americans have been left waiting between 12 and 18 weeks for new passports,
an official tells the Reuters news agency. Rachel Arndt, deputy assistant secretary for passport services in the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, says the availability of vaccinations in the US has led to many more than usual applying for
passports to travel overseas. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge. ""We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,"" she said. ""People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."" And now nurses are donning their high-grade PPE once more. Dr Monaghan's hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week. Read more from Hughhere. A further 42,302 new Covid cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 46 million people have now received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, with more than 35 million now fully vaccinated, government figures showed. Boom Village was going to be held on the same site as the already-cancelled Boomtown A scaled-down version of the Boomtown music festival has been cancelled because of escalating cases of Covid, the event's organisers have said. Boom Village was due to be hosted at the Matterley Estate, near Winchester, between 11 and 15 August. It was designed to be a smaller event than the usual Boomtown festival, which hadalready been cancelled. Organisers say they appreciate the decision might seem confusing given theimminent lifting of Covid restrictions. Astatement on the Boomtown website,externalsays the risk of widespread illness and self-isolation would result in them not having enough people to safely deliver the event. ""The core decision is due to the escalating cases of Covid-19 across the country,"" it adds. Ticket holders have been promised refunds and the full Boomtown festival is expected to return in 2022.

Face masks will still be required in shops after 7 August Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford says the prevalence of Covid-19 in Wales will remain ""extremely high for at least the rest of this summer"". This is based on warnings from the Welsh government's technical advisory group, he says. He tells the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and ""spreading quickly"". ""There can be no doubt that we are experiencing the anticipated third wave of this pandemic, with the rate in Wales rising overnight to 145 cases per 100,000 people,"" Drakeford says. It comes as most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August. Nightclubs are set to resume trading, and social-distancing laws inside will be replaced with a requirement for workplaces to assess the risk. But face masks will still be required in most indoor public places, except in hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, or schools. You can read more about the changing rules in Wales here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News With two out of three UK adults now fully vaccinated against
Covid, the UK is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world - but many
challenges still remain. The spread of the Delta variant and a sharp rise in cases as
restrictions are lifted means vaccinating as many people as possible before the
onset of autumn is now urgent. A third of adults, mostly people in their 20s and 30s, are not yet
fully protected. But there are other communities where uptake is low, for example
some ethnic minorities, particularly people from black backgrounds, those
living in some poorer areas and working in certain jobs, who have not yet been
jabbed. Convincing them to come forward and get a vaccine will help
increase the height of the wall of immunity which is going to help hold back
the tide of hospital admissions come the winter. Every adult in England has been offered at least one dose, but
only 87% have had one. That gives an indication of the scale of challenge
ahead. Even with one of the fastest vaccination programmes on the planet,
the UK is not out of the woods yet. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0007502382
"Waterstones says it will encourage its customers to continue wearing face coverings in its stores after they cease to be compulsory after 19 July. It is one of the first major chains to state a firm policy on mask wearing. Businesses are weighing up what approach to take once Covid measures become a matter for them to decide. Some shop workers and staff are worried that abandoning masks will put their health at risk, but others have reacted with anger at Waterstones' move. Waterstones said in a tweet,external: ""Following the lift of restrictions on 19 July across England, we will observe new government guidance. ""Given our enclosed browsing environment, we encourage our customers to wear face masks and observe social distancing, respecting the safety of staff and fellow book lovers."" Managing director James Daunt told the BBC this would be communicated by signs, but staff would not enforce this: ""If you are wearing a mask and you don't want to be in the company with someone who isn't wearing a mask, we expect people will use their common sense and move away."" He said current safety precautions would remain in place, with screens up between booksellers and customers and staff wearing masks. What's the new guidance on masks and face coverings? The tweet has attracted a mass - and mixed - response. Many are in favour of its position. The tweet had garnered 22,000 ""likes"" by lunchtime. Critical care nurse Kimberley Anne said,external: ""@Waterstones ! As an ITU nurse, I am so exhausted with all these waves of Covid and I personally feel more at ease bookshopping with a mask. I am freaking out already using the tube."" But Talk Radio presenterJulia Hartley-Brewer said:,external""I make a point of buying books at my local @Waterstones rather than ordering on Amazon because I want bookstores to thrive, but if I go into your store and a member of staff asks me to wear a mask, you will lose my business forever."" From Monday 19 July, the government has said, wearing face coverings in England will be recommended but not mandatory. Transport companies have been the most forthright in setting out their policies. London Transport said on Tuesday it would require passengers on the Tube, bus and its Overground railways to wear masks. Airlines including BA and Ryanair have already confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July. But most retailers have taken a more cautious approach, while many, including leading supermarkets, have not yet said anything concrete. Timpsons shoe repair and key cutting chain, which has more than 2,000 shops, is leaving mask wearing as a matter of personal choice for customers. Sir John Timpson, its boss, said: ""I don't think the way it's going we've got any right, we shouldn't expect them to do so, that's entirely up to the customer."" But he said his staff would be asked to wear masks. Jewellery retailer Beaverbrooks is going further. It told the BBC it would keep all of its current safety measures in place, including welcome barriers, hand sanitisation stations and serving screens. It said staff would still be wearing visors or masks. But it added that although it could not force customers to wear masks, it would prefer them to continue to wear masks in its stores. Aside from Sainsbury's, which said last week that mask wearing would be a matter of personal choice for customers, leading supermarkets have not so far publicly stated their approach. Morrisons says it is waiting for further guidance from the government. Some shoppers are uncomfortable with anything other than a clear safety policy. Commenting on Waterstones' move,Denys Whitley tweeted,external: ""'Encourage' is not strong enough. Mask-wearing must be mandatory. Non-masked are not respecting the safety of staff or fellow book-lovers... With this policy, I'll be sticking to the pathetic selection on Amazon."" Shop workers' union Usdaw had previously urged the government not to lift Covid safety measures in shops. According to a recent survey, it found violence, verbal abuse or threats of violence towards shop workers had increased 25-50%, with face coverings the trigger for 15% of the incidents. Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said: ""Shop workers already face violence and abuse when enforcing these measures and we are concerned that, when restrictions no longer have the force of the law behind them, this could result in further abuse, threats and violence towards retail workers."" Should shops ask their customers to keep wearing masks after 19 July, when they are no longer compulsory? Get in touch and let us know.

"The UK inflation rate hit 2.5% in the year to June, the highest for nearly three years, as the unlocking of the UK economy continued. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 2.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics said, driven by higher food and fuel costs. The rate is higher than the Bank of England's 2% inflation target for a second month. That will fuel the debate about whether interest rates need to go up. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. As well as food from shops, eating and drinking out also cost more, while clothing and footwear, usually cheaper at this time of year, went up in price instead. Second-hand car prices rose between May and June this year, whereas in recent years, they have fallen between these months, the ONS said. Some buyers were reported to have turned to the used car market as a result of delays in the supply of new cars caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production. June's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.2%. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: ""The rise was widespread, for example coming from price increases for food and for second-hand cars, where there are reports of increased demand. ""Some of the increase is from temporary effects, for example, rising fuel prices which continue to increase inflation, but much of this is due to prices recovering from lows earlier in the pandemic. ""An increase in prices for clothing and footwear, compared with the normal seasonal pattern of summer sales, also added to the upward pressure this month."" Why Covid has jacked up used car prices Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, an older measure that is still used to calculate certain cost-of-living increases, rose to 3.9% in June, from 3.3% in May. The latest rise in the inflation rate will add to pressure on the Bank of England to consider increasing interest rates to cool the economy. The Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has taken the view that the current inflation surge is ""transitory"" and will fall back after peaking at 3%. But the Bank's departing chief economist,Andy Haldane, warned last monththat the risk of high inflation was ""rising fast"" and could reach nearly 4% this year. Inflation is up again, above target, with prices rising faster than expected across the board in June. Much of this is the result of comparisons with prices that were falling a year ago at the height of the lockdown. Bottlenecks in supply are also driving prices up. For example, car producers can not find microchips, so cannot build enough new cars, so used car prices went up 4.4% in a month. During the pandemic, the microchip market diverted its supply to electronics amid a slump in car sales. There are plenty of examples like this, and the net result is that inflation is heading above 3% in the coming months. This is sufficiently above target to trigger a letter of explanation from the governor of the Bank of England to the chancellor, but don't expect immediate rises in interest rates. Inflation should peak at this level before falling back to normal, as the economy further reopens. It is, right now, high and rising, but hardly out of control. And the reasons for this global rise are pretty clear: demand rebounding quickly after the pandemic, while supply is taking a little longer to ramp back up. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sided with the MPC majority view that inflation was likely to reach 3%, but not much higher. Interest rates would therefore remain at the current record low of 0.1% ""throughout next year"", he said. Inflation would ""ease quickly in 2022"", returning to the Bank's 2% target ""in the second half of next year"", he forecast. However, Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, took Mr Haldane's view that inflation could peak as high as 4% at the end of this year. ""We expect it to continue its upward trend over the summer,"" she told the BBC. ""That's largely because of these global supply shortages which have become more acute. ""Of course, that's affected everything from semi-conductors to household appliances."" Traders in Willesden Market in north-west London interviewed by the BBC said they were feeling the effects of those supply shortages, with their wholesale costs going up sharply. However, they added that they were finding it difficult to pass on those costs to their customers, who were unwilling or unable to pay more. One trader said: ""If you try to pass the costs on to the customers, they just don't buy it. Especially at the moment. ""No-one's got any money, everyone's skint, everyone's coming back out of lockdown, people have lost their jobs. ""I'm earning less, but I'm still going, so I can be thankful for that at the moment."" Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Once again, social-media companies are facing criticism as their platforms are used toracially abuse football players, following the dramatic conclusion of the Euro 2020 men's tournament on Sunday night. And make no mistake, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the technology giants to defend these incidents. How can they not be held more responsible for the content they share to millions? In a nutshell, social-media platforms have not been regulated in the same way as traditional media such as the BBC, because they are not categorised as publishers or broadcasters. If racist comments appeared below this article, written not by me but by someone who had read it, the BBC would be immediately accountable, as part ofan arrangement with the regulator Ofcom,external. But Ofcom does not yet have powers over the likes of Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, which have until now been largely self-regulating -although, that is coming, as part of the long-anticipated Online Safety Bill. Whether the threat of large fines is enough to focus the minds of these multi-million dollar businesses remains to be seen, however. Butit is not just in the UK that regulation is planned. In fairness, while the BBC does have a large global presence, it does not have to deal with anything like the volume of content and video, written and uploaded in real time by anybody and everybody, a platform such as Facebook, with its two billion users, does. Social-media platforms are looking to automation for answers This sheer volume swamps the armies of human moderators employed by those platforms. Some describe nightmare shiftssifting through the worst and most graphic content imaginable and then making decisions about what should be done with it. So, the solution these companies are all pouring countless time and money into is automation. Algorithms trained to seek out offensive material before it is published, the blanket banning of incendiary (and illegal) hashtags, the use of techniques such as ""hashing"", which create a kind of digital fingerprint of a video, and then block any content bearing the same marker, are already in regular use. But so far, automation remains a bit of a blunt instrument. It is not yet sophisticated enough to understand nuance, context, different cultural norms, crafty edits - and there would be very little support for an anonymous algorithm, built by an unelected US technology giant, effectively censoring Western people's speech without these factors (China of course has its own state censorship and US social-media platforms are banned). Match officials at a Premier League game last month wore T shirts bearing anti-abuse slogans Here is an example - a friend last night reported an anonymous account that had posted an orangutan emoji beneath an Instagram post belonging to England's Bukayo Saka. Now, nobody is going to blanket-ban that emoji. But in this context, and given Saka is a young black player whose penalty kick was one of those that failed in the deciding moments of the England v Italy Euro 2020 final, the intention is pretty clear. The response my friend received to her complaint was: ""Our technology has found that this probably doesn't go against our community guidelines,"" - although, it went on to add the automation ""isn't perfect"". She has appealed against the decision but who knows when it will get a pair of human eyes on it? On Twitter, meanwhile, a user was apparently able to use an extremely offensive racial slur in a tweet about a footballer, before deleting the message. In a statement, Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it had ""quickly removed comments"" directed at players. ""No-one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere - and we don't want it on Instagram,"" it said. Twitter's response was similar - in 24 hours, it had removed 1,000 posts and blocked accounts sharing hateful content, using ""a combination of machine learning based automation and human review"", it said. Both companies also said they had tools and filters that could be activated to stop account holders from seeing abusive content - but this does not solve the problem of the content being shared in the first place. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight,"" Facebook added. And perhaps that is what really lies at the heart of all this - it is not necessarily the limitations of technology that are the issue but old-fashioned human nature. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, on Twitter ironically, those responsible for posting racist abuse should ""be ashamed of themselves"". Allow Twitter content?

"Mask-wearing will remain for ""some time"" after Scotland moves to level zero of restrictions Rules on wearing face coverings in Scotland could remain in place until Christmas, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told BBC Scotland it was ""perfectly conceivable"" that masks could still be mandatory in December. On Tuesday, the first minister confirmed mask-wearing would remain for ""some time"" as she announced the move to level zero of Covid restrictions. Nicola Sturgeonmodified planned easingdue to the spread of the Delta variant. Scotland will move to level zero on 19 July which means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. Restrictions to ease but face masks remain What rules are changing, and when? However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained and the return of workers to offices will also be delayed. In an interview onBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Mr Swinney was asked if he could envisaged face coverings being mandatory until Christmas. John Swinney says that face coverings are especially important to protect people who are clinically vulnerable He said: ""I think that's perfectly conceivable. I think that we should recognise that we have got to take a careful and cautious approach to the suppression of Covid. ""We know the virus is going to be with us for a long time so the more that we can do, a gradual elementary level to provide obstacles and barriers to the circulation of this virus, the more we should do that."" Mr Swinney also revealed Scottish government modelling predicts that Scotland could record between 2,500 and 10,500 new Covid cases on the day restrictions move to level zero. He added: ""I think it is likely to be much closer to that lower end of the spectrum than the higher end."" He said the impact of the virus was ""moving in the right direction - which means that we can afford some of the relaxation"". The wearing face masks in shops and on public transport is to continue for the foreseeable future Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she was ""really happy"" to see a continued requirement for face masks. ""I know people say it should be 'my choice', but I don't wear a face mask to protect myself, I wear it to protect others,"" she toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""If I'm in a shop there could be someone who is immuno-compromised, who is asthmatic, who is elderly - and they will feel safer in that setting if I wear my mask."" Prof Sridhar said case numbers in Scotland needed to come down from their current high levels before the wearing of face masks could be dropped. ""We're not asking people to wear masks on beaches like in Portugal or outside in parks, like in parts of the United States,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""It's really just in workplaces, indoor settings, transport, shops, and it's seen as proportionate to the risks of transmission in those settings."" It is still hoped that Scotland will move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. A decision on this will be taken next month. Among other announcements in Ms Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood were plans to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate, as long as they have had two doses of vaccine. In addition, fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as long as they take a test after arrival. Business groups have broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers ""moving the goalposts"" at the last minute by altering plans, such as hospitality venues now being required to close at midnight. Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: ""The midnight curfew is just a made-up time with no evidence to justify it. ""It's like Groundhog Day with our warnings about driving people into house parties and other uncontrolled spaces that lack all the precautions you find in responsible pubs, restaurants and hotels."" Some of the level zero changes expected by the hospitality industry have been modified by the Scottish government The Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant ""should hopefully generate some extra passing trade"", but said there was ""less good news"" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was ""another encouraging milestone"", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be ""a bitter blow for employees and employers alike"". The continued wearing of facemasks won the backing of shop worker union Usdaw. Tracy Gilbert, the union's regional secretary for Scotland, said: ""We ask the public to show their support and respect for shop workers by following the law. ""Wearing a face covering in a shop is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job.""

"Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for ""some time"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant. The move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed. Ms Sturgeon said ""sensible precautions"" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues. She said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What rules are changing and when? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Ministers also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point. Ms Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate. And fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival. However, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place ""for some time"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them. ""And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings."" Ministers say the success of the vaccine programme makes it possible to ease restrictions Scotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had ""levelled off"", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses. She said ""a gradual approach"" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life. Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said ""I will always err on the side of going more cautiously"". England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option ""for good headlines"". A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time. Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings. While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here ""for as long as necessary"". It feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go. The move to level zero means: Up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and up to 10 can meet in a pub or restaurant - with no need to pre-book a two-hour slot. Up to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors, and up to 200 can attend weddings and funerals. Plans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers: Hospitality venues will be required to close at midnight. Some physical distancing rules are to be maintained outdoors, with different groups of 15 required to stay at least 1m (3ft 3in) apart in public spaces - meaning there may be limits on some outdoor events. A ""gradual"" return to office working was due to be part of the move to level zero, but this has now been put back to 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said the move was ""not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions"", but it said it ""does restore yet more freedom to all of us"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says lifting all restrictions right now would put people at risk Business groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers ""moving the goalposts"" at the last minute by altering their plans. The Scottish Retail Consortium said firms ""will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed"". The Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant ""should hopefully generate some extra passing trade"", but said there was ""less good news"" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was ""another encouraging milestone"", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be ""a bitter blow for employees and employers alike"". Some restrictions on outdoor gatherings will continue The virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives"". He said: ""The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver."" Labour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said ""inconsistent decision making and communications"" was hitting the response to the pandemic. He said: ""The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic."" Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had ""concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high"", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging. And outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made ""urgently"", with ""thousands of key workers"" having to quarantine despite testing negative.

"John Lewis and Waitrose are planning to cut 1,000 jobs as part of a shake-up of store management. The move follows the closure of eight John Lewis shops earlier this year, which put almost 1,500 jobs at risk. John Lewis, which owns Waitrose and the department store chain, is trying to cut costs as shopping habits change and more people shop online. It said it would help affected staff find new roles and wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies. The proposed job cuts ""will allow us to reinvest in what matters most to our customers"", a John Lewis Partnership spokesperson said. It will invest in customer service roles and ""visual merchandising to make our shops look their best to entice customers"", the retailer said. The cuts, which work out at nearly three management roles per store, will ""reduce the number of layers between our most senior leaders and non-management"" shop floor staff, it added. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated a trend towards people shopping online instead of in stores. Last year the retailer said it would close eight stores with the loss of 1,300 jobs, and put in place a plan to adapt to the boom in online shopping. It then announced a further eight department store closures this year, after the impact of the pandemic led it to report a hefty annual loss. Earlier this month, the partnership announced plans tobuild 10,000 rental homes over the next few yearsto give it a stable long-term income. At the moment, it has 34 John Lewis shops and 331 Waitrose stores and across the UK. Its 80,000 staff are also partners in the business and usually get a share of the profits. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that for John Lewis, ""pivoting quickly to keep up with the accelerated shift in shopping habits brought on by the pandemic has been far from easy"". Last year was the first time since 1953 that the company did not pay a bonus, ""highlighting the once-in-a-generation challenge the partnership is facing"", she said. The firm is spending Â£1bn over five years to speed up the move to online sales. ""To do that, it needs to make significant cost savings elsewhere,"" Ms Streeter said. ""Closing underperforming stores and reducing headcount is an inevitable consequence as chair Dame Sharon White tries to steer the ship towards the online shopping future."" She added: ""It's becoming increasingly clear that John Lewis faces a future with a much smaller retail footprint. ""By evolving to become part of campus-style developments [with housing], the partnership may help distressed city centres find new leases of life and bring fresh energy back into the retail ecosystem.""

"Five of England's metro mayors call for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after rules change on Monday Face coverings will stay compulsory in areas they have control over, like Manchester's trams and West Yorkshire bus stations They will also be compulsory on London's transport network after England's restrictions ease on 19 July Masks will no longer be a legal requirement in England from Monday but you have to wear them on transport in Scotland and Wales The Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca move onto the government's amber travel list It means from Monday, those not double-jabbed or under 18 have to quarantine on their return A further 42,302 Covid cases are reported across the UK and another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Two thirds of UK adults have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - will be scrapped from 7 August if coronavirus rates allow Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by George Bowden, Chris Clayton, Robert Greenall, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright and Claire Heald. Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Here's a recap of the day's main stories in the UK: Protests have taken place in Paris We're wrapping up our coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the biggest developments from around the world today: The government hasconfirmed nearly all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July. It means all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed. The legal requirement to wear face masks in some public spaces will be dropped, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and limits on how many people can meet will be ditched. Several countries around the world have already tried easing their coronavirus restrictions this year - with mixed results. So what has happened in places where rules have been relaxed? Read more here. Senegal is experiencing an
""unprecedented"" surge in Covid infections, the health
ministry has warned. The country hit a new daily record
of 733 cases on Wednesday. The previous record was 529 cases on Sunday. Senegal has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, but is struggling with its vaccine rollout. ""The situation is unprecedented. We have never seen such an
increase in cases,"" says health ministry spokesman Mamadou
Ndiaye. Measures must be taken urgently to reverse the trend ahead of Eid al-Adha - a Muslim holiday that will be celebrated next week - Ndiaye says. The holiday is the biggest in Senegal and is usually marked with large family gatherings. There are currently no
measures in place to restrict such events. French police have used tear
gas to disperse a protest against President Emmanuel Macron's
plan to require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR
test to gain entry to bars, restaurants and cinemas from August. Macron has announced new measures to combat a surge in infections. These included the
mandatory vaccination of health workers and new health pass
rules for the wider public. These rules have gone further than most of France's neighbours and some have accused the government of stamping on freedoms. Protesters marched through Paris, with some wearing badges saying ""no to the health pass"", before clashes started. The debate over face coverings is not confined to public transport. Under new advice from House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, masks are compulsory for parliamentary staff from next Monday - but will be optional for MPs as they are not employed by Parliament. Unions say the Speaker could stop those who don't wear a face covering from entering the Commons chamber. From 19 July, the legal requirement to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces in England will be removed. Instead, PM Boris Johnson has said the government ""expects and recommends"" that face coverings are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. Read morehere. Asked whether central government could change its mind on masks on public transport, Tracy Brabin says: ""It does feel to me as though there is going to be a shift."" As reasoning, she says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps showed support forSadiq Khan's decision to make masks mandatory on London's transport network. No-one would criticise the government if the the PM did change his mind, says Andy Burnham, adding: ""It would help everyone if there was a change of heart at the national level. ""None of us is saying this is going to be easy, we're all trying to act where we can."" The
Balearic Islands ofMajorca,IbizaandMenorcaare to move to the UK's amber travel list just three weeks after quarantine-free travel to the popular destinations was granted. Following a rise in local cases, the Spanish islands - which attract millions of UK visitors in a normal year - will move to the amber list from 04:00 BST on Monday 19 July. TheBritish Virgin Islandswill also move to the amber list at the same time. Meanwhile,BulgariaandHong Kongwill move to the green list, meaning no arrivals need to quarantine, andCroatiaandTaiwanmove to the
green watchlist, putting travellers on notice of potential future changes. Cuba,Indonesia,MyanmarandSierra Leonewill be moved to the red list, with arrivals required to carry out their quarantine in a government-run hotel at a cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The announcement applies to England, but the other UK nations are expected to follow suit. Separate changes to the travel list system mean that, from Monday and in England, Scotland and Wales, those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantining at home on their return from an amber country. Returning to the metro mayor's press conference, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is asked whether it is fair to ask transport staff to enforce mask-wearing when it is not a legal requirement. She says she doesn't want to put staff in a difficult position, and can't fine people who refuse. It is a matter of persuasion and encouragement, she says. Bus operators are going to be ""strongly encouraging"" passengers to wear masks on buses, she adds, but it will not be mandatory. Brabin goes on to say doesn't want to put staff in a vulnerable position and if people don't want to wear one, then ultimately they won't. Meanwhile, speaking in the House of Commons, in Westminster, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warns current Covid hospital admissions ""have increased to over 500 a day, up 50% in a week"", with waiting lists at their ""highest level seen on record, currently at 5.3 million"". During a debate on a new Health and Care Bill in England, he said the planned ""top down reorganisation"" is coming ""when we are not even through the pandemic"". He described the proposals as a ""Trojan horse to hide a power grab"" by ministers, with patients ""treated like ghosts in the machine"". Previously the government said the planned changes would mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Read more about themhere. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is asked what changed his mind about calling for masks on public transport, after initially suggesting he would not call for such a move. ""When we originally looked at it, I did say I thought this was going to be difficult to do but you do the job [well] if you're listening to people,"" he says. Burnham adds he has been ""inundated with messages"" from vulnerable people saying 19 July is ""fear day"" for them, not ""freedom day"". ""I've been hearing their voices loud and clear,"" he says He mentions the guidance for vulnerable people, which tells them to avoid those who have not been vaccinated, and questions what an unvaccinated person is supposed to look like? If things go on as they are, people will feel they can't go out ""and that's not right"", says Burnham. Liverpool mayor Steve Rotherham says, unlike Sadiq Khan, he does not have the power to make masks mandatory. However, he says he will be asking all transport operators in his constituency to enforce mask-wearing on their services. ""I'll be asking all of them... to do the right thing,"" he says. ""I don't think we can put a price on public safety."" Wearing face masks ""costs nothing"" and they are a ""minor inconvenience"", he adds. Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis and West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin say they will make masks mandatory at the bus stations within their control, but like Burnham and Rotherham, say they do not have the power to make them a requirement across all public transport. West of England Mayor Dan Norris says he has no power to make masks mandatory but he has written to the prime minister to complain about the ""ridiculous"" decision not to enforce mask wearing on public transport. He adds he is calling on people in the West of England to wear masks when they travel. Mayors across England have together called for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after the legal requirement for them ends on Monday. Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, West Yorkshire's Tracy Brabin, Liverpool City Region's Steve Rotheram, North of Tyne's Jamie Driscoll, Dan Jarvis in the Sheffield City Region and the West of England's Dan Norris are holding a joint press conference. Burnham says the people of Greater Manchester should ""work with us"" to protect each other and supporting members of the community who may be concerned by the end of mandatory mask rules. Masks will stay compulsory on Manchester's Metrolink tram services and at West Yorkshire bus stations, for example. They are places the metro mayors have powers over. It comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khandeclared masks mandatoryon the capital's public transport network even after 19 July, and West Midlands Mayor Andy Street said he isexpecting local passengers to wear them on all forms of transport.,external You can read more aboutwhich rules are changing on Monday here. The US State Department is ""surging"" staffing levels to address a backlog of as many as two million passport applications due to the pandemic. Americans have been left waiting between 12 and 18 weeks for new passports,
an official tells the Reuters news agency. Rachel Arndt, deputy assistant secretary for passport services in the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, says the availability of vaccinations in the US has led to many more than usual applying for
passports to travel overseas. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge. ""We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,"" she said. ""People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."" And now nurses are donning their high-grade PPE once more. Dr Monaghan's hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week. Read more from Hughhere. A further 42,302 new Covid cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 46 million people have now received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, with more than 35 million now fully vaccinated, government figures showed. Boom Village was going to be held on the same site as the already-cancelled Boomtown A scaled-down version of the Boomtown music festival has been cancelled because of escalating cases of Covid, the event's organisers have said. Boom Village was due to be hosted at the Matterley Estate, near Winchester, between 11 and 15 August. It was designed to be a smaller event than the usual Boomtown festival, which hadalready been cancelled. Organisers say they appreciate the decision might seem confusing given theimminent lifting of Covid restrictions. Astatement on the Boomtown website,externalsays the risk of widespread illness and self-isolation would result in them not having enough people to safely deliver the event. ""The core decision is due to the escalating cases of Covid-19 across the country,"" it adds. Ticket holders have been promised refunds and the full Boomtown festival is expected to return in 2022.

Face masks will still be required in shops after 7 August Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford says the prevalence of Covid-19 in Wales will remain ""extremely high for at least the rest of this summer"". This is based on warnings from the Welsh government's technical advisory group, he says. He tells the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and ""spreading quickly"". ""There can be no doubt that we are experiencing the anticipated third wave of this pandemic, with the rate in Wales rising overnight to 145 cases per 100,000 people,"" Drakeford says. It comes as most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August. Nightclubs are set to resume trading, and social-distancing laws inside will be replaced with a requirement for workplaces to assess the risk. But face masks will still be required in most indoor public places, except in hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, or schools. You can read more about the changing rules in Wales here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News With two out of three UK adults now fully vaccinated against
Covid, the UK is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world - but many
challenges still remain. The spread of the Delta variant and a sharp rise in cases as
restrictions are lifted means vaccinating as many people as possible before the
onset of autumn is now urgent. A third of adults, mostly people in their 20s and 30s, are not yet
fully protected. But there are other communities where uptake is low, for example
some ethnic minorities, particularly people from black backgrounds, those
living in some poorer areas and working in certain jobs, who have not yet been
jabbed. Convincing them to come forward and get a vaccine will help
increase the height of the wall of immunity which is going to help hold back
the tide of hospital admissions come the winter. Every adult in England has been offered at least one dose, but
only 87% have had one. That gives an indication of the scale of challenge
ahead. Even with one of the fastest vaccination programmes on the planet,
the UK is not out of the woods yet. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.4135434e-05

"This video can not be played Government proposals on the legacy of the past will ""draw a line under the Troubles"" - PM The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly. Some victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals. However, Mr Lewis said it was ""the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation"". In his Commons statement, he outlined a ""statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents"". It is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries. A statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. The plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. The government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts. This video can not be played ""A painful recognition of where we are"" - NI Secretary Brandon Lewis Mr Lewis said: ""We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly. ""But we have arrived at the view that this would be the best way to facilitate an effective information retrieval and provision process, and the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation.

The government statement followed significant recent developments in a number of high-profile Troubles prosecution cases.

Joe McCann was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972 Both soldiers had been interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case. But the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible and as the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) did not appeal against that decision, the case could not proceed. Then, earlier this month, the McCann murder trial collapse had implications for two other high-profile cases - the Bloody Sunday trial and the prosecution for the murder of 15-year-old Daniel Hegarty. What happened on Bloody Sunday? Why did prosecutors drop cases against ex-soldiers? The PPS met the families of Daniel Hegarty and two men killed on Bloody Sunday to explain that given ""related evidential features"" to the McCann case, prosecutors no longer believed there was a reasonable prospect that key evidence against the soldiers accused of their loved one's murders would be ruled admissible. The Bloody Sunday case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but instead it was adjourned following a legal challenge by a brother of one of the men shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

"Waterstones says it will encourage its customers to continue wearing face coverings in its stores after they cease to be compulsory after 19 July. It is one of the first major chains to state a firm policy on mask wearing. Businesses are weighing up what approach to take once Covid measures become a matter for them to decide. Some shop workers and staff are worried that abandoning masks will put their health at risk, but others have reacted with anger at Waterstones' move. Waterstones said in a tweet,external: ""Following the lift of restrictions on 19 July across England, we will observe new government guidance. ""Given our enclosed browsing environment, we encourage our customers to wear face masks and observe social distancing, respecting the safety of staff and fellow book lovers."" Managing director James Daunt told the BBC this would be communicated by signs, but staff would not enforce this: ""If you are wearing a mask and you don't want to be in the company with someone who isn't wearing a mask, we expect people will use their common sense and move away."" He said current safety precautions would remain in place, with screens up between booksellers and customers and staff wearing masks. What's the new guidance on masks and face coverings? The tweet has attracted a mass - and mixed - response. Many are in favour of its position. The tweet had garnered 22,000 ""likes"" by lunchtime. Critical care nurse Kimberley Anne said,external: ""@Waterstones ! As an ITU nurse, I am so exhausted with all these waves of Covid and I personally feel more at ease bookshopping with a mask. I am freaking out already using the tube."" But Talk Radio presenterJulia Hartley-Brewer said:,external""I make a point of buying books at my local @Waterstones rather than ordering on Amazon because I want bookstores to thrive, but if I go into your store and a member of staff asks me to wear a mask, you will lose my business forever."" From Monday 19 July, the government has said, wearing face coverings in England will be recommended but not mandatory. Transport companies have been the most forthright in setting out their policies. London Transport said on Tuesday it would require passengers on the Tube, bus and its Overground railways to wear masks. Airlines including BA and Ryanair have already confirmed face masks will still be compulsory after 19 July. But most retailers have taken a more cautious approach, while many, including leading supermarkets, have not yet said anything concrete. Timpsons shoe repair and key cutting chain, which has more than 2,000 shops, is leaving mask wearing as a matter of personal choice for customers. Sir John Timpson, its boss, said: ""I don't think the way it's going we've got any right, we shouldn't expect them to do so, that's entirely up to the customer."" But he said his staff would be asked to wear masks. Jewellery retailer Beaverbrooks is going further. It told the BBC it would keep all of its current safety measures in place, including welcome barriers, hand sanitisation stations and serving screens. It said staff would still be wearing visors or masks. But it added that although it could not force customers to wear masks, it would prefer them to continue to wear masks in its stores. Aside from Sainsbury's, which said last week that mask wearing would be a matter of personal choice for customers, leading supermarkets have not so far publicly stated their approach. Morrisons says it is waiting for further guidance from the government. Some shoppers are uncomfortable with anything other than a clear safety policy. Commenting on Waterstones' move,Denys Whitley tweeted,external: ""'Encourage' is not strong enough. Mask-wearing must be mandatory. Non-masked are not respecting the safety of staff or fellow book-lovers... With this policy, I'll be sticking to the pathetic selection on Amazon."" Shop workers' union Usdaw had previously urged the government not to lift Covid safety measures in shops. According to a recent survey, it found violence, verbal abuse or threats of violence towards shop workers had increased 25-50%, with face coverings the trigger for 15% of the incidents. Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said: ""Shop workers already face violence and abuse when enforcing these measures and we are concerned that, when restrictions no longer have the force of the law behind them, this could result in further abuse, threats and violence towards retail workers."" Should shops ask their customers to keep wearing masks after 19 July, when they are no longer compulsory? Get in touch and let us know.

"The North West of England recorded fastest rising house prices House prices have risen sharply across the UK, driven by an increase of more than 15% in the year to May in the North West of England. Official figures show property prices also rose at a rapid rate in Scotland, Wales and the North East of England. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the average UK home cost Â£255,000 in May. That was Â£23,000 more than the typical value a year earlier. The 10% rise was the fastest rate for 14 years. Detached and terraced homes recorded the biggest price increases, data from the Land Registry in England and Wales show. Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic House prices dip as stamp duty holiday ends Estate agents have reported huge demand from property buyers during the year so far. This picked up when many buyers wanted to complete their purchases before stamp duty holidays were wound down. In May, the tax breaks were still in place for England, Northern Ireland and Wales. However, that it not the only explanation for rising prices. Scotland's property tax break was withdrawn at the end of March. People's changing priorities as a result of the pandemic mean they are looking for bigger homes in which to live and work. A lack of homes being put on the market to match demand has also led to rising prices. A majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year for that reason. ""The market was being powered by ultra-low mortgage rates, valuable stamp duty savings and people rethinking what they want from their homes due to the pandemic,"" said Katie Cave, director at mortgage broker Clearpoint Finance. ""Demand was as rampant as supply was weak, which sent prices skywards."" The ONS said that house prices in the UK rose by 10% in the year to May. The North West was the region with the highest annual house price growth, with average prices increasing by 15.2%. There were also big rises in Wales (up 13.3%), Scotland (up 12.1%) and the North East of England (up 11.8%). At the other end of the scale, London recorded the slowest property price rise over the year, of 5.2%. Ged McPartlin, managing director of Ascend Properties, said: ""It's clear that the north-south divide has never been wider. ""While this momentous rate of price growth must inevitably slow at some point, we expect this vast difference in property pedigree to remain as buyers in the north continue to benefit from a far more affordable market with, or without, the benefit of a stamp duty saving."" In Wales, terraced houses rose in price by 15.2% over the same period. That was the fastest rise of any property type, which was mirrored in England, where the value of terraced homes went up by 11.2%. This was closely followed by a 14% rise in the cost of detached homes in Wales, and an 11% increase in England. Properties with gardens have proved popular among buyers looking for space inside and outside homes.

"The UK inflation rate hit 2.5% in the year to June, the highest for nearly three years, as the unlocking of the UK economy continued. The Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation rose from 2.1% in May, the Office for National Statistics said, driven by higher food and fuel costs. The rate is higher than the Bank of England's 2% inflation target for a second month. That will fuel the debate about whether interest rates need to go up. Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. As well as food from shops, eating and drinking out also cost more, while clothing and footwear, usually cheaper at this time of year, went up in price instead. Second-hand car prices rose between May and June this year, whereas in recent years, they have fallen between these months, the ONS said. Some buyers were reported to have turned to the used car market as a result of delays in the supply of new cars caused by the shortage of semiconductor chips used in their production. June's reading was above most economists' forecasts of an increase of about 2.2%. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: ""The rise was widespread, for example coming from price increases for food and for second-hand cars, where there are reports of increased demand. ""Some of the increase is from temporary effects, for example, rising fuel prices which continue to increase inflation, but much of this is due to prices recovering from lows earlier in the pandemic. ""An increase in prices for clothing and footwear, compared with the normal seasonal pattern of summer sales, also added to the upward pressure this month."" Why Covid has jacked up used car prices Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, an older measure that is still used to calculate certain cost-of-living increases, rose to 3.9% in June, from 3.3% in May. The latest rise in the inflation rate will add to pressure on the Bank of England to consider increasing interest rates to cool the economy. The Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has taken the view that the current inflation surge is ""transitory"" and will fall back after peaking at 3%. But the Bank's departing chief economist,Andy Haldane, warned last monththat the risk of high inflation was ""rising fast"" and could reach nearly 4% this year. Inflation is up again, above target, with prices rising faster than expected across the board in June. Much of this is the result of comparisons with prices that were falling a year ago at the height of the lockdown. Bottlenecks in supply are also driving prices up. For example, car producers can not find microchips, so cannot build enough new cars, so used car prices went up 4.4% in a month. During the pandemic, the microchip market diverted its supply to electronics amid a slump in car sales. There are plenty of examples like this, and the net result is that inflation is heading above 3% in the coming months. This is sufficiently above target to trigger a letter of explanation from the governor of the Bank of England to the chancellor, but don't expect immediate rises in interest rates. Inflation should peak at this level before falling back to normal, as the economy further reopens. It is, right now, high and rising, but hardly out of control. And the reasons for this global rise are pretty clear: demand rebounding quickly after the pandemic, while supply is taking a little longer to ramp back up. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sided with the MPC majority view that inflation was likely to reach 3%, but not much higher. Interest rates would therefore remain at the current record low of 0.1% ""throughout next year"", he said. Inflation would ""ease quickly in 2022"", returning to the Bank's 2% target ""in the second half of next year"", he forecast. However, Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, took Mr Haldane's view that inflation could peak as high as 4% at the end of this year. ""We expect it to continue its upward trend over the summer,"" she told the BBC. ""That's largely because of these global supply shortages which have become more acute. ""Of course, that's affected everything from semi-conductors to household appliances."" Traders in Willesden Market in north-west London interviewed by the BBC said they were feeling the effects of those supply shortages, with their wholesale costs going up sharply. However, they added that they were finding it difficult to pass on those costs to their customers, who were unwilling or unable to pay more. One trader said: ""If you try to pass the costs on to the customers, they just don't buy it. Especially at the moment. ""No-one's got any money, everyone's skint, everyone's coming back out of lockdown, people have lost their jobs. ""I'm earning less, but I'm still going, so I can be thankful for that at the moment."" Why are prices rising in the UK?

"This video can not be played Government proposals on the legacy of the past will ""draw a line under the Troubles"" - PM The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly. Some victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals. However, Mr Lewis said it was ""the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation"". In his Commons statement, he outlined a ""statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents"". It is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries. A statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. The plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. The government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts. This video can not be played ""A painful recognition of where we are"" - NI Secretary Brandon Lewis Mr Lewis said: ""We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly.

It is not expected Mr Drakeford will move as fast as the UK government, with Boris Johnson planning toscrap most rules in Englandon 19 July. The Scottish government is hoping it can lift most legal restrictions on 9 August, but has said it will keeplaws on the use of face masksfor some time. Despite rising cases in Wales, officials believe the vaccination programme has weakened the link between catching Covid, serious illness and death. Wales moving to 'increasing normality' on Covid People will still have to wear face masks in Wales Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Mr Drakeford's cabinet will make the final decision on Wednesday morning, with a statement to the Welsh Parliament expected in the afternoon. He is expected to confirm whether Wales can now move to ""alert level one"" - with the easing of some restrictions that had been delayed because of the Delta variant. They included the reopening of ice rinks and allowing six people from any household to meet in private homes. He is also expected to publish an updated coronavirus control plan which will set out a future alert level zero, with fewer legal restrictions. But this is not expected to be implemented immediately, with the next three-weekly review not due until early August. Taliesin fears his competitors in England are gaining an advantage as rinks remain closed in Wales Thirteen-year-old Taliesin has not been able to train at Ice Arena Wales in Cardiff since the pandemic hit. His parents have been taking him to Coventry or Sheffield to train on weekends, sometimes setting off at 03:00 BST. His mother Ann-Marie said: ""It's been really, really challengingâ¦ it has been a difficult time to keep momentum up and keep trainingâ¦ it's a big commitment financially and in terms of time and pressure."" ""With competitions coming back now we really need the rink in Cardiff opened more than ever because other people are going to start getting an advantage over us being able to train when we can only go up on the weekend,"" Taliesin toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. Ministers have already announced they willkeep laws requiring face masks on public transportand in health and social care. They are also deciding if they should be mandatory in shops, a move backed by trade unions and Plaid Cymru. Wales' case rate on Tuesday stood at 138.2 per 100,000 people, with the number of positive tests running at an average of 623 a day. That compares with 466 a day the week before, and about 77 a day a month ago. But officials say the link between cases and serious illness and death has been weakened. At the start of July, only 1.1% of Covid cases were admitted to hospital. The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called for a ""detailed plan for the restoration of freedoms in Wales"". ""Given the data trends, the Welsh Labour government now has the flexibility to provide families, workers and businesses with their plan for restoring all freedoms and releasing restrictions in Wales,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth criticised the Welsh government's plans for a press conference on Wednesday evening, saying it would clash with a debate in the Senedd calling for a Wales-only public inquiry into ministers' handling of the Covid pandemic. ""Throughout the pandemic, we've seen announcement after announcement made by press release, rather than in our Parliament where proper scrutiny can take place. Sadly, here's another example of a government snub,"" he said. The hospitality sector has called for social-distancing rules to be relaxed Although most businesses are now allowed to trade, under current restrictions they must do so under social-distancing laws. These apply to pubs, cafes and restaurants andthe sector has lobbied for them to be scrapped. Nightclubs remain closed in Wales, while organisers of large events are waiting to find out if they can take place. Legal limits on numbers that can meet outdoors remain in Wales, while meetings in private homes are currently restricted to those who are in extended household groups.

"Letting small family farms go to the wall will ""break the backbone of Britain's rural communities"", Prince Charles has said. The focus on producing plentiful and cheap food threatens the survival of the country's smaller farms, he says. If they go it will ""rip the heart out of the British countryside"", he warns. The government says it wants to support all farmers and ""the choices that they take on their own holdings"". It comes ahead of the publication of the National Food Strategy, the first major review of Britain's food system in more than 70 years. The strategy was commissioned by the government and is headed by Henry Dimbleby, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain. Thursday's report will explore the links between food production and environmental degradation including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and the sustainable use of resources. It will include recommendations for the government, which has promised to respond with a White Paper within six months. 'Once-in-a-lifetime' chance for sustainable food Unhealthy diets are âslow-motion disasterâ The first part of the strategy was published in July last year and highlighted the connection between obesity, poverty and the UK's high Covid-19 death toll. The Prince of Wales has been concerned with food and the environment for most of his adult life. His latest intervention comes in the form of an essay forRadio 4's Today programme. In it, he condemns the super-efficient intensive agricultural system that produces much of the food we eat as a ""dead end"". He describes how, over the years, he has watched with increasing concern as many of the nation's ""precious landscapes"" have been slowly diminished in the name of ""efficiency"". We don't take account of what he calls the ""hidden costs"" of modern industrial farming, warns the prince. He cites damage to soils and watercourses and the emissions that add to global warming. ""We must put nature back at the heart of the equation"", he urges, or we risk undermining the true source of all our prosperity - nature. ""How we produce food has a direct impact on the Earth's capacity to sustain us, which has a direct impact on human health and economic prosperity,"" he says. He does find some cause for optimism, however. He says he is increasingly confident we can achieve a transition to more sustainable forms of agriculture and praises the efforts of high-profile figures including footballer Marcus Rashford, chef Jamie Oliver and Henry Dimbleby to improve the nation's food system from ""field to fork"". He describes visiting a new centre for farm and food education in the Cotswolds which aims to produce healthy food in an environmentally-friendly and economically-viable way. There are promising investment opportunities in these kind of innovative approaches to agriculture, he believes, and he says he is working to link private investors with the pioneers of these new sustainable approaches to farming. A particular concern is improving soil health and fertility. ""If we regenerate degraded soils around the world, we could capture as much as 70% of the world's carbon emissions,"" the Prince suggests. ""Only by benefitting nature can we benefit people,"" concludes the Prince. And that is the only way of ensuring the future of our living planet, he says. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said new environmental land management schemes would ""support farmers to produce high quality food in a more sustainable way, and deliver the environmental change that we all want to see"". ""Our new system will be centred around incentivising sustainable farming practices alongside profitable food production and rewarding farmers for producing public goods such as better air and water quality, protecting wildlife and soil health,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We want to support all of our farmers, and the choices that they take on their own holdings. We have recently set out further details of theSustainable Farming Incentive,external, which will eventually be open to every farmer in England.""

"Five of England's metro mayors call for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after rules change on Monday Face coverings will stay compulsory in areas they have control over, like Manchester's trams and West Yorkshire bus stations They will also be compulsory on London's transport network after England's restrictions ease on 19 July Masks will no longer be a legal requirement in England from Monday but you have to wear them on transport in Scotland and Wales The Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca move onto the government's amber travel list It means from Monday, those not double-jabbed or under 18 have to quarantine on their return A further 42,302 Covid cases are reported across the UK and another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Two thirds of UK adults have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus Most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - will be scrapped from 7 August if coronavirus rates allow Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by George Bowden, Chris Clayton, Robert Greenall, Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Wright and Claire Heald. Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Here's a recap of the day's main stories in the UK: Protests have taken place in Paris We're wrapping up our coverage for the day, thank you for joining us. Here is a round-up of the biggest developments from around the world today: The government hasconfirmed nearly all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England will be lifted on 19 July. It means all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed. The legal requirement to wear face masks in some public spaces will be dropped, nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, and limits on how many people can meet will be ditched. Several countries around the world have already tried easing their coronavirus restrictions this year - with mixed results. So what has happened in places where rules have been relaxed? Read more here. Senegal is experiencing an
""unprecedented"" surge in Covid infections, the health
ministry has warned. The country hit a new daily record
of 733 cases on Wednesday. The previous record was 529 cases on Sunday. Senegal has avoided the worst of the pandemic so far, but is struggling with its vaccine rollout. ""The situation is unprecedented. We have never seen such an
increase in cases,"" says health ministry spokesman Mamadou
Ndiaye. Measures must be taken urgently to reverse the trend ahead of Eid al-Adha - a Muslim holiday that will be celebrated next week - Ndiaye says. The holiday is the biggest in Senegal and is usually marked with large family gatherings. There are currently no
measures in place to restrict such events. French police have used tear
gas to disperse a protest against President Emmanuel Macron's
plan to require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR
test to gain entry to bars, restaurants and cinemas from August. Macron has announced new measures to combat a surge in infections. These included the
mandatory vaccination of health workers and new health pass
rules for the wider public. These rules have gone further than most of France's neighbours and some have accused the government of stamping on freedoms. Protesters marched through Paris, with some wearing badges saying ""no to the health pass"", before clashes started. The debate over face coverings is not confined to public transport. Under new advice from House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, masks are compulsory for parliamentary staff from next Monday - but will be optional for MPs as they are not employed by Parliament. Unions say the Speaker could stop those who don't wear a face covering from entering the Commons chamber. From 19 July, the legal requirement to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces in England will be removed. Instead, PM Boris Johnson has said the government ""expects and recommends"" that face coverings are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. Read morehere. Asked whether central government could change its mind on masks on public transport, Tracy Brabin says: ""It does feel to me as though there is going to be a shift."" As reasoning, she says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps showed support forSadiq Khan's decision to make masks mandatory on London's transport network. No-one would criticise the government if the the PM did change his mind, says Andy Burnham, adding: ""It would help everyone if there was a change of heart at the national level. ""None of us is saying this is going to be easy, we're all trying to act where we can."" The
Balearic Islands ofMajorca,IbizaandMenorcaare to move to the UK's amber travel list just three weeks after quarantine-free travel to the popular destinations was granted. Following a rise in local cases, the Spanish islands - which attract millions of UK visitors in a normal year - will move to the amber list from 04:00 BST on Monday 19 July. TheBritish Virgin Islandswill also move to the amber list at the same time. Meanwhile,BulgariaandHong Kongwill move to the green list, meaning no arrivals need to quarantine, andCroatiaandTaiwanmove to the
green watchlist, putting travellers on notice of potential future changes. Cuba,Indonesia,MyanmarandSierra Leonewill be moved to the red list, with arrivals required to carry out their quarantine in a government-run hotel at a cost of Â£1,750 per adult. The announcement applies to England, but the other UK nations are expected to follow suit. Separate changes to the travel list system mean that, from Monday and in England, Scotland and Wales, those who are fully vaccinated can avoid quarantining at home on their return from an amber country. Returning to the metro mayor's press conference, West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is asked whether it is fair to ask transport staff to enforce mask-wearing when it is not a legal requirement. She says she doesn't want to put staff in a difficult position, and can't fine people who refuse. It is a matter of persuasion and encouragement, she says. Bus operators are going to be ""strongly encouraging"" passengers to wear masks on buses, she adds, but it will not be mandatory. Brabin goes on to say doesn't want to put staff in a vulnerable position and if people don't want to wear one, then ultimately they won't. Meanwhile, speaking in the House of Commons, in Westminster, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warns current Covid hospital admissions ""have increased to over 500 a day, up 50% in a week"", with waiting lists at their ""highest level seen on record, currently at 5.3 million"". During a debate on a new Health and Care Bill in England, he said the planned ""top down reorganisation"" is coming ""when we are not even through the pandemic"". He described the proposals as a ""Trojan horse to hide a power grab"" by ministers, with patients ""treated like ghosts in the machine"". Previously the government said the planned changes would mean a focus ""on the health of the population, not just the health of patients"". The shake-up will see the law changed to reverse reforms of the NHS in England introduced under Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012. Read more about themhere. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is asked what changed his mind about calling for masks on public transport, after initially suggesting he would not call for such a move. ""When we originally looked at it, I did say I thought this was going to be difficult to do but you do the job [well] if you're listening to people,"" he says. Burnham adds he has been ""inundated with messages"" from vulnerable people saying 19 July is ""fear day"" for them, not ""freedom day"". ""I've been hearing their voices loud and clear,"" he says He mentions the guidance for vulnerable people, which tells them to avoid those who have not been vaccinated, and questions what an unvaccinated person is supposed to look like? If things go on as they are, people will feel they can't go out ""and that's not right"", says Burnham. Liverpool mayor Steve Rotherham says, unlike Sadiq Khan, he does not have the power to make masks mandatory. However, he says he will be asking all transport operators in his constituency to enforce mask-wearing on their services. ""I'll be asking all of them... to do the right thing,"" he says. ""I don't think we can put a price on public safety."" Wearing face masks ""costs nothing"" and they are a ""minor inconvenience"", he adds. Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis and West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin say they will make masks mandatory at the bus stations within their control, but like Burnham and Rotherham, say they do not have the power to make them a requirement across all public transport. West of England Mayor Dan Norris says he has no power to make masks mandatory but he has written to the prime minister to complain about the ""ridiculous"" decision not to enforce mask wearing on public transport. He adds he is calling on people in the West of England to wear masks when they travel. Mayors across England have together called for face masks to remain in use on public transport even after the legal requirement for them ends on Monday. Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, West Yorkshire's Tracy Brabin, Liverpool City Region's Steve Rotheram, North of Tyne's Jamie Driscoll, Dan Jarvis in the Sheffield City Region and the West of England's Dan Norris are holding a joint press conference. Burnham says the people of Greater Manchester should ""work with us"" to protect each other and supporting members of the community who may be concerned by the end of mandatory mask rules. Masks will stay compulsory on Manchester's Metrolink tram services and at West Yorkshire bus stations, for example. They are places the metro mayors have powers over. It comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khandeclared masks mandatoryon the capital's public transport network even after 19 July, and West Midlands Mayor Andy Street said he isexpecting local passengers to wear them on all forms of transport.,external You can read more aboutwhich rules are changing on Monday here. The US State Department is ""surging"" staffing levels to address a backlog of as many as two million passport applications due to the pandemic. Americans have been left waiting between 12 and 18 weeks for new passports,
an official tells the Reuters news agency. Rachel Arndt, deputy assistant secretary for passport services in the department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, says the availability of vaccinations in the US has led to many more than usual applying for
passports to travel overseas. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Dr Catherine Monaghan, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the University Hospital of North Tees, has worked all through the pandemic's first and second waves and now is facing up to the bleak reality of a third Covid surge. ""We are absolutely gutted - it's really hard - I know the whole country wants this to be over - but the reality is that's not what is happening in the hospital,"" she said. ""People are still critically unwell with it - I cannot quite believe we're back at this stage again - it's really worrying."" And now nurses are donning their high-grade PPE once more. Dr Monaghan's hospital, in Stockton-on-Tees, currently has 22 Covid patients, five of whom are in intensive care. That is a lot less than the peak in January - but the number has increased sharply from just six in a single week. Read more from Hughhere. A further 42,302 new Covid cases have been reported across the UK, alongside another 49 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 46 million people have now received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, with more than 35 million now fully vaccinated, government figures showed. Boom Village was going to be held on the same site as the already-cancelled Boomtown A scaled-down version of the Boomtown music festival has been cancelled because of escalating cases of Covid, the event's organisers have said. Boom Village was due to be hosted at the Matterley Estate, near Winchester, between 11 and 15 August. It was designed to be a smaller event than the usual Boomtown festival, which hadalready been cancelled. Organisers say they appreciate the decision might seem confusing given theimminent lifting of Covid restrictions. Astatement on the Boomtown website,externalsays the risk of widespread illness and self-isolation would result in them not having enough people to safely deliver the event. ""The core decision is due to the escalating cases of Covid-19 across the country,"" it adds. Ticket holders have been promised refunds and the full Boomtown festival is expected to return in 2022.

Face masks will still be required in shops after 7 August Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford says the prevalence of Covid-19 in Wales will remain ""extremely high for at least the rest of this summer"". This is based on warnings from the Welsh government's technical advisory group, he says. He tells the Senedd that the Delta variant is in every part of Wales and ""spreading quickly"". ""There can be no doubt that we are experiencing the anticipated third wave of this pandemic, with the rate in Wales rising overnight to 145 cases per 100,000 people,"" Drakeford says. It comes as most Covid rules in Wales - but not all - are set to be scrapped from 7 August. Nightclubs are set to resume trading, and social-distancing laws inside will be replaced with a requirement for workplaces to assess the risk. But face masks will still be required in most indoor public places, except in hospitality businesses, such as pubs and restaurants, or schools. You can read more about the changing rules in Wales here. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News With two out of three UK adults now fully vaccinated against
Covid, the UK is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world - but many
challenges still remain. The spread of the Delta variant and a sharp rise in cases as
restrictions are lifted means vaccinating as many people as possible before the
onset of autumn is now urgent. A third of adults, mostly people in their 20s and 30s, are not yet
fully protected. But there are other communities where uptake is low, for example
some ethnic minorities, particularly people from black backgrounds, those
living in some poorer areas and working in certain jobs, who have not yet been
jabbed. Convincing them to come forward and get a vaccine will help
increase the height of the wall of immunity which is going to help hold back
the tide of hospital admissions come the winter. Every adult in England has been offered at least one dose, but
only 87% have had one. That gives an indication of the scale of challenge
ahead. Even with one of the fastest vaccination programmes on the planet,
the UK is not out of the woods yet. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.1530205e-05
"This video can not be played Masih Alinejad: I got furious instead of just being scared Four Iranian intelligence officials have been charged with plotting to kidnap a New York-based journalist critical of Iran, US prosecutors say. The indictment did not name the target, but Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-American author and activist, says it was her. The conspirators, who all live in Iran and remain at large, also allegedly plotted to lure a person in the UK and three others in Canada to Iran. Iran's government said the allegations were ""ridiculous and baseless"". The US justice department says the Iranian officials sought to lure the New York-based journalist to a third country where the abduction was planned. ""To he honest, emotionally I got angry. I got furious. Instead of just being scared it made me furious,"" Ms Alinejad told BBC News, describing how FBI agents came to her home to tell her that she was ""not safe"". The plotters even offered money to the writer's relatives in Iran to betray them, which they refused to do,the indictment contends,external. They hired private investigators to spy on the target's Brooklyn home and family, and set up a live video feed of the property. They also researched a service offering military-style speedboats for evacuation from New York City, and maritime routes to Venezuela, an ally of Iran. ""I told myself that for years and years the government tried to create fear inside the society, tried to scare us,"" Ms Alinejad told BBC World TV on Wednesday. ""But this is the time that actually the government of Iran, the whole intelligence services of Iran are scared of me."" The intelligence officials worked to procure surveillance of the four people targeted in Canada and the UK, according to the indictment. Allow Twitter content?

She runs the My Stealthy Freedom and White Wednesdays campaignsagainst the mandatory wearing of headscarves for Iranian women. Addressing the indictment on TV on Tuesday,external, she said: ""Initially, I naturally felt shocked. Then I got worried... Then I thought about it: we have been scared of the Islamic regime for a lifetime. But now the Islamic regime is scared of me."" The indictment says the Iranian officials were aided by an Iranian resident of California, Niloufar Bahadorifar. She was arrested this month and charged with providing financial aid to the conspirators and violating sanctions against Iran. She has pleaded not guilty. William Sweeney, the head of New York's FBI office, said it sounded a bit like ""some far-fetched movie plot"". Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Wednesday that such ""Hollywood scenarios"" were ""nothing unexpected from America"". In 2019, the Paris-based dissident journalist Ruhollah Zam was enticed by Iranian agents to travel to Iraq, where he was kidnapped and taken to Iran.

"This video can not be played Government proposals on the legacy of the past will ""draw a line under the Troubles"" - PM The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly. Some victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals. However, Mr Lewis said it was ""the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation"". In his Commons statement, he outlined a ""statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents"". It is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries. A statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. The plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. The government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts. This video can not be played ""A painful recognition of where we are"" - NI Secretary Brandon Lewis Mr Lewis said: ""We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly. ""But we have arrived at the view that this would be the best way to facilitate an effective information retrieval and provision process, and the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation. ""It is a painful recognition of the reality of where we are."" Political reaction to PM's Troubles prosecutions plan Mr Lewis said that the proposals also include a body to help families recover information on Troubles incidents and an oral history initiative. ""Ongoing litigation processes often fail to deliver for families and victims, and their continued presence in a society which is trying to heal from the wounds of its past risks preventing it being able to move forward,"" he said. In terms of ""drawing a line"", this is incredibly far-reaching. It goes beyond a ban on Troubles-era prosecutions, of which there have been just nine in the past six years. Ending legacy inquests and civil actions is arguably of greater impact when you consider the figures. Currently, there around 36 inquests relating to the Troubles due to be heard. Many of these relate to killings by the Army and police. Alongside this, there are more than 1,000 civil claims lodged against the Ministry of Defence and other state agencies. The government is proposing all this is closed down in a new approach which is sweeping in scope. However, the opposition is loud. The Irish government says it is not a fait accompli or a done deal. But with a big majority at Westminster, the government has set off in a direction of travel which few predict will be reversed. Northern Ireland's five main political parties, the Irish government and several victims' groups have been highly critical of any suggested blanket ban on prosecutions for Troubles-era offences. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said a meeting of the Stormont Party Leaders Forum is expected to take place with Mr Lewis on Friday. He said he hoped the parties would use it to express their joint opposition to the proposals. Earlier, the prime minister defended the government's plans as ""measured and balanced"". Boris Johnson told MPs: ""The sad fact remains that there are many members of the armed services who continue to face the threat of vexatious prosecutions well into their 70s and 80s. ""We are finally bringing forward a solution to this problem, to enable the people of Northern Ireland to draw a line under the Troubles and to enable the people of Northern Ireland to move forward."" A statute of limitations would end all prosecutions in Troubles-related cases Prior to the announcement, Northern Ireland's largest cross-community victims' group, Wave, said ""victims and survivors should not be treated this way"". It added that if Mr Lewis ""is serious about effectively dealing with legacy he must talk to those most impacted by pain and trauma"". Reports that the secretary of state was to announce a plan to end Troubles prosecutions also angered relatives of the1974 Birmingham pub bombings. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, was among 21 people killed in the IRA bomb attacks, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to protest against the reported proposal. ""At what point did your government lose all sight of its moral, ethical and judicial backbone?â¯,"" Ms Hambleton's letter asks. Two IRA bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town in Birmingham in November 1974 John Teggart, whose father Danny was one of the victims of the Ballymurphy shootings in 1971, said the proposals were a ""slap in the face"" for victims. ""It dances on the graves of all our loved ones and all those who affected in the conflict,"" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra. Serena Hamilton, whose father Cpl David Graham was an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier killed by the IRA in Coalisland, County Tyrone, in 1977, said she was ""absolutely disgusted"". ""How can you move forward when you haven't got justice in the first place for such heinous crimes that happened to the likes of my father?,"" she asked on Evening Extra. Lord Dannatt, a former Army chief, who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said the proposals represented the ""least worst option"" and offered families a way to get answers about what happened. ""There is now a mechanism where questions can be asked, facts can be ascertained and they will be able to get some degree of closure in knowing what happened because the people answering those questions, whether they're paramilitaries or retired soldiers, will be able to answer those questions truthfully and honestly without the fear of being prosecuted and dragged through the courts."" Amnesty International rejected the proposals as showing an ""appalling and offensive disregard for victims"". Its Northern Ireland campaign manager, Grainne Teggart, said: ""Many victims are having their worst fears realised in these proposals, the government is closing down paths to justice."" Ian Simpson, from the Northern Ireland Veterans' Association, said ""today is a shameful day"". He continued: ""Today, the veterans and innocent victims have been betrayed to the uttermost by Boris Johnson and the British government. ""People who held the line in Northern Ireland, who gave us peace in Northern Ireland, have been put on a pedestal with terrorists, people who went out on a daily basis to murder and to maim."" The government statement followed significant recent developments in a number of high-profile Troubles prosecution cases. In May,two former paratroopers were acquitted of the 1972 murder of Official IRA man Joe McCann after their trial collapseddue to the inadmissibility of prosecution evidence. Joe McCann was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972 Both soldiers had been interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case. But the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible and as the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) did not appeal against that decision, the case could not proceed. Then, earlier this month, the McCann murder trial collapse had implications for two other high-profile cases - the Bloody Sunday trial and the prosecution for the murder of 15-year-old Daniel Hegarty. What happened on Bloody Sunday? Why did prosecutors drop cases against ex-soldiers? The PPS met the families of Daniel Hegarty and two men killed on Bloody Sunday to explain that given ""related evidential features"" to the McCann case, prosecutors no longer believed there was a reasonable prospect that key evidence against the soldiers accused of their loved one's murders would be ruled admissible. The Bloody Sunday case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but instead it was adjourned following a legal challenge by a brother of one of the men shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

"Police were out in force on Tuesday after the unrest across Cuba One man has died in Cuba and more than 140 have been arrested or reported as missing during rare demonstrations against its Communist government. Diubis Laurencio Tejeda, 36, died in a suburb of Havana on Monday during a clash between protesters and police. Cuba's interior ministry did not say what the cause of death was but alleged he was part of a group that attacked a government facility. However, witnesses said security forces had attacked the protesters. State media said Mr Tejeda had been involved in ""disturbances"" in the La GÃ¼inera neighbourhood of Havana on Monday, where a group allegedly attacked a government facility. ANALYSIS: 'Every day worse': Cubans' anger was there to see EXPLAINER: Three key issues that explain Cuba's rare protests FEATURE: Internet sheds light on Cuba anger - until it goes dark It reported that several others had been injured, including members of the security forces. In a statement on Tuesday, the interior ministry accused demonstrators of vandalism, setting fires and attacking police and civilians. But witnesses have said the security forces attacked peaceful protesters who joined a spontaneous demonstration in the neighbourhood. Waldo Herrera, who lives in the area, told Reuters news agency officers had drawn their guns and started shooting at the demonstrators. ""I think the Communists have lost control, they won't have a solution to this situation,"" he said. Data journalism site Inventario recorded more than 40 protests on Sunday. Such unauthorised public gatherings are illegal in Cuba and the security forces took swift action. On Tuesday, the police were out in force on the streets. Amnesty International says at least 140 Cubans have either been detained or their whereabouts are unknown, with relatives fearing they are being held at undisclosed locations. ""They took my daughter yesterday and I have no news of her,"" one woman outside a police station in Havana told the Agence France Press news agency on Tuesday. The rare anti-government demonstrations began on Sunday, when thousands took to the streets in protest over food and medicine shortages, price hikes and the government's handling of Covid-19. The unrest began with a demonstration in the city of San Antonio de los BaÃ±os, south-west of Havana, but soon spread throughout the country. This video can not be played Thousands took to the streets in protest over the government's handling of coronavirus and the economy Posts on social media showed people overturning police cars and looting state-owned shops that price their goods in foreign currencies. For many Cubans, these shops are the only way they can buy basic necessities but prices are high. President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel has called the demonstrators ""counter-revolutionaries"". His government blamed the United States, and its economic sanctions, for both the protests and Cuba's wider problems. US sanctions have restricted trade with Cuba since 1962. They were tightened under former US President Donald Trump, who also imposed sanctions on Venezuela, which is Cuba's main supplier of oil. Cuba's foreign minister called it a ""policy of economic suffocation to provoke social unrest in the country"". But the White House said that Cubans had suffered ""decades of repression"". Speaking on Monday, President Joe Biden said the US ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights"".
