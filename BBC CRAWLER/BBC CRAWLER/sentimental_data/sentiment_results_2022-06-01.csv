"One of Boris Johnson's strongest cabinet allies has hit out out Tory MPs trying to oust him, accusing them of doing ""the opposition's work"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries claimed growing calls for the PM to resign were the result of a ""co-ordinated campaign"" by backbenchers. Criticism of Mr Johnson among Tory MPs has increased since Sue Gray's Partygate report last week. But Ms Dorries said the ""overwhelming"" majority still backed him. Twelve Conservative MPs have called on Mr Johnson to quit since the release of Ms Gray's report laid bare the scale of Covid rule-breaking in No 10. It takes the number now openly calling on him to resign to 28. Most of have written letters of no confidence in him, although the total number formally calling for a contest may be higher. Mr Johnson has dismissed calls for him to quit, adding it would not be ""responsible right now given everything that's going on"". Who are the Tory MPs calling on Johnson to go? How could Boris Johnson be voted out by Tory MPs? Explain why partygate did not breach code, PM told Under Tory party rules, 54 letters are required to set up a vote on the PM's position, a move which could eventually lead to a contest to replace him. Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench committee that organises leadership contests, knows exactly how many have been submitted. Nadine Dorries is urging Tory MPs to unite behind the prime minister Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One,external, Ms Dorries said the debate over Partygate had become a ""Westminster bubble issue"" and the public was ""ready to move on"". ""There is obviously, I think probably led by one or two individuals, a campaign behind the scenes to try, attempt to remove the prime minister for individual reasons to do with personal ambition or other reasons,"" she said. She added: ""The people who most want to get rid of Boris Johnson are Keir Starmer and the SNP"". ""I would just ask my colleagues to reflect on that, and do we really want to do the opposition's work - and do we really believe the public will vote for a party that they think is divided?"" Home Secretary Priti Patel has also backed the prime minister, telling Conservative MPs who want to remove him to ""forget it"", BBC political correspondent Helen Catt reports. Ms Patel told the Daily Mail that writing letters of no confidence was a ""sideshow"" and warned that the public ""wouldn't thank the Conservative Party for talking about itself at a time when people had anxieties, concerns [and] apprehensions"". She also warned colleagues against overshadowing the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, saying ""all the focus"" this weekend should be on the Queen and her ""long-standing dedicated service"". Despite the uncertainty over the number of no-confidence letters, there has been mounting speculation Mr Johnson could face a no-confidence vote soon. On Monday, former Tory leader Lord Hague said the PM was in ""real trouble"" and predicted a vote could take place as early as next week, when MPs return from their short early summer recess. But speaking earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab told Sky News he doubted the number of letters could be ""that high"". There is no consensus among Tory MPs about who should be their next leader, but Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat are among those being discussed as possible challengers. Chancellor Rishi Sunak was widely seen as a potential leadership rival to the PM, but his prospects are thought to have waned after he picked up his own Partygate fine and was embroiled in acontroversy over his wife's financesearlier this year. There's no obvious thread linking the MPs that have publicly called on the prime minister to go. Some of the calls have come in quick succession, others months apart. They've come from MPs elected in different years, with different ideologies. Some of them backed Boris Johnson at the last Tory leadership contest, others backed his rivals. Some Tory MPs are convinced there is a degree of co-ordination behind closed doors. One senior Tory told me he believes supporters of Jeremy Hunt are among those being particularly critical publicly. Others attribute the steady drip-drip of letters in recent days to a ripple effect. As soon as a few critical MPs came out publicly, they argue, others felt emboldened to do the same. Co-ordination or not, there is no doubt MPs do talk to each other - there are Whatsapp groups and sub-Whatsapp groups of Tory MPs. Even before Sue Gray's report came out, I was told the tea rooms of Westminster were alive with chatter about who was ""ready to move"". Some of that chatter has been more muted as MPs are out of office for recess - with some arguing the Jubilee weekend is not the time for ""internal warfare"". But that could all liven up again quite quickly when they return next week. Meanwhile, the debate over the PM's future has been given fresh impetus after his standards adviser Lord Geidt called on him to explain how his own Partygate fine tallied with the rulebook for ministers, which says they have a duty to comply with the law. Along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson was fined for attending a birthday party for him in the Cabinet Room in June 2020. In a report on Monday,external, Lord Geidt wrote there was a ""legitimate question"" over whether this constituted a breach of the ministerial code. In a written reply, Mr Johnson said he had not fallen foul of the code because he had not broken Covid laws on purpose. In an interview with Mumsnet on Tuesday, the prime minister insisted he thought the gathering in the Cabinet Room counted as a work event, and he was ""very, very surprised"" and ""taken aback"" to have received a fine. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the prime minister of ignoring Lord Geidt's advice, and finding himself innocent of breaching ministerial rules in ""his own courtroom"". Adding that Mr Johnson was ""dodging questions"", she called for him to ""make a statement"" on his ""apparent breach"" of the rules. For the SNP, MP Mhairi Black called on Scotland's six Tory MPs to ""step up and do the right thing"" and submit no-confidence letters in ""this Partygate prime minister"".

"Gas costs about Â£2 per therm SSE Airtricity has announced a 42.7% increase in gas prices from 1 July - a move which will hit 186,000 customers in Northern Ireland. It comes on top of a 33% hike in the company's electricity prices which came into effect on Wednesday. The Consumer Council said the gas price increase would mean an additional Â£1.02 per day onto the typical household bill. This is the company's fourth increase in gas prices in just 15 months. It follows a39% rise in April 2022, a 21.8% rise in October 2021 and a 9.8% rise in April 2021. Huge increases in the wholesale cost of gas are the main reason for the increases as wholesale costs make up about half of the typical household bill. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager (NI), said this was ""not the news our customers want to hear"". ""The cost of purchasing natural gas has remained at its highest level in over a decade and at times in recent months, it has hit record highs,"" he said. ""We would encourage any customer who is having difficulty with their energy costs to please contact us."" The company said it had also made a Â£1m donation to a local charity to support people struggling with the cost of living. In March 2021, gas cost around 50 pence per therm, that cost has risen to around Â£2 per therm after hitting as high as Â£4.50 per therm late last year. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. The electricity price rise is the second increase in six months According to the Utility Regulator, the average household bill in Northern Ireland was Â£514 in April 2021 - that rose to Â£626 in October 2021, and Â£870 in April 2022. The announcement comes on the same day that a previously announced 33% rise in SSE Airtricity electricity prices comes into effect. The company is Northern Ireland's second largest electricity provider, with about 158,000 domestic customers. It is the second electricity price increase in six months for customers in Northern Ireland following a 9% rise last December. High and volatile prices on global wholesale energy markets are being blamed. The Consumer Council said the latest increase means the SSE standard tariff for electricity credit meter and pay-as-you-go customers would increase by Â£248 to just over Â£1,000 a year. Rival firms have also increased prices. In May, Electric Irelandincreased its prices by 30%, while Budget Irelandraised prices by 27%. Last week, Power NI announced a 27.5% increase to domestic electricity prices from 1 July 2022. This will add Â£204 onto the average annual household bill bringing it to Â£944 a year. Why are energy bills going up? 'Hidden pandemic' of rising cost of living Katie Daly said it felt like all the price increases were happening at once The latest has price hike come as UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise,hit a 40-year high. Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are pushing the cost of living up. Katie Daly told BBC News NI that she felt the Executive was ""letting us down big time"". ""A shop normally costing Â£50 is coming to Â£70, it's a jump when you're a single parent with two kids,"" she said. ""I used to get Â£10 electric on a Monday morning. I think it's about Â£25 a week now, that's over 100% increase. ""On my gas alone, I think I'm spending Â£100 a month. My son has asthma and I need to have heating on for him but the price of that is killing me."" Stephanie Waite said she had not used her gas heating in winter because of the high cost Stephanie Waite is also struggling with increasing power costs. ""I used to be able to be good for Â£20 a week on my electric, but now you're guaranteed about three days, four at best with Â£20,"" she said. ""The gas bills ... I haven't had my heating on over the winter, I bought myself a wee radiator just because it's either food or heating at the minute."" Peter McClenaghan from the Consumer Council, said: ""While price increases are happening due to global reasons it doesn't make it any easier for people to pay their bills, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. ""If you are struggling to pay your bills, the first thing to do is contact your supplier directly for help and information. There are measures that can be put in place."" Carers NI said the increases were putting increasing pressure on carers Craig Harrison from Carers NI said: ""Carers are being hit by the double whammy of pre-existing financial pressures that are just being compounded by these sky-rocketing energy costs."" He said the stress was having ""a massive impact"" on people's health.

"Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company Meta, has announced that she is leaving the business after 14 years. Ms Sandberg announced her departurein a Facebook post,external, saying she hoped to focus on her foundation and philanthropic work in the future. Her departure comes as Meta faces a slowdown in advertising sales and more competition from rivals such as TikTok. Ms Sandberg is one of the most high-profile women in the tech industry. ""When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years,"" wrote Ms Sandberg, known as a powerful second-in-command at the company. ""Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life."" Javier Olivan, currently Meta's chief growth officer, will take over Ms Sandberg's position in the company when she leaves. Ms Sandberg, whose husband died suddenly in 2015, is getting re-married this summer. She said she planned to leave the company in the autumn but would remain on the board. Following her announcement, shares in Meta fell 4%. Ms Sandberg joined Facebook when it was still a small company led by Mark Zuckerberg, a then-23 year-old Harvard dropout. A veteran of Google, she helped turn its advertising business into a profit powerhouse, as the company grew to include Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Last year, the company reported more than $117bn in revenue and said more than 2.8 billion people globally used one of its apps daily. This video can not be played COO of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg on the importance of female success in the workplace Books she wrote, including Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead - which she described as a ""sort of feminist manifesto"" - made her a global celebrity. But her star power faded as the company faced criticism for its handling of personal data in relation to political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and targeted adverts as well as its moderation of social media posts. Ms Sandberg, who was initially responsible for Facebook's response, appeared to acknowledge some of those challenges in her post, writing: ""The debate around social media has changed beyond recognition since those early days."" ""To say it hasn't always been easy is an understatement. But it should be hard,"" she wrote. ""The products we make have a huge impact, so we have the responsibility to build them in a way that protects privacy and keeps people safe."" In his own post, Mr Zuckerberg said Ms Sandberg's departure marked the ""end of an era"", noting that it was ""unusual"" for a business partnership like theirs to last so long. ""Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company,"" he added. ""She created opportunities for millions of people around the world, and she deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today."" He said Mr Olivan's responsibilities would differ from Ms Sandberg's, with Mr Olivan taking on a ""more traditional"" chief operating officer role that was more focused internally and operationally. Meta is facing new challenges as countries tighten social media regulations and iPhone maker Apple changes its privacy rules, hitting the social media firm's targeted ad business. Growth in the number of Facebook users in key markets, such as the US, has been stalled, and it has lost younger users to rivals such as TikTok. Mr Zuckerberg has been pushing the company to invest heavily in virtual and augmented reality platforms, which he sees as driving the firm's next phase of growth. He renamed the company Meta last year in honour of the shift to the ""metaverse"". What is the metaverse? Facebook chief Sandberg: 'Pay women well' How the star of Sheryl Sandberg dimmed Insider principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said Ms Sandberg ""had an enormous impact on Facebook, Meta, and the broader business world"". ""She helped Facebook build a world-class ad-buying platform and develop ground-breaking ad formats, which enabled the company to become the second largest digital ad business in the world behind Google,"" she said. ""However, Facebook also faced huge scandals under her watch, including the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica privacy debacle in 2018, and the Capitol riots that took place after the 2020 election. And in 2022, Meta is facing a slowdown in user growth and ad revenue that is now testing the business foundation that the company was built on. ""The company needs to find a new way forward, and perhaps this was the best time for Sandberg to depart.""

"Payton Gendron drove hundreds of kilometres to Buffalo, New York The teenage gunman accused of shooting 10 people dead in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, last month has been charged with domestic terrorism. Prosecutors allege 18-year-old Payton Gendron, who earlier pleaded not guilty, was motivated by racial hatred. The suspect, who describes himself as a white supremacist, is accused of shooting 13 people in total during the massacre - almost all of them black. He will also face 10 separate first-degree murder charges. The domestic terrorism charge filed on Wednesday accuses the suspect of killing ""because of the perceived race and/or colour"" of his victims. In addition, the 25-count indictment includes multiple murder charges and attempted murder as hate crimes, as well as weapon possession charges, news agency AFP reports. Ten killed in racially motivated attack at US store America's gun culture - in seven charts Ten people were killed and three injured in the May 14 shooting, when the suspect is accused of having driven more than 320km (200 miles) to a predominantly black neighbourhood in Buffalo, New York's second-largest city. After the attack, Mayor Byron Brown said the suspect had travelled there with the specific intention of ending ""as many black lives as possible"". An 180-page document seemingly authored by the alleged attacker has since emerged, in which he describes himself as a fascist and a white supremacist. The gunman, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at the city's Tops Friendly Market and began livestreaming the shooting spree. A security guard fired several shots at the attacker, but police said he was protected by a bulletproof vest. The gunman is accused of killing the guard before continuing his attack. All of the 10 people who were killed were black. Among those shot dead, who ranged in age from 32 to 86, were a man buying cupcakes for his son's birthday and a woman who had gone shopping after visiting her husband at a nursing home. Separately,New York state's top prosecutor is investigating whether social media companies enabled the attackby allowing it to be streamed, promoted, or planned over their platforms. ""The fact that an individual can post detailed plans to commit such an act of hate without consequence, and then stream it for the world to see is bone-chilling and unfathomable,"" Attorney General Letitia James said. Twitch, the website where the attack was streamed, said the video was taken down less than two minutes after the violence began - but not before it was duplicated and shared on other streaming sites. Platforms' Buffalo attack action called inadequate How Buffalo fits the new pattern of far-right terror The United States is currently experiencing an epidemic of gun-related violence, withdata from the CDC,externalsuggesting that 54 people are killed each day by a firearm. Just 10 days after the attack in Buffalo, a different 18-year-old gunman wielding the same AR-15 style assault riflestormed a primary school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two adults. Speaking after the Uvalde attack, US President Joe Biden called on American lawmakers to pass ""common-sense"" gun laws. ""What in God's name do you need an assault weapon for except to kill someone?"" he asked. ""We have to make it clear to every elected official in this country: It's time to act."" Democratic politicians are pushing for tighter restrictions on firearms and are currently weighing up what national reforms to put to Congress - including bans on certain types of weapons or further restrictions on who can buy guns. According to US politics website The Hill, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday that an assault weapon ban was being considered too. But given how few Republicans lawmakers are open to new gun legislation it will be a long shot for Senate Democrats to get the 60 votes they effectively need to turn an assault weapons ban into law.

Arsenal were flying high, looking likely to close in on Liverpool's current dominance while Manchester United had the aura of a club praying for the intervention of Saint Jude - the patron saint of lost causes or impossible hope. Manchester United may have only drawn againstLiverpoolandArsenal, before scraping through in Sunday's penalty shootout, but that upward trajectory suddenly looks much more possible. âIt is early days for United fans to proclaim a resurrection but there are grounds for hope. They currently look like a coherent group. They have rediscovered how to toil at an acceptable rate and the desire that has been sadly lacking for a very long time is creeping back. âAmorim has managed to make them believe they can be competitive. It may be that the new shape and his tactics are beginning to pay off or it may be that he has got inside their heads better than any other manager or indeed sports psychologist has. âMaybe he just made it clear that if you are willing to put in the hard yards, you will get rewards. It may sound harsh, but some players have been conspicuous by their absence in the past two impressive performances. Fabulous pros and world-class players in their time, neither Casemiro nor Christian Eriksen made it on to the field for a minute. Sadly, the now lacklustre Marcus Rashford has to be added to this group. They do not appear to have the 'legs' needed for the top echelons and the manager has made his decision. Eriksen can still play a bit part, maybe as one of the two players behind the striker now and again but they are clearly not the future for this coach. âHarsh, maybe even vicious, Amorim outwardly seems a kindly and caring sort, although on this occasion he has made the tough decisions that the heartless world of football has known were needed for quite some time. The changes are paying off. Sign up to read more from Pat Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter Altay Bayindir and Joshua Zirkzee ""epitomised"" what Manchester United are about in the club's FA Cup victory againstArsenal. On the latest episode of BBC Radio Manchester's The Devils' Advocate podcast, Gaz, Kim and Jay spoke about the key role they played as United progressed to the fourth round. BBC Radio Manchester's Gaz Drinkwater said: ""I will openly admit that I said it was a disgrace that [Bayindir] would start this game, purely because it was the FA Cup and an important game. ""Why would you start your back-up keeper? But, [he was] phenomenal."" Jay Motty added: ""He was. The one saving grace for Bayindir was that he made that clanger atSpursand then Andre Onana did something similar a week later. ""It wasn't like you had one goalkeeper who was terrible and another who was flying. Onana has been going through a sticky patch although obviously he's the first-choice goalkeeper. ""You look at players like Bayindir who had a stinker at Spurs and Joshua Zirkzee, who had a section of fans boo him which was just disgraceful. ""To see those players doing well and playing their part in what could be a massive win is great to see. ""It's what Manchester United are about - people writing us off and bouncing back and proving everyone wrong. Those two players epitomised that. ""You use the word redemption for a reason - it did feel like that."" Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds We asked for your thoughts after Tuesday's Premier League game between Brentford and Manchester City, where the Bees came from two goals down to secure a 2-2 draw late on. Here are some of your comments: Brentford fans Theo: A complete performance against one of the best clubs in the world. Very consistent in both halves, defended really well, looked dangerous going forward and battled for every ball. So much effort and pressing from the boys, and we never gave up! Couldn't be prouder of my team. Mitch: I thought we were excellent, but if we'd been a little braver in the first half and played Kevin Schade from the start against a holding midfielder, we'd have won. I never felt we were overly threatened, and if we'd converted our chances... but what a fantastic game! Players were outstanding. Rhys: Incredible night. Amazing performance. It should have been 5-2! Wonderful to watch and great to see Rico Lewis back in the Premier League. Cliff: Super proud of our Brentford team. One of the best games at the Gtech this season and it felt like a win. I can't help but think that City should have completely closed the game down, though - and in previous seasons they would have I'm sure. Anyhow,Liverpoolon Saturday! City fans Pat: Difficult one to take. For most of the game we were solid and controlled the midfield. We scored two very good goals and created numerous chances when we should have put the game to bed. Then we allow two soft goals in the last 10 minutes and drop two more points. But, for me, the game hinged on the decision to bring on Ilkay Gundogan for Mateo Kovacic. It felt wrong, looked wrong and ultimately changed the game. Josh: Much better performance all round but same defensive frailties visible. Nathan Ake can't do it all - Josko Gvardiol and Manuel Akanji are still liabilities defensively. Colin: Frightening to see how low City are in confidence. The play on the edge of the opposition box shows that no-one will take a risk and either shoot or make a risky pass. All very safe and very boring - and won't lead to goals. A shadow of their former selves. Martin: I thought they were looking more creative up front. Phil Foden must be crestfallen at the jelly-like defending and inability of the team to close out wins.  Savinho good. Matheus Nunes and Akanji awful. Poor choices of substitutions. Mid-table team this year but little buds are appearing for development. Simon StoneChief football news reporter Reporters covering Manchester United have repeatedly been told the club is committed to the Premier League's financial rules. They have also been told United are ""tight"" when it comes to their PSR position. The detail of that - as with all clubs - is vague. But while they are dealing with the legacy of ridiculous contracts handed out to underperforming players, they will have a problem. Selling homegrown stars is a way to relieve the problem - which is why the future of Marcus Rashford is key in terms of what transfer business United might be able to do this month. But that policy risks alienating supporters, especially if another local lad, like Kobbie Mainoo, was offloaded. The positive, if there is such a thing, around the huge debt United will probably take on for whatever stadium project they choose, is that it will not count in PSR calculations even though, in reality, it will have a massive impact on their budget because it will need paying back. For now, expect overall costs to keep getting cut and more emphasis to be placed on better recruitment at first-team level. They have not been charged this time, but United are too close to spend their way out of their current mess. Read more on how Premier League clubs kept to spending rules Manchester United's rivals are waiting to pounce on January deals for midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho as they anticipate co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wanting to avoid last-minute profit and sustainability rules sales on 30 June to stay within financial rules.

On the team being tired:""With the absence of the central defenders, Rodri, with many things, we are not [at our best] and we didn't take the right decisions. It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win."" On if he is happy with a point:""Yeah, it is what it is."" On why his side are struggling to hold on to leads:""I don't know, it can happen. Sometimes it happens. We have to manage a little bit better but today was not bad."" Michael EmonsBBC Sport journalist Leading 2-0 at the 82nd-minute mark, Manchester City will be heading north wondering how they left London without the three points. Phil Foden's double had City on course for their third successive league win and their fourth in all competitions, before Brentford produced a superb fightback. Yoane Wissa pulled one back, but City should have then restored their two-goal advantage only for Savinho, Erling Haaland and James McAtee to all miss chances before Bees skipper Christian Norgaard headed in an equaliser in the 92nd minute. City have won the title in each of the past four seasons and this was a missed chance to close the gap on leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 at Nottingham Forest and remain 12 points ahead of Pep Guardiola's side. One positive for City would have been Foden's two goals. He did superbly to control a side-footed volley from Kevin de Bruyne's excellent cross and then reacted quickest to prod him a second after Savinho's effort had been parried by Mark Flekken. That is now four goals in Foden's past five Premier League matches after he had not scored in the opening four months of City's league campaign. Foden won the Players' Player of the Year award last season and his form could be crucial if City are to push on and secure Champions League football for 2025-26. Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden has scored seven Premier League goals against Brentford - only netting more against Brighton (eight). Indeed, six of his seven goals against the Bees have come at the Brentford Community Stadium, including each of his past five. While team-mate Kevin De Bruyne has provided an assist in all three of his Premier League away games against Brentford, with all three assists being for Foden goals. Manchester City midfielder Phil Foden, speaking to TNT Sports:""We just looked tired at the end. The last 20, 30 minutes, we looked leggy and they put the pressure on and put longer balls into the box. We didn't cope with the physicality at the end. ""It's one of the toughest places to come and they give you different challenges. I was happy with the performance up until we went 1-0 up and then after that we let our performance slip and gave the ball away. It's something to learn from. They gave us a challenge today and we did the best we could."" On the number of games Man City have to play:""We're used to it for many years, we've been playing the majority of the competitions and playing every three days so it's something the squad are quite used to, no excuses."" On Kevin de Bruyne's ball in for the first goal:""We've built that combination now for years, I've been playing with him and training with him. Me and Kev's connection is good on the pitch. He gave me the perfect ball, I just had to help it on and I was delighted to see it hit the back of the net."" On whether they are turning a corner:""It's definitely picked up from previously and performances are a lot better than they were. We've still got steps to go to where we want to be but as long as we keep making them small steps and improving, that's what we're aiming to do."" Were you at the game or following from elsewhere?

"Development of a major North Sea gas field has been approved by regulators. The Jackdaw field, east of Aberdeen, has the potential to produce 6.5% of Britain's gas output. The regulatory approval comes as the UK government seeks to boost domestic energy output following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shell's proposals were initially rejected on environmental grounds in October. UK Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed the decision. ""We're turbocharging renewables and nuclear, but we are also realistic about our energy needs now,"" hesaid on Twitter,external. ""Let's source more of the gas we need from British waters to protect energy security."" Shell urges UK government to unblock Jackdaw Shell reconsiders its exit from Cambo oil field New North Sea Shearwater pipeline announced by Shell Redevelopment of Penguins oil field to bring new jobs Under the new plan, Shell plans to start production from the field in the second half of 2025. The oil and gas company said the approval came ""at a time when UK energy security is critically required."" Shell said it expected to spend Â£500m in the UK to develop the new facility. It said the Jackdaw field should be able to provide gas to 1.4m British homes, and its carbon emissions should eventually be captured for storage, if a large project in Peterhead secures funding. But environmental campaigners have condemned the move. The activist group Greenpeace said it believed the approval could be unlawful and it was considering legal action. ""Approving Jackdaw is a desperate and destructive decision from Johnson's government, and proves there is no long-term plan,"" said Ami McCarthy, a political campaigner for Greenpeace. The approval comes as Britain struggles with soaring energy prices in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the 24 February. Energy independence was a major theme of the UK energy strategy announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in early April. The main focus was investing in renewable and nuclear power but it also promised new licences for gas projects in the North Sea arguing that producing gas in UK waters has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad. It is understood that Shell has changed the way it processes natural gas before it brings it onshore. The plan had been to vent excess gas at an offshore hub to reduce the corrosive CO2 content in the pipes. Natural gas is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The UK was one of 100 countries that pledged to cut methane gas emissions by 30% over the next 10 years. Under the new plan Shell will bring a higher percentage of gas ashore. It was the Cambo oil field, west of Shetland, that got the attention as world leaders gathered in Glasgow seven months ago to show their commitment to tackling climate change. Cambo was the test of how serious the UK government really was. As minority partner in the development, Shell pulled out. It was expensive, in deep water, and the politics of it made it a riskier investment. It had other projects to consider first. Jackdaw, a gas field close to existing infrastructure, was what Shell describes as a ""vanilla"" project - relatively, very straight forward. Permission to install a tie-back (subsea link) to a nearby platform had been refused last year, on the grounds that production would raise emissions unacceptably. Shell appealed. It wants to capture those emissions at the carbon capture and storage plant it is helping to plan for St Fergus in Aberdeenshire (but which the UK government put on the back burner). And it plans also to re-power its offshore platforms with renewable electricity rather than burning gas. Along with the sudden rise in concern about energy security that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, those arguments appear to have won over the UK government and its regulator. The fight doesn't stop here. The industry saw Jackdaw as a test of whether the UK government is serious about energy security: but for environmental campaigners, it's a test of whether the UK government is serious about climate change.

"A woman in Cardiff is ""furious"" her father's care home is charging Â£18 an hour to take him to hospital appointments Care home providers have been criticised for charging top up fees to residents for taking them to medical appointments. The Older People's Commissioner Helena Herklots said providers should be open and honest about extra fees and social care should be made free. Sue Simms, whose dad is in a care home, said: ""It feels mean and underhanded."" The Welsh government said care homes were legally required to set out any extra charges. Ms Simms, from Cardiff, cares for her father 78-year-old Peter Faint. Mr Faint, who was a research and development scientist, requires full-time nursing care as he has Parkinson's Disease, vascular dementia and multiple sclerosis. Staff shortage 'putting more people in care homes' Care home owner trying to keep 'head above water' Ms Simms, a nurse, said she was ""astonished and furious"" when his care home told her she would have to start paying Â£18 an hour for every hospital appointment that she could not take her father to. ""I know from my background in A&E that if dad needed an ambulance, you could have a number of hours outside hospital, then 10 or 12 hours inside with an overnight wait for transport home. ""You could come away with a bill of hundreds of pounds,"" she said. Sue Simms says she fears people who do not have family support could face bills they cannot afford Ms Simms said she always tried to take her father to appointments but she worried about other people who may not be able to do the same for their relatives. ""We all think that everybody's got somebody but there are a lot of people who don't have anyone,"" she said. ""A lot of people don't have children and only an elderly spouse at home. A lot of people can't afford it. It feels mean and underhanded."" Ms Simms, who is an only child, has reduced her working hours in order to care for both her mother and father. She said she had no idea about the top-up fees when her father moved into the home more than six months ago. ""It's another unnecessary pressure. Am I going to get a call saying my dad has an appointment and I have to juggle work? It's a pressure on my mum too and she's not well,"" she said. A spokesperson for the home where her dad lives, said: ""We do charge an escort fee for hospital appointments as standard at our home. ""We ask for the fee because when a carer is needed to accompany a resident, it means they are away from the home and the other residents under their care. In some cases, we will need to ensure an extra team member is on shift to cover their duties. ""In Sue's case, we apologise that the escort fees were not communicated to her and her family."" The care home added these fees were paused during the height of the pandemic and when charges restarted this should have been clearly communicated to everyone. The Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Helena Herklots, said that it was not always clear how much extra people might have to pay. She added that some of the examples they had heard were ""extraordinary"". Helena Herklots, the Older People's commissioner, says the Welsh Government should make social care free as soon as possible ""We've heard of one example where someone was being charged to get access to go into the garden. That's at the extreme end,"" she said. She said the worry about extra costs was causing families and older people ""a lot of stress"". ""It's affecting their mental health, it's making them anxious and worried because they're not sure they can afford these additional costs,"" she added. She has called on the Welsh government to reform social care funding to make it free at the point of need as soon as possible. The Welsh government said it was committed to creating a National Care Service. Chief executive of Care Forum Wales, Mary Wimbury, explained that the financial situation for care homes was ""really challenging"". She said that care home fees were not increasing in line with increased costs of food, heating and staffing. ""We've got to have an honest conversation across Wales about how much care costs, how much we're prepared to pay, what we want in terms of standards, in terms of things like staff ratios,"" said Ms Wimbury. She added that accompanying someone for a long hospital visit meant backfill staff would be needed in the home which would cost providers. Care Forum Wales, which represents care homes in Wales, says they are struggling with increased costs ""There's either got to be an additional charge or it's got to be part of the general fee,"" she added. The Welsh government said it expected care home providers to be clear and upfront about the fees they charge. ""They are required by law to set out this information in their written guide for the service as well as an individual's service agreement,"" it said. ""Creating a National Care Service, that is free at the point of need, is a commitment in the Co-operation Agreement between the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru and we will be setting up an expert group to support this shared ambition."" The Welsh Local Government Association, which represents councils, said social care services needed ""significant and sustainable"" long term investments to make permanent improvements. ""The current cost of living crisis will only further exacerbate some of the current pressures, with social care facing a funding gap for current services, increasing each year due to inflation and other costs. ""This is without considering the immediate need to address unmet and under met need on these overburdened systems. ""Without adequate funding, some councils will face a battle to balance budgets, worsening existing pressures and running the serious risk of impacts on the ability to deliver timely and quality care to those who draw on it.""

""I'm not sure what Detective Inspector John Rebus would make of it - he'd almost certainly tell me not to get too big-headed. I'll do my best, while pouring a glass of something refreshing."" Lewis's CBE is partly for his services to drama - but also recognises his charity work. Along with his late wife, the actress Helen McCrory, he launched Feed NHS - a campaign to raise Â£1m for meals for NHS workers during the coronavirus pandemic.

"""We are selling loads and loads of bunting, loads of queen masks,"" said trader Deborah Williams Pubs and hotels are ""absolutely booming"" as events including the Platinum Jubilee weekend draw crowds, Cardiff's business group has said. FOR Cardiff said ""tens of thousands"" of people were attending a busy schedule of events across the half term week. Celebrations began with three nights of Ed Sheeran concerts in Cardiff, with a Wales match andJubileeevents to come. Economist, Prof Max Munday from Cardiff University said the extra bank holiday was likely to cut productivity overall. Half term began with Ed Sheeran performing to thousands of fans at the Principality Stadium, although thevolume of visitorshas caused traffic and travel issues. Upcoming jubilee celebrations include a military music parade in Cardiff Bay on Thursday, followed by the lighting of a beacon in the evening. Aled Jones and Bonnie Tyler will headline a concert at Cardiff Castle on Saturday night, while a Big Jubilee Picnic takes place at Bute Park on Sunday. Football fans will also descend on the city on Sunday to watch Wales play either Scotland or Ukraine in the World Cup play-off followingtheir gamelater. Carolyn Brownell: ""It is a really fantastic time for Cardiff"" FOR Cardiff, which was previously called Cardiff's Business Improvement District (BID), said the events were proving a big draw. ""It is not only a boost to the morale of the Welsh people, but also to business and the wider economy,"" said its associate director, Carolyn Brownell. ""From the conversations we are having with hoteliers, the licensees and retail, there is a real sense of optimism and positivity now. ""The hotels are predominately full, particularly with the events happening over the weekend. ""Retail is having a huge amount of intertest in its empty units, and licensees are absolutely booming over the weekend with lots of people wanting to enjoy the festivities and the plethora of restaurants and bars. ""It is a really fantastic time for Cardiff, and you can really see the businesses rallying together. ""That has been one of the positive outcomes of the pandemic,"" she said. Brits set to spend millions on jubilee merchandise How strong is Wales' bond with the monarchy? While hospitality and some retailers expect to benefit from the jubilee, economists say bank holidays generally have a negative impact on growth because so many people are off work. Prof Max Munday is director of the Welsh economy research unit at Cardiff University. He said: ""There will be output lost in a lot of industries. They are going to be shut down, so output will be lost there. ""But then you have got sectors such as transport, food and restaurant services that are likely to see a boost of output."" Prof Munday said previous jubilee bank holidays showed a negligible impact on the economy, but that other impacts were harder to measure. ""Generally, if we were to look at the Golden Jubilee, and the Diamond Jubilee back in 2012, overall most of the assessments show there was probably a net loss of output. ""Of course there are things we can't measure with pounds and pence, such as people's wellbeing. Those things are much harder to estimate."" Businesses are also making the most of the appetite for items to celebrate the jubilee. ""We are selling loads and loads of bunting, loads of queen masks,"" said Deborah Williams whose shop, based opposite Cardiff Castle, has been decorated with union flags and cardboard cut-outs of the Queen. ""People are getting really, really excited,"" she said. ""In the last week it has really ramped up a lot."" She said she was aware of ""loads"" of street parties, care homes having parties and businesses were also ""throwing parties"" for staff. ""It seems to be that everyone just wants to get involved.""

"Clare Balding, Damian Lewis and Stella McCartney are all being made CBEs Actor Damian Lewis has been made a CBE, former Northern Ireland first minister Arlene Foster a dame and crime writer Ian Rankin has been knighted on the Queen's Birthday Honours list. Broadcaster Clare Balding and designer Stella McCartney also become CBEs. And illustrator Sir Quentin Blake and author Sir Salman Rushdie join the elite Companions of Honour. The honours usually coincide with the Queen's birthday but this year also mark the 70th anniversary of her reign. They have been announced on the eve of the Platinum Jubilee weekend and come two weeks ahead of her official birthday. The oldest recipient is Angela Redgrave, 104, the founder and principal of the Bristol School of Dancing. Like the Queen, she has dedicated 70 years to public service. She gets a British Empire Medal (BEM). The same award is given to the youngest people getting honours - 11-year-old twins Elena and Ruben Evans-Guillen from Warrington, who have raised nearly Â£50,000 for NHS charities over the past three years. The BEM is for ""hands-on"" service to a local community. There are a total of 1,134 people on thelist issued by the Cabinet Office.,externalA record proportion of recipients - 51.5% - are women, slightly higher than the previous record of 51.2% set in 2015. More than 100 medical staff and charity workers have been recognised for their work during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ferdinand, Muirhead, Bale and Moeen head sporting honours Charity fundraisers recognised in jubilee honours PM critic knighted in Queen's Jubilee honours MP becomes CBE after football review Twins become youngest birthday honours recipients Woman who fostered 27 children made OBE Our guide to the honours system Masterchef hosts John Torode and Gregg Wallace, singer Bonnie Tyler and footballer Rio Ferdinand are also recognised, with Team GB's Olympic gold medal-winning women's curling team among the sporting stars honoured. Sir Quentin, perhaps best known for his illustrations of Roald Dahl's children's books, said it was ""an enormous privilege"" to join the Companions of Honour - membership is limited to 65 people. The 89-year-old said: ""It is also of special interest to me because it is not, unlike so many awards, just a medal that is pinned on you."" Sir Quentin Blake said the award was a privilege Sir Salman, 74, who joins the likes of Dame Judi Dench and Sir David Attenborough among the 65 members, said: ""It's a privilege to be included in such illustrious company, both past and present."" Dame Arlene, former leader of the DUP and the first woman appointed first minister in Northern Ireland, said being made a dame was ""an honour for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the place which I love and which I represented for 18 years, and indeed for the whole of Northern Ireland"". Knighthood for Rebus author Ian Rankin Damehood is really special - Arlene Foster Award-winning Scottish author Sir Ian is perhaps best known for his Detective Inspector Rebus books, set in and around Edinburgh. He said it was ""amazing to be honoured in this way"", adding: ""It may not make writing my next book any easier but it is gratifying to be recognised both for my crime novels and the work I do for charity. ""I'm not sure what Detective Inspector John Rebus would make of it - he'd almost certainly tell me not to get too big-headed. I'll do my best, while pouring a glass of something refreshing."" Lewis's CBE is partly for his services to drama - but also recognises his charity work. Along with his late wife, the actress Helen McCrory, he launched Feed NHS - a campaign to raise Â£1m for meals for NHS workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The Homeland, Band of Brothers and Billions actor had been made an OBE in 2014. Lewis said it was a ""great honour"" to have been awarded a CBE for his acting and charity work, adding that he was ""thrilled"". Masterchef hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode become MBEs. John Torode and Gregg Wallace present BBC One's Masterchef and its various spin-off shows Australian chef Torode said he was thrilled and humbled. Wallace, who began his career in the Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, said: ""From a council estate in Peckham to being recognised by the Queen is for me something akin to a fairy tale story. I am incredibly, incredibly proud."" Also in the world of food, US-born chef Ken Hom becomes an honorary CBE on theForeign Office's list.,external Sports presenter Balding said she saw her ""prestigious honour"" as ""a reflection of how much people care about sport"". ""There is still a long way to go in the promotion of women's sport and Paralympic sport and I want to keep spreading the message that we can learn so much from the way athletes recover from setbacks, maintain their patience and work together in a team,"" she said.

"The train drivers' union Aslef has rejected the latest 4.2% pay deal from ScotRail. The union's national executive said it would ballot for industrial action unless ScotRail offered further talks. Many drivers have been refusing to work overtime or on rest days during the pay dispute. The driver shortage has led to the now-nationalised train operator cutting a third of services under a temporary timetable. ScotRail said it was frustrated by the decision of Aslef and described the decision not to put the improved pay deal to its members as ""astonishing"". Transport Scotland said it was disappointed the union had rejected a deal which it described as ""both fair and affordable"". Government optimistic over new ScotRail pay offer Hundreds of ScotRail Sunday services cancelled Scotland's Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth had said earlier this week she was hopeful the 4.2% pay offer would resolve the dispute. However, it was turned down by a meeting of Aslef's national executive committee on Wednesday. Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay said: ""Aslef wants to negotiate a fair deal for our members, we are once again calling on ScotRail to return to the talks, so we can negotiate a fair pay offer that we can put to our members."" ScotRail's service delivery director, David Simpson, urged the union to reconsider the pay offer, which includes a improved maternity and adoption leave and a 10% increase in the Sunday working allowance. He said: ""We're incredibly disappointed and frustrated that Aslef bosses have rejected this improved pay offer. It's astonishing that they will not even put this offer to their members. ""Our substantially improved pay offer reflects the cost-of-living challenges faced by families across the country, while balancing it against the need to provide value for the taxpayer. ""We have offered to meet Aslef but, in the meantime, would urge them to reconsider this offer in the interest of their members and the future of the railway in Scotland."" ScotRail say they are astonished, incredibly disappointed and frustrated that Aslef won't even put the offer to members. They've offered further talks,  but they also want Aslef to reconsider the existing offer. It's worth remembering that ScotRail said last week that the 4.2% offer was final. ScotRail introduced an emergency timetable last month to give customers a degree of certainty about services after being hit by numerous cancellations. But the timetable involved almost 700 fewer services a day, with many later trains no longer running. The train operator has introduced extra services for Wednesday's Scotland v Ukraine World Cup play-off. Extra evening services were also provided on Friday and Saturday last week, but Sunday again saw more than 300 cancellations. ScotRail had said it will again provide extra Friday and Saturday services this coming weekend. Separately from the Aslef pay dispute, ScotRail also faces a threat of strike action by RMT members who have been offered a 2.2% pay rise. UK-wide action isalso possible this summer by RMT memberswho are in dispute with Network Rail, although talks are continuing. ScotRail has said the shortage of available drivers is due to disruption to training during Covid pandemic, forcing it to ask the existing workforce to work extra hours. The Scottish government has said a train driver in Scotland typically earns about Â£50,000, and has urged workers to ask for ""sensible"" pay increases during the ""precarious"" economic situation. Minister urges people to be 'sensible' over pay A spokesperson for Transport Scotland said: ""We are disappointed that Aslef, having given due consideration to the terms they negotiated, have decided to reject the very good offer on the table, an offer which is in part self-funded through increased revenue and efficiencies. ""While we understand any unions desire to obtain the best deal possible for their members, the stark realities of the financial pressures we are facing across government are evidenced by the spending review published just yesterday. ""We all need to work together to make nationalisation a success. Ministers are committed to ensuring that the railway unions are part of that success. ""However, to be part of the vision moving forward, the unions need to agree on a deal that is both fair and affordable, particularly in the context of wider public sector pay policy."" The Scottish Conservatives' transport spokesman Graham Simpson accused the government of ""complacency"" over the situation. ""It's clear she [Jenny Gilruth] and the SNP government just assumed the offer would be accepted,"" he said. ""Now, it appears, we're back to square one and the Scottish public will have to endure the woefully-inadequate reduced ScotRail timetable for even longer.""

"Learners say they have paid more than Â£200 for a test - more than twice the standard fee Driving tests are being bulk booked and resold for profit, as a chronic backlog means learners are otherwise waiting months for a test date. Learner drivers say they have paid more than Â£200 for a practical test - more than twice the standard fee. One operator said it used automated software to book tests, and the BBC has seen evidence encouraging driving instructors to sell tests for profit. The DVSA urged applicants to only book tests via its official website. The demand for driving tests, caused by the pandemic, means in many places - including London, Birmingham and Cardiff - tests aren't available to book online for up to six months. At other centres, the earliest availability is September or October. It has seen many learners turn towards a secondary market. Some are paying a nominal fee to companies which find them cancelled tests. Others are buying from sellers which offer tests for vastly inflated prices. Amelia, not her real name, told the BBC she had paid Â£210 for a cancelled test through her instructor in London. The standard fee is Â£62 for a weekday test and Â£75 for one in an evening, at the weekend or over a bank holiday, if booked through the Driving Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The DVSA is the official body that carries out driving tests in Great Britain. ""It was very on-the-go,"" 23-year-old Amelia said. ""My driving instructor would call me and say, 'quick, there's a cancellation, do you want it?' The day we booked my test it all happened within a three or four-minute phone call."" She said she'd had to reply with a picture of her provisional licence number, after which she received a reference number allowing her to change the test booking with her own details. Another driver said her instructor had paid Â£235 for her test. A third paid Â£186 - although Â£54 of this was for the car hire and Â£62 for the standard test fee. Some learners face 10-month wait for driving tests Driving tests resume but learners fight for slots 'I can't get a driving test until next year' The BBC has looked into how this is possible. One operator claimed to be using ""AI-powered software"" to scoop up vacant test slots as soon as they became available on the DVSA website. They said they used software that constantly refreshes the agency's booking website, together with VPNs, or virtual private networks, to hide their computer's identity, meaning it avoided being banned. They sent an email - seen by the BBC - to driving instructors, encouraging them to use their service to profit from pupils. An email sent to driving instructors encouraging them to profit from their pupils When we contacted them, they said: ""This softwareâ¦ [is] like if you're pressing on the search button. It just automates your press, or clicks, on the button."" We also found multiple posts on Facebook Marketplace and within some Facebook groups, offering a variety of test times for sale. Behind such posts are people like Alex, who runs a ""short-notice driving exam business"". He posted an advert on Facebook claiming he ""can guarantee exam bookings within three weeks"". The advert said approved driving instructors who work with him ""make upwards of Â£400-Â£600 a week"" by reselling exams to pupils. When contacted, Alex would not reveal how his business booked tests. But the BBC found one way of booking a slot and then transferring it - or potentially selling it - to someone else. An advert on Facebook, which claims instructors can make over Â£400 by reselling tests (ADIs stands for 'approved driving instructors') Learners only have access to the main DVSA booking system, where they have to manually search for available test dates. They can only book one test per person. And if they want to change their test date, they have to find an alternative one manually. However, we registered on the DVSA's site as a fake driving school, giving us access to a different part of the booking system - one that is not available to most learners. The system is intended to allow driving schools to book tests for multiple pupils - using a single contact number and email address. But the BBC found there was little verification to check who was signing up. It took us five minutes to register, with no requirement for official documentation. After receiving a simple verification code by email, we were given access. Once inside we were able to set alerts for when tests became available and could book multiple tests on the account. And while each booking still required a different provisional licence number, the system allowed exams to be swapped between candidates. In effect, anyone with instructors' access, could purchase a test - either one in the distant future, or a cancellation - and then sell it on at a premium by swapping appointments. We also found it was possible to book tests without the provisional licence holder ever knowing. To test the system, we booked a practical driving test, using a BBC email address and the provisional licence number of a learner, who had given us their permission. There was no verification required on the learner drivers' part and the booking confirmation was sent to our email address - meaning the learner would not know about the booking. When challenged on whether the booking system was robust enough, the DVSA said the system was ""imperfect"" as it ""relies on trust"". It said it was only illegal to book a driving test using someone else's details without their consent. Charles Moffat, chairman of the Approved Driving Instructors' National Joint Council, the UK's leading driver instructor association, said the organisation had heard accounts of tests being resold for a profit. ""We abhor such practice and will always report such conduct to the DVSA,"" he added. The DVSA said it would continue to do all it could to provide as many tests as possible, including conducting out-of-hours testing and recruiting more examiners. DVSA chief executive Loveday Ryder said in a statement to the BBC: ""We've already put in place measures to monitor and prevent bots from accessing our systems while also strengthening our firewall to tackle the issue. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to crack down on companies that are exploiting learner drivers. ""We've closed the system to new registrations and will rapidly close down accounts that do not belong to driving instructors and driving schools. We'll also be taking further steps to make sure all future accounts are linked to driving instructors  and those with training businesses."" As of 2 June the DVSA has reduced the number of times a driving test appointment can be changed from 10 to the pre-pandemic limit of six. It has also stopped accepting new automatic online registrations to use the service - any new applications must be made by email - and has stopped accepting any new registrations from companies who do not directly employ a driving instructor.

It could have been an embarrassing night for us, but I really enjoyed watching Ukraine. The shape was totally wrong right from the start. At the back, we were all over the place.  Ukraine players celebrate their second goal early in the second half FT: Scotland 1-3 Ukraine Pat NevinFormer Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Scotland needed to get into the game second half but they lost that goal and the plan was out the window again. They didn't play anywhere near their best.  FT: Scotland 1-3 Ukraine Alan HuttonFormer Scotland defender on BBC Radio 5 Live This moment is amazing, it's truly special. What they're going through, what they're feeling now - and they fully deserve it. Well done Ukraine, they were outstanding.  FT: Scotland 1-3 Ukraine Craig LeveinFormer Scotland manager on BBC Sportsound Nobody could argue that wasn't the correct result. We spoke about Scotland's inadequacies in the first-half, but Ukraine played fantastically well. Craig Gordon made some unbelievable saves to keep Scotland in it. The system did change after that and it looked better, gave us an opportunity. But you're asking a lot to get back in the game from 2-0 down.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company Meta, has announced that she is leaving the business after 14 years. Ms Sandberg announced her departurein a Facebook post,external, saying she hoped to focus on her foundation and philanthropic work in the future. Her departure comes as Meta faces a slowdown in advertising sales and more competition from rivals such as TikTok. Ms Sandberg is one of the most high-profile women in the tech industry. ""When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years,"" wrote Ms Sandberg, known as a powerful second-in-command at the company. ""Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life."" Javier Olivan, currently Meta's chief growth officer, will take over Ms Sandberg's position in the company when she leaves. Ms Sandberg, whose husband died suddenly in 2015, is getting re-married this summer. She said she planned to leave the company in the autumn but would remain on the board. Following her announcement, shares in Meta fell 4%. Ms Sandberg joined Facebook when it was still a small company led by Mark Zuckerberg, a then-23 year-old Harvard dropout. A veteran of Google, she helped turn its advertising business into a profit powerhouse, as the company grew to include Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Last year, the company reported more than $117bn in revenue and said more than 2.8 billion people globally used one of its apps daily. This video can not be played COO of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg on the importance of female success in the workplace Books she wrote, including Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead - which she described as a ""sort of feminist manifesto"" - made her a global celebrity. But her star power faded as the company faced criticism for its handling of personal data in relation to political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and targeted adverts as well as its moderation of social media posts. Ms Sandberg, who was initially responsible for Facebook's response, appeared to acknowledge some of those challenges in her post, writing: ""The debate around social media has changed beyond recognition since those early days."" ""To say it hasn't always been easy is an understatement. But it should be hard,"" she wrote. ""The products we make have a huge impact, so we have the responsibility to build them in a way that protects privacy and keeps people safe."" In his own post, Mr Zuckerberg said Ms Sandberg's departure marked the ""end of an era"", noting that it was ""unusual"" for a business partnership like theirs to last so long. ""Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company,"" he added. ""She created opportunities for millions of people around the world, and she deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today."" He said Mr Olivan's responsibilities would differ from Ms Sandberg's, with Mr Olivan taking on a ""more traditional"" chief operating officer role that was more focused internally and operationally. Meta is facing new challenges as countries tighten social media regulations and iPhone maker Apple changes its privacy rules, hitting the social media firm's targeted ad business. Growth in the number of Facebook users in key markets, such as the US, has been stalled, and it has lost younger users to rivals such as TikTok. Mr Zuckerberg has been pushing the company to invest heavily in virtual and augmented reality platforms, which he sees as driving the firm's next phase of growth. He renamed the company Meta last year in honour of the shift to the ""metaverse"". What is the metaverse? Facebook chief Sandberg: 'Pay women well' How the star of Sheryl Sandberg dimmed Insider principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said Ms Sandberg ""had an enormous impact on Facebook, Meta, and the broader business world"". ""She helped Facebook build a world-class ad-buying platform and develop ground-breaking ad formats, which enabled the company to become the second largest digital ad business in the world behind Google,"" she said. ""However, Facebook also faced huge scandals under her watch, including the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica privacy debacle in 2018, and the Capitol riots that took place after the 2020 election. And in 2022, Meta is facing a slowdown in user growth and ad revenue that is now testing the business foundation that the company was built on. ""The company needs to find a new way forward, and perhaps this was the best time for Sandberg to depart.""

"Learners say they have paid more than Â£200 for a test - more than twice the standard fee Driving tests are being bulk booked and resold for profit, as a chronic backlog means learners are otherwise waiting months for a test date. Learner drivers say they have paid more than Â£200 for a practical test - more than twice the standard fee. One operator said it used automated software to book tests, and the BBC has seen evidence encouraging driving instructors to sell tests for profit. The DVSA urged applicants to only book tests via its official website. The demand for driving tests, caused by the pandemic, means in many places - including London, Birmingham and Cardiff - tests aren't available to book online for up to six months. At other centres, the earliest availability is September or October. It has seen many learners turn towards a secondary market. Some are paying a nominal fee to companies which find them cancelled tests. Others are buying from sellers which offer tests for vastly inflated prices. Amelia, not her real name, told the BBC she had paid Â£210 for a cancelled test through her instructor in London. The standard fee is Â£62 for a weekday test and Â£75 for one in an evening, at the weekend or over a bank holiday, if booked through the Driving Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The DVSA is the official body that carries out driving tests in Great Britain. ""It was very on-the-go,"" 23-year-old Amelia said. ""My driving instructor would call me and say, 'quick, there's a cancellation, do you want it?' The day we booked my test it all happened within a three or four-minute phone call."" She said she'd had to reply with a picture of her provisional licence number, after which she received a reference number allowing her to change the test booking with her own details. Another driver said her instructor had paid Â£235 for her test. A third paid Â£186 - although Â£54 of this was for the car hire and Â£62 for the standard test fee. Some learners face 10-month wait for driving tests Driving tests resume but learners fight for slots 'I can't get a driving test until next year' The BBC has looked into how this is possible. One operator claimed to be using ""AI-powered software"" to scoop up vacant test slots as soon as they became available on the DVSA website. They said they used software that constantly refreshes the agency's booking website, together with VPNs, or virtual private networks, to hide their computer's identity, meaning it avoided being banned. They sent an email - seen by the BBC - to driving instructors, encouraging them to use their service to profit from pupils. An email sent to driving instructors encouraging them to profit from their pupils When we contacted them, they said: ""This softwareâ¦ [is] like if you're pressing on the search button. It just automates your press, or clicks, on the button."" We also found multiple posts on Facebook Marketplace and within some Facebook groups, offering a variety of test times for sale. Behind such posts are people like Alex, who runs a ""short-notice driving exam business"". He posted an advert on Facebook claiming he ""can guarantee exam bookings within three weeks"". The advert said approved driving instructors who work with him ""make upwards of Â£400-Â£600 a week"" by reselling exams to pupils. When contacted, Alex would not reveal how his business booked tests. But the BBC found one way of booking a slot and then transferring it - or potentially selling it - to someone else. An advert on Facebook, which claims instructors can make over Â£400 by reselling tests (ADIs stands for 'approved driving instructors') Learners only have access to the main DVSA booking system, where they have to manually search for available test dates. They can only book one test per person. And if they want to change their test date, they have to find an alternative one manually. However, we registered on the DVSA's site as a fake driving school, giving us access to a different part of the booking system - one that is not available to most learners. The system is intended to allow driving schools to book tests for multiple pupils - using a single contact number and email address. But the BBC found there was little verification to check who was signing up. It took us five minutes to register, with no requirement for official documentation. After receiving a simple verification code by email, we were given access. Once inside we were able to set alerts for when tests became available and could book multiple tests on the account. And while each booking still required a different provisional licence number, the system allowed exams to be swapped between candidates. In effect, anyone with instructors' access, could purchase a test - either one in the distant future, or a cancellation - and then sell it on at a premium by swapping appointments. We also found it was possible to book tests without the provisional licence holder ever knowing. To test the system, we booked a practical driving test, using a BBC email address and the provisional licence number of a learner, who had given us their permission. There was no verification required on the learner drivers' part and the booking confirmation was sent to our email address - meaning the learner would not know about the booking. When challenged on whether the booking system was robust enough, the DVSA said the system was ""imperfect"" as it ""relies on trust"". It said it was only illegal to book a driving test using someone else's details without their consent. Charles Moffat, chairman of the Approved Driving Instructors' National Joint Council, the UK's leading driver instructor association, said the organisation had heard accounts of tests being resold for a profit. ""We abhor such practice and will always report such conduct to the DVSA,"" he added. The DVSA said it would continue to do all it could to provide as many tests as possible, including conducting out-of-hours testing and recruiting more examiners. DVSA chief executive Loveday Ryder said in a statement to the BBC: ""We've already put in place measures to monitor and prevent bots from accessing our systems while also strengthening our firewall to tackle the issue. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to crack down on companies that are exploiting learner drivers. ""We've closed the system to new registrations and will rapidly close down accounts that do not belong to driving instructors and driving schools. We'll also be taking further steps to make sure all future accounts are linked to driving instructors  and those with training businesses."" As of 2 June the DVSA has reduced the number of times a driving test appointment can be changed from 10 to the pre-pandemic limit of six. It has also stopped accepting new automatic online registrations to use the service - any new applications must be made by email - and has stopped accepting any new registrations from companies who do not directly employ a driving instructor.

"She's one of the most photographed women in history and over the past 70 years has defined what it means to dress like a queen. Not trendsetting or daring, but iconic. She's become famous for her brightly coloured dresses and coats paired with a matching hat, accessorised with her signature square handbag, three strand pearl necklace and a jewelled brooch. It sounds simple but the Queen's style has become a powerful formula. It's a style that has been honed and refined over seven decades, helped by the close relationships she has developed with trusted designers and dressers. ""Royal fashion is fun, powerful and steeped with meaning,"" says author and royal fashion commentator Elizabeth Holmes. ""Her image is a huge part of her legacy."" The Queen has always had a very clear idea of what she wanted to look like, says historian Michael Pick. ""People have said she has no idea about clothes, but that is simply not true. She is very astute about what suits her,"" Pick says. When she was in her 20s, Princess Elizabeth began working with designer Norman Hartnell, a relationship she inherited from the Queen Mother. Full-skirted dresses with a nipped in waist, influenced by French couture, were paired with white fur stoles and diamond tiaras. As she took on her new role as Queen, Hartnell helped her to dazzle her way through state banquets and royal tours in a host of tulle and satin gowns, intricately embellished with seed pearls, crystals and beads. Hartnell also created two of the most important dresses she would ever wear - her wedding dress and the gown she wore for her coronation. He describes the process as a collaboration.  ""For her coronation dress Hartnell produced about eight designs and she chose elements from them all and made it her own,"" Pick says. For the Queen, working with the same people was not just about trust, but was also down to necessity. Hartnell had the largest couture house in London along with the largest embroidery workroom, and for someone as busy as the Queen who needed hundreds of new outfits each year, it meant he had the capacity to design and produce what she needed. Still, the scale of the job meant she also asked designer Hardy Amies to work with her, beginning with a wardrobe of looks for a tour of Canada in 1951. Amies led the Queen into a slightly more crisp and understated look, with tailored day clothes and sleeker eveningwear. Then Ian Thomas took her through the 1970s and 1980s in a flurry of brightly coloured chiffon, floral prints and bows. For the last 24 years her outfits have been designed and produced in-house by a small team of around 10 people, led by her personal dresser Angela Kelly. Each item the Queen wears is bespoke, and before the pandemic she was attending more then 300 engagements a year. ""It's a huge amount of work,"" Pick says. ""You don't want the monarch wearing something someone else is wearing. The public expects something different. ""Hartnell and Amies made her more individual, while Angela Kelly has been very clever and managed to take her individual style and make it sparkle."" When the Queen steps out in public every aspect of her appearance has been meticulously planned. Fabrics are checked to see how they drape or might behave in a breeze. The bright colours, chosen for the season and occasion, give instant impact so that she stands out in a crowd. A hat gives her slight stature more height and highlights her face. She wears sensible block-heeled shoes - handmade and worn in by Kelly herself to make sure they are comfortable - and there is always a clear umbrella with a colour-matched trim on standby, so even the unpredictable British weather won't get in her way. This uniform-way of dressing maximises her comfort on long days, but also helps define her role, says Elizabeth Holmes. ""Her job is to be a calm and consistent presence. Her clothes are a mix of knowing what to expect but also with an ability to surprise and delight. ""Even in the casual moments there is a sense of uniform, with her headscarf and wellies. It keeps the continuity and also shows she is never off duty."" Arguably the most iconic part of the Queen's look is the thing that has remained virtually unchanged throughout her reign: her famous shampoo and set is almost identical to the style she wore when she came to the throne in 1953. But for the change in colour as she got older and embraced her natural grey, it has retained the two distinctive wave curls at the front and firm and structured curls around the back, formed perfectly to host a crown or hat. The traditional style, set on rollers under a dryer, was the hairstyle of choice for many of Britain's fashion conscious women in the post-war years but while trends have moved on the Queen has been loyal to it ever since. ""Her hair is quite conventional for a woman her age, but it is a strong look, softened by curls to give it a gentleness,"" says royal and celebrity hairdresser Richard Ward. ""I think her hair sums up what we all really value about her,"" he says. ""It is sensible, practical and elegant."" Another of the Queen's most iconic style points is the famous top-handled Launer handbag. Unlike other classic designer bags such as the Hermes Birkin or the Chanel 2.55, which are popular with women aged from their 20s to their 70s, Launer is not as fashionable or desirable for younger women, says Charlotte Rogers, a luxury accessories expert. But there is still a big market for them in other countries, especially the Middle East. The Queen's royal seal of approval changes everything for a brand. ""The fact the Queen still uses Launer bags is huge,"" Rogers says. ""Royals are the ultimate influencers."" The handbags retail for around Â£1,500-Â£2,000, and the Queen is said to have a collection of over 200 in different colours and styles. It seems in her Jubilee year the Queen has become more influential than ever, which is no mean feat for a woman in her 90s, says Rogers. ""She's age appropriate, a style much like my grandmother used to wear for special occasions and I think she is influential to older ladies,"" she says. ""Pins and brooches were seen as so unfashionable and now I can't buy enough of them. They sell so quickly."" The Queen's clothes are not just style choices but also brand statements, steeped with meaning and influence. Whether she's wearing a jewelled gown or a tweed skirt every outfit says something about her and her role as an ambassador and figurehead. ""Her wardrobe is her communication,"" says Matthew Storey, curator at Historic Royal Palaces. She has to be prepared, reliable and traditional. But while walking the line of being accessible and reassuring her clothes also ""have to be worthy of royalty,"" Holmes says. ""It's part of the bedazzling of the crown. With the Queen her clothes are bespoke. You can't buy them but it means they can be seen and admired."" There's also a diplomatic role, subtle nods to a country or event shown in emblems or colours she wears. ""The subtle pink coloured dress she wore to the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games was chosen because it was on none of the national flags. It stood out but it also wasn't showing any allegiance,"" Storey says. Like other iconic brands she also means many different things to people. ""Like a work of art you interpret her in your own way,"" says Jeetendr Sehdev, author and celebrity branding expert. ""Do we really know who she is? I'm not sure we do. But what we do know is what she means to us and the things she stands for - her strength, boldness and authenticity - remain relevant even among young people."" Younger royals like Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, are clearly inspired by her, but the Queen stands far and above, he says. There's great affection for how she looks, Holmes says. She has a signature style that will forever remind people of her. ""No-one else dresses like her,"" she says. ""That's her job and it's profound."" All pictures are subject to copyright See her life in pictures Who is on - and off - the royal balcony Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gas costs about Â£2 per therm SSE Airtricity has announced a 42.7% increase in gas prices from 1 July - a move which will hit 186,000 customers in Northern Ireland. It comes on top of a 33% hike in the company's electricity prices which came into effect on Wednesday. The Consumer Council said the gas price increase would mean an additional Â£1.02 per day onto the typical household bill. This is the company's fourth increase in gas prices in just 15 months. It follows a39% rise in April 2022, a 21.8% rise in October 2021 and a 9.8% rise in April 2021. Huge increases in the wholesale cost of gas are the main reason for the increases as wholesale costs make up about half of the typical household bill. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager (NI), said this was ""not the news our customers want to hear"". ""The cost of purchasing natural gas has remained at its highest level in over a decade and at times in recent months, it has hit record highs,"" he said. ""We would encourage any customer who is having difficulty with their energy costs to please contact us."" The company said it had also made a Â£1m donation to a local charity to support people struggling with the cost of living. In March 2021, gas cost around 50 pence per therm, that cost has risen to around Â£2 per therm after hitting as high as Â£4.50 per therm late last year. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. The electricity price rise is the second increase in six months According to the Utility Regulator, the average household bill in Northern Ireland was Â£514 in April 2021 - that rose to Â£626 in October 2021, and Â£870 in April 2022. The announcement comes on the same day that a previously announced 33% rise in SSE Airtricity electricity prices comes into effect. The company is Northern Ireland's second largest electricity provider, with about 158,000 domestic customers. It is the second electricity price increase in six months for customers in Northern Ireland following a 9% rise last December. High and volatile prices on global wholesale energy markets are being blamed. The Consumer Council said the latest increase means the SSE standard tariff for electricity credit meter and pay-as-you-go customers would increase by Â£248 to just over Â£1,000 a year. Rival firms have also increased prices. In May, Electric Irelandincreased its prices by 30%, while Budget Irelandraised prices by 27%. Last week, Power NI announced a 27.5% increase to domestic electricity prices from 1 July 2022. This will add Â£204 onto the average annual household bill bringing it to Â£944 a year. Why are energy bills going up? 'Hidden pandemic' of rising cost of living Katie Daly said it felt like all the price increases were happening at once The latest has price hike come as UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise,hit a 40-year high. Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are pushing the cost of living up. Katie Daly told BBC News NI that she felt the Executive was ""letting us down big time"". ""A shop normally costing Â£50 is coming to Â£70, it's a jump when you're a single parent with two kids,"" she said. ""I used to get Â£10 electric on a Monday morning. I think it's about Â£25 a week now, that's over 100% increase. ""On my gas alone, I think I'm spending Â£100 a month. My son has asthma and I need to have heating on for him but the price of that is killing me."" Stephanie Waite said she had not used her gas heating in winter because of the high cost Stephanie Waite is also struggling with increasing power costs. ""I used to be able to be good for Â£20 a week on my electric, but now you're guaranteed about three days, four at best with Â£20,"" she said. ""The gas bills ... I haven't had my heating on over the winter, I bought myself a wee radiator just because it's either food or heating at the minute."" Peter McClenaghan from the Consumer Council, said: ""While price increases are happening due to global reasons it doesn't make it any easier for people to pay their bills, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. ""If you are struggling to pay your bills, the first thing to do is contact your supplier directly for help and information. There are measures that can be put in place."" Carers NI said the increases were putting increasing pressure on carers Craig Harrison from Carers NI said: ""Carers are being hit by the double whammy of pre-existing financial pressures that are just being compounded by these sky-rocketing energy costs."" He said the stress was having ""a massive impact"" on people's health.

""I think her hair sums up what we all really value about her,"" he says. ""It is sensible, practical and elegant."" Another of the Queen's most iconic style points is the famous top-handled Launer handbag. Unlike other classic designer bags such as the Hermes Birkin or the Chanel 2.55, which are popular with women aged from their 20s to their 70s, Launer is not as fashionable or desirable for younger women, says Charlotte Rogers, a luxury accessories expert. But there is still a big market for them in other countries, especially the Middle East. The Queen's royal seal of approval changes everything for a brand. ""The fact the Queen still uses Launer bags is huge,"" Rogers says. ""Royals are the ultimate influencers."" The handbags retail for around Â£1,500-Â£2,000, and the Queen is said to have a collection of over 200 in different colours and styles. It seems in her Jubilee year the Queen has become more influential than ever, which is no mean feat for a woman in her 90s, says Rogers. ""She's age appropriate, a style much like my grandmother used to wear for special occasions and I think she is influential to older ladies,"" she says. ""Pins and brooches were seen as so unfashionable and now I can't buy enough of them. They sell so quickly."" The Queen's clothes are not just style choices but also brand statements, steeped with meaning and influence. Whether she's wearing a jewelled gown or a tweed skirt every outfit says something about her and her role as an ambassador and figurehead. ""Her wardrobe is her communication,"" says Matthew Storey, curator at Historic Royal Palaces. She has to be prepared, reliable and traditional. But while walking the line of being accessible and reassuring her clothes also ""have to be worthy of royalty,"" Holmes says. ""It's part of the bedazzling of the crown. With the Queen her clothes are bespoke. You can't buy them but it means they can be seen and admired."" There's also a diplomatic role, subtle nods to a country or event shown in emblems or colours she wears. ""The subtle pink coloured dress she wore to the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games was chosen because it was on none of the national flags. It stood out but it also wasn't showing any allegiance,"" Storey says. Like other iconic brands she also means many different things to people. ""Like a work of art you interpret her in your own way,"" says Jeetendr Sehdev, author and celebrity branding expert. ""Do we really know who she is? I'm not sure we do. But what we do know is what she means to us and the things she stands for - her strength, boldness and authenticity - remain relevant even among young people."" Younger royals like Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, are clearly inspired by her, but the Queen stands far and above, he says. There's great affection for how she looks, Holmes says. She has a signature style that will forever remind people of her. ""No-one else dresses like her,"" she says. ""That's her job and it's profound."" All pictures are subject to copyright See her life in pictures Who is on - and off - the royal balcony Â© 2025 BBC.

"One of Boris Johnson's strongest cabinet allies has hit out out Tory MPs trying to oust him, accusing them of doing ""the opposition's work"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries claimed growing calls for the PM to resign were the result of a ""co-ordinated campaign"" by backbenchers. Criticism of Mr Johnson among Tory MPs has increased since Sue Gray's Partygate report last week. But Ms Dorries said the ""overwhelming"" majority still backed him. Twelve Conservative MPs have called on Mr Johnson to quit since the release of Ms Gray's report laid bare the scale of Covid rule-breaking in No 10. It takes the number now openly calling on him to resign to 28. Most of have written letters of no confidence in him, although the total number formally calling for a contest may be higher. Mr Johnson has dismissed calls for him to quit, adding it would not be ""responsible right now given everything that's going on"". Who are the Tory MPs calling on Johnson to go? How could Boris Johnson be voted out by Tory MPs? Explain why partygate did not breach code, PM told Under Tory party rules, 54 letters are required to set up a vote on the PM's position, a move which could eventually lead to a contest to replace him. Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench committee that organises leadership contests, knows exactly how many have been submitted. Nadine Dorries is urging Tory MPs to unite behind the prime minister Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One,external, Ms Dorries said the debate over Partygate had become a ""Westminster bubble issue"" and the public was ""ready to move on"". ""There is obviously, I think probably led by one or two individuals, a campaign behind the scenes to try, attempt to remove the prime minister for individual reasons to do with personal ambition or other reasons,"" she said. She added: ""The people who most want to get rid of Boris Johnson are Keir Starmer and the SNP"". ""I would just ask my colleagues to reflect on that, and do we really want to do the opposition's work - and do we really believe the public will vote for a party that they think is divided?"" Home Secretary Priti Patel has also backed the prime minister, telling Conservative MPs who want to remove him to ""forget it"", BBC political correspondent Helen Catt reports. Ms Patel told the Daily Mail that writing letters of no confidence was a ""sideshow"" and warned that the public ""wouldn't thank the Conservative Party for talking about itself at a time when people had anxieties, concerns [and] apprehensions"". She also warned colleagues against overshadowing the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, saying ""all the focus"" this weekend should be on the Queen and her ""long-standing dedicated service"". Despite the uncertainty over the number of no-confidence letters, there has been mounting speculation Mr Johnson could face a no-confidence vote soon. On Monday, former Tory leader Lord Hague said the PM was in ""real trouble"" and predicted a vote could take place as early as next week, when MPs return from their short early summer recess. But speaking earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab told Sky News he doubted the number of letters could be ""that high"". There is no consensus among Tory MPs about who should be their next leader, but Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat are among those being discussed as possible challengers. Chancellor Rishi Sunak was widely seen as a potential leadership rival to the PM, but his prospects are thought to have waned after he picked up his own Partygate fine and was embroiled in acontroversy over his wife's financesearlier this year. There's no obvious thread linking the MPs that have publicly called on the prime minister to go. Some of the calls have come in quick succession, others months apart. They've come from MPs elected in different years, with different ideologies. Some of them backed Boris Johnson at the last Tory leadership contest, others backed his rivals. Some Tory MPs are convinced there is a degree of co-ordination behind closed doors. One senior Tory told me he believes supporters of Jeremy Hunt are among those being particularly critical publicly. Others attribute the steady drip-drip of letters in recent days to a ripple effect. As soon as a few critical MPs came out publicly, they argue, others felt emboldened to do the same. Co-ordination or not, there is no doubt MPs do talk to each other - there are Whatsapp groups and sub-Whatsapp groups of Tory MPs.

Some of that chatter has been more muted as MPs are out of office for recess - with some arguing the Jubilee weekend is not the time for ""internal warfare"". But that could all liven up again quite quickly when they return next week. Meanwhile, the debate over the PM's future has been given fresh impetus after his standards adviser Lord Geidt called on him to explain how his own Partygate fine tallied with the rulebook for ministers, which says they have a duty to comply with the law. Along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson was fined for attending a birthday party for him in the Cabinet Room in June 2020. In a report on Monday,external, Lord Geidt wrote there was a ""legitimate question"" over whether this constituted a breach of the ministerial code. In a written reply, Mr Johnson said he had not fallen foul of the code because he had not broken Covid laws on purpose. In an interview with Mumsnet on Tuesday, the prime minister insisted he thought the gathering in the Cabinet Room counted as a work event, and he was ""very, very surprised"" and ""taken aback"" to have received a fine. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the prime minister of ignoring Lord Geidt's advice, and finding himself innocent of breaching ministerial rules in ""his own courtroom"". Adding that Mr Johnson was ""dodging questions"", she called for him to ""make a statement"" on his ""apparent breach"" of the rules.

"Sports Direct owner Frasers Group has bought Missguided for Â£20m, after the online fashion retailer collapsed into administration. Chief executive Michael Murray said the group, which also owns House of Fraser, was ""delighted to secure a long-term future"" for the fast fashion company. Some 87 staff will be made redundant and 147 are expected to move to Frasers Group, the BBC understands. Administrator Teneo would not comment on job losses. It will run the business for a transition period of around eight weeks. Frasers will then take it on as a ""standalone business"" within the group. Missguided has suffered from supply chain problems, rising freight costs and increasing competition from rivals. Suppliers had accused the business of leaving millions of pounds of debts unpaid. Frasers Group confirmed it had bought the intellectual property of Missguided and its sister brand Mennace. Mr Murray said: ""Missguided's digital-first approach to the latest trends in women's fashion will bring additional expertise to the wider Frasers Group."" Missguided fast fashion brand collapses Boohoo hit as shoppers return more clothes The Manchester-based business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009 and grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fashion players. But in the last few years it has struggled to make a profit. Last autumn it was rescued by the finance firm Alteri Investors, with Mr Passi stepping down as chief executive in April. Beth Davies ordered Â£200 worth of clothes from Missguided and they have not arrived Missguided customers have been tweeting the company to complain that orders have not arrived, returns not processed and refunds not received. Among them is Beth Davies, a 24-year-old business support manager from Sheffield, who ordered Â£200 of potential outfits for a wedding on Saturday. She received a reply that said an IT issue meant her order had not been sent by next day delivery. By then the news of Missguided's collapse had broken withi newspaper reporting the warehouse had been shut since Thursday,external- two days before Ms Davies placed her order. ""Yesterday I was at work feeling so frustrated,"" she said. ""They said it's on the way when that's clearly a lie if the warehouse has been shut since last week."" New owners Frasers Group said fulfilment of orders was the responsibility of administrator Teneo, which declined to comment. Prof Dilys Williams, director of the centre for sustainable fashion at London College of Fashion, said the company's collapse exposed the ""fragility"" of the fast fashion model. She said many customers were becoming more interested in sustainability and moving away from cheap, throwaway clothing. Missguided once had a lucrative sponsorship deal with reality dating show Love Islandbut this year the series has partnered with eBay to style the stars in second-hand pieces. ""The culture of being able to buy second hand and it being a great thing is a change in how people are thinking about fashion,"" Prof Williams told the BBC. However, the brand had also faced increased competition from fast fashion rivals such as Boohoo and Shein, a Chinese company which saw its popularity surge during the pandemic. Darcey Jupp, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said Frasers Group was taking a punt on Missguided as it was a different direction to its sports and premium brands. ""Operating Missguided as a standalone brand is a wise move, as its young target audience would not be inclined to shop at its other fascias like House of Fraser,"" she said. She added: ""Continuing its concessions in select Asda stores would be a good way to capture demand from convenience-seeking consumers."" The Frasers Group deal comes as it embarks on a modernisation strategy under a new boss,with plans to open up to 10 flagship Sports Direct stores across the UK. Mr Murray took over from founder Mike Ashley - his future father-in-law - in May. Missguided will become the latest troubled brand to join the group, after it snapped up Game, Evans Cycles, Jack Wills and Sofa.com in similar deals. Retailers Boohoo, Asos and JD Sports had also been rumoured to be interested in a potential rescue deal.

"Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook's parent company Meta, has announced that she is leaving the business after 14 years. Ms Sandberg announced her departurein a Facebook post,external, saying she hoped to focus on her foundation and philanthropic work in the future. Her departure comes as Meta faces a slowdown in advertising sales and more competition from rivals such as TikTok. Ms Sandberg is one of the most high-profile women in the tech industry. ""When I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years,"" wrote Ms Sandberg, known as a powerful second-in-command at the company. ""Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life."" Javier Olivan, currently Meta's chief growth officer, will take over Ms Sandberg's position in the company when she leaves. Ms Sandberg, whose husband died suddenly in 2015, is getting re-married this summer. She said she planned to leave the company in the autumn but would remain on the board. Following her announcement, shares in Meta fell 4%. Ms Sandberg joined Facebook when it was still a small company led by Mark Zuckerberg, a then-23 year-old Harvard dropout. A veteran of Google, she helped turn its advertising business into a profit powerhouse, as the company grew to include Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Last year, the company reported more than $117bn in revenue and said more than 2.8 billion people globally used one of its apps daily. This video can not be played COO of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg on the importance of female success in the workplace Books she wrote, including Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead - which she described as a ""sort of feminist manifesto"" - made her a global celebrity. But her star power faded as the company faced criticism for its handling of personal data in relation to political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and targeted adverts as well as its moderation of social media posts. Ms Sandberg, who was initially responsible for Facebook's response, appeared to acknowledge some of those challenges in her post, writing: ""The debate around social media has changed beyond recognition since those early days."" ""To say it hasn't always been easy is an understatement. But it should be hard,"" she wrote. ""The products we make have a huge impact, so we have the responsibility to build them in a way that protects privacy and keeps people safe."" In his own post, Mr Zuckerberg said Ms Sandberg's departure marked the ""end of an era"", noting that it was ""unusual"" for a business partnership like theirs to last so long. ""Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company,"" he added. ""She created opportunities for millions of people around the world, and she deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today."" He said Mr Olivan's responsibilities would differ from Ms Sandberg's, with Mr Olivan taking on a ""more traditional"" chief operating officer role that was more focused internally and operationally. Meta is facing new challenges as countries tighten social media regulations and iPhone maker Apple changes its privacy rules, hitting the social media firm's targeted ad business. Growth in the number of Facebook users in key markets, such as the US, has been stalled, and it has lost younger users to rivals such as TikTok. Mr Zuckerberg has been pushing the company to invest heavily in virtual and augmented reality platforms, which he sees as driving the firm's next phase of growth. He renamed the company Meta last year in honour of the shift to the ""metaverse"". What is the metaverse? Facebook chief Sandberg: 'Pay women well' How the star of Sheryl Sandberg dimmed Insider principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson said Ms Sandberg ""had an enormous impact on Facebook, Meta, and the broader business world"". ""She helped Facebook build a world-class ad-buying platform and develop ground-breaking ad formats, which enabled the company to become the second largest digital ad business in the world behind Google,"" she said. ""However, Facebook also faced huge scandals under her watch, including the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica privacy debacle in 2018, and the Capitol riots that took place after the 2020 election. And in 2022, Meta is facing a slowdown in user growth and ad revenue that is now testing the business foundation that the company was built on. ""The company needs to find a new way forward, and perhaps this was the best time for Sandberg to depart.""

"On Wednesday, jurors returned a verdict in the high-profile defamation case that has been fought for over a month between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard in the US state of Virginia. For six weeks, the court heard the tawdry details of Mr Depp and Ms Heard's volatile relationship, and its ultimate, unhappy end. Mr Depp sued his ex-wife for defamation over an opinion article she wrote for the Washington Post, alleging she was a domestic abuse victim, though it did not mention him by name. Ms Heard counter-sued. Jurors awarded Mr Depp - who denied abusing Ms Heard - $15m (Â£12m) in compensatory and punitive damages. Ms Heard won one of three counter-claims against Mr Depp and was awarded $2m in compensatory damages. Here is a look back at 10 key moments from court, which helped define this closely watched stand-off. This story contains descriptions of violence readers may find upsetting. To some observers, the relationship between Ms Heard and Mr Depp could be summed up in these two words: mutual abuse. This was the description used by clinical psychologist Laurel Anderson, Ms Heard and Mr Depp's former marriage counsellor. Called to the stand by Mr Depp's team, Dr Anderson described a volatile relationship, with both parties threatening to walk out of sessions amid arguments. But in Dr Anderson's view, Ms Heard was often the instigator of these fights. Mr Depp had been ""well controlled"" for decades before meeting Ms Heard, Dr Anderson said, and did not engage in violence with past partners. ""With Ms Heard, he was triggered. They engaged in what I saw as mutual abuse,"" she told the jury. On more than one occasion Ms Heard initiated violent interactions in an effort to prevent Mr Depp from leaving, she said. ""It was a point of pride to her, if she felt disrespected, to initiate a fight,"" the court heard. Over four days of testimony, Mr Depp was pressed on a number of his text messages and emails featuring graphic insults of his ex-wife. In one instance, he was asked about a 2013 text exchange with British actor Paul Bettany. ""Let's burn her,"" Mr Depp had written, referring to Ms Heard. ""Let's drown her before we burn her"". He then made a further obscene suggestion ""to make sure she is dead"". The actor told jurors he was ""ashamed"" of the messages, and that they were an attempt at humour based on a Monty Python sketch. ""This is a film we'd all watch when we were 10 - it's just irreverent and abstract humour,"" he said. Called to the stand by Mr Depp's team, forensic psychologist Dr Shannon Curry told jurors she believed Amber Heard suffered from twin diagnoses: borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. Dr Curry said she had reached her conclusion after spending about 12 hours with Ms Heard in December 2021, conducting mental health tests and reviewing her medical records. Borderline personality is a disease of instability, Dr Curry said, marked by ""a lot of anger, cruelty toward people less powerful and attention seeking"". The behaviours are ""driven by an underlying fear of abandonment"", she said, following audio shared in court of Ms Heard begging Mr Depp not to leave her. This video can not be played Psychologist says Amber Heard has two personality disorders But Dr Curry's diagnoses were rejected by psychologist Dr Dawn Hughes, who was called by Ms Heard's team. Instead, Dr Hughes diagnosed Ms Heard with post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by ""intimate partner violence by Mr Depp"". Throughout the trial, jurors heard two competing accounts of Mr Depp's substance use. To hear Mr Depp tell it, he was sober for much of his relationship with Ms Heard after detoxing from the opioid Oxycodone in 2014. But Ms Heard's described a different Mr Depp - one prone to alcohol and drug binges despite her repeated pleas for him to get clean. According to Ms Heard, Mr Depp frequently abused alcohol, cocaine and painkillers. ""He would pass out, get sick, lose control of himself,"" she said. According to testimony, this behaviour occurred in front of Mr Depp's children. In one instance raised at trial, the long-time manager of the actor's private island in the Bahamas said she recalled seeing Mr Depp passed out in the sand in front of his son. Mr Depp rejected Ms Heard's account of his drug use, saying her characterisation was ""grossly embellished"" and ""plainly false"". His team pointed out that she also drank and sometimes used drugs. It depends who is asked. Again, jurors were presented two very different pictures of the trial's central characters. Ms Heard told the court the 'Monster' was the dark side of her ex-husband, the volatile and violent version of him, who emerged when Mr Depp was drunk or high. Text messages sent by Mr Depp to staff and friends seemed to support this description. ""Amber and I have been absolutely perfect... I have locked my monster child away in a cage deep within and it has worked,"" he wrote on one occasion. But while on the stand, Mr Depp said the ""monster"" was a phrase he used just to mollify his then-wife in an attempt to avoid conflict. Asked why he used the phrase himself, he responded: ""Because I heard it all the time."" While on the stand, Mr Depp rejected his former partner's claims of abuse outright, telling jurors he had ""never struck Ms Heard in that way, nor have I struck any woman in my life"". Instead, Mr Depp alleged that he suffered at the hands of Ms Heard, who abused and demeaned him. ""It could begin with a slap, it could begin with a shove. it could begin with throwing a TV remote at my head,"" he said. ""She [Ms Heard] has a need for conflict, she has a need for violence. It erupts out of nowhere"". Mr Depp's team used Ms Heard's own words - audio recordings and handwritten notes - to underline these claims. In one recording, Ms Heard can be heard admitting to ""hitting"" Mr Depp, before mocking him and calling him a baby. And in a letter to Mr Depp she apologised for getting ""crazy"". ""I'm sorry I hurt you,"" Ms Heard wrote. ""I can get wicked when I'm hurt"". Jurors heard several accounts - some overlapping, many contradictory - of a 2015 trip to Australia, where Mr Depp was shooting a film for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. According Mr Depp, he lost the tip of his middle finger during an explosive fight with his then-wife, when she threw a vodka bottle at him, which smashed. Mr Depp told jurors he went into shock and used blood from his injury to write messages to Heard on the wall. ""I don't know what a nervous breakdown feels like, but that's probably the closest I've ever been,"" he said. Ms Heard denied injuring his finger and said Mr Depp sexually assaulted her that night with a liquor bottle. A surgeon called by Ms Heard's team also disputed Mr Depp's account, saying his description of events was unlikely, in large part because his fingernail remained in tact. Dr Richard Moore said that if events occurred like Mr Depp had described, his fingernail would have been damaged by the bottle. While Mr Depp and Ms Heard brought an unusual amount of star power to the Fairfax courthouse, it was Mr Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, who turned out to be the trial's breakout star. The young lawyer from California caught the attention of millions amid the defamation trial. T-shirts adorned with her name and hashtags praising her made the rounds on social media. Who is Johnny Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez? Ms Vasquez's sharp style became especially apparent in her cross-examination of Amber Heard. Exchanges between the two occasionally turned tense. In one instance, the two sparred over an image of spilled wine. It is one of several pictures Ms Heard has presented, allegedly from a huge fight the couple had in 2016 which ended with Mr Depp assaulting her. During Ms Vasquez's questioning, Ms Heard turned to jurors and claimed the photos had been redacted or edited by Mr Depp's lawyers to benefit her ex-husband's case. ""I'd appreciate if you wouldn't be making arguments to the jury,"" Ms Vasquez said sternly. ""I didn't ask you about anything"". British supermodel Kate Moss was a last-minute addition to the witness list. Ms Moss, who was in a relationship with Mr Depp between 1994 and 1998, was called by the actor's team in the last week of trial to rebut a rumour invoked by Ms Heard suggesting that her ex-husband had shoved the model down the stairs in the 1990s. Ms Heard had described a fight in 2015 with Mr Depp in which she said she hit Mr Depp because he had swung at her sister while she was standing at the top of a staircase. ""I just, in my head, instantly think of Kate Moss and the stairs and I swung at him,"" Ms Heard said. In her brief testimony over video call, Ms Moss denied that Mr Depp had ever pushed her down the stairs. ""There had been a rainstorm and as I left the room I slid down the stairs and I hurt my back,"" Ms. Moss said. ""He came running back to help me and carried me to my room and got me medical attention."" ""He never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs,"" Ms. Moss said. This video can not be played Watch Kate Moss testify: ""Did Mr Depp push you down the stairs?"" On the last day of testimony, Ms Heard delivered emotional testimony about the harassment she said she has endured following her divorce from Mr Depp. ""I receive hundreds of death threats regularly if not daily. Thousands since this trial has started. People mocking, mocking my testimony about being assaulted,"" she said. ""Every single day I have to relive the trauma"". She called the court case ""horrible"" and ""humiliating"". ""Perhaps it's easy to forget, but I am a human being,"" she said. ""As I stand here today, I can't have a career. I can't even have people associate with me because of the threats and the attacks that they will have to endure"". Who is Johnny Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez?

"The pair divorced in 2016, just 15 months after getting married The sequel to Johnny Depp and ex-wife Amber Heard's bitter legal battle has come to Virginia. After losing the first round - a libel trial set in the UK - Depp, 58, sued Heard, 35, for $50m (Â£38m) over an op-ed she wrote in The Washington Post in which she claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse. Heard has sued back, with a $100m counterclaim against Depp. The defamation trial is expected to feature painful accusations of domestic abuse. It will be broadcast live and involve a number of high-profile witnesses, including James Franco, Paul Bettany and Elon Musk. As the case opened on Tuesday, here's a look at how we got here and what might happen next. Depp and Heard started dating in early 2012, after meeting on the set of The Rum Diary a few years earlier. By 2015, they were married. But just 15 months after they made it official, it was over. Heard filed for a divorce and a restraining order, appearing in a Los Angeles court with a bruised cheek. She said her then-husband - 23 years her senior - had ""violently"" attacked her and thrown a mobile phone at her face with ""extreme force"". There were other alleged instances of harassment as well - ""excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse"", she wrote in court filings, ""angry, hostile, humiliating and threatening assaults"". Depp denied the abuse. A judge granted Heard a temporary restraining order, but hours before a civil trial over the order was to begin, she and the Pirates of the Caribbean star released a joint statement saying they had put their dispute to rest. ""Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm."" Depp gave Heard $7m as part of their divorce settlement, which she pledged to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union - something Depp's team now disputes. For a period, all seemed civil between the former couple. ""He walked away, she walked away - that was it,"" said journalist and author Cooper Lawrence, who has written extensively on celebrity culture. Depp, pictured outside court in London, has denied all abuse But then in December 2018, Heard wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post, describing her experience as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"". ""I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out,"" she wrote. ""I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse."" She did not mention her ex-husband or any other alleged perpetrator by name. But according to Depp's complaint, these three sentences amount to defamation anyway, derailing his career and ""incalculably"" damaging his reputation. ""The op-ed's clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false,"" the star's lawyer wrote in the complaint. ""Her allegationsâ¦ are part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career."" Depp's legal team successfully argued that the trial should be held in Virginia - home to two Washington Post offices and where the paper is physically published. ""It's not uncommon for a plaintiff to choose the forum,"" said Ryan Baker, a Los Angeles attorney who has represented clients in defamation cases. ""But that doesn't explain why they chose Virginia over California."" The reason, Mr Baker said, is probably linked to something called an Anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) law. These state statutes are essentially extensions of the First Amendment, giving added protection to speech and other activities that relate to matters of public interest. ""If someone, like Amber Heard, writes something about domestic violence and spousal abuse - those are clearly matters of public interest,"" Mr Baker said. ""She has some form of immunity for saying those things."" In 2018, Amber Heard described feeling ""culture's wrath"" as a victim of domestic abuse Both Virginia and California have their own versions of Anti-SLAPP laws, but California's are stronger. There, defendants like Heard are able to invoke the protection immediately. Virginia, by contrast, does not allow defendants to use this protection in the early phases of legal proceedings. ""In California, I think Heard would have just knocked this case out right away,"" Mr Baker said. Depp will still have to overcome an Anti-SLAPP argument from his ex-wife. Last month, a Virginia judge ruled that Heard could raise the statute at trial, arguing her op-ed is protected speech. ""It will be a real mountain to climb"" for Depp, Mr Baker added, ""he's just able to climb it a lot later in Virginia"". Sort of. In 2018 - before Heard's op-ed was published - Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd, publishers of British newspaper The Sun for libel over an article that referred to him as a ""wife beater"". But while this legal battle was between Depp and The Sun, the three-week trial in London looked more like a feud between former spouses. Depp's odds of success were better in England than the US, where a defamed person has to prove what was said about them isn't true. Across the Atlantic it's the opposite: the burden of proof rests with the alleged slanderer, who has to prove what they said is true. Still, he lost. A British judge ruled that the ""great majority"" of Heard's accusations of abuse could be proven to the civil standard - meaning the abuse was more likely than not to have occurred. Last year, Depp's appeal in that case was denied. There are around 120 people on the potential witnesses list. It's a star-studded assortment: Elon Musk, Ellen Barkin, Paul Bettany and James Franco. The Tesla CEO is expected to testify on behalf of Heard. Musk, who reportedly dated Heard between 2016-18, offered to provide ""24/7 security"" to the Justice League and Aquaman star to protect her from Depp, according to text messages read at the London libel trial. Franco, too, is expected to speak on Heard's behalf. The actress has said she confided in Franco about bruises she sustained in an alleged fight with Depp. Paul Bettany, who has called Depp the ""kindest, gentlest"" man he knows, will take the side of his friend. Bettany will probably face questions about text messages exchanged between him and Depp in 2013. ""It's going to be a circus,"" said journalist Cooper Lawrence. ""Now we have to hear from all these really famous people because they were witness to all of this, they were there for it,"" she added. Mobs formed daily during Depp's libel trial in London The upcoming battle - expected to last up to six weeks - will in many ways be a rerun of the London trial, exposing lurid details about Depp and Heard's former relationship, with accusations of abuse aimed at both sides. Heard is sure to repeat claims of verbal and physical assault by a volatile Depp throughout their relationship. Depp, in turn, will probably return to his assertions that Heard was the aggressor and has fabricated her account as a victim for financial and reputational gain. ""I don't think either one of them comes out of this holding their heads high,"" Ms Lawrence said. Indeed, whatever the legal outcome, Depp's decision to aggressively litigate has ensured an immense amount of attention is trained on his personal life. ""It seems to me that his strategy may be backfiring,"" Mr Baker said. ""There are now endless opportunities for a peanut gallery to form. At the end of the day, is it better just to move on?""

"The train drivers' union Aslef has rejected the latest 4.2% pay deal from ScotRail. The union's national executive said it would ballot for industrial action unless ScotRail offered further talks. Many drivers have been refusing to work overtime or on rest days during the pay dispute. The driver shortage has led to the now-nationalised train operator cutting a third of services under a temporary timetable. ScotRail said it was frustrated by the decision of Aslef and described the decision not to put the improved pay deal to its members as ""astonishing"". Transport Scotland said it was disappointed the union had rejected a deal which it described as ""both fair and affordable"". Government optimistic over new ScotRail pay offer Hundreds of ScotRail Sunday services cancelled Scotland's Transport Minister Jenny Gilruth had said earlier this week she was hopeful the 4.2% pay offer would resolve the dispute. However, it was turned down by a meeting of Aslef's national executive committee on Wednesday. Scottish organiser Kevin Lindsay said: ""Aslef wants to negotiate a fair deal for our members, we are once again calling on ScotRail to return to the talks, so we can negotiate a fair pay offer that we can put to our members."" ScotRail's service delivery director, David Simpson, urged the union to reconsider the pay offer, which includes a improved maternity and adoption leave and a 10% increase in the Sunday working allowance. He said: ""We're incredibly disappointed and frustrated that Aslef bosses have rejected this improved pay offer. It's astonishing that they will not even put this offer to their members. ""Our substantially improved pay offer reflects the cost-of-living challenges faced by families across the country, while balancing it against the need to provide value for the taxpayer. ""We have offered to meet Aslef but, in the meantime, would urge them to reconsider this offer in the interest of their members and the future of the railway in Scotland."" ScotRail say they are astonished, incredibly disappointed and frustrated that Aslef won't even put the offer to members. They've offered further talks,  but they also want Aslef to reconsider the existing offer. It's worth remembering that ScotRail said last week that the 4.2% offer was final. ScotRail introduced an emergency timetable last month to give customers a degree of certainty about services after being hit by numerous cancellations. But the timetable involved almost 700 fewer services a day, with many later trains no longer running. The train operator has introduced extra services for Wednesday's Scotland v Ukraine World Cup play-off. Extra evening services were also provided on Friday and Saturday last week, but Sunday again saw more than 300 cancellations. ScotRail had said it will again provide extra Friday and Saturday services this coming weekend. Separately from the Aslef pay dispute, ScotRail also faces a threat of strike action by RMT members who have been offered a 2.2% pay rise. UK-wide action isalso possible this summer by RMT memberswho are in dispute with Network Rail, although talks are continuing. ScotRail has said the shortage of available drivers is due to disruption to training during Covid pandemic, forcing it to ask the existing workforce to work extra hours. The Scottish government has said a train driver in Scotland typically earns about Â£50,000, and has urged workers to ask for ""sensible"" pay increases during the ""precarious"" economic situation. Minister urges people to be 'sensible' over pay A spokesperson for Transport Scotland said: ""We are disappointed that Aslef, having given due consideration to the terms they negotiated, have decided to reject the very good offer on the table, an offer which is in part self-funded through increased revenue and efficiencies. ""While we understand any unions desire to obtain the best deal possible for their members, the stark realities of the financial pressures we are facing across government are evidenced by the spending review published just yesterday. ""We all need to work together to make nationalisation a success. Ministers are committed to ensuring that the railway unions are part of that success. ""However, to be part of the vision moving forward, the unions need to agree on a deal that is both fair and affordable, particularly in the context of wider public sector pay policy."" The Scottish Conservatives' transport spokesman Graham Simpson accused the government of ""complacency"" over the situation. ""It's clear she [Jenny Gilruth] and the SNP government just assumed the offer would be accepted,"" he said. ""Now, it appears, we're back to square one and the Scottish public will have to endure the woefully-inadequate reduced ScotRail timetable for even longer.""

"Clover is known to almost 4,500 Facebook followers as Sainsbury's Cat A social media star cat that vanished from its adopted home at a supermarket has been located 25 miles away. Clover, known to almost 4,500 Facebook followers as Sainsbury's Cat, is believed to have disappeared from Cardiff's Thornhill store on 21 May. She was found in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, by a volunteer who tracked her down, with the help of cat biscuits. Owner Sarah Hamilton, who owns two other cats named Daisy and Violet, said she was happy to have Clover back. Court fight looms over Sainsbury's cat ban Tesco cat Pumpkin defies Norwich supermarket 'ban' Missing cat hitched a ride on supermarket van in Cornwall The GP said she was contacted to say she had been found at about 22:00 BST on Monday. She said: ""The lady who went to find her last night, she saw something on a community Facebook page in Brynmawr. Someone had seen a cat that looked like Clover. ""They went out in the dead of night and managed to find her in quite a quiet area."" Clover, who is 15 years old, was found with her collar missing. She went missing from her usual Sainsbury's haunt about 10 days before being found But she was identified after her microchip was scanned. Dr Hamilton said Clover now spends most of her time at Sainsbury's. She has been going there for about seven years. Her Facebook page shows she spends time there snoozing in trolleys, snoozing on bags of soil and snoozing among potted plants. During her waking hours she has been known to pose for passing photographers. Mum-of-three Dr Hamilton said: ""She likes the attention and the free food."" Daisy and Violet are happy to live at the 49-year-old's Cardiff home. Dr Hamilton sometimes checks Facebook to see how Clover is doing and said it was ""lovely"" to see her keeping people company during the first wave of pandemic. ""Despite everything Clover was still there doing her thing,"" Dr Hamilton said.

"Learners say they have paid more than Â£200 for a test - more than twice the standard fee Driving tests are being bulk booked and resold for profit, as a chronic backlog means learners are otherwise waiting months for a test date. Learner drivers say they have paid more than Â£200 for a practical test - more than twice the standard fee. One operator said it used automated software to book tests, and the BBC has seen evidence encouraging driving instructors to sell tests for profit. The DVSA urged applicants to only book tests via its official website. The demand for driving tests, caused by the pandemic, means in many places - including London, Birmingham and Cardiff - tests aren't available to book online for up to six months. At other centres, the earliest availability is September or October. It has seen many learners turn towards a secondary market. Some are paying a nominal fee to companies which find them cancelled tests. Others are buying from sellers which offer tests for vastly inflated prices. Amelia, not her real name, told the BBC she had paid Â£210 for a cancelled test through her instructor in London. The standard fee is Â£62 for a weekday test and Â£75 for one in an evening, at the weekend or over a bank holiday, if booked through the Driving Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The DVSA is the official body that carries out driving tests in Great Britain. ""It was very on-the-go,"" 23-year-old Amelia said. ""My driving instructor would call me and say, 'quick, there's a cancellation, do you want it?' The day we booked my test it all happened within a three or four-minute phone call."" She said she'd had to reply with a picture of her provisional licence number, after which she received a reference number allowing her to change the test booking with her own details. Another driver said her instructor had paid Â£235 for her test. A third paid Â£186 - although Â£54 of this was for the car hire and Â£62 for the standard test fee. Some learners face 10-month wait for driving tests Driving tests resume but learners fight for slots 'I can't get a driving test until next year' The BBC has looked into how this is possible. One operator claimed to be using ""AI-powered software"" to scoop up vacant test slots as soon as they became available on the DVSA website. They said they used software that constantly refreshes the agency's booking website, together with VPNs, or virtual private networks, to hide their computer's identity, meaning it avoided being banned. They sent an email - seen by the BBC - to driving instructors, encouraging them to use their service to profit from pupils. An email sent to driving instructors encouraging them to profit from their pupils When we contacted them, they said: ""This softwareâ¦ [is] like if you're pressing on the search button. It just automates your press, or clicks, on the button."" We also found multiple posts on Facebook Marketplace and within some Facebook groups, offering a variety of test times for sale. Behind such posts are people like Alex, who runs a ""short-notice driving exam business"". He posted an advert on Facebook claiming he ""can guarantee exam bookings within three weeks"". The advert said approved driving instructors who work with him ""make upwards of Â£400-Â£600 a week"" by reselling exams to pupils. When contacted, Alex would not reveal how his business booked tests. But the BBC found one way of booking a slot and then transferring it - or potentially selling it - to someone else. An advert on Facebook, which claims instructors can make over Â£400 by reselling tests (ADIs stands for 'approved driving instructors') Learners only have access to the main DVSA booking system, where they have to manually search for available test dates. They can only book one test per person. And if they want to change their test date, they have to find an alternative one manually. However, we registered on the DVSA's site as a fake driving school, giving us access to a different part of the booking system - one that is not available to most learners. The system is intended to allow driving schools to book tests for multiple pupils - using a single contact number and email address. But the BBC found there was little verification to check who was signing up. It took us five minutes to register, with no requirement for official documentation. After receiving a simple verification code by email, we were given access. Once inside we were able to set alerts for when tests became available and could book multiple tests on the account. And while each booking still required a different provisional licence number, the system allowed exams to be swapped between candidates. In effect, anyone with instructors' access, could purchase a test - either one in the distant future, or a cancellation - and then sell it on at a premium by swapping appointments. We also found it was possible to book tests without the provisional licence holder ever knowing. To test the system, we booked a practical driving test, using a BBC email address and the provisional licence number of a learner, who had given us their permission. There was no verification required on the learner drivers' part and the booking confirmation was sent to our email address - meaning the learner would not know about the booking. When challenged on whether the booking system was robust enough, the DVSA said the system was ""imperfect"" as it ""relies on trust"". It said it was only illegal to book a driving test using someone else's details without their consent. Charles Moffat, chairman of the Approved Driving Instructors' National Joint Council, the UK's leading driver instructor association, said the organisation had heard accounts of tests being resold for a profit. ""We abhor such practice and will always report such conduct to the DVSA,"" he added. The DVSA said it would continue to do all it could to provide as many tests as possible, including conducting out-of-hours testing and recruiting more examiners. DVSA chief executive Loveday Ryder said in a statement to the BBC: ""We've already put in place measures to monitor and prevent bots from accessing our systems while also strengthening our firewall to tackle the issue. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to crack down on companies that are exploiting learner drivers. ""We've closed the system to new registrations and will rapidly close down accounts that do not belong to driving instructors and driving schools. We'll also be taking further steps to make sure all future accounts are linked to driving instructors  and those with training businesses."" As of 2 June the DVSA has reduced the number of times a driving test appointment can be changed from 10 to the pre-pandemic limit of six. It has also stopped accepting new automatic online registrations to use the service - any new applications must be made by email - and has stopped accepting any new registrations from companies who do not directly employ a driving instructor.

"Gas costs about Â£2 per therm SSE Airtricity has announced a 42.7% increase in gas prices from 1 July - a move which will hit 186,000 customers in Northern Ireland. It comes on top of a 33% hike in the company's electricity prices which came into effect on Wednesday. The Consumer Council said the gas price increase would mean an additional Â£1.02 per day onto the typical household bill. This is the company's fourth increase in gas prices in just 15 months. It follows a39% rise in April 2022, a 21.8% rise in October 2021 and a 9.8% rise in April 2021. Huge increases in the wholesale cost of gas are the main reason for the increases as wholesale costs make up about half of the typical household bill. Andrew Greer, SSE Airtricity general manager (NI), said this was ""not the news our customers want to hear"". ""The cost of purchasing natural gas has remained at its highest level in over a decade and at times in recent months, it has hit record highs,"" he said. ""We would encourage any customer who is having difficulty with their energy costs to please contact us."" The company said it had also made a Â£1m donation to a local charity to support people struggling with the cost of living. In March 2021, gas cost around 50 pence per therm, that cost has risen to around Â£2 per therm after hitting as high as Â£4.50 per therm late last year. Their tariffs are independently scrutinised and approved by the Utility Regulator in consultation with the Consumer Council and the Department for the Economy. The electricity price rise is the second increase in six months According to the Utility Regulator, the average household bill in Northern Ireland was Â£514 in April 2021 - that rose to Â£626 in October 2021, and Â£870 in April 2022. The announcement comes on the same day that a previously announced 33% rise in SSE Airtricity electricity prices comes into effect. The company is Northern Ireland's second largest electricity provider, with about 158,000 domestic customers. It is the second electricity price increase in six months for customers in Northern Ireland following a 9% rise last December. High and volatile prices on global wholesale energy markets are being blamed. The Consumer Council said the latest increase means the SSE standard tariff for electricity credit meter and pay-as-you-go customers would increase by Â£248 to just over Â£1,000 a year. Rival firms have also increased prices. In May, Electric Irelandincreased its prices by 30%, while Budget Irelandraised prices by 27%. Last week, Power NI announced a 27.5% increase to domestic electricity prices from 1 July 2022. This will add Â£204 onto the average annual household bill bringing it to Â£944 a year. Why are energy bills going up? 'Hidden pandemic' of rising cost of living Katie Daly said it felt like all the price increases were happening at once The latest has price hike come as UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise,hit a 40-year high. Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are pushing the cost of living up. Katie Daly told BBC News NI that she felt the Executive was ""letting us down big time"". ""A shop normally costing Â£50 is coming to Â£70, it's a jump when you're a single parent with two kids,"" she said. ""I used to get Â£10 electric on a Monday morning. I think it's about Â£25 a week now, that's over 100% increase. ""On my gas alone, I think I'm spending Â£100 a month. My son has asthma and I need to have heating on for him but the price of that is killing me."" Stephanie Waite said she had not used her gas heating in winter because of the high cost Stephanie Waite is also struggling with increasing power costs. ""I used to be able to be good for Â£20 a week on my electric, but now you're guaranteed about three days, four at best with Â£20,"" she said. ""The gas bills ... I haven't had my heating on over the winter, I bought myself a wee radiator just because it's either food or heating at the minute."" Peter McClenaghan from the Consumer Council, said: ""While price increases are happening due to global reasons it doesn't make it any easier for people to pay their bills, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. ""If you are struggling to pay your bills, the first thing to do is contact your supplier directly for help and information. There are measures that can be put in place."" Carers NI said the increases were putting increasing pressure on carers Craig Harrison from Carers NI said: ""Carers are being hit by the double whammy of pre-existing financial pressures that are just being compounded by these sky-rocketing energy costs."" He said the stress was having ""a massive impact"" on people's health.

"Sports Direct owner Frasers Group has bought Missguided for Â£20m, after the online fashion retailer collapsed into administration. Chief executive Michael Murray said the group, which also owns House of Fraser, was ""delighted to secure a long-term future"" for the fast fashion company. Some 87 staff will be made redundant and 147 are expected to move to Frasers Group, the BBC understands. Administrator Teneo would not comment on job losses. It will run the business for a transition period of around eight weeks. Frasers will then take it on as a ""standalone business"" within the group. Missguided has suffered from supply chain problems, rising freight costs and increasing competition from rivals. Suppliers had accused the business of leaving millions of pounds of debts unpaid. Frasers Group confirmed it had bought the intellectual property of Missguided and its sister brand Mennace. Mr Murray said: ""Missguided's digital-first approach to the latest trends in women's fashion will bring additional expertise to the wider Frasers Group."" Missguided fast fashion brand collapses Boohoo hit as shoppers return more clothes The Manchester-based business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009 and grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fashion players. But in the last few years it has struggled to make a profit. Last autumn it was rescued by the finance firm Alteri Investors, with Mr Passi stepping down as chief executive in April. Beth Davies ordered Â£200 worth of clothes from Missguided and they have not arrived Missguided customers have been tweeting the company to complain that orders have not arrived, returns not processed and refunds not received. Among them is Beth Davies, a 24-year-old business support manager from Sheffield, who ordered Â£200 of potential outfits for a wedding on Saturday. She received a reply that said an IT issue meant her order had not been sent by next day delivery. By then the news of Missguided's collapse had broken withi newspaper reporting the warehouse had been shut since Thursday,external- two days before Ms Davies placed her order. ""Yesterday I was at work feeling so frustrated,"" she said. ""They said it's on the way when that's clearly a lie if the warehouse has been shut since last week."" New owners Frasers Group said fulfilment of orders was the responsibility of administrator Teneo, which declined to comment. Prof Dilys Williams, director of the centre for sustainable fashion at London College of Fashion, said the company's collapse exposed the ""fragility"" of the fast fashion model. She said many customers were becoming more interested in sustainability and moving away from cheap, throwaway clothing. Missguided once had a lucrative sponsorship deal with reality dating show Love Islandbut this year the series has partnered with eBay to style the stars in second-hand pieces. ""The culture of being able to buy second hand and it being a great thing is a change in how people are thinking about fashion,"" Prof Williams told the BBC. However, the brand had also faced increased competition from fast fashion rivals such as Boohoo and Shein, a Chinese company which saw its popularity surge during the pandemic. Darcey Jupp, apparel analyst at GlobalData, said Frasers Group was taking a punt on Missguided as it was a different direction to its sports and premium brands. ""Operating Missguided as a standalone brand is a wise move, as its young target audience would not be inclined to shop at its other fascias like House of Fraser,"" she said. She added: ""Continuing its concessions in select Asda stores would be a good way to capture demand from convenience-seeking consumers."" The Frasers Group deal comes as it embarks on a modernisation strategy under a new boss,with plans to open up to 10 flagship Sports Direct stores across the UK. Mr Murray took over from founder Mike Ashley - his future father-in-law - in May. Missguided will become the latest troubled brand to join the group, after it snapped up Game, Evans Cycles, Jack Wills and Sofa.com in similar deals. Retailers Boohoo, Asos and JD Sports had also been rumoured to be interested in a potential rescue deal.

"She's one of the most photographed women in history and over the past 70 years has defined what it means to dress like a queen. Not trendsetting or daring, but iconic. She's become famous for her brightly coloured dresses and coats paired with a matching hat, accessorised with her signature square handbag, three strand pearl necklace and a jewelled brooch. It sounds simple but the Queen's style has become a powerful formula. It's a style that has been honed and refined over seven decades, helped by the close relationships she has developed with trusted designers and dressers. ""Royal fashion is fun, powerful and steeped with meaning,"" says author and royal fashion commentator Elizabeth Holmes. ""Her image is a huge part of her legacy."" The Queen has always had a very clear idea of what she wanted to look like, says historian Michael Pick. ""People have said she has no idea about clothes, but that is simply not true. She is very astute about what suits her,"" Pick says. When she was in her 20s, Princess Elizabeth began working with designer Norman Hartnell, a relationship she inherited from the Queen Mother. Full-skirted dresses with a nipped in waist, influenced by French couture, were paired with white fur stoles and diamond tiaras. As she took on her new role as Queen, Hartnell helped her to dazzle her way through state banquets and royal tours in a host of tulle and satin gowns, intricately embellished with seed pearls, crystals and beads. Hartnell also created two of the most important dresses she would ever wear - her wedding dress and the gown she wore for her coronation. He describes the process as a collaboration.  ""For her coronation dress Hartnell produced about eight designs and she chose elements from them all and made it her own,"" Pick says. For the Queen, working with the same people was not just about trust, but was also down to necessity. Hartnell had the largest couture house in London along with the largest embroidery workroom, and for someone as busy as the Queen who needed hundreds of new outfits each year, it meant he had the capacity to design and produce what she needed. Still, the scale of the job meant she also asked designer Hardy Amies to work with her, beginning with a wardrobe of looks for a tour of Canada in 1951. Amies led the Queen into a slightly more crisp and understated look, with tailored day clothes and sleeker eveningwear. Then Ian Thomas took her through the 1970s and 1980s in a flurry of brightly coloured chiffon, floral prints and bows. For the last 24 years her outfits have been designed and produced in-house by a small team of around 10 people, led by her personal dresser Angela Kelly. Each item the Queen wears is bespoke, and before the pandemic she was attending more then 300 engagements a year. ""It's a huge amount of work,"" Pick says. ""You don't want the monarch wearing something someone else is wearing. The public expects something different. ""Hartnell and Amies made her more individual, while Angela Kelly has been very clever and managed to take her individual style and make it sparkle."" When the Queen steps out in public every aspect of her appearance has been meticulously planned. Fabrics are checked to see how they drape or might behave in a breeze. The bright colours, chosen for the season and occasion, give instant impact so that she stands out in a crowd. A hat gives her slight stature more height and highlights her face. She wears sensible block-heeled shoes - handmade and worn in by Kelly herself to make sure they are comfortable - and there is always a clear umbrella with a colour-matched trim on standby, so even the unpredictable British weather won't get in her way. This uniform-way of dressing maximises her comfort on long days, but also helps define her role, says Elizabeth Holmes. ""Her job is to be a calm and consistent presence. Her clothes are a mix of knowing what to expect but also with an ability to surprise and delight. ""Even in the casual moments there is a sense of uniform, with her headscarf and wellies. It keeps the continuity and also shows she is never off duty."" Arguably the most iconic part of the Queen's look is the thing that has remained virtually unchanged throughout her reign: her famous shampoo and set is almost identical to the style she wore when she came to the throne in 1953. But for the change in colour as she got older and embraced her natural grey, it has retained the two distinctive wave curls at the front and firm and structured curls around the back, formed perfectly to host a crown or hat. The traditional style, set on rollers under a dryer, was the hairstyle of choice for many of Britain's fashion conscious women in the post-war years but while trends have moved on the Queen has been loyal to it ever since. ""Her hair is quite conventional for a woman her age, but it is a strong look, softened by curls to give it a gentleness,"" says royal and celebrity hairdresser Richard Ward. ""I think her hair sums up what we all really value about her,"" he says. ""It is sensible, practical and elegant."" Another of the Queen's most iconic style points is the famous top-handled Launer handbag. Unlike other classic designer bags such as the Hermes Birkin or the Chanel 2.55, which are popular with women aged from their 20s to their 70s, Launer is not as fashionable or desirable for younger women, says Charlotte Rogers, a luxury accessories expert. But there is still a big market for them in other countries, especially the Middle East. The Queen's royal seal of approval changes everything for a brand. ""The fact the Queen still uses Launer bags is huge,"" Rogers says. ""Royals are the ultimate influencers."" The handbags retail for around Â£1,500-Â£2,000, and the Queen is said to have a collection of over 200 in different colours and styles. It seems in her Jubilee year the Queen has become more influential than ever, which is no mean feat for a woman in her 90s, says Rogers. ""She's age appropriate, a style much like my grandmother used to wear for special occasions and I think she is influential to older ladies,"" she says. ""Pins and brooches were seen as so unfashionable and now I can't buy enough of them. They sell so quickly."" The Queen's clothes are not just style choices but also brand statements, steeped with meaning and influence. Whether she's wearing a jewelled gown or a tweed skirt every outfit says something about her and her role as an ambassador and figurehead. ""Her wardrobe is her communication,"" says Matthew Storey, curator at Historic Royal Palaces. She has to be prepared, reliable and traditional. But while walking the line of being accessible and reassuring her clothes also ""have to be worthy of royalty,"" Holmes says. ""It's part of the bedazzling of the crown. With the Queen her clothes are bespoke. You can't buy them but it means they can be seen and admired."" There's also a diplomatic role, subtle nods to a country or event shown in emblems or colours she wears. ""The subtle pink coloured dress she wore to the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games was chosen because it was on none of the national flags. It stood out but it also wasn't showing any allegiance,"" Storey says. Like other iconic brands she also means many different things to people. ""Like a work of art you interpret her in your own way,"" says Jeetendr Sehdev, author and celebrity branding expert. ""Do we really know who she is? I'm not sure we do. But what we do know is what she means to us and the things she stands for - her strength, boldness and authenticity - remain relevant even among young people."" Younger royals like Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, are clearly inspired by her, but the Queen stands far and above, he says. There's great affection for how she looks, Holmes says. She has a signature style that will forever remind people of her. ""No-one else dresses like her,"" she says. ""That's her job and it's profound."" All pictures are subject to copyright See her life in pictures Who is on - and off - the royal balcony Â© 2025 BBC.

"One of Boris Johnson's strongest cabinet allies has hit out out Tory MPs trying to oust him, accusing them of doing ""the opposition's work"". Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries claimed growing calls for the PM to resign were the result of a ""co-ordinated campaign"" by backbenchers. Criticism of Mr Johnson among Tory MPs has increased since Sue Gray's Partygate report last week. But Ms Dorries said the ""overwhelming"" majority still backed him. Twelve Conservative MPs have called on Mr Johnson to quit since the release of Ms Gray's report laid bare the scale of Covid rule-breaking in No 10. It takes the number now openly calling on him to resign to 28. Most of have written letters of no confidence in him, although the total number formally calling for a contest may be higher. Mr Johnson has dismissed calls for him to quit, adding it would not be ""responsible right now given everything that's going on"". Who are the Tory MPs calling on Johnson to go? How could Boris Johnson be voted out by Tory MPs? Explain why partygate did not breach code, PM told Under Tory party rules, 54 letters are required to set up a vote on the PM's position, a move which could eventually lead to a contest to replace him. Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench committee that organises leadership contests, knows exactly how many have been submitted. Nadine Dorries is urging Tory MPs to unite behind the prime minister Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One,external, Ms Dorries said the debate over Partygate had become a ""Westminster bubble issue"" and the public was ""ready to move on"". ""There is obviously, I think probably led by one or two individuals, a campaign behind the scenes to try, attempt to remove the prime minister for individual reasons to do with personal ambition or other reasons,"" she said. She added: ""The people who most want to get rid of Boris Johnson are Keir Starmer and the SNP"". ""I would just ask my colleagues to reflect on that, and do we really want to do the opposition's work - and do we really believe the public will vote for a party that they think is divided?"" Home Secretary Priti Patel has also backed the prime minister, telling Conservative MPs who want to remove him to ""forget it"", BBC political correspondent Helen Catt reports. Ms Patel told the Daily Mail that writing letters of no confidence was a ""sideshow"" and warned that the public ""wouldn't thank the Conservative Party for talking about itself at a time when people had anxieties, concerns [and] apprehensions"". She also warned colleagues against overshadowing the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, saying ""all the focus"" this weekend should be on the Queen and her ""long-standing dedicated service"". Despite the uncertainty over the number of no-confidence letters, there has been mounting speculation Mr Johnson could face a no-confidence vote soon. On Monday, former Tory leader Lord Hague said the PM was in ""real trouble"" and predicted a vote could take place as early as next week, when MPs return from their short early summer recess. But speaking earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab told Sky News he doubted the number of letters could be ""that high"". There is no consensus among Tory MPs about who should be their next leader, but Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat are among those being discussed as possible challengers. Chancellor Rishi Sunak was widely seen as a potential leadership rival to the PM, but his prospects are thought to have waned after he picked up his own Partygate fine and was embroiled in acontroversy over his wife's financesearlier this year. There's no obvious thread linking the MPs that have publicly called on the prime minister to go. Some of the calls have come in quick succession, others months apart. They've come from MPs elected in different years, with different ideologies. Some of them backed Boris Johnson at the last Tory leadership contest, others backed his rivals. Some Tory MPs are convinced there is a degree of co-ordination behind closed doors. One senior Tory told me he believes supporters of Jeremy Hunt are among those being particularly critical publicly. Others attribute the steady drip-drip of letters in recent days to a ripple effect. As soon as a few critical MPs came out publicly, they argue, others felt emboldened to do the same. Co-ordination or not, there is no doubt MPs do talk to each other - there are Whatsapp groups and sub-Whatsapp groups of Tory MPs. Even before Sue Gray's report came out, I was told the tea rooms of Westminster were alive with chatter about who was ""ready to move"". Some of that chatter has been more muted as MPs are out of office for recess - with some arguing the Jubilee weekend is not the time for ""internal warfare"". But that could all liven up again quite quickly when they return next week. Meanwhile, the debate over the PM's future has been given fresh impetus after his standards adviser Lord Geidt called on him to explain how his own Partygate fine tallied with the rulebook for ministers, which says they have a duty to comply with the law. Along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson was fined for attending a birthday party for him in the Cabinet Room in June 2020. In a report on Monday,external, Lord Geidt wrote there was a ""legitimate question"" over whether this constituted a breach of the ministerial code. In a written reply, Mr Johnson said he had not fallen foul of the code because he had not broken Covid laws on purpose. In an interview with Mumsnet on Tuesday, the prime minister insisted he thought the gathering in the Cabinet Room counted as a work event, and he was ""very, very surprised"" and ""taken aback"" to have received a fine. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner accused the prime minister of ignoring Lord Geidt's advice, and finding himself innocent of breaching ministerial rules in ""his own courtroom"". Adding that Mr Johnson was ""dodging questions"", she called for him to ""make a statement"" on his ""apparent breach"" of the rules. For the SNP, MP Mhairi Black called on Scotland's six Tory MPs to ""step up and do the right thing"" and submit no-confidence letters in ""this Partygate prime minister"".

"She's one of the most photographed women in history and over the past 70 years has defined what it means to dress like a queen. Not trendsetting or daring, but iconic. She's become famous for her brightly coloured dresses and coats paired with a matching hat, accessorised with her signature square handbag, three strand pearl necklace and a jewelled brooch. It sounds simple but the Queen's style has become a powerful formula. It's a style that has been honed and refined over seven decades, helped by the close relationships she has developed with trusted designers and dressers.

"Horizon Europe is the EU's key funding programme for research and innovation Universities have called for an urgent resolution to a row about UK access to a major EU research programme.

"A woman in Cardiff is ""furious"" her father's care home is charging Â£18 an hour to take him to hospital appointments Care home providers have been criticised for charging top up fees to residents for taking them to medical appointments. The Older People's Commissioner Helena Herklots said providers should be open and honest about extra fees and social care should be made free. Sue Simms, whose dad is in a care home, said: ""It feels mean and underhanded."" The Welsh government said care homes were legally required to set out any extra charges. Ms Simms, from Cardiff, cares for her father 78-year-old Peter Faint. Mr Faint, who was a research and development scientist, requires full-time nursing care as he has Parkinson's Disease, vascular dementia and multiple sclerosis. Staff shortage 'putting more people in care homes' Care home owner trying to keep 'head above water' Ms Simms, a nurse, said she was ""astonished and furious"" when his care home told her she would have to start paying Â£18 an hour for every hospital appointment that she could not take her father to. ""I know from my background in A&E that if dad needed an ambulance, you could have a number of hours outside hospital, then 10 or 12 hours inside with an overnight wait for transport home. ""You could come away with a bill of hundreds of pounds,"" she said. Sue Simms says she fears people who do not have family support could face bills they cannot afford Ms Simms said she always tried to take her father to appointments but she worried about other people who may not be able to do the same for their relatives. ""We all think that everybody's got somebody but there are a lot of people who don't have anyone,"" she said. ""A lot of people don't have children and only an elderly spouse at home. A lot of people can't afford it. It feels mean and underhanded."" Ms Simms, who is an only child, has reduced her working hours in order to care for both her mother and father. She said she had no idea about the top-up fees when her father moved into the home more than six months ago. ""It's another unnecessary pressure. Am I going to get a call saying my dad has an appointment and I have to juggle work? It's a pressure on my mum too and she's not well,"" she said. A spokesperson for the home where her dad lives, said: ""We do charge an escort fee for hospital appointments as standard at our home. ""We ask for the fee because when a carer is needed to accompany a resident, it means they are away from the home and the other residents under their care. In some cases, we will need to ensure an extra team member is on shift to cover their duties. ""In Sue's case, we apologise that the escort fees were not communicated to her and her family."" The care home added these fees were paused during the height of the pandemic and when charges restarted this should have been clearly communicated to everyone. The Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Helena Herklots, said that it was not always clear how much extra people might have to pay. She added that some of the examples they had heard were ""extraordinary"". Helena Herklots, the Older People's commissioner, says the Welsh Government should make social care free as soon as possible ""We've heard of one example where someone was being charged to get access to go into the garden. That's at the extreme end,"" she said. She said the worry about extra costs was causing families and older people ""a lot of stress"". ""It's affecting their mental health, it's making them anxious and worried because they're not sure they can afford these additional costs,"" she added. She has called on the Welsh government to reform social care funding to make it free at the point of need as soon as possible. The Welsh government said it was committed to creating a National Care Service. Chief executive of Care Forum Wales, Mary Wimbury, explained that the financial situation for care homes was ""really challenging"". She said that care home fees were not increasing in line with increased costs of food, heating and staffing. ""We've got to have an honest conversation across Wales about how much care costs, how much we're prepared to pay, what we want in terms of standards, in terms of things like staff ratios,"" said Ms Wimbury. She added that accompanying someone for a long hospital visit meant backfill staff would be needed in the home which would cost providers. Care Forum Wales, which represents care homes in Wales, says they are struggling with increased costs ""There's either got to be an additional charge or it's got to be part of the general fee,"" she added. The Welsh government said it expected care home providers to be clear and upfront about the fees they charge. ""They are required by law to set out this information in their written guide for the service as well as an individual's service agreement,"" it said. ""Creating a National Care Service, that is free at the point of need, is a commitment in the Co-operation Agreement between the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru and we will be setting up an expert group to support this shared ambition."" The Welsh Local Government Association, which represents councils, said social care services needed ""significant and sustainable"" long term investments to make permanent improvements. ""The current cost of living crisis will only further exacerbate some of the current pressures, with social care facing a funding gap for current services, increasing each year due to inflation and other costs. ""This is without considering the immediate need to address unmet and under met need on these overburdened systems. ""Without adequate funding, some councils will face a battle to balance budgets, worsening existing pressures and running the serious risk of impacts on the ability to deliver timely and quality care to those who draw on it.""
