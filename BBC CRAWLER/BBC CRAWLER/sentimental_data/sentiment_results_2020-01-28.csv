"Woodward was not at home when his home came under attack The Cheshire home of Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has been attacked by a group chanting that he was ""going to die"". A video posted on social media showed an individual throwing a red flare over a large gate, while others sang songs aimed at the 48-year-old. Woodward, who is married with two young children, was not present at the time. Manchester United said anyone committing a criminal offence or trespassing will be banned for life. A club statement added: ""Fans expressing opinion is one thing, criminal damage and intent to endanger life is another. There is simply no excuse for this. ""We know that the football world will unite behind us as we work with police to identify the perpetrators of this unwarranted attack."" Cheshire police confirmed they received a call about ""an incident of criminal damage"" on Tuesday evening involving ""a large group"". A statement continued: ""Thankfully no-one was harmed, and officers will liaise with security officials over the coming days to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident and identify those involved."" Woodward has been the subject of growing supporter discontent at United in recent weeks. Manchester United sit fifth in the Premier League - 33 points behind leaders Liverpool - and Woodward has been the target of blame by many fans. At the recent home game against Burnley and Sunday's FA Cup victory over Tranmere, supporters have sung the same song about Woodward and made repeated calls for the club's owners, the Glazer family, to leave the club. The incident is reminiscent of another attack, in 2004, on the car of then club director Maurice Watkins, whose shares ended up being bought by Malcolm Glazer as his bid for the club gathered pace. Woodward advised Malcolm Glazer and the Glazer family during its successful takeover of the club in 2005 before being recruited as a senior member of staff.

"Mrs Brown's Boys has beaten Fleabag and After Life to win a fifth comedy prize at the National Television Awards. The awards, voted for by the British public, saw Jesy Nelson, Peaky Blinders and Sir Michael Palin all collect prizes. Ant and Dec, meanwhile, enjoyed their 19th straight NTA success as best presenters. New awards host David Walliams also won one, which he went up to collect in his underpants. National Television Awards: Red carpet in pictures How Mrs Brown's Boys became a critic-proof hit How America fell in love with Fleabag There were wins for the usual suspects Strictly Come Dancing, This Morning and Emmerdale too during the event at London's O2 Arena. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's dark comedy, Fleabag, won big at the recent Emmys, Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards, but the show was overlooked on Tuesday night in favour of Brendan O'Carroll's Saturday night sitcom, Mrs Brown's Boys. Ricky Gervais' After Life - a similarly dark comedy about a suicidal journalist who has just lost his wife to cancer - also missed out. But after thanking his family, O'Carroll was quick to praise the Netflix-produced show as ""one of the best things I've ever seen"", drawing a wave of gratitude and a smile from Gervais in the crowd. Ricky Gervais and the cast of After Life Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not in attendance at the NTAs Gervais previously poked fun at popular sitcoms with laughter tracks, innuendo and catchphrases in his show Extras, yet after nine years Mrs Brown's Boys continues to be a huge draw. In 2018 its Christmas special brought in 6.8 million viewers, making it the most-watched programme of the day. ""Comedy is hard, it's not easy,"" declared the Irish writer, actor and comedian. Derry Girls and Sex Education found that to their cost, missing out in the comedy stakes at this year's awards, where Ant and Dec won their 19th successive presenting award despite having not hosted their own show, Saturday Night Takeaway, in 2019. The nation's favourite double act admitted the ceremony was getting more tense for them as the years went by. ""We had our chat on the way in about this being the year we don't win it - then you go and do this again,"" joked Ant. The pair enjoyed a second win of the night with best entertainment programme I'm a Celebrity..., which they present, and dedicated the award to those affected by the bushfires in Australia, where the programme is filmed. David Walliams - who took over proceedings from usual host Dermot O'Leary - made his opening speech from raised up high on a wire. David Walliams is lifted off the ground in rehearsal The show began with a VT of him playing a strange version of himself, appearing before even stranger versions of The X Factor judges, who were also played by the host himself. Later on, sitting bare-legged on Dec's lap, he leapt up to receive his own award for best TV Judge, for his work on Britain's Got Talent. ""When I die, which I will, they will show this clip on the news - me in my pants,"" quipped Walliams. An emotional Jesy Nelson won the award for best factual programme for Odd One Out, her documentary about cyber bullying. ""I'm so sorry, this is so overwhelming. I'm such a baby,"" declared the Little Mix star. The feature was inspired by her experiences of online trolling when she first rose to fame as a youngster with the band on The X Factor. ""I want to thank every single person that was in the documentary for being so brave and courageous to tell their own story to the world,"" she added. ""I don't think we ever expected for this to have such an impact and I'm just so grateful that such a negative experience in my life turned into such a positive one."" Jesy Nelson: Online trolls made me want to die Little Mix star praised for 'inspiring' documentary Sir Michael Palin received a special recognition award and used the platform to pay tribute to ""someone who taught me more about television than anyone else"" - his fellow Monty Python star Terry Jones, whodied last week aged 77. ""He had a skill in being very ruthless but also being charming at the same time"" said Sir Michael. National Television Awards 2020 winners in full Best challenge show - Great British Bake Off Best factual programme - Odd One Out, Jesy Nelson Best drama - Peaky Blinders Best comedy - Mrs Brown's Boys Best serial drama performance - Katie McGlynn, Coronation Street Impact award - Gavin & Stacey Best live magazine show - This Morning Best TV judge - David Walliams Best new drama - Chernobyl Best TV presenter - Ant & Dec Best Newcomer - Peter Ash, Coronation Street Special recognition award - Sir Michael Palin Best drama performance - Cillian Murphy, Peaky Blinders Best serial drama - Emmerdale Best talent show- Strictly Come Dancing The Bruce Forsyth entertainment award - I'm A Celebrityâ¦ Get Me Out Of Here In the best challenge show category, Love Island lost out to The Great British Bake Off. Earlier on Tuesday, Caroline Flack, who stepped down from the ITV2 show following an assault charge, made a return to social media to wish the cast and crew of the dating show the best of luck. Host Walliams brought weary groans from the crowd with jokes about Flack, and actor Lawrence Fox. Good Morning Britain show host Piers Morgan boycotted the awards this year because, he said, ""the same people always win"" and (like a stopped clock twice a day) he wasn't wrong; Emmerdale won best soap for a fourth straight year, and This Morning and Strictly Come Dancing won awards for a 10th and fifth year in a row respectively. Holly Willoughby praised her co-host Phillip Schofield - ""this silver haired man with a heart of gold"". Strictly host Tess Daly, meanwhile, paid tribute to her late former showbiz colleague Bruce Forsyth, whose name now adorns one of the awards. ""Brucewasshow business and his memory lives on,"" she said. Claudia Winkleman, who replaced him as her on-screen partner said they would celebrate the win with ""crisps and tequila"". In between the awards, The Pet Shop Boys debuted a new song called Monkey Business, backed by a cast of colourfully dressed dancers. Peaky Blinders picked up two gongs; best drama again and best drama performance for Cillian Murphy - though you might know him better as the gangster Thomas Shelby. The popular historical drama miniseries Chernobyl gained the plaudits for best new drama. And the award for best serial drama performance went to Katie McGlynn for her portrayal of Sinead Tinker in Coronation Street. ""That was nerve-wrecking trying to get up them steps in this dress,"" McGlynn laughed. She thanked the soap's bosses for ""trusting me with this huge story line"" and dedicated the award to her late granddad, who had encouraged her to put herself forward for it. He died just a month before her first audition on the show. Fellow fictional Weatherfield resident Peter Ash won the trophy for best newcomer. Finally, Gavin and Stacey was given a special ""Impact"" award and writer/actor Ruth Jones said it ""wasn't easy bringing the show"" back after a decade for the recent Christmas special. The episode became the UK's most-watched scripted TV programme of the entire 2010s, with days to spare. Jones admitted that she wished co-writer and now US-dweller James Corden ""was here to share this"". ""He and I have been on a journey that has lasted over 15 years."" Slipping into character and a thick Welsh accent for a second, Jones, or Nessa rather, delivered a pointed message to audience member and alleged former flame Sir Tom Jones. ""I don't know what you're laughing at Tom, you never writes, you never phones... ""There's still a lot of electricity between me and Tom and don't you knows it,"" she added.

"Companies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower knew a planned cladding system would fail in the event of a fire, emails suggest. The evidence was presented to the public inquiry into the fire at the London high-rise block. The 2017 disaster killed 72 people. The inquiry's second phase, which began on Monday, is looking at how the building came to be covered in flammable cladding during its refurbishment between 2012 and 2016. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Seven key points from first phase of inquiry Who were the victims? The emails were disclosed to the inquiry by Celotex, which manufactured the insulation panels used in the work, as it defended suggestions it had not made clear the product would burn. In an internal email sent in March 2015, Daniel Anketell-Jones, a technical manager at the cladding design company Harley, said the aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding ""will be gone rather quickly in a fire!"" In another email, Terry Ashton, from the fire consultants Exova, accepted the zinc cladding being considered at the time would fail if there were external flames. In response, Neil Crawford, from the architect firm Studio E said that ""metal cladding always burns and falls off"". The inquiry is hearing opening statements, but some companies have introduced previously unpublished evidence as they seek to blame other firms involved. In what the inquiry has described as a ""merry-go-round of buck-passing"", the firms who carried out the refurbishment have said they were misled about the safety of the materials they chose. The manufacturers have hit back that they should have carried out tests and satisfied themselves that what they were designing was safe. Celotex made the RS5000 insulation which contributed to the fire. But the company told the inquiry it was always sold on the basis that it did burn. The company said it had carried out tests and the thick insulation panels could be safely used with cladding which was not combustible, rather than with the type used at Grenfell, which was. Its barrister, Craig Orr QC, said it was ""abundantly clear that the cladding system designed and installed on Grenfell Tower bore no resemblance to the system as described in Celotex's marketing materials"". He said the architects, cladding firm, and fire safety advisers should all have been aware of ""clear and specific warnings"" about fire safety in the marketing materials for the insulation. As the manufacturer, Mr Orr argued it was not Celotex's job to ensure the product was being used safely - and said this was a matter for the designers, contractors and consultants. Another company involved, cladding manufacturer Arconic Architectural Products, also said it was not required to ensure its product could be safely used on tall buildings. Arconic said architects and designers were responsible for choosing materials and ensuring they did not provide a fire risk. The company said building regulations did allow its combustible cladding to be used, as part of a wider system, as long as the system had undergone a successful fire test. But no evidence suggested a test, or assessment of previous similar tests, had been carried out in the context of the Grenfell Tower refurbishment, the company's barrister said. On Monday, the inquiry heard that Arconic had failed to pass the results of testing, which suggested its cladding was far less safe in a fire than it had admitted, to a British certification body, the BBA. The company's barrister said it would respond to that later in the inquiry but he insisted the certificate for the Reynobond PE cladding panels said that the way it was used could affect the way it reacted in a fire. Earlier, Exova, the fire safety consultancy which reviewed the refurbishment, said criticism of it was ""unjustified"" because it was not consulted about the combustible materials which were eventually installed on the exterior of the block. The company said it had only been asked to comment on early plans for the tower's refurbishment and was ""left out"" of later discussions surrounding cladding. Both the Reynobond PE cladding panels and the Celotex RS5000 insulation were combustible and during the inquiry's first phase were found to be a key factor in the fire's rapid spread on 14 June, 2017.

"This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? The UK has decided to let Huawei continue to be used in its 5G networks but with restrictions, despite pressure from the US to block the firm. The Chinese firm will be banned from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, known as the core. In addition, it will only be allowed to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, which includes radio masts. And it will be excluded from areas near military bases and nuclear sites. Downing Street said that Boris Johnson had spoken to President Trump to explain the move. ""The prime minister underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies,"" it said. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeohad previously suggested that use of Huawei's equipment,externalposed a spying risk, saying that ""we won't be able to share information"" with nations that put it into their ""critical information systems"". But the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the decision would not affect the UK's intelligence-sharing relationship with the US and other close allies. This video can not be played Raab: ""Risk cannot be eliminated in telecoms"" ""Nothing in this review affects this country's ability to share highly-sensitive intelligence data over highly-secure networks both within the UK and our partners, including the Five Eyes,"" the minister told the House of Commons. A document published by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) indicates that the UK's networks will havethree years to comply with the caps on the use of Huawei's equipment,external. ""Huawei is reassured by the UK government's confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G rollout on track,"" the firm's UK chief Victor Zhangsaid in a statement,external. ""It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market."" The prime minister had faced pressure from the US and some Conservative MPs to block the Chinese tech giant on the grounds of national security. A Trump administration official has said the US ""is disappointed"" with the decision. Beijing had warned the UK there could be ""substantial"" repercussions to other trade and investment plans had the company been banned outright. The choice has been described as the biggest test of Boris Johnson's post-Brexit strategy to date. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the US Senate Intelligence Committee  tweeted his dismay. ""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,""he posted,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What is Huawei and what will be its role in UK 5G? How UK's decision affects the rest of the world MPs attack government over decision for 5G networks Huawei has always denied that it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients.The firm's founder has saidhe would ""shut the company down"" rather than aid ""any spying activities"". Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee,tweeted that the government's,external""statement leaves many concerns and does not close the UK's networks to a frequently malign international actor"". Three out of four of the UK's mobile networks had already decided to use and deploy Huawei's 5G products outside the core in the ""periphery"". Two of them - Vodafone and EE - now face having to reduce their reliance on the supplier, as more than 35% of their existing radio access network equipment was made by it. This video can not be played WATCH: 5G explained in 45 seconds The cap also applies to the Shenzen-based firm's involvement in the rollout of full-fibre broadband. According to agovernment report published last June,external, Huawei currently has a 45% share of that market. ""We want world-class connectivity as soon as possible but this must not be at the expense of our national security,"" said Britain's digital secretary Baroness Morgan. ""High-risk vendors never have been and never will be in our most sensitive networks,"" she said referring to government and intelligence systems. BT has some of Huawei's equipment in the core of its EE network but is in the process of replacing it. ""This is a good compromise between alleviating 'security' concerns and making sure that the 5G UK market is not harmed,"" commented Dimitris Mavrakis, a telecoms analyst at ABI Research. ""It means there will be minimal disruption to existing 5G rollout plans."" The government has also said the UK needs to ""improve the diversity in the supply of equipment"" to the country's telecom networks. Beyond Huawei, the world's four main providers are: Nokia - a Finnish company Ericsson - a Swedish company Samsung - a South Korean company ZTE - a Chinese company that the country's government part-owns At present, the UK is mostly dependent on Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson - a situation that has caused the NCSC's technical director to claim that the ""market is broken"". ""That's crazy,""Dr Ian Levy added,external. ""We need to diversify the market significantly in the UK so that we have a more robust supply base to enable the long-term security of the UK networks and to ensure we do not end up nationally dependent on any vendor."" In response,the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said,externalit will now support ""the emergence of new, disruptive entrants to the supply chain"" and promote ""the adoption of open, interoperable standards"". The new rules still have to be debated and approved by MPs. Tim Morrison, a former US National Security Council official, urged them to rebel. ""There is still time for backbenchers in both parties to save the special relationship and the privacy rights of Britons if they vote to block this mistake by the government."" A mobile phone network's core is sometimes likened to its heart or brain. It is where voice and other data is routed across various sub-networks and computer servers to ensure it gets to its desired destination. This involves: authenticating subscribers so that specific users only get access to the services they have paid for and opted into sending a call to the right radio tower to connect to another person's mobile phone managing facilities such as call-forwarding and voicemail delivering SMS messages and multimedia from one handset to another routing data back and forth to third-party services such as apps and websites keeping track of usage to calculate an individual's bill While once, a lot of this involved physical equipment known as routers and switches, in the 5G world much of this kit has been ""virtualised"". That means software rather than specialised hardware now takes care of much of the job. This opens the door to new capabilities. But a perceived risk is that it could also open the system up to new kinds of attack. And even if encryption means the information being handled cannot be spied upon, the fear is that a rogue participant could still crash the network - or at least disrupt the data flow. The core is distinct from the Radio Access Network, which is sometimes referred to as the ""periphery"". The RAN includes the base stations and antennas used to provide a link between individual mobile devices and the core. Insiders sometimes describe this as the ""innovative but dumb"" part of the network. That is because new traffic management software and other advances mean more traffic can be handled than before, but the equipment does not actually affect what happens to the data itself beyond transmitting it back and forth. Huawei 5G verdict is a decision 'with few good options' What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Panorama: Can we trust Huawei? Although it has commonly been reported that Huawei's advantage here is cost, industry insiders say a bigger advantage is that it can currently do the same job as its rivals using fewer antennas. That means fewer planning permission requests need to be approved, and 5G can be rolled out more quickly as a result. The theory is that by limiting Huawei to the RAN but banning it from the core, the authorities make the risk of its involvement more ""manageable"". The Trump administration's cyber-security chiefs, along with their Australian counterparts, contend that over time the ""edge"" -  the name given to the boundary between the core and periphery - will disappear, as more and more sensitive operations are carried out closer to users. As a result, they claim it will no longer be possible to keep Huawei, and by extension the Chinese state, out of the network's most sensitive areas. This video can not be played WATCH: What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack? UK network operators acknowledge that over time more functions will indeed move from centralised sites to individual exchanges and even base stations themselves. But they are adamant that they can still design the architecture of their networks to keep the core distinct and protected.

More than 100 people have now died in China, with confirmed infections surging to more than 4,500. High-speed trains and ferries that cross the border will be suspended from Thursday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced. She wore a face mask. The virus has spread across China and to at least 16 countries globally. On Monday, Germany and Japan confirmed that they had cases involving people who had not travelled to China but caught the virus from someone who had. This had previously been seen only in Vietnam, which borders China and where someone was infected by his father who had travelled from Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak. Cries of 'stay strong' heard from Wuhan windows Britons in China call for more UK coronavirus help Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Several foreign governments with large numbers of citizens in Wuhan are planning air evacuations. Wuhan, as well as the wider Hubei province, are already effectively in a lockdown with strict transport restrictions in and out of the area. Wearing masks in public is now mandatory in some Chinese cities. On Monday, authorities in Beijing confirmed that a 50-year-old man had died - the first fatality in the Chinese capital. Carrie Lam announced Hong Kong's new strategy to tackle the virus on Tuesday. In addition to suspending train and ferry services, flights to mainland China will be halved. People will also no longer be able to receive permits to visit Hong Kong from the mainland. A hospital workers union had threatened to go on strike unless the government heeded a list of demands, which included tightening the border with the mainland. The city of seven million - a major financial centre - is part of China but retains significant autonomy. Tens of millions of people visit from mainland China every year but numbers were down in 2019 because of the pro-democracy protests that rocked the city. ""The flow of people between the two places needs to be drastically reduced"" amid the outbreak, said Ms Lam. Analysts say restricting travel from the mainland to Hong Kong - a major international hub - could help limit the spread of the new coronavirus to other countries. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city The new coronavirus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan. The number of total cases confirmed by China rose to 4,515 as of 27 January, up from 2,835 a day earlier. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei province. The initial victims were mostly elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems, but few details have been released about the dozens of deaths confirmed in recent days. On Tuesday, China agreed for WHO to send international experts to the country as soon as possible to help understand the virus and guide global response efforts. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection In another development, a Beijing hospital built in seven days in 2003 to accommodate patients with symptoms of the Sars virus is being refurbished for the coronavirus outbreak,the South China Morning Post reported,external. Construction and medical workers have been stationed at Xiaotangshan Hospital on the northern outskirts of the capital for several days, it quoted local sources as saying. About 4,000 people worked on the building in 2003, reportedly breaking the world record for the fastest construction of a hospital. A similar hospital is currently being built in Wuhan, with officials hoping to have it finished in six days. Construction of the new hospital in Wuhan is taking place at breakneck speed The news of more human-to-human cases of the new coronavirus will add to fears about how far this outbreak might spread. These latest cases in Japan and Germany suggest that anyone coming into close contact with another infected person could catch it. It's thought people with symptoms, such as a cough and fever, will be the most contagious. But experts haven't ruled out that people with no obvious signs of infection could also pose a risk. And it can take more than a week for a person to develop symptoms. The advice is to avoid close contact with people who are infected - that means keeping enough distance to avoid breathing air or touching surfaces contaminated with respiratory droplets from others carrying and shedding the virus. According to the World Health Organization and national authorities, there have been more than 50 confirmed cases outside China - but no deaths. Fourteen cases:Thailand Six:Japan Five:USA, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan Four:Malaysia, South Korea, France, Germany Two:Vietnam One:Nepal, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka Three further cases were confirmed in Germany on Tuesday. In Paris, an elderly Chinese tourist is in a serious condition, health director general Jerome Salomon told reporters. Authorities are attempting to find out how many people have been in contact with him. In Japan, authorities said a bus driver caught the virus after transporting tour groups from Wuhan earlier this month. Surgical masks sell out in US amid coronavirus fears Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Although the emergence of such cases is ""not too surprising"", the German case is particularly worrying, said Prof Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia. ""Because if the Chinese woman was indeed asymptomatic at the time of the training session it would confirm reports of spread before symptoms develop  - making standard control strategies less effective."" Like many countries, the United States has urged its nationals to ""reconsider travel"" to China. The country plans to fly consular staff and US citizens out of Wuhan in the coming days. This video can not be played Road blocks and ghost towns: Inside the province where the virus originated Japan is expecting to evacuate about 200 nationals on a chartered plane on Wednesday, with health workers on board to monitor passengers. The European Commission announced on Tuesday that it would start helping to repatriate Europeans.

"This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? The UK has decided to let Huawei continue to be used in its 5G networks but with restrictions, despite pressure from the US to block the firm. The Chinese firm will be banned from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, known as the core. In addition, it will only be allowed to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, which includes radio masts. And it will be excluded from areas near military bases and nuclear sites. Downing Street said that Boris Johnson had spoken to President Trump to explain the move. ""The prime minister underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies,"" it said. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeohad previously suggested that use of Huawei's equipment,externalposed a spying risk, saying that ""we won't be able to share information"" with nations that put it into their ""critical information systems"". But the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the decision would not affect the UK's intelligence-sharing relationship with the US and other close allies. This video can not be played Raab: ""Risk cannot be eliminated in telecoms"" ""Nothing in this review affects this country's ability to share highly-sensitive intelligence data over highly-secure networks both within the UK and our partners, including the Five Eyes,"" the minister told the House of Commons. A document published by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) indicates that the UK's networks will havethree years to comply with the caps on the use of Huawei's equipment,external. ""Huawei is reassured by the UK government's confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G rollout on track,"" the firm's UK chief Victor Zhangsaid in a statement,external. ""It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market."" The prime minister had faced pressure from the US and some Conservative MPs to block the Chinese tech giant on the grounds of national security. A Trump administration official has said the US ""is disappointed"" with the decision. Beijing had warned the UK there could be ""substantial"" repercussions to other trade and investment plans had the company been banned outright. The choice has been described as the biggest test of Boris Johnson's post-Brexit strategy to date. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican member of the US Senate Intelligence Committee  tweeted his dismay. ""I fear London has freed itself from Brussels only to cede sovereignty to Beijing,""he posted,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

What is Huawei and what will be its role in UK 5G? How UK's decision affects the rest of the world MPs attack government over decision for 5G networks Huawei has always denied that it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients.The firm's founder has saidhe would ""shut the company down"" rather than aid ""any spying activities"". Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, former chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee,tweeted that the government's,external""statement leaves many concerns and does not close the UK's networks to a frequently malign international actor"". Three out of four of the UK's mobile networks had already decided to use and deploy Huawei's 5G products outside the core in the ""periphery"". Two of them - Vodafone and EE - now face having to reduce their reliance on the supplier, as more than 35% of their existing radio access network equipment was made by it. This video can not be played WATCH: 5G explained in 45 seconds The cap also applies to the Shenzen-based firm's involvement in the rollout of full-fibre broadband. According to agovernment report published last June,external, Huawei currently has a 45% share of that market. ""We want world-class connectivity as soon as possible but this must not be at the expense of our national security,"" said Britain's digital secretary Baroness Morgan. ""High-risk vendors never have been and never will be in our most sensitive networks,"" she said referring to government and intelligence systems. BT has some of Huawei's equipment in the core of its EE network but is in the process of replacing it. ""This is a good compromise between alleviating 'security' concerns and making sure that the 5G UK market is not harmed,"" commented Dimitris Mavrakis, a telecoms analyst at ABI Research. ""It means there will be minimal disruption to existing 5G rollout plans."" The government has also said the UK needs to ""improve the diversity in the supply of equipment"" to the country's telecom networks. Beyond Huawei, the world's four main providers are: Nokia - a Finnish company Ericsson - a Swedish company Samsung - a South Korean company ZTE - a Chinese company that the country's government part-owns At present, the UK is mostly dependent on Huawei, Nokia and Ericsson - a situation that has caused the NCSC's technical director to claim that the ""market is broken"". ""That's crazy,""Dr Ian Levy added,external. ""We need to diversify the market significantly in the UK so that we have a more robust supply base to enable the long-term security of the UK networks and to ensure we do not end up nationally dependent on any vendor."" In response,the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said,externalit will now support ""the emergence of new, disruptive entrants to the supply chain"" and promote ""the adoption of open, interoperable standards"". The new rules still have to be debated and approved by MPs. Tim Morrison, a former US National Security Council official, urged them to rebel. ""There is still time for backbenchers in both parties to save the special relationship and the privacy rights of Britons if they vote to block this mistake by the government."" A mobile phone network's core is sometimes likened to its heart or brain. It is where voice and other data is routed across various sub-networks and computer servers to ensure it gets to its desired destination. This involves: authenticating subscribers so that specific users only get access to the services they have paid for and opted into sending a call to the right radio tower to connect to another person's mobile phone managing facilities such as call-forwarding and voicemail delivering SMS messages and multimedia from one handset to another routing data back and forth to third-party services such as apps and websites keeping track of usage to calculate an individual's bill While once, a lot of this involved physical equipment known as routers and switches, in the 5G world much of this kit has been ""virtualised"". That means software rather than specialised hardware now takes care of much of the job. This opens the door to new capabilities. But a perceived risk is that it could also open the system up to new kinds of attack. And even if encryption means the information being handled cannot be spied upon, the fear is that a rogue participant could still crash the network - or at least disrupt the data flow. The core is distinct from the Radio Access Network, which is sometimes referred to as the ""periphery"". The RAN includes the base stations and antennas used to provide a link between individual mobile devices and the core. Insiders sometimes describe this as the ""innovative but dumb"" part of the network. That is because new traffic management software and other advances mean more traffic can be handled than before, but the equipment does not actually affect what happens to the data itself beyond transmitting it back and forth. Huawei 5G verdict is a decision 'with few good options' What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Panorama: Can we trust Huawei? Although it has commonly been reported that Huawei's advantage here is cost, industry insiders say a bigger advantage is that it can currently do the same job as its rivals using fewer antennas. That means fewer planning permission requests need to be approved, and 5G can be rolled out more quickly as a result. The theory is that by limiting Huawei to the RAN but banning it from the core, the authorities make the risk of its involvement more ""manageable"". The Trump administration's cyber-security chiefs, along with their Australian counterparts, contend that over time the ""edge"" -  the name given to the boundary between the core and periphery - will disappear, as more and more sensitive operations are carried out closer to users. As a result, they claim it will no longer be possible to keep Huawei, and by extension the Chinese state, out of the network's most sensitive areas. This video can not be played WATCH: What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack? UK network operators acknowledge that over time more functions will indeed move from centralised sites to individual exchanges and even base stations themselves. But they are adamant that they can still design the architecture of their networks to keep the core distinct and protected.

"Navinder Sarao in London in 2016 The self-taught UK trader who made millions in bogus trades and contributed to a brief 2010 crash in the US stock market has been sentenced to a year of home confinement. Navinder Sarao,who pleaded guilty in 2016to fraud and market ""spoofing"", faced up to eight years in prison. But US prosecutors had recommended against jail time. They said the judge should consider his ""extraordinary cooperation"" with the government and diagnosis with autism. In federal court in Chicago, Judge Virginia Kendall sentenced Mr Sarao to one year of supervised release with strict conditions, which limit his activities outside the home,according to a Bloomberg reporter who was in the courtroom,external. ""I hope that this is a lesson to you,"" she reportedly said. When the judge proposed a year of home incarceration initially, she was told that sentence might not be enforceable outside of the US. Mr Sarao already spent four months in the UK's Wandsworth Prison after his 2015 arrest. He has also forfeited about $7.6m (Â£5.8m) in illegal gains. This video can not be played 'We're incredibly grateful', says Navinder Singh Sarao's lawyer ""We're incredibly grateful,"" Mr Sarao's attorney Roger Burlingame told the BBC.  ""He's...looking forward to getting back to living his life."" Mr Burlingame added that Mr Sarao was ""overjoyed"" to put the matter behind him, after ""living under threat of a very long sentence"" for almost five years. US authorities say Mr Sarao made more than $70m between 2009 and 2014 trading from his childhood bedroom, including $12.8m tied to his illegal behaviour. Using specially programmed, high-speed software, Mr Sarao placed thousands of orders that he did not intend to fulfil, creating the illusion of market demand. When he cancelled or changed his bids, he was able to profit. Navinder Sarao will be extremely relieved not be spending another day behind bars. His attorney, Roger Burlingame, told me that the four months Mr Sarao spent at Wandsworth prison were probably the toughest thing he'd ever faced. Mr Sarao has a diagnosis of severe Asperger's - one of many interesting aspects to this case. Mr Burlingame said that Mr Sarao almost believed he was playing a highly sophisticated and complicated video game and he affectively found the best ""cheat"" to win the game. He had alerted authorities about what he believed - that many traders were cheating on the futures markets - six months before he was arrested. He claims the authorities weren't interested in his findings. The other aspect which many people find hard to believe is that Mr Sarao has no money left from his trading profits. He lost a large amount to fraudsters himself but Mr Burlingame said his motivation was never money but the thrill of winning at his favourite video game. The activity - known as ""spoofing"" - contributed to market instability that led to the May 2010 ""flash crash"", when the Dow Jones index fell almost 1,000 points in a matter of minutes. Navinder Sarao: The man accused of causing the US market to crash Could one man cause a stockmarket crash? The US made spoofing a crime in 2010 as part of a broader effort to tighten regulations following the 2008 financial crisis. Mr Sarao was the second person to be charged under the new rules. Mr Burlingame said Judge Kendall had considered Mr Sarao's crimes in the ""proper context"", which had included complaining to market officials about spoofing by other traders. Mr Sarao saw his trades as a way to ""fight fire with fire"", Mr Burlingame added. The case against Mr Sarao, filed in federal court in Chicago, drew intense interest in the UK, where he was dubbed the ""Hound of Hounslow"" in reference to the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" and location of his parents' home in West London. Hounslow in west London, from where US authorities allege Navinder Sarao caused the market to crash He faced hundreds of years in prison on the initial charges, which were reduced in the 2016 plea deal. In court documents, Mr Sarao's attorneys described him as a mathematical savant and ""singularly sunny, childlike, guileless, trusting person"", who lived off public benefits and spent much of his time in his childhood bedroom, surrounded by computer games and stuffed animals. He spent little of his profits, much of which he lost in investment scams. In their sentencing recommendation, prosecutors noted Mr Sarao's medical diagnosis, expressions of his remorse and assistance with other lawsuits. They said jail time would not serve as a deterrent, arguing that he had been motivated not by greed, but by a desire to excel in an activity he perceived as a ""sophisticated video game"".

"This video can not be played Raab: ""Risk cannot be eliminated in telecoms"" MPs have attacked the government's decision to allow Huawei technology to be used in the UK's 5G mobile networks. Some called for an outright ban during a debate in the Commons, arguing even limited access put UK security at risk. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the decision followed a ""rigorous"" review by security experts and ""tight restrictions"" would be in place. They include a ban on using the Chinese firm's technology in so-called ""core"" parts of the network. The firm's kit will also only be allowed to account for up to 35% of the network's peripheral equipment. Huawei has always denied it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients. Its vice president, Victor Zhang, welcomed the UK's decision, saying it would ""result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future"". Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei: What is 5G's core and why protect it? Boris Johnson has sought to allay US security concerns about Huawei's involvement in a phone call with President Donald Trump. Downing Street said the prime minister had ""underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies"". Mr Trump has yet to comment publicly on the UK's decision although the White House has said it is ""disappointed"" and a number of US politicians have warned of the possible repercussions. Giving a statement to MPs, Mr Raab said: ""I hope the whole House will agree that if we are to achieve our digital connectivity ambitions, it is absolutely imperative that we trust the safety and security of our telecom networks. ""Risk cannot be eliminated in telecoms. But it is the job of government, Ofcom and industry to work together to ensure we reduce our vulnerabilities and mitigate those risks."" This video can not be played 5G explained in 45 seconds However, his statement did not reassure a raft of MPs from all sides of the House who criticised the move. Former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis said ""the only way to protect our safety is to ban it"", while his backbench colleague Julian Lewis said Huawei was ""intimately linked with the Chinese communist state and its deeply hostile intelligence agency"". The SNP's John Nicholson said the firm's technology was ""not safe"" to use and the government had ""chosen low cost over security"". His colleague, Carol Monaghan, said she did not know if it was ""naivety or arrogance preventing the UK government from seeing the high risk being presented to security"". Earlier, Labour's shadow culture secretary, Tracy Brabin, criticised the government for ""failing to invest in home-grown alternatives to Huawei"", which she claimed put them in the ""ludicrous position of having to choose between the UK's security concerns and our infrastructure needs"". That issue was raised by a number of MPs, including the DUP's Sammy Wilson, who asked for assurances from Mr Raab that ""in future [the UK will] not be as dependent on foreign technology"". Tory MP David Davis and the SNP's Carol Monaghan criticised the decision to allow Huawei into UK G networks Tory Iain Duncan Smith said it ""beggars belief"" that the firm was given the green light when the UK had ""a cyber war going on with China"". He urged the government to ensure it was ""driven out"" of the UK market as soon as possible. The foreign secretary admitted there were only three major vendors that made kit suitable for 5G networks - Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia - and it was a ""market failure that needs to be addressed"". He added: ""The government is developing an ambitious strategy to help diversify the supply chain. ""This will entail the deployment of all the tools at the government's disposal, including funding."" By BBC News online political reporter Jennifer Scott It's only six weeks since Boris Johnson stormed to victory in the general election - winning with an 80-strong majority - but the honeymoon is over and the prime minister now has serious government business to attend to. The coming few weeks demand some big decisions from Mr Johnson and his cabinet. Huawei was the first - but what are the others?Find out here. Despite the backlash in Parliament, other MPs have welcomed the government's decision. Former Prime Minister Theresa May said the government had made ""the decision that protects our national security but also recognises the interests of economy."" Former Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said it seemed to be a ""sensible compromise"" and Huawei technology could be used as long as the government was ""sensible, cautious and following the advice of the intelligence agencies"". Labour's Kevan Jones a former member of the Intelligence and Security Committee - also told MPs he had seen nothing to suggest the decision would compromise the UK's intelligence relationship with its key allies. Today's decision marks a significant gamble by Boris Johnson. The hope within government is that the restrictions imposed on Huawei will be enough to avoid a major breakdown in relations with the United States and appease critical Tory MPs. At the same time, however, it's hoped the restrictions will be sufficiently light touch not to delay the roll-out of super fast broadband - thereby compromising Boris Johnson's election pledge to ""level up"" living standards outside of London and the south.

"The government should drop the salary threshold for immigrants by more than Â£4,000, a committee has advised. Skilled migrants from outside the EU currently need to have a job offer with a minimum salary of Â£30,000. But the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC),externalsaid it should fall to Â£25,600 for all workers to help recruit teachers and skilled NHS staff. The committee's chair also called Boris Johnson's proposal for a new points-based immigration system a ""soundbite"". Mr Johnson said he wanted a scheme, based on Australia's system, during his summer campaign to lead the Conservative Party, and he made it a key pledge during the election. BBC Briefing on immigration How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Prof Alan Manning, from the MAC, said while he recognised politicians needed ""cosmetic"" means of presenting complex topics to the public, it was unclear what the government meant when it had repeatedly used the phrase. The outgoing chairman said: ""No perfect system exists and there are unavoidable, difficult trade-offs."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers would carefully consider the committee's recommendations but stressed the report was ""advisory"". ""I think it's important to recognize the British public voted for change when it came to immigration,"" she said. ""We are committed to ensuring we have a system... that has the ability to level up across the whole of the UK in a way that immigration policy has failed for too long."" There are a range of visas in the current system As part of the European Union, anyone from other member states - or from the European Economic Area (EEA) - can come to the UK to live or work without a visa. For those outside the EU, there are a range of visas they can attempt to qualify for. One of them is the Tier 1 or ""exceptional talent"" visa - a points based system for highly qualified people who need to be endorsed as a leader or emerging leader, but do not need a job offer - capped at 2,000 offers a year. Another is the Tier 2 (general) visa - where the applicant has to match exact criteria, including having a job offer with a minimum salary of Â£30,000. There is also a Tier 2 (general) visa with a lower salary threshold if the applicant is on the so-called Shortage Occupation List, which includes nurses and engineers. Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have both asked the MAC for reviews Theresa May's government announced a look at changes to the immigration system based on skills in December 2018. In June 2019, the then-home secretary (and now Chancellor) Sajid Javid said he wanted to build on this work, especially looking at salary thresholds for migrant workers. He wrote to the MAC - an independent body that advises the government on immigration - to ask them to work with businesses to find out what next steps to take. After Boris Johnson became prime minister, one of his main pledges was to create an overall points-based system for immigration. This would see applicants assigned points based on a number of professional and personal characteristics, with higher points awarded for more desirable traits - from the amount of time they have worked in a skilled sector through to their proficiency in the English language. The PM asked his new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, to also write to the MAC and seek their recommendations on implementing such a system. The MAC released the 278-page report on Tuesday In its report,external, the committee criticised the UK's current complex immigration system. When it came to Tier 1 visas, the committee said the rules ""set too high a bar for the definition of 'exceptional talent' and is often not a route well-suited for those who satisfy the existing definition"". It recommended the government could expand this way of entering the UK, especially increasing the number of points awarded to those with the most desired skills, and focusing on  younger applicants and those showing promise, rather than already being established. For Tier 2 (general) visas, the committee said the criteria were too strict to call it a points based system as applicants have to meet every one. However, they recommended keeping the existing framework of the visa with some changes. For example, it thinks the government should lower the threshold for the salary needed by someone with a job offer from Â£30,000 to Â£25,600. The committee dismissed those calling for no threshold, believing it stopped the undercutting of the labour market, ensured migrants made a net positive contribution to the public finances, and made sure migration policy supported the ""ambition to make the UK a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy"". But it said the drop would enable more medium-skilled workers to qualify. The MAC said whatever the government decides, it must work quickly to get something in place for post-Brexit immigration. The committee warned about social care If adopted by the government, the first people it would affect would be EU citizens. With the UK leaving the bloc at the end of the month, and the so-called transition period - where we align with EU rules while a trade deal is negotiated - ending in December 2020, they will instead face the same hurdles as immigrants coming from outside the EU to the UK. There would be an increase in the variety of skilled workers who could get a visa, not only because of the lower threshold, but with more additions to the skilled workers list, including carpenters, glaziers, plasterers and teaching assistants. And the MAC said schools and the NHS would particularly benefit from the changes. However, people who work in fishing, elementary agricultural roles or as waiting staff would be removed from the list, making it tougher for them to live and work here. The MAC warned that while its proposals would benefit the UK economy, there could be a rise in pressures in social care because of a shortage of low-skilled workers being able to enter the country. It said the ""root of the problem"" was a failure of the sector to ""offer competitive terms and conditions"", which itself was ""caused by a failure to have a sustainable funding model"". The MAC is absolutely clear that there is no such thing as a perfect immigration system - there will be losers and winners, trade-offs that favour one part of the economy over the other in pursuit of a policy goal. Under its recommendations, sectors like agriculture and hospitality will find it harder to bring in long-term migrants - but schools and hospitals could really benefit. However, its outgoing chairman, Alan Manning, says government needs to be really clear with the public about what it wants from its repeated ""soundbite"" of an ""Australian-style points-based-system"". It could mean one of many, many things, he says - and time is running out for ministers to decide. With 11 months to go before the Brexit transition period ends, the Home Office needs to agree the policy, pass legislation and help businesses prepare for a world in which freedom of movement from the EU has ended. Labour's Diane Abbott says the salary cap won't help with social care Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott said: ""Even a lower salary cap won't help recruit the hospital staff we need, the social care workers or many of the new recruits to private businesses."" She added the UK needed ""a system based on treating people and their families decently who come here with firm job offers, whatever their pay level"". The Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for home affairs, Christine Jardine, criticised the government's plan to end free movement after Brexit, saying the MAC review ""makes clear these plans will make the crisis in social care even worse"". And the SNP called for Scotland to be able to issue its own work visas, without any salary threshold, to address the country's different economic and demographic needs. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Ben Greening, executive director of Migration Watch - a group which believes the present level of immigration is not sustainable - said the proposals amounted to ""a significant loosening"" of the rules around Tier 2 migration. He said it would mean ""exposing over seven million UK jobs to new or increased global competition from much larger developing countries where there is very substantial demand to come to the UK"". ""The report essentially says the government needn't bother with a points system for people coming to the UK with a job offer and the current system relying on employer sponsorship should work fine for these people,"" said Denis Kierans, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory.

"Israel Folau previously played rugby league for Melbourne Storm, Brisbane Broncos, Queensland and Australia Sacked Australia rugby union international Israel Folau has made a switch back to rugby league with a move to Super League club Catalans Dragons. Folaureached a settlementwith Australia Rugby in December after he was released for writing homophobic posts on social media in April. He was sacked for saying ""hell awaits"" gay people, after previously being warned over his social media posts. Folau, 30, has signed a one-year deal with the French club. The Rugby Football League and Super League said they ""deplored"" Folau's previous comments and it was ""a difficult decision"" to allow him into the competition. Super League chief executive chairman Robert Elstone said ""strict guidelines are in place"" to avoid Folau again making such comments and warned that a repeat would see the player's contract being ""terminated immediately"". Catalans also face a ""substantial fine"" if Folau was to do so. The first opportunity for Folau to play will be in Catalans' season-opening game at home against Huddersfield on Saturday. News of the deal came shortly after an announcement by Wigan Warriors that their match against Catalans at the DW Stadium on 22 March will be ""Pride Day"". The club said they are inviting LGBTQ+ groups to help promote equality in the game. Wigan chairman Ian Lenagantold BBC Radio 5 Live they considered signing Folau, but made no approach. Elstone added he had sought the opinion of informed voices in rugby league and the majority shared his disappointment that Catalans had chosen to sign Folau. ""There is a strong feeling that the decision to sign him lets down many people connected to our sport,"" he continued. ""I made Catalans Dragons aware of those views. ""However, Super League does not have the authority to veto the registration of players and is satisfied by the due diligence carried out by The Rugby Football League."" Keegan Hirst, the first British rugby league player to come out as gay, posted on Twitter that he is ""shocked and disappointed"" by the deal. ""Our great game is tasked with fighting against homophobia and standing up for the values it puts such high stock in. It shows none of the bravery, camaraderie or integrity RFL expects from its players, staff and fans,"" the Halifax prop said. The RFL said they do not have the ""regulatory framework"" to stop Folau from joining Catalans and as such could not ""prevent his participation in the sport"". ""The player has not been charged or found guilty of any criminal offence,"" an RFL statement said. ""The moral responsibility for deciding whether to sign a player sits with individual clubs. ""We have sought and received reassurances from both the player and the club regarding future behaviour."" Folau said he ""acknowledged the views expressed by Super League and the Rugby Football League"". ""I'm a proud Christian, my beliefs are personal, my intention is not to hurt anyone and I will not be making further public comment about them,"" he said. ""I look forward to my return to the great game of rugby league with the Catalans Dragons."" The signing comes after the National Rugby League ruled out Folau's return to Australia's top-flight competition. He had a distinguished career in the NRL with the Melbourne Storm and Brisbane Broncos and earned representative honours as a Queensland State of Origin player and Australia international. Catalans Dragons chairman Bernard Guasch said they ""do not support or agree"" with what Folau has previously expressed and ""do not share or condone those views"". But he went on to say they ""want to give Israel a new opportunity to shine on the pitch"". Folau's return to professional sport comes nine months after he was sacked by Australia. The former Wallabies star, who was previously one of Australia's highest-paid players, attempted to sue Rugby Australia for A$14m (Â£7.4m; $9.5m) after having his contract terminated, arguing it was a case of religious discrimination. The row was followed closely down under, as it sparked debate about free speech and discrimination, but it was also a cause of wider controversy in rugby union as athletes both condemned and supported the player. England international Billy Vunipolawas also warned by the Rugby Football Unionfor his support of Folau. Folau's return to the sporting arena sees him go back to the 13-man game he last played a decade ago, with a spell playing Australian rules football followed by his high-profile antics in rugby union. Catalans Dragons, based in Perpignan in the south of France, are no strangers to making controversial signings, having signed a number of players sacked by Australian clubs, including Greg Bird and Todd Carney. Dave Woods, BBC rugby league correspondent It's fair to say that the whole game is appalled by Catalans' decision to sign Israel Folau but they are legally constrained by what they can do. Rugby Australia sacked him but had to come to an expensive settlement following a court case. The Australian National Rugby League declared that he would not be welcome in their game but as they didn't ban him, that has left the RFL unable to prevent his registration here. But it's fair to say he will not be welcome at any domestic Super League grounds. Wigan's immediate reaction to declare that their home game against Catalans will now be a celebration of the LGBTQ+ community is a reflection of the sentiments of every other Super League club. It's rare to see such a united front from both the Super League and RFL in their condemnation of this signing.

"Canadian Lauren Williams and her British husband Tom are trapped in Wuhan with a baby on the way Britons in parts of China affected by the new coronavirus have criticised the lack of government support for returning home. UK citizens in Wuhan and surrounding areas said that while other countries had organised evacuations, they had been given little information. The US and Japan are sending planes to Wuhan to evacuate their citizens. Downing Street says the Foreign Office is ""urgently exploring options"" for British nationals to leave the region. The new coronavirus has caused more than 100 deaths, spreading across China and to at least 16 countries around the world - but there are no confirmed cases in the UK. So far 97 people have tested negative, the Department of Health said, and there have been no positive results. Beyond Today: What it's like to live in a city under lockdown Death toll from China virus outbreak passes 100 Up to 300 British people are thought to be trapped in the city of Wuhan and Hubei province, where the outbreak is believed to have started and which is now under strict travel restrictions. In postings on local social media, the Foreign Office called on UK citizens who want to leave the area to contact its 24-hour number before Wednesday to add their names to a list.

Wuhan is in lockdown, with travel out of the city restricted A Downing Street spokesman said details of plans for British citizens to leave Hubei province ""are being finalised"" and the Foreign Office will confirm them ""as soon as they can"". Asked about plans to repatriate Britons, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: ""We are working on it."" One of the issues facing the UK government was identifying exactly how many British citizens needed to be repatriated, said Mr Shapps. He said: ""One of the things we're asking people to do is to contact the consulate there to make them aware."" The consulate is gathering all the information on British citizens in the area ""in order to help repatriate where appropriate"", Mr Shapps said. But Jason Neil and Sophie Hunt, who moved to Wuhan to teach English and have now spent more than five days in their apartment, said they contacted the embassy and received little response. ""We have contacted the embassy, we've emailed them and tried to ring them, and we got a really useless automated email response back from the embassy, saying not to go to Hubei,"" said Ms Hunt.

"Companies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower knew a planned cladding system would fail in the event of a fire, emails suggest. The evidence was presented to the public inquiry into the fire at the London high-rise block. The 2017 disaster killed 72 people. The inquiry's second phase, which began on Monday, is looking at how the building came to be covered in flammable cladding during its refurbishment between 2012 and 2016. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Seven key points from first phase of inquiry Who were the victims? The emails were disclosed to the inquiry by Celotex, which manufactured the insulation panels used in the work, as it defended suggestions it had not made clear the product would burn. In an internal email sent in March 2015, Daniel Anketell-Jones, a technical manager at the cladding design company Harley, said the aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding ""will be gone rather quickly in a fire!"" In another email, Terry Ashton, from the fire consultants Exova, accepted the zinc cladding being considered at the time would fail if there were external flames. In response, Neil Crawford, from the architect firm Studio E said that ""metal cladding always burns and falls off"". The inquiry is hearing opening statements, but some companies have introduced previously unpublished evidence as they seek to blame other firms involved. In what the inquiry has described as a ""merry-go-round of buck-passing"", the firms who carried out the refurbishment have said they were misled about the safety of the materials they chose. The manufacturers have hit back that they should have carried out tests and satisfied themselves that what they were designing was safe. Celotex made the RS5000 insulation which contributed to the fire. But the company told the inquiry it was always sold on the basis that it did burn. The company said it had carried out tests and the thick insulation panels could be safely used with cladding which was not combustible, rather than with the type used at Grenfell, which was. Its barrister, Craig Orr QC, said it was ""abundantly clear that the cladding system designed and installed on Grenfell Tower bore no resemblance to the system as described in Celotex's marketing materials"". He said the architects, cladding firm, and fire safety advisers should all have been aware of ""clear and specific warnings"" about fire safety in the marketing materials for the insulation. As the manufacturer, Mr Orr argued it was not Celotex's job to ensure the product was being used safely - and said this was a matter for the designers, contractors and consultants. Another company involved, cladding manufacturer Arconic Architectural Products, also said it was not required to ensure its product could be safely used on tall buildings. Arconic said architects and designers were responsible for choosing materials and ensuring they did not provide a fire risk. The company said building regulations did allow its combustible cladding to be used, as part of a wider system, as long as the system had undergone a successful fire test. But no evidence suggested a test, or assessment of previous similar tests, had been carried out in the context of the Grenfell Tower refurbishment, the company's barrister said. On Monday, the inquiry heard that Arconic had failed to pass the results of testing, which suggested its cladding was far less safe in a fire than it had admitted, to a British certification body, the BBA. The company's barrister said it would respond to that later in the inquiry but he insisted the certificate for the Reynobond PE cladding panels said that the way it was used could affect the way it reacted in a fire. Earlier, Exova, the fire safety consultancy which reviewed the refurbishment, said criticism of it was ""unjustified"" because it was not consulted about the combustible materials which were eventually installed on the exterior of the block. The company said it had only been asked to comment on early plans for the tower's refurbishment and was ""left out"" of later discussions surrounding cladding. Both the Reynobond PE cladding panels and the Celotex RS5000 insulation were combustible and during the inquiry's first phase were found to be a key factor in the fire's rapid spread on 14 June, 2017.

"The majority of the 7,100 cheetahs left in the world are in Africa India's top court has said cheetahs can be reintroduced in the country, 70 years after they were wiped out. Responding to a plea by the government, the Supreme Court said African cheetahs could be introduced to the wild in a ""carefully chosen location"". Cheetahs are an endangered species, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). Only 7,100 cheetahs are left in the wild, almost all of them in Africa. The Asiatic cheetah, which once roamed parts of India, is now only found in Iran, where there are thought to be about 50 left. India's Supreme Court said the animal would have to be introduced on an experimental basis to find out if it could adapt to Indian conditions. Studies show that at least 200 cheetahs were killed in India, largely by sheep and goat herders, during the colonial period.  It is the only large mammal to become extinct after the country gained independence in 1947. India's former environment minister Jairam Ramesh welcomed the decision to reintroduce the animal.

For more than a decade, wildlife officials, cheetah experts and conservationists from all over the world have discussed the reintroduction of the spotted big cat to India and have agreed that there is a strong case for it. But leading conservationists have harboured doubts about the plan. They fear that in its haste to bring back the cheetah, India will end up housing the animals in semi-captive conditions in huge, secured open air zoos rather than allowing them to live free. They add that without restoring habitat and prey base, and given the high chances of a man-animal conflict, viable cheetah populations cannot be established. They have also pointed to India's chequered record of reintroducing animals to the wild. Lions were reintroduced in the Chandraprabha sanctuary in northern Uttar Pradesh state in the 1950s, but were then poached out of existence. This video can not be played Curious cheetah joins safari group in Tanzania However, conservationists who have led the initiative insist that these fears are unfounded. They say a decision will only be taken after shortlisted sites are fully examined for habitat, prey and potential for man-animal conflict. The first cheetah in the world to be bred in captivity was in India during the rule of Mughal emperor Jahangir. His father, Akbar, recorded that there were 10,000 cheetahs during his time. He reigned from 1556 to 1605. Much later, research suggested the number of cheetahs had dropped to a couple of hundred by the 19th Century - and the cat was reportedly sighted for the last time in India in 1967-68.

"The UK government has announced a series of measures to remove the Chinese phone-maker Huawei from the UK's 5G mobile networks. It will ban UK mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and they will have to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. The government had previously said Huawei could be involved in the project but it changed its mind following growing security concerns about China. Huawei was founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, southern China, by Ren Zhengfei, a former army officer. It started making communications equipment for mobile phone networks and is now a global leader, employing 180,000 workers. Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone supplier after Samsung,external, with 18% of the market - ahead of Apple and others. At the heart of the debate is a simple question: can the West trust Huawei or will using its equipment leave communication networks, and our own mobile phones, vulnerable? The US says Huawei could be used by China for spying, via its 5G equipment. It points to Mr Ren's military background and Huawei's role in communications networks to argue it represents a security risk. Mr Ren was member of China's army, the People's Liberation Army, for nine years until 1983. He is also a member of China's Communist party. Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987 But Huawei says this is not relevant: ""When Ren Zhengfei was a young man, you needed to be a Communist Party member to have any position of responsibility."" Washington has banned US firms from doing business with Huawei (for example, designing and producing chips) and wants its allies to ban it from their 5G networks. Australia and New Zealand have joined the US. For the UK, pressing ahead with using Huawei equipment could have affected vital UK-US trade talks (after Brexit) and the US warned such a decision could risk future security co-operation. But deciding to ban Huawei from 5G in the UK, could risk Chinese retaliation such as a possible cyber attack. Many countries are preparing to move from 4G to more advanced 5G mobile networks. Download speeds 10 times faster than today will radically change how we work, communicate and stream videos. In theory, controlling the tech at the heart of these networks could give Huawei the capacity to spy or disrupt communications during any future dispute. This is important, as more things - from self-driving cars to fridges, baby monitors and fire alarms become connected to the internet. The concern is that state-sponsored hackers could use these devices, which often have weaker security features, as back doors into strategically vital networks. For instance, this could make it possible to shut down a rivals' power stations. But removing Huawei equipment from the networks will have a significant impact on the roll-out of the UK's 5G technology. The Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be delayed by two to three years and with added costs of up to Â£2bn. The UK has been using Huawei kit since 2005 The US argues China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, which says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"", means Beijing could force Huawei to do its bidding. Huawei says it's never been asked to spy and ""would categorically refuse to comply"". It adds: ""We would never compromise or harm any country, organization, or individual, especially when it comes to cyber-security and user privacy protection."" To monitor the company, the UK set up the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, which comes under the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). In March 2019, it said it hadn't found evidence of malicious Chinese state activity, but it did identify some serious defects in Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security competence. Announcing the ban on 14 July, Mr Dowden said NSCS has now ""significantly changed their security assessment"" of Huawei's presence in the UK's 5G network. He said the decision followed Washington's tougher stance on the company but did not give further details. US buyers will almost certainly favour kit from US companies, such as Cisco, Juniper Networks, or Qualcomm. In Europe, 5G manufacturers include Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Nokia has issued a statement saying: ""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed."" The government says it will look at ""multiple vendors"" and will bring forward a Telecoms Security Bill in the autumn. The action does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers. If you use a Huawei phone, it's very unlikely the firm's handing your data to the Chinese government, though it is possible. In the same way, technically, data from a Google Pixel phone could be handed over to the US government. Newer Huawei models like this Huawei Mate 30 Pro won't get Android updates automatically In March last year, Google halted Huawei's licence for Android - the operating system for most of the world's phones, aside from Apple's iPhone. If your Huawei phone was issued before the ban it will receive Android updates, but newer models won't. However Huawei is trying to work around this. As Huawei is from Guangdong province where Cantonese is the main dialect, the firm says its name should be pronounced ""wah-way"". However, some Mandarin speakers argue that the name is pronounced ""hwah-way"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Raab: ""Risk cannot be eliminated in telecoms"" MPs have attacked the government's decision to allow Huawei technology to be used in the UK's 5G mobile networks. Some called for an outright ban during a debate in the Commons, arguing even limited access put UK security at risk. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the decision followed a ""rigorous"" review by security experts and ""tight restrictions"" would be in place. They include a ban on using the Chinese firm's technology in so-called ""core"" parts of the network. The firm's kit will also only be allowed to account for up to 35% of the network's peripheral equipment. Huawei has always denied it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients. Its vice president, Victor Zhang, welcomed the UK's decision, saying it would ""result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future"". Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei: What is 5G's core and why protect it? Boris Johnson has sought to allay US security concerns about Huawei's involvement in a phone call with President Donald Trump. Downing Street said the prime minister had ""underlined the importance of like-minded countries working together to diversify the market and break the dominance of a small number of companies"". Mr Trump has yet to comment publicly on the UK's decision although the White House has said it is ""disappointed"" and a number of US politicians have warned of the possible repercussions. Giving a statement to MPs, Mr Raab said: ""I hope the whole House will agree that if we are to achieve our digital connectivity ambitions, it is absolutely imperative that we trust the safety and security of our telecom networks. ""Risk cannot be eliminated in telecoms. But it is the job of government, Ofcom and industry to work together to ensure we reduce our vulnerabilities and mitigate those risks."" This video can not be played 5G explained in 45 seconds However, his statement did not reassure a raft of MPs from all sides of the House who criticised the move. Former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis said ""the only way to protect our safety is to ban it"", while his backbench colleague Julian Lewis said Huawei was ""intimately linked with the Chinese communist state and its deeply hostile intelligence agency"". The SNP's John Nicholson said the firm's technology was ""not safe"" to use and the government had ""chosen low cost over security"". His colleague, Carol Monaghan, said she did not know if it was ""naivety or arrogance preventing the UK government from seeing the high risk being presented to security"". Earlier, Labour's shadow culture secretary, Tracy Brabin, criticised the government for ""failing to invest in home-grown alternatives to Huawei"", which she claimed put them in the ""ludicrous position of having to choose between the UK's security concerns and our infrastructure needs"". That issue was raised by a number of MPs, including the DUP's Sammy Wilson, who asked for assurances from Mr Raab that ""in future [the UK will] not be as dependent on foreign technology"". Tory MP David Davis and the SNP's Carol Monaghan criticised the decision to allow Huawei into UK G networks Tory Iain Duncan Smith said it ""beggars belief"" that the firm was given the green light when the UK had ""a cyber war going on with China"". He urged the government to ensure it was ""driven out"" of the UK market as soon as possible. The foreign secretary admitted there were only three major vendors that made kit suitable for 5G networks - Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia - and it was a ""market failure that needs to be addressed"". He added: ""The government is developing an ambitious strategy to help diversify the supply chain. ""This will entail the deployment of all the tools at the government's disposal, including funding."" By BBC News online political reporter Jennifer Scott It's only six weeks since Boris Johnson stormed to victory in the general election - winning with an 80-strong majority - but the honeymoon is over and the prime minister now has serious government business to attend to. The coming few weeks demand some big decisions from Mr Johnson and his cabinet. Huawei was the first - but what are the others?Find out here. Despite the backlash in Parliament, other MPs have welcomed the government's decision. Former Prime Minister Theresa May said the government had made ""the decision that protects our national security but also recognises the interests of economy."" Former Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said it seemed to be a ""sensible compromise"" and Huawei technology could be used as long as the government was ""sensible, cautious and following the advice of the intelligence agencies"". Labour's Kevan Jones a former member of the Intelligence and Security Committee - also told MPs he had seen nothing to suggest the decision would compromise the UK's intelligence relationship with its key allies. Today's decision marks a significant gamble by Boris Johnson. The hope within government is that the restrictions imposed on Huawei will be enough to avoid a major breakdown in relations with the United States and appease critical Tory MPs. At the same time, however, it's hoped the restrictions will be sufficiently light touch not to delay the roll-out of super fast broadband - thereby compromising Boris Johnson's election pledge to ""level up"" living standards outside of London and the south.

"The UK has decided to let Huawei continue to be used in its growing 5G networks - but with restrictions. Thelong-awaited decisiongoes against advice and pressure from the US to block the firm for security reasons. But some industry-watchers believe it will benefit the wider rollout of next-generation mobile data services. ""I think it's a pragmatic decision that brings stability and continuity in the 5G ecosystem,"" commented Stephane Teral from IHS Markit. ""Huawei has been investing in the UK and in other countries in Europe including France, Germany, Italy, and Poland since the beginning of this century. A ban would have been disastrous."" Firstly, the decision is seen as a blow to US-UK relations. After months of lobbying by Washington, Westminster has gone against one of its closest allies. A Trump administration official has said the US ""is disappointed"" with the decision. And both Democrats and Republicans have tweeted their disgust. Allow Twitter content?

Conversely, the decision to allow one of China's most important and valuable companies to operate in the UK is an endorsement that will please Beijing. Chinese diplomats had warned the UK there could be ""substantial"" repercussions to other trade and investment plans had the company been banned outright. Sources close to Huawei suggest that the UK's decision is likely to have a favourable impact on other markets, where Huawei is being considered as part of the 5G rollout. The US, Australia and Japan decided some time ago to ban Huawei kit from being used in 5G telecommunications networks, but many other countries are still deciding what to do. It is expected to have an almost instant impact on the nations that make up the Five Eyes security partnership: Whilst the US and Australia has already banned the brand, New Zealand and Canada are now expected to follow the UK's lead. The debate is raging across the European Union, where Europe's leading telecoms operators - all Huawei customers - have lobbied against an outright ban. The EU will soon publish a bloc-wide framework to address risks in networks but is not expected to place any bans on individual companies. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to be at odds with many in her party who want to remove Huawei from the existing German networks. Britain's decision could bolster her case. Angela Merkel says eliminating individual 5G equipment providers might not make Germany any safer Huawei has had a strong footprint in many African countries for years, and 5G is already being built and tested with the company's kit. South Africa is the first and only country on the continent to have commercially launched a 5G service. And the company responsible for doing this, Rain, uses the Chinese firm's products. Other countries, including India, are currently trialling Huawei technology but are yet to decide on full rollout. They will no doubt look to the UK's analysis, not least the documents that the National Cyber Security Centre has published, to back up their decision. Elsewhere, Huawei is making a major push in South America and facing little-to-no restrictions in many large markets including Brazil. Britain's semi-endorsement of the company will no doubt aid Huawei as it continues to build out networks there.

Campbell said he did not share the government's enthusiasm for
the compromises which had been made. He expressed ""great concern"" about the UK ""being at odds

He asks whether Washington's anxiety is primarily about the UK's ability to mitigate the risk or about the message it may send to other countries who do not have the same abilities. Mr Raab says the UK is coming from a starting position of having Huawei already involved in our networks. ""We considered all of these aspects,"" he says.

She insists that steps have been taken to mitigate any risks and ""in no way would this government"" ever jeopardise national security. She says there will be no effect on intelligence sharing. She is asked what message the UK is sending onhuman rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in China. In reply, she says the UK has been clear these abuses ""must stop"" but it is ""not an either-or"" situation; the UK can criticise China on human rights while working with Chinese firms.

House of CommonsParliament Former Prime Minister Theresa May says she commends the government for its decision over Huawei. It was, of course, a decision her government was originally working on. She reinforces Mr Raab's words by saying: ""We never have had and never will have high-risk vendors in our most
sensitive networks. ""There will be no effect on our ability to share intelligence with our
allies."" House of CommonsParliament Answering Labour's points, the foreign secretary says high-risk vendors ""never have been and never will be in our sensitive networks"". Huawei, as we said, is being designated high risk - and therefore will face restrictions around its involvement in the UK market.

As events continue in the Commons, a statement has come in from mobile operator O2. ""Huawei kit makes up less than 1% of our owned network infrastructure,"" it says. ""We will continue to develop our 5G
network with minimum disruption with our primary vendors Nokia and Ericsson."" Nokia, of course, are Finnish and Swedish firms respectively. O2 says it agrees with the government that ""diversity of supply is the best way to serve
customers,"" but adds that ""careful consideration must be given to the distinction between
'core' and 'non-core' as 5G networks develop and evolve. We'll now take time to
review the full report."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds now replies to Dominic Raab. He says the need for ""guarantees about safety and security"" is crucial if Huawei is to be involved in the UK's 5G system. He also warns that the UK should not be ""held hostage"" over any impact on a US trade deal. ""As we assess potential risk we should be ensuring that the
UK network is constructed in the best possible condition to withstand attacks,"" he tells MPs. The shadow minister is also critical of previous Conservative governments, suggesting poor investment decisions have meant the ""UK is left to choose between just three 5G vendors."" What is the
government going to do about diversifying the market, he asks. âThe government needs to act."" House of CommonsParliament Mr Raab says the decision ""follows a rigorous and evidence-based review"" - the most comprehensive done anywhere in the world. This limited green light for Huawei is the ""right decision"", and the government will have the ""right measures in place"" to make it work. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps meets people at the launch at Fleetwood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has launched a government fund to help restore historic railway lines closed in the 1960s after the Beeching report. The Â£500m fund will not be used to build new railway lines - it is only meant to fund feasibility studies of routes that could be restored. The plan was promised in November's Conservative election manifesto. But Labour called the initiative ""meaningless"", adding that Â£500m would help reopen just 25 miles of railway. And the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the funds as a ""drop in the ocean"". Conservatives pledge Â£4.2bn for trains, buses and trams Work gets under way on new Â£8m railway station The government will start by funding proposals for two lines - the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line in Northumberland and the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. Communities will also be able to apply for some of the remainder of the Â£500m pot to help restore their lines. Roughly 5,000 miles of track were closed and more than 2,300 stations were axed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, followingthe Beeching report. The aim was to cut the mounting debts of the nationalised British Rail by removing duplicated routes and closing the least-used branch lines of the railway. This became known as the Beeching cuts. The plans drew huge opposition from rural local communities, which campaigned and successfully prevented some routes and stations from closing. On Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited the Fleetwood and Poulton-le-Fylde line which was closed in 1970. ""Many communities still live with the scars that came from the closure of their local railway more than five decades ago,"" he said. ""Investing in transport links is essential to levelling up access to opportunities across the country, ensuring our regions are better connected, local economies flourish and more than half a century of isolation is undone."" People in Fleetwood, a town of 25,000 that is hemmed in on the Lancashire coast, told us unanimously that reopening their defunct rail line to nearby Poulton-le-Fylde would be a good thing. They say their town has lost so much over the years and they hope that restoring the railway would help regenerate the area and cut congestion on the roads. The government is currently falling over itself to back policies that improve regional connectivity around the country. Just think of its bailout for the regional airline Flybe. But today's announcement is only a tentative step towards recreating a functioning railway to Fleetwood. An assessment of the economic and social case will now be carried out. The funding for Fleetwood - Â£100,000 - is peanuts for now. If the assessment is positive, more money will follow. However, even Â£500m (the total funding pledged for helping to reopen lines cut during the Beeching era) is not a big sum of money in railway infrastructure terms. Michael Byng, a railway construction consultant, believes reopening the Colne to Skipton line near Leeds would cost around Â£368m on its own. He also believes that reopening the rail line to Fleetwood, which does have a tram that runs along the coast to Blackpool, would not be money well spent and other options like improving the connectivity of the tram itself should be considered. Commenting on the proposals, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. ""Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds."" This video can not be played Volunteer train driver Chris Cubitt and North Yorkshire Moors Railway general manager Philip Benham on 50 years since Beeching Axe rail report Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, was similarly sceptical about the government's plans. ""RMT welcomes any investment in our railways but Â£500m is a drop in the ocean compared to what's really required to connect our abandoned communities and reverse decades of cuts to infrastructure and maintenance,"" he said. Dennis Fancett, chairman of South East Northumberland Rail User Group, told the BBC: ""What I was really hoping for was an announcement that we're all systems go and funding for the entire reopening is provided and building can start. ""The business case for reopening this line is the economic regeneration of South East Northumberland."" Brian Crawford, chairman of the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society, said restoration of the disused railway line to Fleetwood from Poulton-le-Fylde could reinvigorate the coastal town. ""There are two aims - one of commuters going to work and the other one is to make Fleetwood a major tourist destination. It has a fantastic seafront but without a railway, we don't seem to get that many visitors,"" he told the BBC. Do you have a question about the government's rail plans?

"The UK's financial regulator has asked banks to explain how they have decided their new overdraft rates. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said most High Street banks had set ""very similar prices"",after it demanded changes to the system. Several big brands including Santander, Lloyds Banking Group and HSBC are set to bring in a 39.9% rate this year. The FCA has sent a letter to banks,external, asking them to explain what influenced their decision. The City regulator has also asked how the banks will deal with any customers who could be worse off following the changes. It said some firms could reduce or waive interest for customers who are in financial difficulty because of their overdraft. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, told the BBC's Today programme that seven in 10 customers would be better off or unaffected by the new rules. ""If you had an unarranged overdraft before, you saw some rates that were 10 times higher than the equivalent payday loans. ""The reforms force banks to publish clear headline rates, without fixed fees and charges in them. In some banks, as many as nine in 10 customers will be better off, or no worse off."" The FCA has introduced tough new rules for the ""dysfunctional"" overdraft market. It says it wants to get rid of ""confusing"" fees for customers. The new rules, which come into force in April this year, will stop banks and building societies from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts. They will also require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and to get rid of fixed daily or monthly fees. However, some analysts have warnedthat steep overdraft rates could become ""the new normal"". As the hackneyed phrase says, we change partners more often than we switch bank accounts. So, when the FCA announced what it called the biggest overhaul of overdrafts for generation, its aim was to inspire competition. The theory is that a clear, simple overdraft interest rate allows customers to compare and move current accounts, potentially saving them a lot of money. Now the banks have pretty much clustered around the same, somewhat expensive 40% rate, there is little sign of any competition at all. It should not be forgotten that the changes will mean more support for those facing financial trouble, and those who used to regularly bust their overdraft limit will not be hit so hard. But you can understand the accusations that the reforms have backfired for the regulator, and why it has now responded by asking questions of the banks. Most banks and building societies have chosen to set a rate very close to 40%. Lloyds Banking Group, which includes the Halifax bank, was one of the latest big brandsto announce most customers will soon pay an annual rate of 39.9%to dip into their overdraft. That means they would pay Â£39.90 for each Â£100 borrowed in an overdraft for a whole year. The FCA has previously acknowledged that banks might increase their arranged overdraft prices as a result of the new rules. But it argues the overall effect will still be better for customers - and increased competition between providers as a result of the changes will constrain any price increases.

"A multi-million pound publicity blitz to prepare the public for leaving the EU appears to have had little impact, a spending watchdog has said. The National Audit Office said Â£46m was spent on the ""Get ready for Brexit"" campaign ahead of the UK's expected departure at the end of last October. But the campaign was halted three days before the UK was supposed to leave after the EU granted another extension. The NAO said it was ""not clear"" it left people ""significantly better prepared"". But the Cabinet Office, which is in charge of Brexit preparations, said to have not done anything in the run-up to the 31 October deadline would have risked ""significant and unnecessary disruption"". The department estimated the campaign reached had 99.8% of the population, with every member of the public having the opportunity to see the range of billboard, print, TV and online adverts 55 times. Varadkar: EU will have stronger team in trade talks Commemorative Brexit 50p coin unveiled 'Get ready for Brexit' campaign launches The publicity drive was ordered by Boris Johnson after he became prime minister last July, with his ""do or die"" promise to leave by 31 October. It ran for nearly two months before being halted on 28 October - after the PM was forced by Parliament to request a further three-month delay. The campaign encouraged people and businesses to visitthe government's main gov.uk website,externalto answer questions and receive advice on preparing for the UK's exit from the bloc. Among those specifically targeted were British citizens who were intending to travel to Europe in the days and weeks after Brexit and businesses that exported to the EU. The watchdog said the numbers of people looking for information about Brexit did not notably change as a result - ranging from 32% and 37% during the campaign, to 34% when it stopped. ""At short notice, the Cabinet Office successfully corralled multiple government departments to work together effectively and launched this complex campaign at great speed,"" said the NAO's chief executive, Gareth Davies. ""However, it is not clear that the campaign resulted in the public being significantly better prepared."" The Liberal Democrats said the campaign had been ""an expensive propaganda stunt"" designed to help get Mr Johnson re-elected. Their education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, urged the Electoral Commission to look into whether the millions spent should be included in the Conservative Party's declared election campaign expenditure. In response, the government said the watchdog had acknowledged the campaign increased public awareness of the action they needed to take to be ready to leave the EU. The UK will leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 31 January. It will continue to follow EU rules until the end of 2020 under the terms of an 11-month transition period.

"The UK government has announced a series of measures to remove the Chinese phone-maker Huawei from the UK's 5G mobile networks. It will ban UK mobile providers from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after the end of this year and they will have to remove all of its 5G kit from their networks by 2027. The government had previously said Huawei could be involved in the project but it changed its mind following growing security concerns about China. Huawei was founded in 1987 in Shenzhen, southern China, by Ren Zhengfei, a former army officer. It started making communications equipment for mobile phone networks and is now a global leader, employing 180,000 workers. Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone supplier after Samsung,external, with 18% of the market - ahead of Apple and others. At the heart of the debate is a simple question: can the West trust Huawei or will using its equipment leave communication networks, and our own mobile phones, vulnerable? The US says Huawei could be used by China for spying, via its 5G equipment. It points to Mr Ren's military background and Huawei's role in communications networks to argue it represents a security risk. Mr Ren was member of China's army, the People's Liberation Army, for nine years until 1983. He is also a member of China's Communist party. Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987 But Huawei says this is not relevant: ""When Ren Zhengfei was a young man, you needed to be a Communist Party member to have any position of responsibility."" Washington has banned US firms from doing business with Huawei (for example, designing and producing chips) and wants its allies to ban it from their 5G networks. Australia and New Zealand have joined the US. For the UK, pressing ahead with using Huawei equipment could have affected vital UK-US trade talks (after Brexit) and the US warned such a decision could risk future security co-operation. But deciding to ban Huawei from 5G in the UK, could risk Chinese retaliation such as a possible cyber attack. Many countries are preparing to move from 4G to more advanced 5G mobile networks. Download speeds 10 times faster than today will radically change how we work, communicate and stream videos. In theory, controlling the tech at the heart of these networks could give Huawei the capacity to spy or disrupt communications during any future dispute. This is important, as more things - from self-driving cars to fridges, baby monitors and fire alarms become connected to the internet. The concern is that state-sponsored hackers could use these devices, which often have weaker security features, as back doors into strategically vital networks. For instance, this could make it possible to shut down a rivals' power stations. But removing Huawei equipment from the networks will have a significant impact on the roll-out of the UK's 5G technology. The Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said it would be delayed by two to three years and with added costs of up to Â£2bn. The UK has been using Huawei kit since 2005 The US argues China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, which says organisations must ""support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work"", means Beijing could force Huawei to do its bidding. Huawei says it's never been asked to spy and ""would categorically refuse to comply"". It adds: ""We would never compromise or harm any country, organization, or individual, especially when it comes to cyber-security and user privacy protection."" To monitor the company, the UK set up the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, which comes under the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). In March 2019, it said it hadn't found evidence of malicious Chinese state activity, but it did identify some serious defects in Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security competence. Announcing the ban on 14 July, Mr Dowden said NSCS has now ""significantly changed their security assessment"" of Huawei's presence in the UK's 5G network. He said the decision followed Washington's tougher stance on the company but did not give further details. US buyers will almost certainly favour kit from US companies, such as Cisco, Juniper Networks, or Qualcomm. In Europe, 5G manufacturers include Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia. Nokia has issued a statement saying: ""We have the capacity and expertise to replace all of the Huawei equipment in the UK's networks at scale and speed."" The government says it will look at ""multiple vendors"" and will bring forward a Telecoms Security Bill in the autumn. The action does not affect Huawei's ability to sell its smartphones to consumers. If you use a Huawei phone, it's very unlikely the firm's handing your data to the Chinese government, though it is possible. In the same way, technically, data from a Google Pixel phone could be handed over to the US government. Newer Huawei models like this Huawei Mate 30 Pro won't get Android updates automatically In March last year, Google halted Huawei's licence for Android - the operating system for most of the world's phones, aside from Apple's iPhone. If your Huawei phone was issued before the ban it will receive Android updates, but newer models won't. However Huawei is trying to work around this. As Huawei is from Guangdong province where Cantonese is the main dialect, the firm says its name should be pronounced ""wah-way"". However, some Mandarin speakers argue that the name is pronounced ""hwah-way"". Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"Government decides to allow Chinese firm Huawei limited involvement in the UK's 5G network Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab makes a statement in the Commons on the issue He insists the decision is the ""right"" one for the UK's security and its economy But some MPs, including senior Tories, are unhappy at the move - US reaction has also been critical Some peers also criticise the move after Culture Secretary Baroness Morgan makes a statement Emma Harrison and Lucy Webster Discussions on Huawei have now ended in both the Commons and the Lords.

curve"". He said the limit to 35% of the kit was
welcome but asked whether this would be reduced over time to ""wean operators
off the Chinese provider"". Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord
Campbell said he did not share the government's enthusiasm for
the compromises which had been made. He expressed ""great concern"" about the UK ""being at odds

As events continue in the Commons, a statement has come in from mobile operator O2. ""Huawei kit makes up less than 1% of our owned network infrastructure,"" it says. ""We will continue to develop our 5G
network with minimum disruption with our primary vendors Nokia and Ericsson."" Nokia, of course, are Finnish and Swedish firms respectively. O2 says it agrees with the government that ""diversity of supply is the best way to serve
customers,"" but adds that ""careful consideration must be given to the distinction between
'core' and 'non-core' as 5G networks develop and evolve. We'll now take time to
review the full report."" House of CommonsParliament Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds now replies to Dominic Raab. He says the need for ""guarantees about safety and security"" is crucial if Huawei is to be involved in the UK's 5G system. He also warns that the UK should not be ""held hostage"" over any impact on a US trade deal. ""As we assess potential risk we should be ensuring that the
UK network is constructed in the best possible condition to withstand attacks,"" he tells MPs. The shadow minister is also critical of previous Conservative governments, suggesting poor investment decisions have meant the ""UK is left to choose between just three 5G vendors."" What is the
government going to do about diversifying the market, he asks. âThe government needs to act."" House of CommonsParliament Mr Raab says the decision ""follows a rigorous and evidence-based review"" - the most comprehensive done anywhere in the world. This limited green light for Huawei is the ""right decision"", and the government will have the ""right measures in place"" to make it work. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Keeping spirits up in virus-hit Wuhan As the number of coronavirus infections continues to grow, millions of people have gone into lockdown in Wuhan - the centre of the outbreak - to try to stop the virus spreading. But in this time of isolation some people are determined to raise each others' spirits. The deadly outbreak comes as China celebrates one of the most important dates in its calendar  - Lunar New Year. Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one - typically a time filled with lots of cheer. For many, it's the only chance in a year they have to meet up with their family and exchange gifts of food and money. In Wuhan people have been encouraged to stay home to minimise the spread of the virus. But residents in a block of flats found a small way to cheer each other up. Videos circulating on social media show people shouting ""Wuhan jiayou"" out of their windows- roughly translated to ""Stay strong Wuhan"" or ""Keep on going Wuhan"". This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city The phrase is echoed across the block and residents can be heard cheering in the background. Add oil! The Chinese expression keeping people going Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? China coronavirus: A visual guide Coronavirus: How worried should we be? It's also a cheer that's being repeated online. On social media site Weibo, the phrase ""Wuhan jiayou"" has been trending. Many across different parts of the country are posting the phrase in solidarity with Wuhan - where the majority of deaths as a result of the virus have occurred. ""We will get through this. Wuhan jiayou, the whole country is supporting you,"" said one comment on Weibo. More than one hundred people - mostly in Wuhan - have now died as a result of the outbreak which has spread across China and internationally. Though there is plenty of fear and anger at the authorities on social media in China, state media has been highlighting kind acts and stories of residents banding together in Wuhan. One new restaurant owner in Wuhan spent the Lunar New Year festival packing food for medical workers in the city, according to state news outlet Changjiang Daily. Li Bo had opened a restaurant in the city just a month ago. He sold his car and borrowed money in order to raise the funds for it. But before the 36-year-old could properly get his business started, the outbreak kicked in - leaving the streets of the city empty and his restaurant deserted. ""I panicked. I lay at home worrying about how I was going to repay the loan,"" he told Changjiang Daily. ""But then I saw [news] about how the medical staff in hospitals were struggling and I felt like it was time for me act. I wanted to do my part, no matter how insignificant."" According to a report by news site Beijing News, some hospitals in Wuhan have experienced food shortages. Two residents living in Wuhan had previously told the BBC that people in the city have been trying to stockpile food. Li Bo is packing 200 lunch boxes for medical workers at a local hospital Li Bo along with his chef spent days buying ingredients and cooking enough food to fit into 200 boxes. He told the news outlet on 26 January that he was in the process of finding enough boxes to pack the food into, adding that the meals would eventually be delivered to medical staff in Wuhan's Xiehe Hospital. ""I wanted to do my best to [make sure] the medical staff eat hot meals. I hope they get the nutrition they need and that will boost their immunity,"" he told the paper, adding that he plans to continue the food deliveries for as long as he can. ""I hope the city we love gets better soon."" Fears of the coronavirus have seen thousands across the country flocking to buy face masks - triggering a mask shortage in some places. Masks have become such a valuable commodity that many on Weibo have joked that they would rather receive face masks instead of the typical monetary gifts given out during Lunar New Year. One villager in Changde, a neighbouring province of Hubei where Wuhan is located, decided he would donate almost 15,000 face masks, according to news outlet the Xiaoxiang Morning Herald. Hao Jin had last year worked in a mask production factory. He eventually resigned from the job but the company could not afford to pay him his salary. He was instead given 15,000 masks - worth 20,000 yuan (Â£2,207; $2,883) as a form of compensation. He brought the masks home and forgot about them until he heard news of the mask shortage. ""I thought I would donate the masks I have to those in need, I hope they can be of more use and value to others,"" he said. He kept a handful of the masks for his family, and distributed some to those in his village before donating the rest to people in his county.

"Whether to allow Huawei to help build the UK's 5G networks is one of the most consequential and difficult national security decisions a British government has ever faced. The decision -due to be made at a meeting of the National Security Council later- involves balancing complex technical risks with geopolitics and costs to the economy. But it is also an issue where room for manoeuvre is tight - partly thanks to a series of decisions going back over the years which have closed down options. If you want to understand how we got where we are, it is worth going back more than a decade and a half to when BT was upgrading the UK's telecoms infrastructure. It wanted to use Huawei equipment because it was cheaper. What is Huawei and what is its role in UK 5G? Using Huawei in UK 5G network 'madness', says US The story of a controversial company BT - using a trick that operators are still using today - warned that excluding Huawei would cost vast amounts of money requiring compensation from the government. Few at the time appreciated the significance of the decision. It was only after it had been taken that officials began to question whether it had opened up the UK to surveillance or even sabotage from China - something Huawei itself has always said is impossible. And so a strategy was created to minimise the danger. Steps included making sure there were multiple suppliers in the network and ensuring risky vendors (in others words Huawei) were kept out of the most sensitive parts of the network (for instance the core which controls how it functions). The history means the UK intelligence community believes it has a much better understanding than anyone else about how to manage the risk from Huawei. As the use of Huawei spread to other telecoms operators, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) was created to carefully evaluate the physical equipment and the code that Huawei was introducing into the UK. Huawei's main UK office is in Reading, west of London I visitedwhat became known as ""the cell""in Banbury 2013. The security was intense - in one inner room a computer with access to the Huawei source code sat watched by CCTV cameras to prevent any unauthorised access. No deliberate backdoor or evidence of espionage has ever been found. But there have been issues. A 2018 oversight report was highly critical of the company's engineering standards, and the 2019 report saidno material progress had been made to address those concerns,which left it with only ""limited assurance"" that security could be protected. This experience though has created a degree of confidence from intelligence and security officials that they can mitigate the risks of using Huawei in a 5G network, by putting in place a suite of restrictions. But they also caution that the ultimate decision has to be political since it involves balancing the technical advice with the diplomatic and economic costs. Panorama: can we trust Huawei? The 5G network is being built partly on top of 4G, so excluding Huawei from 5G in the UK (unlike the US where it plays almost no role) also means ripping it out of 4G. That will be costly and slow down the roll-out of increased connectivity, which this government has made a priority. That decision has also been made harder by delay - it was due to be taken nearly a year ago but leaks and elections have got in the way. This video can not be played Johnson: UK will ""come up"" with a solution on Huawei In the meantime, 5G is already being rolled out. The telecoms operators have been pressing their case to use Huawei and using its equipment. This means the costs of excluding the company have been going up by the day. Saying ""no"" will slow down the much-heralded promise of greater connectivity. But delay has also given the US and critics more time to marshal their arguments against using the Chinese company, including presenting a recent dossier - althoughUK officials say it lacked any ""smoking gun"". The US has saidit will review intelligence sharingif the UK does use Huawei. UK officials believe - or perhaps hope - that Washington is bluffing. That is a big call. One of the challenges is disentangling this subject from the broader trade confrontation between China and the US, and the unpredictable nature of President Trump. At times, there have been signs that Huawei has become a bargaining chip in that broader battle. UK officials may have feared that they could exclude Huawei and anger China, only to find the US President cutting a deal with Beijing and leaving them isolated. Some British officials caution that this overlooks the fact that concerns about the company go much deeper in Washington, where national security officials are increasingly focused on the technological challenge from China. The US has taken a hard line because it knows the UK decision has global significance. Many other countries are going through similar debates right now. Like the UK, they would like to use Huawei because it is cheap but fear the security risks and the wrath of the US. If the UK approves the use of Huawei many of them may use that as cover to follow suit. Few others though have the technical experience of monitoring Huawei that the UK has built up. The global perspective goes to one of the wider long-term risks. Some people ask how we have got to a position where we are needing to even consider using Chinese technology. The answer is because Western countries failed to think strategically about protecting or nurturing their own full spectrum telecoms industry over the last two decades. Companies went bust or were taken over. Meanwhile Beijing pursued a focused long-term strategy to become a leader in the technology. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has voiced concerns about depending on Huawei Approval for Huawei in the UK with others following in its wake, would be likely to accelerate the company's rise and the risks of dependency. The risks of it becoming a dominant player were expressed by former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ""The issue is what happens if we get to the situation where no Western companies are really able to compete with Huawei going forward,"" he told the BBC. ""Like it or not, in a decade's time people will look back and say, 'was this really wise to take this decision in 2020 that has led to this dependency?'"" The US is talking about building greater Western capability in this field, but it is not yet clear what this actually looks like or how long it would take to deliver. And there is a lot of talk in Washington about having lost 5G but making sure not to lose 6G. Huawei itself has always maintained that it is not an arm of the Chinese state and will not spy on its behalf. But the more dominant it becomes in the coming years, the harder it might be to extract the company from a network if it was found to have done something wrong. So Tuesday's decision comes down to balancing significant but hard to quantify long-term risks with real short-term economic costs. Past decisions have narrowed the UK's options. And this one may do so again. Do you have a question about Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network?

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps meets people at the launch at Fleetwood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has launched a government fund to help restore historic railway lines closed in the 1960s after the Beeching report. The Â£500m fund will not be used to build new railway lines - it is only meant to fund feasibility studies of routes that could be restored. The plan was promised in November's Conservative election manifesto. But Labour called the initiative ""meaningless"", adding that Â£500m would help reopen just 25 miles of railway. And the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the funds as a ""drop in the ocean"". Conservatives pledge Â£4.2bn for trains, buses and trams Work gets under way on new Â£8m railway station The government will start by funding proposals for two lines - the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line in Northumberland and the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. Communities will also be able to apply for some of the remainder of the Â£500m pot to help restore their lines. Roughly 5,000 miles of track were closed and more than 2,300 stations were axed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, followingthe Beeching report. The aim was to cut the mounting debts of the nationalised British Rail by removing duplicated routes and closing the least-used branch lines of the railway. This became known as the Beeching cuts. The plans drew huge opposition from rural local communities, which campaigned and successfully prevented some routes and stations from closing. On Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited the Fleetwood and Poulton-le-Fylde line which was closed in 1970. ""Many communities still live with the scars that came from the closure of their local railway more than five decades ago,"" he said. ""Investing in transport links is essential to levelling up access to opportunities across the country, ensuring our regions are better connected, local economies flourish and more than half a century of isolation is undone."" People in Fleetwood, a town of 25,000 that is hemmed in on the Lancashire coast, told us unanimously that reopening their defunct rail line to nearby Poulton-le-Fylde would be a good thing. They say their town has lost so much over the years and they hope that restoring the railway would help regenerate the area and cut congestion on the roads. The government is currently falling over itself to back policies that improve regional connectivity around the country. Just think of its bailout for the regional airline Flybe. But today's announcement is only a tentative step towards recreating a functioning railway to Fleetwood. An assessment of the economic and social case will now be carried out. The funding for Fleetwood - Â£100,000 - is peanuts for now. If the assessment is positive, more money will follow. However, even Â£500m (the total funding pledged for helping to reopen lines cut during the Beeching era) is not a big sum of money in railway infrastructure terms. Michael Byng, a railway construction consultant, believes reopening the Colne to Skipton line near Leeds would cost around Â£368m on its own. He also believes that reopening the rail line to Fleetwood, which does have a tram that runs along the coast to Blackpool, would not be money well spent and other options like improving the connectivity of the tram itself should be considered. Commenting on the proposals, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. ""Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds."" This video can not be played Volunteer train driver Chris Cubitt and North Yorkshire Moors Railway general manager Philip Benham on 50 years since Beeching Axe rail report Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, was similarly sceptical about the government's plans. ""RMT welcomes any investment in our railways but Â£500m is a drop in the ocean compared to what's really required to connect our abandoned communities and reverse decades of cuts to infrastructure and maintenance,"" he said. Dennis Fancett, chairman of South East Northumberland Rail User Group, told the BBC: ""What I was really hoping for was an announcement that we're all systems go and funding for the entire reopening is provided and building can start. ""The business case for reopening this line is the economic regeneration of South East Northumberland."" Brian Crawford, chairman of the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society, said restoration of the disused railway line to Fleetwood from Poulton-le-Fylde could reinvigorate the coastal town. ""There are two aims - one of commuters going to work and the other one is to make Fleetwood a major tourist destination. It has a fantastic seafront but without a railway, we don't seem to get that many visitors,"" he told the BBC. Do you have a question about the government's rail plans?

"The government should drop the salary threshold for immigrants by more than Â£4,000, a committee has advised. Skilled migrants from outside the EU currently need to have a job offer with a minimum salary of Â£30,000. But the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC),externalsaid it should fall to Â£25,600 for all workers to help recruit teachers and skilled NHS staff. The committee's chair also called Boris Johnson's proposal for a new points-based immigration system a ""soundbite"". Mr Johnson said he wanted a scheme, based on Australia's system, during his summer campaign to lead the Conservative Party, and he made it a key pledge during the election. BBC Briefing on immigration How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Prof Alan Manning, from the MAC, said while he recognised politicians needed ""cosmetic"" means of presenting complex topics to the public, it was unclear what the government meant when it had repeatedly used the phrase. The outgoing chairman said: ""No perfect system exists and there are unavoidable, difficult trade-offs."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers would carefully consider the committee's recommendations but stressed the report was ""advisory"". ""I think it's important to recognize the British public voted for change when it came to immigration,"" she said. ""We are committed to ensuring we have a system... that has the ability to level up across the whole of the UK in a way that immigration policy has failed for too long."" There are a range of visas in the current system As part of the European Union, anyone from other member states - or from the European Economic Area (EEA) - can come to the UK to live or work without a visa. For those outside the EU, there are a range of visas they can attempt to qualify for. One of them is the Tier 1 or ""exceptional talent"" visa - a points based system for highly qualified people who need to be endorsed as a leader or emerging leader, but do not need a job offer - capped at 2,000 offers a year. Another is the Tier 2 (general) visa - where the applicant has to match exact criteria, including having a job offer with a minimum salary of Â£30,000. There is also a Tier 2 (general) visa with a lower salary threshold if the applicant is on the so-called Shortage Occupation List, which includes nurses and engineers. Priti Patel and Sajid Javid have both asked the MAC for reviews Theresa May's government announced a look at changes to the immigration system based on skills in December 2018. In June 2019, the then-home secretary (and now Chancellor) Sajid Javid said he wanted to build on this work, especially looking at salary thresholds for migrant workers. He wrote to the MAC - an independent body that advises the government on immigration - to ask them to work with businesses to find out what next steps to take. After Boris Johnson became prime minister, one of his main pledges was to create an overall points-based system for immigration. This would see applicants assigned points based on a number of professional and personal characteristics, with higher points awarded for more desirable traits - from the amount of time they have worked in a skilled sector through to their proficiency in the English language. The PM asked his new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, to also write to the MAC and seek their recommendations on implementing such a system. The MAC released the 278-page report on Tuesday In its report,external, the committee criticised the UK's current complex immigration system. When it came to Tier 1 visas, the committee said the rules ""set too high a bar for the definition of 'exceptional talent' and is often not a route well-suited for those who satisfy the existing definition"". It recommended the government could expand this way of entering the UK, especially increasing the number of points awarded to those with the most desired skills, and focusing on  younger applicants and those showing promise, rather than already being established. For Tier 2 (general) visas, the committee said the criteria were too strict to call it a points based system as applicants have to meet every one. However, they recommended keeping the existing framework of the visa with some changes. For example, it thinks the government should lower the threshold for the salary needed by someone with a job offer from Â£30,000 to Â£25,600. The committee dismissed those calling for no threshold, believing it stopped the undercutting of the labour market, ensured migrants made a net positive contribution to the public finances, and made sure migration policy supported the ""ambition to make the UK a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy"". But it said the drop would enable more medium-skilled workers to qualify. The MAC said whatever the government decides, it must work quickly to get something in place for post-Brexit immigration. The committee warned about social care If adopted by the government, the first people it would affect would be EU citizens. With the UK leaving the bloc at the end of the month, and the so-called transition period - where we align with EU rules while a trade deal is negotiated - ending in December 2020, they will instead face the same hurdles as immigrants coming from outside the EU to the UK. There would be an increase in the variety of skilled workers who could get a visa, not only because of the lower threshold, but with more additions to the skilled workers list, including carpenters, glaziers, plasterers and teaching assistants. And the MAC said schools and the NHS would particularly benefit from the changes. However, people who work in fishing, elementary agricultural roles or as waiting staff would be removed from the list, making it tougher for them to live and work here. The MAC warned that while its proposals would benefit the UK economy, there could be a rise in pressures in social care because of a shortage of low-skilled workers being able to enter the country. It said the ""root of the problem"" was a failure of the sector to ""offer competitive terms and conditions"", which itself was ""caused by a failure to have a sustainable funding model"". The MAC is absolutely clear that there is no such thing as a perfect immigration system - there will be losers and winners, trade-offs that favour one part of the economy over the other in pursuit of a policy goal. Under its recommendations, sectors like agriculture and hospitality will find it harder to bring in long-term migrants - but schools and hospitals could really benefit. However, its outgoing chairman, Alan Manning, says government needs to be really clear with the public about what it wants from its repeated ""soundbite"" of an ""Australian-style points-based-system"". It could mean one of many, many things, he says - and time is running out for ministers to decide. With 11 months to go before the Brexit transition period ends, the Home Office needs to agree the policy, pass legislation and help businesses prepare for a world in which freedom of movement from the EU has ended. Labour's Diane Abbott says the salary cap won't help with social care Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott said: ""Even a lower salary cap won't help recruit the hospital staff we need, the social care workers or many of the new recruits to private businesses."" She added the UK needed ""a system based on treating people and their families decently who come here with firm job offers, whatever their pay level"". The Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for home affairs, Christine Jardine, criticised the government's plan to end free movement after Brexit, saying the MAC review ""makes clear these plans will make the crisis in social care even worse"". And the SNP called for Scotland to be able to issue its own work visas, without any salary threshold, to address the country's different economic and demographic needs. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Ben Greening, executive director of Migration Watch - a group which believes the present level of immigration is not sustainable - said the proposals amounted to ""a significant loosening"" of the rules around Tier 2 migration. He said it would mean ""exposing over seven million UK jobs to new or increased global competition from much larger developing countries where there is very substantial demand to come to the UK"". ""The report essentially says the government needn't bother with a points system for people coming to the UK with a job offer and the current system relying on employer sponsorship should work fine for these people,"" said Denis Kierans, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory. ""It wouldn't be surprising to see a new system introduced that is branded as 'Australian-style' but actually looks rather like the 'UK-style' system we already have for non-EU citizens.""

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps meets people at the launch at Fleetwood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has launched a government fund to help restore historic railway lines closed in the 1960s after the Beeching report. The Â£500m fund will not be used to build new railway lines - it is only meant to fund feasibility studies of routes that could be restored. The plan was promised in November's Conservative election manifesto. But Labour called the initiative ""meaningless"", adding that Â£500m would help reopen just 25 miles of railway. And the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the funds as a ""drop in the ocean"". Conservatives pledge Â£4.2bn for trains, buses and trams Work gets under way on new Â£8m railway station The government will start by funding proposals for two lines - the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line in Northumberland and the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. Communities will also be able to apply for some of the remainder of the Â£500m pot to help restore their lines. Roughly 5,000 miles of track were closed and more than 2,300 stations were axed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, followingthe Beeching report. The aim was to cut the mounting debts of the nationalised British Rail by removing duplicated routes and closing the least-used branch lines of the railway. This became known as the Beeching cuts. The plans drew huge opposition from rural local communities, which campaigned and successfully prevented some routes and stations from closing. On Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited the Fleetwood and Poulton-le-Fylde line which was closed in 1970. ""Many communities still live with the scars that came from the closure of their local railway more than five decades ago,"" he said.

"Savannah hopes to delay the onset of the menopause Experts have raised concern over a new medical procedure that claims to allow women to delay the onset of the menopause by over a decade. Its long-term safety and success remains untested - but some women have already paid at least Â£6,000 for the procedure. Prof Simon Fishel, the leading IVF expert behind ProFam, the Birmingham-based company that has created the procedure, says it increases their chances of having a baby in later life and can combat health issues associated with the menopause - such as heart conditions and bone weakening. The procedure involves surgically removing a small portion of one of the ovaries - which is then formed into tiny strips and frozen. The earlier in life part of the ovary is removed, the better the chance the procedure will be successful, Prof Fishel says They can then be thawed, and grafted back into the body. According to the private doctors providing the procedure, if the patient wants the section of the ovary put back inside her to help her have a child, it can be reinserted near her fallopian tube later in life. If her wish is to slow down the menopause, it can be placed in a site where there is good blood supply - usually the armpit. The earlier in life the initial procedure to remove part of the ovary is carried out, Prof Fishel says, the greater the benefits - as there will be more eggs and the ovary will be more ""hormone-packed"". But so far, only 11 women have had the procedure. Prof Fishel says the procedure can delay the onset of the menopause in some women for up to 20 years Prof Fishel accepts the procedure is ""experimental"" as a whole but says its component parts are not. A similar procedure has been used successfully by doctors to help women at risk of losing their ovarian function as a result of cancer treatment. And there is now ""enough information"" to say the procedure is safe. But Dr Melanie Davies, who chairs Fertility Preservation UK, warns against ""healthy women going through surgery that would not otherwise be needed... in the hope of preserving future fertility and hormone replacement"". ""We know that fertility can be restored in a proportion of women that have had cancer,"" she says. ""But no healthy women have gone through this yet and there is no evidence that graft will last more than 10 years. ""So it will be of limited help for hormone replacement."" Existing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is ""well researched and widely available for women who choose to take it"", Dr Davies says. And for women who want to increase their chances of having a baby later in life egg freezing is a ""far better established procedure"" than Prof Fishel's ""unproven technique"". Dr Davies, sits on the British Menopause Society's Medical Advisory Committee, which says the potential impact of removing ovarian tissue on long-term ovarian function, including fertility, requires ""further assessment and evaluation"" - and Prof Fishel's has a number of ""limitations"". Hot flushes are a common symptom in the run-up to the menopause Not all women want treatment to relieve symptoms of the menopause but options are available. The main treatment is hormone replacement therapy, which can relieve many associated symptoms, especially hot flushes and night sweats - although it is not advisable for some. Further steps can also be taken: eating a balanced diet, low in fat and high in calcium, to strengthen bones and protect the heart exercising regularly, to reduce anxiety and stress and guard against heart disease stopping smoking, to prevent heart disease and hot flushes not drinking too much, to reduce hot flushes Source: NHS and Dr Heather Currie, former chair of the British Menopause Society Despite the concerns, Prof Simon Fishel's own daughter, Savannah, 22, is keen to pursue the procedure. She is ""definitely not wanting to pop out babies anytime soon"", Savannah tells the BBC's Today and Victoria Derbyshire programmes. ""One thing I'm definitely not focused on now is having kids,"" she says. ""I love my job and there's so many other things I want to do before then. ""I don't want in the back of my mind that if I do want kids, I've got to get it done now, get a ring on my finger.""

"This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city The death toll from the new coronavirus now stands at 106, with the number of infections almost doubling in a day to more than 4,500. The rise comes as governments scramble to control the spread of the virus. Hong Kong is going to slash cross-border travel with mainland China. Meanwhile, Japan is sending a plane to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to evacuate its citizens The virus has spread across China and to at least 16 countries globally. Wuhan, as well as wider Hubei province, are already effectively in a lockdown with strict transport restrictions in and out of the area. Wearing masks in public is now mandatory in some Chinese cities. On Monday, authorities in Beijing confirmed a 50-year-old man had died - the first fatality in the Chinese capital from the virus. Hours later, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the high-speed rail line between the territory and mainland China would be suspended from Thursday. Flights, buses and ferry services will also be cut down drastically in an effort to halt the virus's spread to the city - a global financial centre. Cries of 'stay strong' heard from Wuhan windows Coronavirus: How worried should we be? China coronavirus: A visual guide The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. Most of the deaths have been in Hubei province. The initial victims were mostly elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems, but few details have been released about the dozens of deaths confirmed in recent days. A total of 60 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery, according to Chinese state media. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection Efforts to stem the spread of the virus have coincided with the Lunar New Year celebration, which usually sees millions travel across the country to visit relatives and friends. Travel is being severely restricted and monitored To try to stop the spread of infections, many of the new year festivities have been suspended and the holiday period has been extended by three days to Sunday. Chinese authorities have also imposed several other measures in recent days: Beijing and Shanghai introduced a 14-day observation period for people arriving from Hubei Authorities postponed the new semester for schools and universities nationwide, without giving a resumption date China Railway Group suspended hundreds of train lines throughout the country The immigration administration encouraged citizens to reconsider the timing of overseas travel to reduce cross-border movement This video can not be played Road blocks and ghost towns: Inside the province where the virus originated In Wuhan, travel from the city of 11 million people has been severely restricted and non-essential vehicles have been banned from the roads. The city's mayor though said about five million people had already left the city ahead of the holidays and before the lockdown. Several major cities have suspended public transport systems, taxis and ride-hailing services. The Disneyland attraction parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have both been closed. The new coronavirus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan and can now spread between people. Chinese authorities over the weekend said the virus was - like a normal flu - able to spread during its incubation period and before any symptoms appeared. This would set it apart from cases like Sars and Ebola and make it much harder to contain. Coronavirus: Companies tell workers 'stay at home' Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? Coronavirus: Facebook tells staff to avoid China The incubation period can range from two to 10 days, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). However unlike China, it said it remained unclear whether the virus was contagious before symptoms appear. The number of total cases confirmed by China rose to 4,515 as of 27 January, up from 2,835 a day earlier. The United States, which has also had several infected cases, has urged its nationals to ""reconsider travel"" to China and is advising against travel to Hubei. The country plans to fly consular staff and US citizens out of Wuhan in the coming days. Japan is expecting to evacuate about 200 nationals on a chartered plane on Wednesday morning, with health workers on board to monitor passengers. The evacuees will be asked to look out for any symptoms of the new coronavirus for two weeks after their return. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? Many other countries have also warned against any non-essential travel to China. Like the US and Japan, France has said it plans to airlift citizens out of Wuhan. The UK is yet to make a similar decision but has urged Britons to leave the area if they can - however this has upset some living in Hubei who complain they are trapped. The Philippines on Tuesday announced they would stop issuing visas on arrival for Chinese travellers. This video can not be played Ben Kavanagh, a teacher originally from County Kildare, describes the scene in Wuhan According to the World Health Organization and national authorities, there have been at least47 confirmed cases,externaloutside China. The latest case to be confirmed is in the German state of Bavaria, only the fourth so far in Europe. Eight cases:Thailand Five:USA, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan Four:Malaysia, South Korea, Japan Three:France Two:Vietnam One:Nepal, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Germany So far, there have been no deaths outside China. The virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms seem to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. After a week, some people can experience shortness of breath and need hospital treatment. The virus itself is a new, or ""novel"" coronavirus - a family that normally affects animals. The effect of the coronavirus family on humans has long been observed mainly in the form of the common cold. In recent decades though, more serious coronaviruses - like Sars or Mers - have proven potentially deadly to humans. Surgical masks sell out in US amid coronavirus fears Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Yet even in the cases of severe viruses most people infected were likely to fully recover just like they would from a normal flu. On Tuesday, an expert at China's National Health Commission (NHC) said one week was sufficient for a recovery from mild coronavirus symptoms. According to local media, the NHC also said the virus could infect children, but that their symptoms would be relatively mild.

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps meets people at the launch at Fleetwood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has launched a government fund to help restore historic railway lines closed in the 1960s after the Beeching report. The Â£500m fund will not be used to build new railway lines - it is only meant to fund feasibility studies of routes that could be restored. The plan was promised in November's Conservative election manifesto. But Labour called the initiative ""meaningless"", adding that Â£500m would help reopen just 25 miles of railway. And the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the funds as a ""drop in the ocean"". Conservatives pledge Â£4.2bn for trains, buses and trams Work gets under way on new Â£8m railway station The government will start by funding proposals for two lines - the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line in Northumberland and the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. Communities will also be able to apply for some of the remainder of the Â£500m pot to help restore their lines. Roughly 5,000 miles of track were closed and more than 2,300 stations were axed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, followingthe Beeching report. The aim was to cut the mounting debts of the nationalised British Rail by removing duplicated routes and closing the least-used branch lines of the railway. This became known as the Beeching cuts. The plans drew huge opposition from rural local communities, which campaigned and successfully prevented some routes and stations from closing. On Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited the Fleetwood and Poulton-le-Fylde line which was closed in 1970. ""Many communities still live with the scars that came from the closure of their local railway more than five decades ago,"" he said. ""Investing in transport links is essential to levelling up access to opportunities across the country, ensuring our regions are better connected, local economies flourish and more than half a century of isolation is undone."" People in Fleetwood, a town of 25,000 that is hemmed in on the Lancashire coast, told us unanimously that reopening their defunct rail line to nearby Poulton-le-Fylde would be a good thing. They say their town has lost so much over the years and they hope that restoring the railway would help regenerate the area and cut congestion on the roads. The government is currently falling over itself to back policies that improve regional connectivity around the country. Just think of its bailout for the regional airline Flybe. But today's announcement is only a tentative step towards recreating a functioning railway to Fleetwood. An assessment of the economic and social case will now be carried out. The funding for Fleetwood - Â£100,000 - is peanuts for now. If the assessment is positive, more money will follow. However, even Â£500m (the total funding pledged for helping to reopen lines cut during the Beeching era) is not a big sum of money in railway infrastructure terms. Michael Byng, a railway construction consultant, believes reopening the Colne to Skipton line near Leeds would cost around Â£368m on its own. He also believes that reopening the rail line to Fleetwood, which does have a tram that runs along the coast to Blackpool, would not be money well spent and other options like improving the connectivity of the tram itself should be considered. Commenting on the proposals, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. ""Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds."" This video can not be played Volunteer train driver Chris Cubitt and North Yorkshire Moors Railway general manager Philip Benham on 50 years since Beeching Axe rail report Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, was similarly sceptical about the government's plans. ""RMT welcomes any investment in our railways but Â£500m is a drop in the ocean compared to what's really required to connect our abandoned communities and reverse decades of cuts to infrastructure and maintenance,"" he said. Dennis Fancett, chairman of South East Northumberland Rail User Group, told the BBC: ""What I was really hoping for was an announcement that we're all systems go and funding for the entire reopening is provided and building can start. ""The business case for reopening this line is the economic regeneration of South East Northumberland."" Brian Crawford, chairman of the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society, said restoration of the disused railway line to Fleetwood from Poulton-le-Fylde could reinvigorate the coastal town. ""There are two aims - one of commuters going to work and the other one is to make Fleetwood a major tourist destination. It has a fantastic seafront but without a railway, we don't seem to get that many visitors,"" he told the BBC. Do you have a question about the government's rail plans?

"Facial recognition involves creating a digital map of people's features and then checking for a match Police involvement in a private landlord's facial recognition trial has led a regulator to call for government intervention. BBC Radio 4'sFile on 4has learned that South Yorkshire Police shared three photos of serious offenders and one of a vulnerable missing person with Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre. It follows similar controversial tie-ups in Manchester and London. Meadowhall owner British Land said the 2018 test only lasted four weeks. It added that it had ""no plans"" to use facial recognition at its sites, and that all personal data gathered during the trial was ""immediately deleted"". South Yorkshire Police disclosed last August that it had ""supported"" the scheme to understand ""opportunities associated with this technology,"" but did not provide further detail at the time. It has declined to comment further. Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch uncovered the added information aboutthe Meadowhall scheme. Tony Porter, the Surveillance Camera Commissioner (SCC) for England and Wales, has now called for government inspections into police use of facial recognition technology. ""I think if the public are going to be reassured, there does need to be a very clear oversight mechanism,"" Mr Porter told File on 4. ""And I would say that at the moment isn't obvious. I think the next step is for the government to address that gap in each and every circumstance that is required."" The Home Office's Surveillance Camera Code of Practice,external, which governs schemes involving both police and the private sector, states that ""any use of facial recognition or other biometric characteristic recognition systems needs to be clearly justified and proportionate"". Met Police to deploy facial recognition cameras Facial recognition: EU considers ban of up to five years Facial recognition technology code of conduct call Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been critical of police use of facial regulation, agreed that inspections are an ""absolute necessity"". ""You should no more give an absolute open sesame on personal surveillance, which is what facial recognition is, than you would give any police force the right to search you or your house without a warrant,"" he said. The Meadowhall live facial recognition trial ran for four weeks between January and March 2018. British Land told File on 4 it did not put up signs warning visitors that facial recognition was in use. Big Brother Watch's director Silkie Carlo told File on 4 such partnerships are hard to monitor: ""That means that this is even less accountable to the public and difficult to find details of. ""We're now at a stage where we think millions of people in this country could have been scanned by facial recognition, many of whom don't even know about it."" The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had considered the Meadowhall trial, but closed the case without taking further action. Mr Porter, who oversees surveillance camera use by public bodies on behalf of the Home Office, still has unanswered questions and has requested a meeting with South Yorkshire Police. A trial at the Trafford Centre shopping mall in Manchester in 2018 was halted after Mr Porter's intervention. A scheme at the Kings Cross development in London, run between May 2016 and March 2018, is still being investigated by the ICO. Big Brother Watch, Amnesty International, and the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee have all said automatic facial recognition technology should be halted until ""proper regulation"" that ""explicitly regulates"" the technology is in place. Meanwhile, South Wales Police is continuing its use of the technology with a new trial of body worn facial recognition cameras that will begin in early spring. The Home Office said it fully supports police trials of facial recognition, and is working alongside the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, who are exploring the issues around such schemes. The ICO said the organisation has doubled in size over last three years, and their enforcement tools range from heavy fines to lighter sanctions, depending on the relative harm to individuals. It's calling for a statutory code of conduct for police forces' use of live facial recognition, ""The regulation of live facial recognition (LFR) is a priority issue for the commissioner,"" it added. ""We have completed an investigation into police use of LFR, and there is ongoing work exploring how it is used by private organisations, including in airports.""

"Sainsbury's has promised to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero over the next 20 years. The supermarket chain, which is the second largest in the UK, has said it will spend Â£1bn to reach the target. It pledged to reduce emissions from areas like refrigeration and transport. Critics said the pledge did not extend to the supermarket's supply network, which accounts for most of its emissions. However, Sainsbury's said it would be contacting its suppliers. Chief executive Mike Coupe said the retailer would be writing to its suppliers to ensure ""they are playing their part"". He added: ""We need to understand further up our supply chains how we impact the environment and make sure our suppliers are working towards eliminating their carbon emissions as well."" Asked whether it would help carbon emissions if Sainsbury's sold more UK produce instead of food from overseas, he said: ""We have to find a balance regarding 'food miles'. ""We have to bring our customers on the journey with us. It is more environmentally-friendly to grow products in environments that are suitable for those products. ""But equally there is a trade-off between doing that, our customers having availability of those products, and the way that we bring them to the market."" Tesco to ditch plastic-wrap for multipack tins Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? Currently, Sainsbury's produces one million tonnes of carbon each year, although, the supermarket said that figure had fallen by a third in the past 15 years. Over the next two decades, Sainsbury's will spend an average of Â£50m a year on measures such as converting some of its vehicles to use alternative fuel and redesigning stores to be more energy efficient in order to achieve the goal. The plan is one of Mr Coupe's final actions as the boss of Sainsbury's. Last week, heannounced he would step downin May. ""We are committing to reduce our own carbon emissions and become net zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the government's own targets, because 2050 isn't soon enough,"" he said in a statement. He said the chain had spent Â£260m on measures such as energy-efficient lighting and refrigeration over the last decade. The 2040 deadline targets emissions that Sainsbury's directly controls, such as heating and lighting. ""Direct operations is just the tip of iceberg,"" Dexter Galvin from charity, the Carbon Disclosure Project, told the BBC. ""[Sainsbury's is] too late to the party. Tesco and Co-op have approved targets already including supply chain,"" he said. While governments struggle to meet their ambitions on climate change, many businesses are putting words into action. In fact, there's something of a climate ""arms race"" between consumer-facing firms like supermarkets. Sainsbury's promise of net zero emissions by 2040 is a full decade earlier than Tesco's target. But the plan's not quite as impressive as it seems because so far Sainsbury's target applies only to its own emissions - NOT the much higher emissions of its suppliers. The full accounting will come later, the firm says. There's a target on water too - Sainsbury's says it's reducing water usage by capturing rain on roofs, and recycling water from car washes and ice on fish counters. But most radical is its initiative tohalve plastic packagingby 2025. This is said to be very ambitious. Experts warn, though, that in their rush to ban plastic,firms shouldn't use substitutesthat are even worse for the planet. Mike Childs, head of policy for Friends of the Earth, said: ""The influence supermarket chains have over suppliers is also huge - they must use that to encourage better environmental standards while still ensuring a fair deal for farmers."" However, he added: ""It's encouraging to see Sainsbury's stepping up to the plate on the climate emergency - the rapid transition to a net zero economy is urgently required. ""Supermarkets have a huge influence on our personal carbon footprints, so the more they can do to embrace and encourage greener lifestyles the better for us all."" Rival Tesco has said it plans to achieve net zero by 2050, 10 years later than Sainsbury's. However, it has also set targets for its suppliers demanding they reduce carbon emissions by 7% this year.

"Keeping spirits up in virus-hit Wuhan As the number of coronavirus infections continues to grow, millions of people have gone into lockdown in Wuhan - the centre of the outbreak - to try to stop the virus spreading. But in this time of isolation some people are determined to raise each others' spirits. The deadly outbreak comes as China celebrates one of the most important dates in its calendar  - Lunar New Year. Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving all rolled into one - typically a time filled with lots of cheer. For many, it's the only chance in a year they have to meet up with their family and exchange gifts of food and money. In Wuhan people have been encouraged to stay home to minimise the spread of the virus. But residents in a block of flats found a small way to cheer each other up. Videos circulating on social media show people shouting ""Wuhan jiayou"" out of their windows- roughly translated to ""Stay strong Wuhan"" or ""Keep on going Wuhan"". This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city The phrase is echoed across the block and residents can be heard cheering in the background. Add oil! The Chinese expression keeping people going Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? China coronavirus: A visual guide Coronavirus: How worried should we be? It's also a cheer that's being repeated online. On social media site Weibo, the phrase ""Wuhan jiayou"" has been trending. Many across different parts of the country are posting the phrase in solidarity with Wuhan - where the majority of deaths as a result of the virus have occurred. ""We will get through this. Wuhan jiayou, the whole country is supporting you,"" said one comment on Weibo. More than one hundred people - mostly in Wuhan - have now died as a result of the outbreak which has spread across China and internationally. Though there is plenty of fear and anger at the authorities on social media in China, state media has been highlighting kind acts and stories of residents banding together in Wuhan. One new restaurant owner in Wuhan spent the Lunar New Year festival packing food for medical workers in the city, according to state news outlet Changjiang Daily. Li Bo had opened a restaurant in the city just a month ago. He sold his car and borrowed money in order to raise the funds for it. But before the 36-year-old could properly get his business started, the outbreak kicked in - leaving the streets of the city empty and his restaurant deserted. ""I panicked. I lay at home worrying about how I was going to repay the loan,"" he told Changjiang Daily. ""But then I saw [news] about how the medical staff in hospitals were struggling and I felt like it was time for me act. I wanted to do my part, no matter how insignificant."" According to a report by news site Beijing News, some hospitals in Wuhan have experienced food shortages. Two residents living in Wuhan had previously told the BBC that people in the city have been trying to stockpile food. Li Bo is packing 200 lunch boxes for medical workers at a local hospital Li Bo along with his chef spent days buying ingredients and cooking enough food to fit into 200 boxes. He told the news outlet on 26 January that he was in the process of finding enough boxes to pack the food into, adding that the meals would eventually be delivered to medical staff in Wuhan's Xiehe Hospital. ""I wanted to do my best to [make sure] the medical staff eat hot meals. I hope they get the nutrition they need and that will boost their immunity,"" he told the paper, adding that he plans to continue the food deliveries for as long as he can. ""I hope the city we love gets better soon."" Fears of the coronavirus have seen thousands across the country flocking to buy face masks - triggering a mask shortage in some places. Masks have become such a valuable commodity that many on Weibo have joked that they would rather receive face masks instead of the typical monetary gifts given out during Lunar New Year. One villager in Changde, a neighbouring province of Hubei where Wuhan is located, decided he would donate almost 15,000 face masks, according to news outlet the Xiaoxiang Morning Herald. Hao Jin had last year worked in a mask production factory. He eventually resigned from the job but the company could not afford to pay him his salary. He was instead given 15,000 masks - worth 20,000 yuan (Â£2,207; $2,883) as a form of compensation. He brought the masks home and forgot about them until he heard news of the mask shortage. ""I thought I would donate the masks I have to those in need, I hope they can be of more use and value to others,"" he said. He kept a handful of the masks for his family, and distributed some to those in his village before donating the rest to people in his county.

"China is struggling with a new virus that has already killed more than 20 people. It is a serious health issue. The World Health Organization has called it an emergency for China, though not for the world, not so far at least. Inevitably, it will have economic consequences. But how severe and how far will they spread? Economists are very wary about putting any figures on it at this early stage. But it is possible to identify what form the impact will take and to look at the economic damage done by previous similar episodes, notably the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome - better known as Sars - in 2002-3, which also began in China. It is within China that there already is some economic damage. Travel restrictions have been imposed in parts of the country at a time [the Chinese New Year] when many people travel. So the tourism business is already being hit. Consumer spending on entertainment and gifts will also be affected. For entertainment, many will be reluctant to take part in activities outside the home that could lead to exposure to the virus. Many people are sure to have cancelled plans of their own volition to avoid risks of exposure to the disease. The impact is magnified by the fact that Wuhan, the city where it began, is an important transport hub. Travel restrictions are also a problem for any business that needs to move goods or people around. Industrial supply chains will be affected. Some deliveries may be disrupted and some will become more expensive. There will be lost economic activity as a result of people not being able or willing to travel to work. There will also be a direct financial cost from treating patients borne by health insurers (public and private) and by patients. Outside China, much will depend on the spread of the disease. If there are outbreaks elsewhere some of the same effects may be apparent, although almost certainly on a much smaller scale. The extent of these effects will depend to a large degree on how easily transmissible the virus proves to be and the death rate among those infected. Encouragingly many people so far have made full recoveries, though there have been tragic exceptions. It is often the case that economic problems are quickly reflected by financial markets, where traders' views about what assets are worth are affected by their expectations about future developments. On this occasion that have been some negative consequences for stock markets, particular in China. But they have not been large. Even the Shanghai Composite Index is higher than it was six months ago. There are some businesses who could gain, such as drugs makers.  What is immediately available is symptom relief. In the longer term there might be profitable opportunity in developing a vaccine against the virus. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson told the BBC that his teams had already done the ""basic work"" on a vaccine. He thought it could be available in about a year. There has also been a surge in demandfor surgical masks and gloves to protect against becoming infected.  Shares in Chinese companies that make these items - drugs and protective equipment - have seen some sharp price rises. The best historical example to give guidance is probably the Sars outbreak. One estimate,externalsuggested a cost to the global economy of $40bn (Â£30.5bn). Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics, a London based consultancy, suggests that global growth was a full percentage point weaker in the second quarter of 2003 than it would have been without Sars. That is quite a substantial hit, but she also says it made up the ground quite quickly afterwards. She says the picture is complicated by other factors that affected global growth at the time but she concludes ""it is very hard to pick out any lasting damage to global GDP (economic activity) from Sars, which was an unusually severe and widespread virus"".

"Companies in China have advised staff to work from home in an attempt to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Businesses are also offering workers longer holidays, as well as telling employees returning from the most affected areas to stay away from work. It comes after the Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Sunday. At least 80 people have now died in China from the disease, with almost 3,000 confirmed cases around the world. Bytedance, which owns the video-sharing platform TikTok, and Chinese gaming giant Tencent have told staff to work from home. Hotpot restaurant chain Haidilao has shut its branches across China until Friday. On Sunday, the government of the city of Suzhou said businesses there would remain closed until at least 8 February. Suzhou is a manufacturing hub in eastern China, home to a major pharmaceuticals and technology business park. Coronavirus: Could it damage the global economy? Coronavirus: How worried should we be? China's travel industry counts cost of coronavirus Several companies, including Swiss banking group UBS and property developer Country Garden, have told staff returning from the city of Wuhan or Hubei province to quarantine themselves at home. In Hong Kong, the stock exchange has cancelled a ceremony scheduled for Wednesday to mark the first day of trading day of the Lunar New Year, due to concerns over the risk of infection. Global markets have also been hit by growing concerns from investors that measures to halt the spread of the flu-like virus will have a negative impact on the global economy. In Tokyo, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 share index fell by 2% after the Chinese government announced this weekend that it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which had been due to reopen on 31 January, are now scheduled to stay closed until 2 February. On the commodities markets, prices of everything from oil to copper have fallen as traders bet that global demand will fall while Chinese cities remain in lockdown. Brent crude oil was down by 2.2% on deepening concerns about demand for energy, despite attempts by Saudi Arabia's energy minister to ease market jitters. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud said he was closely monitoring developments in China and was confident the virus would be contained. London copper prices fell by 1.9% to the lowest level in almost eight weeks. That followed last week's 5.5% slide, the steepest weekly decline in five years.

"Savannah hopes to delay the onset of the menopause Experts have raised concern over a new medical procedure that claims to allow women to delay the onset of the menopause by over a decade. Its long-term safety and success remains untested - but some women have already paid at least Â£6,000 for the procedure. Prof Simon Fishel, the leading IVF expert behind ProFam, the Birmingham-based company that has created the procedure, says it increases their chances of having a baby in later life and can combat health issues associated with the menopause - such as heart conditions and bone weakening. The procedure involves surgically removing a small portion of one of the ovaries - which is then formed into tiny strips and frozen. The earlier in life part of the ovary is removed, the better the chance the procedure will be successful, Prof Fishel says They can then be thawed, and grafted back into the body. According to the private doctors providing the procedure, if the patient wants the section of the ovary put back inside her to help her have a child, it can be reinserted near her fallopian tube later in life. If her wish is to slow down the menopause, it can be placed in a site where there is good blood supply - usually the armpit. The earlier in life the initial procedure to remove part of the ovary is carried out, Prof Fishel says, the greater the benefits - as there will be more eggs and the ovary will be more ""hormone-packed"". But so far, only 11 women have had the procedure. Prof Fishel says the procedure can delay the onset of the menopause in some women for up to 20 years Prof Fishel accepts the procedure is ""experimental"" as a whole but says its component parts are not. A similar procedure has been used successfully by doctors to help women at risk of losing their ovarian function as a result of cancer treatment. And there is now ""enough information"" to say the procedure is safe. But Dr Melanie Davies, who chairs Fertility Preservation UK, warns against ""healthy women going through surgery that would not otherwise be needed... in the hope of preserving future fertility and hormone replacement"". ""We know that fertility can be restored in a proportion of women that have had cancer,"" she says. ""But no healthy women have gone through this yet and there is no evidence that graft will last more than 10 years. ""So it will be of limited help for hormone replacement."" Existing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is ""well researched and widely available for women who choose to take it"", Dr Davies says. And for women who want to increase their chances of having a baby later in life egg freezing is a ""far better established procedure"" than Prof Fishel's ""unproven technique"". Dr Davies, sits on the British Menopause Society's Medical Advisory Committee, which says the potential impact of removing ovarian tissue on long-term ovarian function, including fertility, requires ""further assessment and evaluation"" - and Prof Fishel's has a number of ""limitations"". Hot flushes are a common symptom in the run-up to the menopause Not all women want treatment to relieve symptoms of the menopause but options are available. The main treatment is hormone replacement therapy, which can relieve many associated symptoms, especially hot flushes and night sweats - although it is not advisable for some. Further steps can also be taken: eating a balanced diet, low in fat and high in calcium, to strengthen bones and protect the heart exercising regularly, to reduce anxiety and stress and guard against heart disease stopping smoking, to prevent heart disease and hot flushes not drinking too much, to reduce hot flushes Source: NHS and Dr Heather Currie, former chair of the British Menopause Society Despite the concerns, Prof Simon Fishel's own daughter, Savannah, 22, is keen to pursue the procedure. She is ""definitely not wanting to pop out babies anytime soon"", Savannah tells the BBC's Today and Victoria Derbyshire programmes. ""One thing I'm definitely not focused on now is having kids,"" she says. ""I love my job and there's so many other things I want to do before then. ""I don't want in the back of my mind that if I do want kids, I've got to get it done now, get a ring on my finger.""

"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps meets people at the launch at Fleetwood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has launched a government fund to help restore historic railway lines closed in the 1960s after the Beeching report. The Â£500m fund will not be used to build new railway lines - it is only meant to fund feasibility studies of routes that could be restored. The plan was promised in November's Conservative election manifesto. But Labour called the initiative ""meaningless"", adding that Â£500m would help reopen just 25 miles of railway. And the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the funds as a ""drop in the ocean"". Conservatives pledge Â£4.2bn for trains, buses and trams Work gets under way on new Â£8m railway station The government will start by funding proposals for two lines - the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line in Northumberland and the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. Communities will also be able to apply for some of the remainder of the Â£500m pot to help restore their lines. Roughly 5,000 miles of track were closed and more than 2,300 stations were axed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, followingthe Beeching report. The aim was to cut the mounting debts of the nationalised British Rail by removing duplicated routes and closing the least-used branch lines of the railway. This became known as the Beeching cuts. The plans drew huge opposition from rural local communities, which campaigned and successfully prevented some routes and stations from closing. On Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited the Fleetwood and Poulton-le-Fylde line which was closed in 1970. ""Many communities still live with the scars that came from the closure of their local railway more than five decades ago,"" he said. ""Investing in transport links is essential to levelling up access to opportunities across the country, ensuring our regions are better connected, local economies flourish and more than half a century of isolation is undone."" People in Fleetwood, a town of 25,000 that is hemmed in on the Lancashire coast, told us unanimously that reopening their defunct rail line to nearby Poulton-le-Fylde would be a good thing. They say their town has lost so much over the years and they hope that restoring the railway would help regenerate the area and cut congestion on the roads. The government is currently falling over itself to back policies that improve regional connectivity around the country. Just think of its bailout for the regional airline Flybe. But today's announcement is only a tentative step towards recreating a functioning railway to Fleetwood. An assessment of the economic and social case will now be carried out. The funding for Fleetwood - Â£100,000 - is peanuts for now. If the assessment is positive, more money will follow. However, even Â£500m (the total funding pledged for helping to reopen lines cut during the Beeching era) is not a big sum of money in railway infrastructure terms. Michael Byng, a railway construction consultant, believes reopening the Colne to Skipton line near Leeds would cost around Â£368m on its own. He also believes that reopening the rail line to Fleetwood, which does have a tram that runs along the coast to Blackpool, would not be money well spent and other options like improving the connectivity of the tram itself should be considered. Commenting on the proposals, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. ""Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds."" This video can not be played Volunteer train driver Chris Cubitt and North Yorkshire Moors Railway general manager Philip Benham on 50 years since Beeching Axe rail report Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, was similarly sceptical about the government's plans. ""RMT welcomes any investment in our railways but Â£500m is a drop in the ocean compared to what's really required to connect our abandoned communities and reverse decades of cuts to infrastructure and maintenance,"" he said. Dennis Fancett, chairman of South East Northumberland Rail User Group, told the BBC: ""What I was really hoping for was an announcement that we're all systems go and funding for the entire reopening is provided and building can start. ""The business case for reopening this line is the economic regeneration of South East Northumberland."" Brian Crawford, chairman of the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society, said restoration of the disused railway line to Fleetwood from Poulton-le-Fylde could reinvigorate the coastal town. ""There are two aims - one of commuters going to work and the other one is to make Fleetwood a major tourist destination. It has a fantastic seafront but without a railway, we don't seem to get that many visitors,"" he told the BBC. Do you have a question about the government's rail plans?

"Whether to allow Huawei to help build the UK's 5G networks is one of the most consequential and difficult national security decisions a British government has ever faced. The decision -due to be made at a meeting of the National Security Council later- involves balancing complex technical risks with geopolitics and costs to the economy. But it is also an issue where room for manoeuvre is tight - partly thanks to a series of decisions going back over the years which have closed down options. If you want to understand how we got where we are, it is worth going back more than a decade and a half to when BT was upgrading the UK's telecoms infrastructure. It wanted to use Huawei equipment because it was cheaper. What is Huawei and what is its role in UK 5G? Using Huawei in UK 5G network 'madness', says US The story of a controversial company BT - using a trick that operators are still using today - warned that excluding Huawei would cost vast amounts of money requiring compensation from the government. Few at the time appreciated the significance of the decision. It was only after it had been taken that officials began to question whether it had opened up the UK to surveillance or even sabotage from China - something Huawei itself has always said is impossible. And so a strategy was created to minimise the danger. Steps included making sure there were multiple suppliers in the network and ensuring risky vendors (in others words Huawei) were kept out of the most sensitive parts of the network (for instance the core which controls how it functions). The history means the UK intelligence community believes it has a much better understanding than anyone else about how to manage the risk from Huawei. As the use of Huawei spread to other telecoms operators, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) was created to carefully evaluate the physical equipment and the code that Huawei was introducing into the UK. Huawei's main UK office is in Reading, west of London I visitedwhat became known as ""the cell""in Banbury 2013. The security was intense - in one inner room a computer with access to the Huawei source code sat watched by CCTV cameras to prevent any unauthorised access. No deliberate backdoor or evidence of espionage has ever been found. But there have been issues. A 2018 oversight report was highly critical of the company's engineering standards, and the 2019 report saidno material progress had been made to address those concerns,which left it with only ""limited assurance"" that security could be protected. This experience though has created a degree of confidence from intelligence and security officials that they can mitigate the risks of using Huawei in a 5G network, by putting in place a suite of restrictions. But they also caution that the ultimate decision has to be political since it involves balancing the technical advice with the diplomatic and economic costs. Panorama: can we trust Huawei? The 5G network is being built partly on top of 4G, so excluding Huawei from 5G in the UK (unlike the US where it plays almost no role) also means ripping it out of 4G. That will be costly and slow down the roll-out of increased connectivity, which this government has made a priority. That decision has also been made harder by delay - it was due to be taken nearly a year ago but leaks and elections have got in the way. This video can not be played Johnson: UK will ""come up"" with a solution on Huawei In the meantime, 5G is already being rolled out. The telecoms operators have been pressing their case to use Huawei and using its equipment. This means the costs of excluding the company have been going up by the day. Saying ""no"" will slow down the much-heralded promise of greater connectivity. But delay has also given the US and critics more time to marshal their arguments against using the Chinese company, including presenting a recent dossier - althoughUK officials say it lacked any ""smoking gun"". The US has saidit will review intelligence sharingif the UK does use Huawei. UK officials believe - or perhaps hope - that Washington is bluffing. That is a big call. One of the challenges is disentangling this subject from the broader trade confrontation between China and the US, and the unpredictable nature of President Trump. At times, there have been signs that Huawei has become a bargaining chip in that broader battle. UK officials may have feared that they could exclude Huawei and anger China, only to find the US President cutting a deal with Beijing and leaving them isolated. Some British officials caution that this overlooks the fact that concerns about the company go much deeper in Washington, where national security officials are increasingly focused on the technological challenge from China. The US has taken a hard line because it knows the UK decision has global significance. Many other countries are going through similar debates right now. Like the UK, they would like to use Huawei because it is cheap but fear the security risks and the wrath of the US. If the UK approves the use of Huawei many of them may use that as cover to follow suit. Few others though have the technical experience of monitoring Huawei that the UK has built up. The global perspective goes to one of the wider long-term risks. Some people ask how we have got to a position where we are needing to even consider using Chinese technology. The answer is because Western countries failed to think strategically about protecting or nurturing their own full spectrum telecoms industry over the last two decades. Companies went bust or were taken over. Meanwhile Beijing pursued a focused long-term strategy to become a leader in the technology. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has voiced concerns about depending on Huawei Approval for Huawei in the UK with others following in its wake, would be likely to accelerate the company's rise and the risks of dependency. The risks of it becoming a dominant player were expressed by former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ""The issue is what happens if we get to the situation where no Western companies are really able to compete with Huawei going forward,"" he told the BBC. ""Like it or not, in a decade's time people will look back and say, 'was this really wise to take this decision in 2020 that has led to this dependency?'"" The US is talking about building greater Western capability in this field, but it is not yet clear what this actually looks like or how long it would take to deliver. And there is a lot of talk in Washington about having lost 5G but making sure not to lose 6G. Huawei itself has always maintained that it is not an arm of the Chinese state and will not spy on its behalf. But the more dominant it becomes in the coming years, the harder it might be to extract the company from a network if it was found to have done something wrong. So Tuesday's decision comes down to balancing significant but hard to quantify long-term risks with real short-term economic costs. Past decisions have narrowed the UK's options. And this one may do so again. Do you have a question about Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network?
