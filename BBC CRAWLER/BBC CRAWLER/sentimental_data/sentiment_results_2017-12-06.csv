"Clockwise from top: Actor Ashley Judd, pop singer Taylor Swift, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, corporate lobbyist Adama Iwu and Isabel Pascual, a strawberry-picker from Mexico (not her real name) Time magazine has named ""the Silence Breakers"" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its ""Person of the Year"". The movement is most closely associated with the #MeToo hashtag which sprung up as allegations emerged against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. But Time says the hashtag is ""part of the picture, but not all of it"". ""This is the fastest-moving social change we've seen in decades,"" editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said. He told NBC's Today programme that it ""began with individual acts of courage by hundreds of women - and some men, too - who came forward to tell their own stories"". The magazine illustrates the ubiquitous nature of sexual harassment by showcasing women from markedly different backgrounds on its cover.,external Two celebrities are featured - Ashley Judd, one of the first to speak out against Mr Weinstein, and pop singer Taylor Swift, who won a civil case against an ex-DJ who she said had grabbed her bottom. They are shown alongside Isabel Pascual, a 42-year-old strawberry picker from Mexico (not her real name); Adama Iwu, a 40-year-old corporate lobbyist in Sacramento; and Susan Fowler, 26, a former Uber engineer whose allegation brought down Uber's CEO.

Ironically, President Trump - whose election Ms Kelly said was a ""setback for women"" that helps explain the #MeToo movement - was named as runner-up for Person of the Year this year, having been given the title last year.

"Laurence Soper was found guilty of 19 counts of sexual assault against boys at St Benedict's School in Ealing, where he taught An ex-Roman Catholic priest has been found guilty of abusing boys at a London school during the 1970s and 80s. Laurence Soper, 74, was extradited to face 19 charges of indecent and serious sexual assault against 10 former pupils at the independent St Benedict's School in Ealing, where he taught. Soper fled to Kosovo with Â£182,000 from the Vatican bank in a bid to avoid prosecution for molesting boys. An Old Bailey jury took 14 hours to find him guilty of all charges. Prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC told how the victims were subjected to sadistic beatings by Soper for ""fake reasons"" and on many occasions ""with what can only have been a sexual motive"". They included kicking a football ""in the wrong direction"", ""failing to use double margins"", and ""using the (wrong) staircase"", leading to a caning and a sexual assault, she said. Laurence Soper was a senior priest at St Benedict's School in Ealing, west London Ms Etherton said at least one of Soper's alleged victims suffered serious mental health problems, while another was too afraid to speak out because the abusers ""were like saints to me"". The court heard Soper quit as an abbot in 2000 and moved to Rome. He then skipped bail and spent six years living in Kosovo, with a European Arrest Warrant issued for his extradition. Soper denied using the cane as a ruse to abuse boys who were given the choice of six lashes with trousers on, or three with them off. He told jurors he went on the run out of ""stupidity and cowardice"", fearing that his life's work would be wrecked. Soper is the latest in a string of men to face allegations relating to their work at St Benedict's. In 2009, Father David Pearce, 75, nicknamed the ""devil in a dog collar"",was jailed after he admitted 11 charges of indecent assault dating back to 1972,external Between 2003 and 2009, ""master of discipline"" John Maestri, 78, of Chatham in Kent, admittedfive indecent assaults against childrenat St Benedict's in the 1980s and was jailed In 2010, John Skelton was convicted of indecent assaults against two complainants said to have occurred in 1983 Father Anthony Gee faced accusations of abuse, but no further action was taken although civil action was brought against him In 2010, Abbot Shipperlee announced an independent review of safeguarding arrangements, policies and procedures. The following year, Lord Carlileproduced a damning report calling for tougher rulesto protect all faith pupils and stripped monks of control at the school. In a statement issued by Lord Carlile QC, the school apologised for the ""serious wrongs of the past"". He said: ""The school regrets that Soper did not have the courage to plead guilty. The result has been that innocent victims, whom he abused when they were boys in the school, were compelled to give evidence. ""The tough lessons of the past have been learned, and the errors and crimes of the past are in the daily consciousness and conscience of the school management."" Soper was remanded in custody to be sentenced on 19 December.

"At the start of the year Bitcoin was valued below $1,000 Bitcoin has breached the $16,000 mark, extending the digital currency's record-breaking surge. The cryptocurrency began the year below $1,000 but continues to rise despite warnings of a dangerous bubble. According to Coindesk.com, Bitcoin reached $16,663.18 (Â£12, 358.35), having soared over 50% in a week. The new high comes days before the launch of Bitcoin futures on two exchanges, including the world's largest futures exchange, CME. Spread betting firm CMC Markets said the rise had all the symptoms of a bubble market, warning ""there is no way to know when the bubble will burst"". What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? US regulator approves Bitcoin trading Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency. Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online. Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks. A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens. However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment. The digital currency's rapid ascent from around $1,000 at the start of the year has put it in the spotlight. Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream. Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as ""initial coin offerings"". But last weeka US regulator agreed to let two traditional exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts. The announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow investors  to buy and sell ""future"" contracts in bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price - was seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin. Cambridge Global Payments director of global product and market strategy Karl Schamotta said that move was behind the latest rally: ""The perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to Bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here."" But Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said the rise in Bitcoin's value was ""mostly motivated by fear of missing out and greed"". Bitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million.

"Labour's chief whip in the House of Lords is to stand down in the New Year following criticism of his expenses. Lord Bassam has referred himself to the standards watchdog and agreed to repay the cost of travel to and from his Brighton home since 2010. The peer, who also had a Â£36,366 allowance for staying overnight in London, says he has not been told he has broken any rules. But he said it would have been ""more appropriate"" not to claim the money. Labour said Lord Bassam, who is a member of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, would make way once a successor had been elected in January or February. A spokesman said the peer had already referred himself to the Lords standards commissioner to determine whether he had broken the peers' code of conduct. After theMail On Sunday reported,externalLord Bassam claimed the Â£6,400 annual cost of travelling to and from his home in Brighton, the former leader of Brighton Council said he would not submit such claims again. According to the paper, Lord Bassam is one of a small number of front bench peers also entitled to theLords office holders allowance,external. This is because of his role as chief whip and because his main home is not in London. The payment is included in his salary and designed to cover ""expenses in staying overnight away from their main or only residence"". In a statement, Lord Bassam said: ""With my home outside of London, I have been in receipt of the relevant office holders allowance for the opposition chief whip in the Lords. ""At the same time, in accordance with rules laid down by the House, I have claimed costs for my regular travel to and from Parliament. ""While I have not been advised that any breach of the rules has taken place, waiving the right to such travel claims would perhaps have been a more appropriate response on my part. ""I will not be submitting any further claims in this way, and instead use the office holders allowance to cover those additional costs. I will also discuss with House officials the steps necessary to repay previous travel claims.""

"Sean Rigg died from a heart attack in police custody in 2008 Five police officers will not face prosecution after the death of a mentally ill man in custody, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has ruled. Sean Rigg's family said it was ""shameful"" the CPS had upheld its decision from 2016. The musician, 40, died from a heart attack at Brixton police station in south London in 2008. In 2012 an inquest jury found that police used ""unsuitable"" force after arresting Mr Rigg. The CPS chose not to authorise charges against any of the officerslast year because the evidential threshold was not met. A review began at the request of Mr Rigg's family. Mr Rigg's sister, Marcia Rigg, said in a family statement: ""It is shameful that the CPS should yet again find there is insufficient evidence. ""After years of vigorous campaigning to highlight the flaws in this wretched and unfair judicial system, there is no justice in the UK for families like mine. ""Any hope has been crushed."" In the weeks before his death Mr Rigg, who had paranoid schizophrenia, had not taken his medication. Marcia Rigg believes the police have not been held accountable over her brother's death He was held down for eight minutes in the ""prone position""after his arrest in Balham for attacking passers-by and officers in August 2008. He fell ill in a police van and died in custody. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and Met Police are still liaising over whether any officer has a misconduct case to answer. Daniel Machover, the family solicitor, said: ""As the police continue to pose a danger to those suffering from mental ill health, it is saddening that the CPS has failed to bring charges that would help to bring about change and accountability."" A CPS spokesperson said: ""A full review of the evidence, including new material provided by the IPCC, was undertaken by a specialist CPS prosecutor who was not involved in the original decision. ""The review has now concluded and has upheld the original decision not to authorise charges in relation to the death of Mr Rigg, on the basis that the evidential test in the code for crown prosecutors is not met."" The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) said in a statement: ""The MPS has been notified by the Crown Prosecution Service that the decision not to prosecute any police officer in connection with the death of Sean  Rigg has been reviewed and upheld. ""The MPS has responded to the IPCC about its findings in relation to whether any officer involved has a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct. We await the IPCC's further response and continue to liaise in line with the regulations that govern police conduct matters. ""We will do all we can to progress matters as quickly as possible.""

"Some important items were lost or never recovered, including Poppi's last nappy and her pyjama bottoms, the inquest heard An expert witness has cast doubt on suggestions toddler Poppi Worthington was sexually abused in the hours before her death. Dr Nat Cary, a consultant forensic pathologist, told the inquest there was no clear-cut evidence of trauma implying third-party involvement. His evidence contradicted the findings of Dr Alison Armour, who was called as a witness earlier in the week. Poppi died suddenly at a house in Barrow on 12 December 2012. No-one has been prosecuted. Although he did not carry out his own post-mortem examination, Dr Cary said he had formed his opinion after studying photographs and slides. He told the hearing in Kendal he discounted Dr Armour's assertion that marks found near Poppi's fallopian tube were bruises from sexual penetration. Dr Cary said they were ""of no consequence"" and would have occurred naturally in the five days between the youngster's death and her examination by Dr Armour. Although he said he could not ""absolutely exclude"" penetration, Dr Cary said he would have ""expected very obvious injury and there wasn't anything of the sort"". He said he could not be sure how the 13-month-old had died. There could have been an ""element of asphyxia"" but there was no sign she had struggled against restraint, he said. ""Just because you don't find a natural cause it doesn't mean there isn't one,"" he said. He told Leslie Thomas QC, representing Poppi's father Paul Worthington, there was no evidence of a criminal act directly or indirectly causing Poppi's death. The presence of blood ""needs to be explained"" but there was only the ""possibility that something happened"", he said. Dr Nat Cary (seen here at a crime scene in Ipswich in 2006) said Poppi's death was not necessarily criminal just because it was unexplained In answer to further questions, he said it was not possible to say whether an injury to Poppi's leg was deliberate or accidental and, if the latter, whether it was not witnessed by a parent or seen but ignored. The coroner David Roberts asked Dr Cary if Poppi's case affected the way he now carried out his work in other cases. Would he, for example, look for marks like those seen in Poppi, he asked. Dr Cary said: ""Yes, I would have a better look than I used to."" The sheet from the double bed where Poppi was placed at the time of her collapse was not recovered, the inquest heard The inquest was told earlier that vital evidence from Poppi's final hours was lost or never found by police. Catherine Thundercloud, a retired Cumbria Police officer, said it would have been ""imperative"" to get statements from people in the house and Poppi's aunt, Tracy Worthington, as quickly as possible. She had been asked to review the evidence as part of an Independent Police Commission Complaint (IPCC) investigation. Sheets, equipment and gloves used by paramedics and hospital staff should have been retained, she said. But a number of these items had not been kept, the inquest has heard. Alison Hewitt, counsel for the coroner, asked Ms Thundercloud what officers should have known before they searched the house. Ms Thundercloud said they should have had first accounts from the parents and details from hospital staff about what had happened. The inquest has heard the first police search began before first accounts had been gathered from Mr Worthington. Paul Worthington has always denied harming his daughter Ms Thundercloud said: ""Unless you've read what he said you can't do a proper strategy."" She said those failures may have resulted in ""vital evidence being lost"". The account from Mr Worthington would have shown the pyjama bottoms, which have never been found, were needed, she said. Mr Worthington's laptop and both parents' mobile phones should also have been seized, she said. Ms Thundercloud said there had been ""a lot of failings by police"" and ""missed opportunities"" in the first two days of the investigation. A proper log of the investigation was not kept so it was ""very difficult"" to see ""the rationale of what was done and not done,"" she said. In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died. Mr Worthington has denied any wrongdoing. The hearing continues.

"A member of House of Commons staff was arrested after a fight outside one of Parliament's busiest bars. The Sports and Social Club has been closed and a 57-year-old man arrested on suspicion of GBH and affray. Police later released the man, who remains under investigation. A 64-year-old man, also a Commons employee, is reported to have been taken to hospital in an ambulance following the incident, which took place on Tuesday evening. He needed treatment for non-life threatening injuries. Scotland Yard said police were still investigating what happened but no-one else was thought to have  been involved. A House of Lords spokesperson said the Sports and Social Club bar would stay closed until the investigation was complete. The venue, which is a popular haunt for MPs and their staff, is a large traditional pub in the bowels of the Parliamentary estate. It was recently taken back under the direct control of the House of Lords authorities from an outside contractor and its future was already thought to be in doubt.

"Laurence Soper was found guilty of 19 counts of sexual assault against boys at St Benedict's School in Ealing, where he taught An ex-Roman Catholic priest has been found guilty of abusing boys at a London school during the 1970s and 80s. Laurence Soper, 74, was extradited to face 19 charges of indecent and serious sexual assault against 10 former pupils at the independent St Benedict's School in Ealing, where he taught. Soper fled to Kosovo with Â£182,000 from the Vatican bank in a bid to avoid prosecution for molesting boys. An Old Bailey jury took 14 hours to find him guilty of all charges. Prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC told how the victims were subjected to sadistic beatings by Soper for ""fake reasons"" and on many occasions ""with what can only have been a sexual motive"". They included kicking a football ""in the wrong direction"", ""failing to use double margins"", and ""using the (wrong) staircase"", leading to a caning and a sexual assault, she said. Laurence Soper was a senior priest at St Benedict's School in Ealing, west London Ms Etherton said at least one of Soper's alleged victims suffered serious mental health problems, while another was too afraid to speak out because the abusers ""were like saints to me"". The court heard Soper quit as an abbot in 2000 and moved to Rome. He then skipped bail and spent six years living in Kosovo, with a European Arrest Warrant issued for his extradition. Soper denied using the cane as a ruse to abuse boys who were given the choice of six lashes with trousers on, or three with them off. He told jurors he went on the run out of ""stupidity and cowardice"", fearing that his life's work would be wrecked. Soper is the latest in a string of men to face allegations relating to their work at St Benedict's. In 2009, Father David Pearce, 75, nicknamed the ""devil in a dog collar"",was jailed after he admitted 11 charges of indecent assault dating back to 1972,external Between 2003 and 2009, ""master of discipline"" John Maestri, 78, of Chatham in Kent, admittedfive indecent assaults against childrenat St Benedict's in the 1980s and was jailed In 2010, John Skelton was convicted of indecent assaults against two complainants said to have occurred in 1983 Father Anthony Gee faced accusations of abuse, but no further action was taken although civil action was brought against him In 2010, Abbot Shipperlee announced an independent review of safeguarding arrangements, policies and procedures. The following year, Lord Carlileproduced a damning report calling for tougher rulesto protect all faith pupils and stripped monks of control at the school. In a statement issued by Lord Carlile QC, the school apologised for the ""serious wrongs of the past"". He said: ""The school regrets that Soper did not have the courage to plead guilty. The result has been that innocent victims, whom he abused when they were boys in the school, were compelled to give evidence. ""The tough lessons of the past have been learned, and the errors and crimes of the past are in the daily consciousness and conscience of the school management.""

"Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman (left) and Mohammad Aqib Imran appeared at Westminster at Magistrates' Court A man has been remanded in custody after appearing in court accused of a plot to bomb Downing Street's security gates and then kill Theresa May. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, from north London, planned to detonate a homemade bomb and attack the PM with a suicide vest and a knife. A second man also appeared in court charged with preparing terrorist acts. Both men will appear at London's Old Bailey on 20 December. Mr Rahman is charged with the preparation of terrorist acts and is also charged with assisting another man to prepare separate acts of terrorism. The second charge relates to allegedly helping Mohammad Aqib Imran, 21, from Birmingham, who is accused is charged with preparing acts of terrorism. He is alleged to have taken several steps in an attempt to travel to Libya. That included saving money, trying to secure a false passport, and researching extremist ideologies and travel options. The men were arrested by Metropolitan Police officers on 28 November within 90 minutes of one another. The men arrived at court in a police van During the seven minute hearing, the men - dressed in light grey sweatshirts and trousers - confirmed their names, addresses and dates of birth. Mr Rahman gave his nationality as Bangladeshi-British, while Mr Imran gave his as Pakistani-British. Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot remanded the men in custody ahead of the Old Bailey appearance. The magistrates' court appearances comes a day after a security review said it was ""conceivable"" that the Manchester Arena bombing in May, in which 22 people were killed, could have been prevented.

capital before a final status agreement,"" a spokesman said. ""We believe it is unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the
region."" Some Palestinians are calling for a national all-out strike on Thursday to reject Trump's move, an independent Palestinian news agency reports. Palestinians have been urged to attend demonstrations instead. The EU foreign policy chief has voiced her ""serious concern"" at the US president's move. ""The aspirations of both parties must be fulfilled and a way must be found  through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital  of both states,"" Federica Mogherini said. She added that the EU's concern was based on Trump's announcement ""and the repercussions this may have on the prospect of peace"". Images are coming in from the Gaza Strip showing Palestinians gathering to protest against Trump's decision. Local news websites quoted a senior member of Hamas, Ismail Radwan, telling the crowds that ""Jerusalem and the Holy City can never be relinquished or be accepted as a unified capital of the occupation"". He reportedly added that Trump's step was a ""blatant assault on our people and on our umma (the wider Muslim community)"". In a series of Twitter posts, the US embassy in Amman has announced that they are suspending vital services.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Bath Spa University said Prof Christina Slade's pay-off was ""value for money"" A university vice-chancellor was handed more than Â£800,000 in her final year, including a hefty departure payment,it has been revealed.,external Accounts for Bath Spa University showProf Christina Slade was paid Â£429,000 ""for loss of office"" on top of her Â£250,000 salary,externaland other benefits. The University and College Union (UCU) has called for an ""urgent overhaul"" of senior pay at British universities. A spokeswoman for Bath Spa said the sum represented ""value for money"". Prof Slade, who served as vice-chancellor until August, was also given a housing allowance of Â£20,000 and another Â£20,000 for ""other benefits-in-kind"". There were also pension contributions of Â£89,000. In total, she received a pay package, including benefits and pensions, worth Â£808,000, after she decided to leave the job. Lord Adonis, who is pushing the issue of vice-chancellor pay in the House of Lords, said: ""If Â£800,000 represents value for money for a vice-chancellor, then I am the emperor of China."" Bath Spa University charged Â£9,250 a year for an undergraduate degree starting in 2017. That is Â£27,750 for a three-year course. Prof Slade's Â£808,000 pay was equivalent to 87 students' fees for a year or 29 students' entire degrees. The whole pay package, including compensation for loss of office, was also almost double the amount earned by Dame Glynis Breakwell, who is standing down from the nearby University of Bath following a row over her pay. The median annual salary in the UK is Â£23,474. In Bath it is Â£23,082. It means in her final year Prof Slade earned 35 times more than theaverage worker in the local area,external. University vice-chancellors in the UKearn an average of Â£249,000. Bath Spa University has not yet given details of the circumstances of her departure, but an interim vice-chancellor, Prof Nick Foskett, is running the university until January. An incoming vice-chancellor, Prof Sue Rigby will be taking over on 22 January. She is due to be paid 20% less than Prof Slade received in 2015-16. A spokeswoman for the university said: ""Having taken legal advice, the university paid Prof Slade a sum which reflected her contractual and statutory entitlements, and was considered to represent value for money."" She said that the vice-chancellor's salary was decided by a pay committee, which did not include the vice-chancellor or staff. The committee was ""mindful of the need to respond to concerns about excessive salaries and take into account the performance of the university"", she added. Lord Adonis said such high rates of pay were not acceptable when students could potentially be racking up debts of Â£100,000 because of the way interest was stacking up. He added that it was not the case that England was losing vice-chancellors to the US, it was simply that universities had seen an explosion in income through higher fees. He is calling for a independent investigation into the pay of vice-chancellors. Bath Spa University describes itself as a creative university with about 7,000 students and 1,000 staff. It was awarded university status in 2005 after seven colleges joined together to make the new institution. Dame Glynis Breakwell agreed to stand down as University of Bath's vice-chancellor after a row over her pay The new revelations came on the day it emerged the retirement terms of Britain's highest paid vice-chancellorare being investigated by a watchdog. Prof Dame Glynis Breakwell announced she was resigning from the University of Bath after a row over her Â£468,000 salary. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said that when it came to senior pay in universities ""many vice-chancellors and senior staff look like they are living on a different planet"". She called for greater transparency into how senior pay awards were decided, with staff and students included on remuneration committees. ""We are seeing what happens when decisions are taken in secret without proper checks and balances,"" she added. ""This simply cannot be allowed to continue; we need an urgent overhaul of how senior pay and perks are determined, and how our universities are governed."" But Bath Spa said the former vice-chancellor had led the university during a during a turbulent time for UK higher education and it had ""flourished"" during her tenure. It was now widely recognised as a centre of excellence for creativity, culture and enterprise, it said. A spokesman said: ""During her leadership, Bath Spa University has been transformed from a regional British university to a truly global institution, ranked eighth best modern university in the UK by the Sunday Times in 2016. ""As well as major campus developments, Prof Slade has overseen a transformation in teaching and research, with additional professorial posts created and a significant increase in research activity and income.""

"A member of House of Commons staff was arrested after a fight outside one of Parliament's busiest bars. The Sports and Social Club has been closed and a 57-year-old man arrested on suspicion of GBH and affray. Police later released the man, who remains under investigation. A 64-year-old man, also a Commons employee, is reported to have been taken to hospital in an ambulance following the incident, which took place on Tuesday evening. He needed treatment for non-life threatening injuries. Scotland Yard said police were still investigating what happened but no-one else was thought to have  been involved. A House of Lords spokesperson said the Sports and Social Club bar would stay closed until the investigation was complete. The venue, which is a popular haunt for MPs and their staff, is a large traditional pub in the bowels of the Parliamentary estate. It was recently taken back under the direct control of the House of Lords authorities from an outside contractor and its future was already thought to be in doubt.

"This video can not be played Brexit Secretary David Davis is quizzed by committee chairman Hilary Benn The government has not carried out any impact assessments of leaving the EU on the UK economy, Brexit Secretary David Davis has told MPs. Mr Davis said the usefulness of such assessments would be ""near zero"" because of the scale of change Brexit is likely to cause. He said the government had produced a ""sectoral analysis"" of different industries but not a ""forecast"" of what would happen when the UK leaves the EU. Labour called it a ""shambles"". The Liberal Democrats said impact assessments were urgently needed while the SNP called it an ""ongoing farce"". Mr Davis said a ""very major contingency planning operation"" was in place for Brexit. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict May says 'good progress' made on Brexit Pienaar: Davis raises questions over Brexit planning Kuenssberg: The phone call that never was Opposition MPs have been on the trail of the ""Brexit impact assessments"" for months. And when David Davis told them they didn't exist, they were quick to highlight some similar-sounding studies he had referred to in the past: October 2016,asked what assessment the government had made of the impact of Brexit on the economy: ""We currently have in place an assessment of 51 sectors of the economy. We are looking at those one by one, but the aim at the end is that this will inform the negotiating approach so that no one gets hurt."" December 2016, to the Brexit Committee: ""We are in the midst of carrying out about 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85% of the economyâ¦ everything except sectors that are not affected by international trade."" February 2017, in a statement to MPs: ""We continue to analyse the impact of our exit across the breadth of the UK economy, covering more than 50 sectors - I think it was 58 at the last count - to shape our negotiating position."" June 2017,on the Andrew Marr Show:""That data's being gathered, we've got 50, nearly 60 sector analyses already done, we've got planning work going on in the customs, we've got planning work going on 22 other issues which are critical, 127 all told."" Downing Street told journalists: ""We have been clear that the impact assessments don't exist. They're a specific thing in Whitehall terms. We think we have complied with the terms of the motion."" At Wednesday morning's Brexit committee hearing, chairman Hilary Benn asked whether impact assessments had been carried out into various parts of the economy, listing the automotive, aerospace and financial sectors. ""I think the answer's going to be no to all of them,"" Mr Davis responded. When Mr Benn suggested this was ""strange"", the minister said formal assessments were not needed to know that ""regulatory hurdles"" would have an impact, describing Brexit as a ""paradigm change"" of similar impact to the financial crash, which could not be predicted. ""I am not a fan of economic models because they have all proven wrong,"" he said. 'Davis sounded frazzled' -by the BBC's Norman Smith David Davis has probably not done the Brexit cause a huge bundle of good this morning. First, his frank admission that no impact assessments have been completed will inevitably be seized on by critics to argue Team May simply haven't done the basic spadework. Second his suggestion that he doesn't have the resources for this, and anyway some of the work his officials have done wasn't much good, is hardly a ringing endorsement of his Brexit department. Third, Mr Davis probably didn't help his own reputation by telling the committee he had been handed two chapters of the 850 pages of analysis but hadn't read them. At times Mr Davis even chided the committee over the time they were taking. Fair enough the Brexit secretary had a cold - but at times he sounded thoroughly frazzled and cheesed off. Not a great look. There has been a long-running row over the government's Brexit studies and their publication. MPs have been pushing for the documents to be published, and on 1 November the Commons passed a motion to release ""Brexit impact assessments"" to the Brexit Committee of MPs. In response, the government said this motion ""misunderstood"" what the documents actually were, but has since provided an edited set of reports to the committee. David Davis said the impact of Brexit on different sectors had not been assessed Mr Davis told the MPs this represented ""getting as close as we can to meeting what we took to be the intent of Parliament"". A ""quantitative economic forecast of outcome"" does not exist, he said. ""That is not there. We have not done that. What is there is the size of the industry, the employment and so on."" Mr Davis also said there was no ""systematic impact assessment"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn asks: ""Do they exist, or donât they?"" During PMQs, Prime Minister Theresa May repeated Mr Davis' line that ""sectoral analysis"", not ""impact assessments"" had been drawn up, adding that the government would not give a running commentary on the negotiations. ""This really is a shambles,"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. Later, Chancellor Philip Hammond was asked whether the Treasury had produced analysis of the potential economic impact of Brexit. He said his department had ""modelled and analysed a whole range of potential alternative structures between the EU and the UK, potential alternative arrangements and agreements that might be made"". Appearing before the Treasury Select Committee, he suggested these could be made public when a Brexit deal has been agreed, but said to do so at this stage would be ""deeply unhelpful to the negotiation"".

"Downing Street has insisted it is still confident of a first-phase Brexit deal before next week's summit Theresa May has been urged not to allow Eurosceptic MPs in her party to ""impose their own conditions"" on negotiations amid signs of fresh Tory infighting. Nineteen Tory MPs who back a ""soft Brexit"" have written to her saying it is ""highly irresponsible"" for anyone to dictate terms which may scupper a deal. It follows some Tories backing the DUP's decision to oppose a draft deal on the future of the Irish border. The PM has spoken to the DUP's Arlene Foster to try to break the deadlock. The DUP says there is ""more work to be done"" if it is to agree to plans for the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit - a prerequisite for talks to move on to their next phase. Irish PM Leo Varadkar, who also spoke to Mrs May on Wednesday, said he was willing to consider any new proposals,suggesting the UK might put something forward within the next 24 hours. And the BBC understands the ambassadors of the 27 EU member states, who received an update from chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday, are ""waiting for something from London"" in the next 48 hours. The BBC's Adam Fleming said Mr Barnier and the member states agreed there must be clarity within 48 hours for them to have enough time to consult with their capitals about draft guidelines for phase two of the talks. At a summit next week, European leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made in the negotiations on Ireland, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights so far to open trade talks. Brexit impact assessments 'don't exist' Kuenssberg: Brexit discussion looming for PM Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Dublin 'to give May space' on Brexit In their letter, the 19 MPs - who largely backed Remain in the 2016 referendum - say they support the PM's handling of the negotiations, in particular the ""political and practical difficulties"" relating to the Irish border. But they hit out at what they say are attempts by some in their party to paint a no-deal scenario in which the UK failed to agree a trade agreement as ""some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points ""We wish to make it clear that we are disappointed yet again that some MPs and others seek to impose their own conditions on these negotiations,"" the MPs, including former cabinet ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan - write. ""In particular, it is highly irresponsible to seek to dictate terms which could lead to the UK walking away from these negotiations."" Allow Twitter content?

It urges the PM to ""take whatever time is necessary"" to get the next stage of negotiations right. On Tuesday, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith argued the time was fast approaching for the UK to consider walking away from the talks if the EU did not allow negotiators to proceed to the next phase - in which future trade and security relations will take centre stage. The suggestion of ""regulatory alignment"" between Northern Ireland and the European Union and any continuing role for the European Court of Justice has also concerned some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs. On Monday Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - whose support the PM needs to win key votes at Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. The DUP said the proposals, which aimed to avoid a ""hard border"" by aligning regulations on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, were not acceptable. This has left the UK government racing to find an agreement suiting all sides in time for next week's summit. The Irish PM said he was willing to consider any new proposals from the UK The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the Irish government, which has said it wants firm guarantees that a hard border can be avoided, was playing a ""dangerous game"" with its own economy. At a press conference with his Dutch counterpart on Wednesday, Irish PM Leo Varadkar insisted he wanted the talks to move beyond consideration of divorce issues to the future. ""Having consulted with people in London, she (Theresa May) wants to come back to us with some text tonight or tomorrow,"" he said. ""I expressed my willingness to consider that."" In a separate development, Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested the UK could pay the so-called Brexit bill, regardless of whether or not there is a subsequent trade agreement with the EU. He told MPs on the Treasury Committee he found it ""inconceivable"" that the UK would ""walk away"" from its financial obligations as ""frankly it would not make us a credible partner for future international agreements"". On the issue of the divorce bill, a No 10 spokesman said the government's position remained that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that applies to the financial settlement"". Reports have suggested the UK has raised its financial offer to a figure of up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn).

"The Minnesota senator has faced mounting allegations of sexual misconduct Up to 30 Democratic senators have called on US Senator Al Franken to resign amid sexual misconduct claims. In statements released almost simultaneously on Wednesday, a group of Democratic lawmakers said the embattled Minnesota senator must step down. Mr Franken, a former Saturday Night Live comedian, has been accused of groping and sexually harassing seven women, including a US military veteran. He has apologised to his accusers, while disputing some allegations. In a statement provided to BBC News, Mr Franken's office said the senator ""will be making an announcement tomorrow"". The senator saida report by Minnesota Public Radio,externalthat he would resign his seat on Thursday was ""not accurate"". His Twitter account posted: ""No final decision has been made and the Senator is still talking with his family."" Senators Kamala Harris, Claire McCaskill, Maggie Hassan, Mazie Hirono, Patty Murray, Kirsten Gillibrand - all prominent female Democratic lawmakers - released their statements online. They spoke out following a US media report that Mr Franken had allegedly tried to forcibly kiss a former congressional aide in 2006. He denied the claim. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse Second woman accuses US Congressman Conyers Senators Tammy Baldwin, Bob Casey, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, and Sherrod Brown released similar statements shortly after. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington With the seventh credible allegation of harassment levelled against Senator Al Franken, a dam is breaking - and, once again, women are leading the way. One, after another, female Democratic senators have come out calling for Mr Franken's resignation. It's a drumbeat of condemnation that will be increasingly hard for the embattled Minnesota senator to ignore. A day after John Conyers, the longest-serving current member of the House of Representatives, resigned amid allegations of harassment and assault, the Democratic Party appears to be coming to grips with the problem within its ranks. This, however, is probably just the beginning - and, at some point, the politician in the firestorm may be from an at-risk seat. That's not the case with Mr Franken and Mr Conyers, and it will be at that point that party principles will be truly tested. For now, however, Democrats can make a move for the moral high ground, as Donald Trump and the Republican Party rally around Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who faces credible allegations of sexual assault and impropriety with teenage girls. Others followed suit, including Dianne Feinstein, Heidi Heitkamp, Maria Cantwell, Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Michael Bennet, Dick Durbin, Martin Heinrich, Jeff Merkley, Patrick Leahy, Ron Wyden and Tom Carper. Finally, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Mr Franken should quit. Tom Perez, the Democrat National Committee chairman, also called on Mr Franken to resign in a Twitter post. ""Everyone must share the responsibility of building a culture of trust and respect for women in every industry and workplace, and that includes our party,"" he wrote. This video can not be played Senator Gillibrand calls on Franken to quit Mrs Murray, the third-highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, wrote: ""It's clear to me that this has been a deeply harmful, persistent problem and a clear pattern over a long period of time."" ""It's time for him to step aside,"" the Washington state representative said on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Roy Moore's accuser: I was a child George Bush Snr accused by interpreter ""I was really startled by it and I just sort of booked it towards the door,"" she said, adding that he then told her: ""It's my right as an entertainer"".

"Google says its AlphaGo Zero artificial intelligence program has triumphed at chess against world-leading specialist software within hours of teaching itself the game from scratch. The firm's DeepMind division says that it played 100 games against Stockfish 8, and won or drew all of them. Theresearch has yet to be peer reviewed,external. But experts already suggest the achievement will strengthen the firm's position in a competitive sector. ""From a scientific point of view, it's the latest in a series of dazzling results that DeepMind has produced,"" the University of Oxford's Prof Michael Wooldridge told the BBC. ""The general trajectory in DeepMind seems to be to solve a problem and then demonstrate it can really ramp up performance, and that's very impressive."" DeepMind has previously won a series of Go games against some of the world's top human players DeepMind has previously defeated several of the world's top human players of the Chinese board game Go, as well as teaching itself how to play video games including Pong and Space Invaders. The London-based team is currently trying to develop a system that can beat humansat the space strategy game Starcraft,external, which is seen as being an even more complex challenge. Google is not commenting on the research until it is published in a journal. However, details published onCornell University's Arxiv site,externalstate that an algorithm dubbed AlphaZero was able to outperform Stockfish just four hours after being given the rules of chess and being told to learn by playing simulations against itself. In the 100 games that followed, each program was given one minute's worth of thinking time per move. DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis was previously involved in making computer games, including Theme Park AlphaZero won 25 games in which it played with white pieces, giving it the first move, and a further three in which it played with black pieces. The two programs drew the remaining 72 games. DeepMind described the level of performance achieved as being ""superhuman"". Google highlighted that Stockfish 8 had previously won 2016's Top Chess Engine Championship. The software was first released in 2008 and has been built on by volunteers in the years since. The open source project has been beaten by another program, Komodo, in two major computer chess challenges this year. Even so, one human chess grandmaster was still hugely impressed by DeepMind's victory. ""I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they played chess,"" Peter Heine Nielsen told the BBC. ""Now I know."" AlphaGo Zero's latest achievements do not rest on chess alone. The paper says it was also triumphant in the Japanese board game Shogi versus a leading artificial intelligence program named Elmo, after two hours of self-training. The AlphaZero algorithm won 90 games, drew two and lost eight. Furthermore, after eight hours of self-training it was also able to beat the previous version of itself at Go - winning 60 games and losing 40. Shogi is sometimes known as Japanese chess Prof Wooldridge noted that all three games were fairly ""closed"" in the sense they had limited sets of rules to contend with. ""In the real world we don't know what is round the corner,"" he explained. ""Coping when you don't know what is coming is much more complicated, and things will get even more exciting when DeepMind moves on to more open problems."" The University of Bath's AI expert Prof Joanna Bryson added that people should be cautious about buying too deeply into the firm's hype. But she added that its knack for good publicity had put it in a strong position against challengers. ""It's not only about hiring the best programmers,"" she said. ""It's also very political, as it helps makes Google as strong as possible when negotiating with governments and regulators looking at the AI sector.""

"US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv has been met with a wave of disapproval. Leaders from within the Arab and Muslim worlds, and from the wider international community, were swift to criticise the move. Some warned of the potential for violence and bloodshed as a result. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Mr Trump said his decision was a ""recognition of reality"", and that the US was ""not taking a position on any final status issues"". President Mahmoud Abbassaid the decision was tantamount to the US ""abdicating its role as a peace mediator"". ""These deplorable and unacceptable measures deliberately undermine all peace efforts,"" he said in a speech broadcast after Mr Trump's announcement. He insisted that Jerusalem was the ""eternal capital of the state of Palestine"". The leader of the Islamist movement Hamas, Ismail Haniya, called for a new ""intifada"", or uprising. ""The American decision is an aggression against our people. It's a declaration of war against our Palestinian people,"" he told a news conference in Gaza. ""We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy,"" he added. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid on Wednesday that the US announcement was a ""historic landmark"" and that Mr Trump's decision was ""courageous and just"". Mr Netanyahu said the speech was ""an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel"". The city had ""been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years"", he added. In a speech on Thursday, he said: ""President Trump has inscribed himself in the annals of our capital for all time."" ""His name will now be linked to the names of others in the context of the glorious history of Jerusalem and our people... We are already in contacts with other countries that will declare similar recognition,"" he said, adding: ""It's about time."" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogancondemned the move, saying it was ""throwing the region into a ring of fire"". ""What do you want to do Mr Trump? What kind of an approach is this? Political leaders exist not to create struggles but to make peace,"" he said. His Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu wrote on Twitter that ""the decision is against international law and relevant UN resolutions"". Allow Twitter content?

Saudi Arabia's King Salmantold Mr Trump by telephone on Tuesday that the relocation of the embassy or recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital ""would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world"". On Thursday, a Saudi royal court statement called Mr Trump's decision ""unjustified and irresponsible"". ""The US move represents a significant decline in efforts to push a peace process and is a violation of the historically neutral American position on Jerusalem."" Those views were echoed byEgypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who warned against ""complicating the situation in the region by introducing measures that would undermine chances for peace in the Middle East"".

Meanwhile,Jordan's King Abdullahcalled for joint efforts to ""deal with the ramifications of this decision"" and a Jordanian government spokesman said Mr Trump was violating international law and the UN charter. Lebanon's President Michel Aounsaid the peace process would be set back decades, whileQatar's Foreign MinisterSheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thanisaid the move was ""a death sentence for all who seek peace"". Pope Francissaid: ""I cannot silence my deep concern over the situation that has emerged in recent days. At the same time, I appeal strongly for all to respect the city's status quo, in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions."" United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterressaid President Trump's statement ""would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians"". Mr Guterres said Jerusalem was ""a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties"". Such negotiations must take ""into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinians and the Israeli sides,"" he said. TheEuropean Unioncalled for the ""resumption of a meaningful peace process towards a two-state solution"" and said ""a way must be found, through negotiations, to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states, so that the aspiration of both parties can be fulfilled"". EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherinisaid the announcement ""has a very worrying potential impact."" ""It is a very fragile context and the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the ones we are already living in,"" she added. ""The worst thing that could happen now is an escalation of tensions around the holy places and in the region because what happens in Jerusalem matters to the whole region and the entire world."" French President Emmanuel Macronsaid Mr Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""regrettable"". He called efforts for ""avoid violence at all costs."" German ChancellorAngela Merkel's spokesman said on Twitter that Berlin ""does not support this position because the status of Jerusalem can only be negotiated within the framework of a two-state solution"". BothChinaandRussiaalso expressed their concern that the move could lead to an escalation of tensions in the region. UK Prime Minister Theresa Maysaid her government disagreed with the US decision, which was ""unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region"". ""The British embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it,"" a statement said. ""Our position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and longstanding: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states. In line with relevant [UN] Security Council Resolutions, we regard East Jerusalem as part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories.""

""The German government does not support this position  because the status of Jerusalem can only be negotiated  within the framework of a two-state solution,"" spokesman  Steffen Seibert wrote on Twitter (in German). Yolande KnellBBC News, Jerusalem For many Israelis, President Trump's formal recognition of Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem corrects a historic injustice. Israeli politicians are now urging more countries to follow Washington's lead and move their embassies. ""We expect our friends to recognise our own capital as what it is,"" Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett told the BBC. But Palestinians object strongly to the US announcement and say it inflames tensions. Palestinians protest in Gaza City Palestinian Education Minister Sabri Saidam described it as ""a manifestation of the lack of fairness in handling of the Palestine file and a total bias towards Israel"". There were large protests in Gaza following Mr Trump's speech - and there are calls for more across the Palestinian territories in the coming days. The First Minister of Scotland and Scottish National Party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, says Trump's decision is ""reckless"". The secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), Saeb Erekat, has told reporters that Mr Trump  has destroyed any hopes for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict. I think tonight [Trump] is strengthening the forces of extremists in this region as no-one has done before  Reacting to President Trump's announcement, the Czech Republic has issued a statement: ""The Czech Republic currently, before the peace between Israel and Palestine is signed, recognises Jerusalem to be in fact the capital of Israel in the borders of the demarcation line from 1967,""the country's foreign ministry said on its website,external. ""The Czech Republic together with other EU member states ... considers Jerusalem to be future capital of both states, meaning the State of Israel and the future State of Palestine. ""The ministry can start considering moving the Czech embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem only based on results of negotiations with key partners in the region and in the world.""

In a later comment he says: This list now includes #Egypt, #Morocco and London, as protests begin in #Jordan and the West Bank.  The BBC's Barbara Plett-Usher, in Washington, says: ""Trump emphasised several times that he was delivering on a campaign promise, signaling that domestic politics was largely what motivated this controversial decision. ""The announcement would have made more sense as part of a peace plan, but the White House is still drafting one. So the president spent much of the speech pushing back against criticism that he was prejudging his own peace initiative. ""He insisted that the US was still deeply committed to facilitating a deal acceptable to both sides, and was not taking a position on the final status of the holy city. ""That seemed to imply the Palestinian claim to occupied East Jerusalem would still be on the table in any negotiations. But his argument would have been more convincing to them if heâd spelled that out, and if heâd clearly stated that the end goal was two states. ""However he said the US would support such a solution if agreed to by both sides: not the unequivocal endorsement the Palestinians were looking for. Instead, he didnât offer the Palestinians anything."" The UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has firmly rejected President Trump's move to accord Israel sovereignty over Jerusalem. From day one as secretary general of the United Nations, I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians. Jerusalem is a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties, on the basis of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinians and the Israeli sides.

"Mahad Yusuf and Fesar Mahamud, of north London, have been convicted of trafficking a vulnerable teenager Two north London gang members have been convicted of exploiting a vulnerable teenager in the first so-called ""county lines"" case of its kind. Mahad Yusuf, 20, and Fesar Mahamud, 19 pleaded guilty to human trafficking offences on 5 December. The 19-year-old victim was told she ""belonged"" to Yusuf as she was lured into a car and driven to Swansea.

Specialist officers found the woman when they executed a search warrant on 25 May. Det Insp Rick Stewart said: ""The victim in this case suffered a horrendous ordeal at the hands of these two men, who trafficked her for their own criminal gain.

He made the announcement in a speech to workers at a car factory in the Volga city of Nizhny Novgorod. ""I will put forward my candidacy for the post of president of the Russian federation,"" he said. Mr Putin has been in power since 2000, either as president or prime minister. If he wins the March election he will be eligible to serve until 2024. Russian TV journalist Ksenia Sobchak has already said she will stand in the election but opinion polls suggest Mr Putin will win easily.

Happy bot-day, Mr President Mr Putin is popular with many Russians, who see him as a strong leader who has restored Russia's global standing with a decisive military intervention in the Syrian civil war and Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

"Hardware Warehouse is among the brands Steinhoff owns in South Africa Poundland owner Steinhoff International has seen its shares fall by almost two thirds after it said it would launch a probe into accounting irregularities. It came as chief executive Markus Jooste resigned and the South African group postponed its full-year results. Steinhoff has asked accountancy giant PwC to conduct an independent investigation. Shares in the company, listed in South Africa and Germany, ended the day 63% lower. Steinhoff owns 40 local brands in more than 30 countries. As well as furniture and homeware, it also sells products including clothing, footwear and consumer goods. Its brands include Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK, Conforama in Europe, Pep and Ackermans in South Africa and Snooze in Australia. Steinhoff derives about 60% of its earnings in Europe and 34% in Africa. Last year the firm lost out in a battle with Sainsbury's to take over Argos owner Home Retail Group. Earlier this year Poundland put UK discount chain 99p Stores - which it bought for Â£55m two years ago - into administration. Bruno Steinhoff founded Steinhoff Group Headquartered in South Africa from German origins Founded in 1964 by Bruno Steinhoff 6,500 retail outlets in 30 countries 22 manufacturing facilities 40 retail brands, including Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK, Conforama in Europe, Pep, Ackermans and Hardware Warehouse in South Africa and Snooze in Australia Also has property and automotive assets Mr Jooste had been in charge for close to two decades and oversaw Steinhoff's expansion from a furniture manufacturer in South Africa to one of the biggest global household goods retailers. The company said late on Tuesday that he had resigned with immediate effect, after the discovery of new information prompted the firm to ask PwC to perform an ""independent investigation"". ""The supervisory board of Steinhoff wishes to advise shareholders that new information has come to light today which relates to accounting irregularities requiring further investigation,"" the group said in a statement. Steinhoff's largest shareholder and chairman, billionaire Christo Wiese, will take over in an executive capacity on an interim basis. The group has been under investigation for suspected accounting irregularities by the state prosecutor in Oldenburg in Germany since 2015. It is not clear if these are the accounting irregularities the company was referring to in its statement.

"Some important items were lost or never recovered, including Poppi's last nappy and her pyjama bottoms, the inquest heard An expert witness has cast doubt on suggestions toddler Poppi Worthington was sexually abused in the hours before her death. Dr Nat Cary, a consultant forensic pathologist, told the inquest there was no clear-cut evidence of trauma implying third-party involvement. His evidence contradicted the findings of Dr Alison Armour, who was called as a witness earlier in the week. Poppi died suddenly at a house in Barrow on 12 December 2012. No-one has been prosecuted. Although he did not carry out his own post-mortem examination, Dr Cary said he had formed his opinion after studying photographs and slides. He told the hearing in Kendal he discounted Dr Armour's assertion that marks found near Poppi's fallopian tube were bruises from sexual penetration. Dr Cary said they were ""of no consequence"" and would have occurred naturally in the five days between the youngster's death and her examination by Dr Armour. Although he said he could not ""absolutely exclude"" penetration, Dr Cary said he would have ""expected very obvious injury and there wasn't anything of the sort"". He said he could not be sure how the 13-month-old had died. There could have been an ""element of asphyxia"" but there was no sign she had struggled against restraint, he said. ""Just because you don't find a natural cause it doesn't mean there isn't one,"" he said. He told Leslie Thomas QC, representing Poppi's father Paul Worthington, there was no evidence of a criminal act directly or indirectly causing Poppi's death. The presence of blood ""needs to be explained"" but there was only the ""possibility that something happened"", he said. Dr Nat Cary (seen here at a crime scene in Ipswich in 2006) said Poppi's death was not necessarily criminal just because it was unexplained In answer to further questions, he said it was not possible to say whether an injury to Poppi's leg was deliberate or accidental and, if the latter, whether it was not witnessed by a parent or seen but ignored. The coroner David Roberts asked Dr Cary if Poppi's case affected the way he now carried out his work in other cases. Would he, for example, look for marks like those seen in Poppi, he asked. Dr Cary said: ""Yes, I would have a better look than I used to."" The sheet from the double bed where Poppi was placed at the time of her collapse was not recovered, the inquest heard The inquest was told earlier that vital evidence from Poppi's final hours was lost or never found by police. Catherine Thundercloud, a retired Cumbria Police officer, said it would have been ""imperative"" to get statements from people in the house and Poppi's aunt, Tracy Worthington, as quickly as possible. She had been asked to review the evidence as part of an Independent Police Commission Complaint (IPCC) investigation. Sheets, equipment and gloves used by paramedics and hospital staff should have been retained, she said. But a number of these items had not been kept, the inquest has heard. Alison Hewitt, counsel for the coroner, asked Ms Thundercloud what officers should have known before they searched the house. Ms Thundercloud said they should have had first accounts from the parents and details from hospital staff about what had happened. The inquest has heard the first police search began before first accounts had been gathered from Mr Worthington. Paul Worthington has always denied harming his daughter Ms Thundercloud said: ""Unless you've read what he said you can't do a proper strategy."" She said those failures may have resulted in ""vital evidence being lost"". The account from Mr Worthington would have shown the pyjama bottoms, which have never been found, were needed, she said. Mr Worthington's laptop and both parents' mobile phones should also have been seized, she said. Ms Thundercloud said there had been ""a lot of failings by police"" and ""missed opportunities"" in the first two days of the investigation. A proper log of the investigation was not kept so it was ""very difficult"" to see ""the rationale of what was done and not done,"" she said. In 2016, High Court family judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled Poppi was probably sexually assaulted by her father shortly before she died. Mr Worthington has denied any wrongdoing. The hearing continues. Poppi fractures 'accidental fall' theory No 'natural causes' to Poppi's death Poppi police officer 'not fully trained' Poppi's father sobs at abuse questions Poppi dad refuses to answer questions Doctor 'suspicious' of Poppi's injury Second inquest for 'bubbly' toddler Poppi HM Courts Service An Evening with Shaun Ryder relocated from The Forum following asbestos closure Decision made on new 180-space car park at Cumberland Infirmary Drunk man grabbed concrete slab and threatened to smash up petrol station House damaged in suspected gas explosion to be demolished Police investigating 'serious assault' on Botchergate, Carlisle Cumbrian homecare provider holds first-ever staff awards ceremony At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Adriana (centre) gave an emotional news conference in Buenos Aires A woman taken from her mother as a newborn in Argentina has been reunited with her relatives by campaign group Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo. Adriana, 40, who asked not to have her surname released, was identified after she took a DNA test. Her DNA matched those of relatives of her parents, who disappeared under Argentina's military rule. Adriana is the 126th child found by the Grandmothers, who campaign for victims of the ""Dirty War"". Speaking at a news conference, Adriana said that when the couple who had brought her up died, she was told by someone that she was not their biological child. ""I found out on a Saturday and on the Monday I had already gone to the Grandmothers, I wanted to know if I was the daughter of people who had disappeared, more than anything because of my date of birth,"" she said referring to the hundreds of children who were taken from left-wing activists under military rule between 1976 and 1983. The grandmother looking for Argentina's stolen babies 'We will never stop searching' 'Stolen baby' speaks out She took a DNA test but, after four months, still no match had been found in the database the Grandmothers keep of relatives of those who disappeared or were murdered by the military regime. ""I began to think I had been abandoned, given away, sold, that they hadn't wanted me,"" said Adriana about her biological parents. But on Monday she finally got a call from the National Commission for the Right to Identity (CONADI) telling her they had information they would like to give her in person. Adriana went there straight away and was told she was the daughter of Violeta Ortolani and Edgardo Garnier. Activists held up pictures of Adriana's parents, who disappeared in 1977 The couple had met as engineering students in the city of La Plata, where they were also active in a left-wing student group. Ms Ortolani was detained by the military in December 1976 when she was eight months pregnant. Adriana was born in captivity in January 1977. Mr Garnier was detained a month later while he was searching for his missing partner and child. Neither Violeta Ortolani nor Edgardo Garnier, who were 23 and 21 years old at the time of their detention, were ever seen again. They are two of  some 30,000 people who disappeared during military rule. Mr Garnier's mother never stopped looking for her missing grandchild and has been a key figure in the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo. She could not attend Tuesday's news conference but Adriana said she had already spoken to her by phone. ""She is beautiful inside and out and such a personality."" Adriana said.

"Sarah sits at a windowsill to do her homework Mary, and her nine-year-old daughter, Sarah, are homeless and have spent the past 13 months living in a single room in a hostel. ""Nobody knows how we are living,"" says Mary. ""No-one knows we are in this situation."" ""They know we are in temporary accommodation, but they don't know we are living in a hostel - that we've got no space."" And there certainly is a lack of space.  It is just about possible to walk around one side of the double bed. There is a small table, but not enough room for mother and daughter to sit and eat a meal together. Their belongings are piled up precariously in laundry-bag towers against the wall, and there is not a free surface in the room. Their stuff is everywhere. Sarah has to sit cross-legged on the bed and lean on the windowsill to do her homework. She is one of the 128,000 children in Britain who will spend Christmas in temporary accommodation this year, according to official figures - the highest number for a decade. Very few of these will be sleeping rough, but they will be saddled with the hardships of living in temporary accommodation. Mary and Sarah (not their real names) found themselves homeless when their landlord wanted his property back and they could not afford another deposit and rent in advance. The office worker struggles to eat let alone cook healthy meals in the room, where just one of the cooker rings works. ""I am leading a double life because I go to work in my suit all dressed up and I go to church all dressed up, but nobody knows what I am going through."" And despite her young years, Sarah seems to want to keep her living conditions secret from her school friends too. ""I have friends and I really want my friends to come to my house, but they can't come here. ""They have to come to a nice house. So if they ask me I say I'll have to ask my mum. ""It's stopping me from having friends and hanging out."" According to housing and homelessness charity Shelter, families living in temporary accommodation are often confined to one single room, which significantly disrupts the children's ability to play or follow a daily routine Interviews by the charity with some families in such conditions, revealed children feeling anxious, afraid and ashamed. Mary says the practicalities of living in such a small space are very challenging. ""It's the storing of our clothes, the washing of our clothes."" Like others in similar situations, Mary struggles to stay positive. ""It's very easy to not do anything and just come back from wherever and go to bed. I'm trying so hard to fight that."" Mary adds: ""What keeps us going, for me and my daughter, is our faith. ""I think if I didn't have that I would have ended up in a mental hospital."" The government says it is working with Shelter and others to end homelessness. It is providing Â£1bn until 2020 to tackle the issue and putting into practice the Homelessness Reduction Act, which aims to ensure people receive the support they need earlier. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""Councils have a duty to provide safe, secure and suitable temporary accommodation. ""This means that people are getting help now and no family is without a roof over their head this Christmas."" Mary and her daughter have since been moved out of the hostel by their local council but only into another temporary setting.

"This video can not be played Woman was kept alive despite her advance directive wishes The family of an 81-year-old woman has received a Â£45,000 payout after she was kept alive against her will. Brenda Grant made a living will stating she feared degradation and indignity more than death after seeing her mum lose independence through dementia. But the George Eliot hospital, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, misplaced the document and she was artificially fed for 22 months. The trust has apologised for its failure. Mrs Grant, from Nuneaton, had an advance directive drawn up to say if she were no longer of sound mind or had suffered from a list of medical ailments, she should not have treatment to prolong her life. It also confirmed she should not be given food, but that distressing symptoms should be controlled by pain relief even though the treatment might shorten her life. Midlands Live: Arson attack on open gas main; Two men in court accused of terror plot Mrs Grant's daughter said she wanted to prevent other people going through similar problems In October 2012, Mrs Grant suffered a catastrophic stroke that left her unable to walk, talk or swallow. After spending nearly three months in the George Eliot Hospital she was fitted with a stomach peg so she could be fed directly, then discharged into a nursing home. The hospital had the advance directive but it was hidden in the middle of a thick pile of medical notes, Mrs Grant's daughter Tracy Barker said. Once in the nursing home, Mrs Grant became agitated and tried to pull out the tubes in her arm, prompting staff to put mittens on her hands. Mrs Barker said: ""She had a fear of being kept alive because she had a fear of going into a nursing home. ""She never wanted to be a burden to anybody, so she wouldn't have wanted any of us to look after her."" Brenda Grant, pictured with her grandson, ""never wanted to become a burden to anybody"" Mrs Grant did not tell her children about the living will. It was her GP who alerted them to it shortly before Mrs Grant was re-admitted to hospital.

A living will, or advance decision,is a document that sets out a person's wishes regarding health careand how they want to be treated if they become seriously ill and unable to make their own choices The document allows people to refuse treatment, even if it might lead to death, and is legally binding Some advantages are that they help medics and relatives take difficult decisions, but it can also be difficult for a healthy person to fully imagine what they would really want in those situations To arrange one, legal advice is recommended while discussing the matter with a healthcare professional who knows your medical history. The outcome should then be shared with all those involved in your care To refuse potentially life-sustaining treatment, the document must be signed and witnessed and include the statement ""even if life is at risk as a result"" Sources: Age UK and BBC ""I'm very, very angry with myself that I let my mum suffer for two years that she didn't need to suffer for,"" Mrs Barker said.

"Amazon's Fire TV devices are advertised as providing access to YouTube Google plans to stop Amazon's Fire TV streaming devices being able to use YouTube from the start of 2018. The search giant has also blocked a workaround that Amazon introduced to restore YouTube access to a screen-based version of its smart speaker. Experts say the steps mark an escalation of a business row in which consumers have been caught up in the fallout. Amazon had previously stopped selling several of Google's hardware products. It removed the latest Nest-branded smart home kit - including a home security system and a new version of its thermostat - from its online stores last month. And since 2015, Amazon has refused to sell Google's Chromecast video and audio-streaming dongles. The latest development coincides with the release of Amazon's Prime Video app for the Apple TV. Its absence had previously put Apple's set-top box at a disadvantage to Amazon's Fire TV line-up. Fire TV owners have reported that trying to watch YouTube clips now prompts an alert warning them that they will lose the functionality on 1 January. Allow Twitter content?

""We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services,"" Google said in a statement. ""But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn't make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of Nest's latest products. ""Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and FireTV. We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon."" Google had stopped Amazon's Echo Show speakers being able to play YouTube videos in September, on the basis that the retailer had altered the way the software worked. The version Amazon presented had lacked next video recommendations, subscriptions and other features - but these were restored in November, when Amazon made the device present a more normal view of YouTube. One of the Echo Show's most popular features was its ability to search for YouTube clips by voice But,according to Techcrunch,external, the search firm believes its rights have still been violated because Amazon continues to overlay its own voice controls. Amazon has responded, saying: ""Echo Show and Fire TV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube's existing website. Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website. We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible."" The dispute disadvantages consumers in two ways. Users will be unable to access a service that Amazon's devices had promised to deliver. And Amazon's refusal to even allow third-parties to sell certain Google products via its site makes it harder to find them at their lowest price. ""It's a surprising turn of events in both respects,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight tech consultancy. ""YouTube is all about maximising the number of people who see its content, and Amazon wants to be the so-called 'everything store'. ""It's all very unfortunate for consumers, who will have little understanding of the commercial tensions between the two companies. ""I wonder whether the next step might be the intervention of a regulator to investigate whether they are behaving anti-competitively.""

"This video can not be played Woman was kept alive despite her advance directive wishes The family of an 81-year-old woman has received a Â£45,000 payout after she was kept alive against her will. Brenda Grant made a living will stating she feared degradation and indignity more than death after seeing her mum lose independence through dementia. But the George Eliot hospital, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, misplaced the document and she was artificially fed for 22 months. The trust has apologised for its failure. Mrs Grant, from Nuneaton, had an advance directive drawn up to say if she were no longer of sound mind or had suffered from a list of medical ailments, she should not have treatment to prolong her life. It also confirmed she should not be given food, but that distressing symptoms should be controlled by pain relief even though the treatment might shorten her life. Midlands Live: Arson attack on open gas main; Two men in court accused of terror plot Mrs Grant's daughter said she wanted to prevent other people going through similar problems In October 2012, Mrs Grant suffered a catastrophic stroke that left her unable to walk, talk or swallow. After spending nearly three months in the George Eliot Hospital she was fitted with a stomach peg so she could be fed directly, then discharged into a nursing home. The hospital had the advance directive but it was hidden in the middle of a thick pile of medical notes, Mrs Grant's daughter Tracy Barker said. Once in the nursing home, Mrs Grant became agitated and tried to pull out the tubes in her arm, prompting staff to put mittens on her hands. Mrs Barker said: ""She had a fear of being kept alive because she had a fear of going into a nursing home. ""She never wanted to be a burden to anybody, so she wouldn't have wanted any of us to look after her."" Brenda Grant, pictured with her grandson, ""never wanted to become a burden to anybody"" Mrs Grant did not tell her children about the living will. It was her GP who alerted them to it shortly before Mrs Grant was re-admitted to hospital. In a meeting with hospital medics, the GP then argued alongside Mrs Grant's family that her living will should be respected, Mrs Barker said.

"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against eating raw dough, batter or cake mixture because of the risk of E. coli from flour. The FDA updated its guidelines following an investigation into an E. coli outbreak in the US in 2016 where flour was found to be the cause. Cooking the flour kills any bacteria that can cause infections. The FDA says commercially made cookie dough ice-cream products are OK as manufacturers use treated flour. In 2016, dozens of people across the US were made sick by a strain of bacteria called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O121, that was linked to flour. A mill in Kansas City, Missouri, was found to be the probable source of the outbreak and ten million pounds of flour were recalled. Previously there have been warnings about eating raw dough and cake mixture due to the presence of raw eggs that can pose a risk of salmonella. The UK Food Standards Agency advises against eating raw dough ""because it may not be safe"". But Leslie Smoot, a senior adviser for the FDA, says flour alone is also a risk. ""Flour is derived from a grain that comes directly from the field and typically is not treated to kill bacteria."" Bacteria from animal waste in the field could contaminate the grain, which is then harvested and milled into flour. E. coli O121 can cause abdominal cramps and diarrhoea (often bloody) but most people recover within a week. In rare cases it can cause a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome. Young and elderly people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk of complications. The FDA says we should not eat or taste any raw biscuit dough, cake mix, batter, or any other raw dough or batter product that is supposed to be cooked or baked. They advise carefully washing hands, work surfaces and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour and raw dough products When baking with children watch out for flour spreading easily Do not give play dough made with raw flour to children In the US, restaurants and retailers have been warned not to serve raw dough to customers or provide raw dough for children to play with Keep raw foods separate from other foods while preparing them to prevent any contamination that may be present from spreading They recommend following package directions for cooking products containing flour at proper temperatures and for specified times Follow label directions to chill products containing raw dough promptly after purchase until you bake them The Food Standards Agency agrees ""it is advisable to follow manufacturers' cooking instructions when using food ingredients. Cooking food at the right temperature will ensure any harmful bacteria are killed."" 'War on E. coli superbug' announced Health Explained: What is E. coli? VideoHealth Explained: What is E. coli?

"The UK faces a ""perfect storm"" of threats that could put its entire electoral system at risk, the head of the elections watchdog has warned. Russian meddling on social media and local council cuts were just two of the factors threatening the credibility of the system, Sir John Holmes said. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Britain's electoral laws were a ""mess"" and needed to be updated. He will set out the steps he says need to be taken in a speech later. The Electoral Commission has launched an investigation into allegations of Russian interference in last year's Brexit referendum and the general election. ""It would be naive to assume that what we know happened in the US and France around their elections did not and could not happen here,"" Sir John told Today. ""And there has been evidence coming from the US inquiry that some of that activity was happening. ""What we have done is asked companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook to tell us what was happening here in the same way they did in the US."" Responding to Sir John's comments, a UK government spokesman said: ""We have one of the most robust democratic processes in the world - one that is not vulnerable to international malicious influence. However, this government is not complacent and we are already undertaking work to strengthen our electoral process and ensure it is fit for the future."" In the US, both the House and Senate intelligence committees arelooking into allegations of Russian interferencein the 2016 presidential election - something the Kremlin strongly denies. Congress hasreleased images of social media postsalleged to be Russian propaganda. Technology companies display alleged examples of Russian-backed posts to US senators Sir John, a former diplomat who has served in Moscow, said it was ""impossible"" for the Electoral Commission to ""regulate or prevent what Russia is doing"". But he wants new rules requiring political campaigners to identify themselves to give voters ""transparency about who is trying to influence them, who is paying for it"". He also wants to see photo IDs introduced at polling booths, followingallegations of voter fraud in Tower Hamlets, in east London, and other areas. Critics say the plan discriminates against people on low incomes who don't have photo IDs. But Sir John said they could be given free photo ID cards, as was already happening in Northern Ireland, where the new system is up and running. He ruled out a move to online voting, because of concerns about hacking - but he wants it to be made easier to check online whether you are registered to vote. He also wants bigger fines for political parties and campaign groups that try to get round spending limits. Sir John Holmes is a former diplomat and UN official The watchdog has repeatedly complained that it lacks the teeth to tackle abuses of the system, with Sir John warning some well resourced partiescould see fines as ""a cost of doing business""after the Conservatives were fined Â£70,000 for breaking the rules. He has also warned that cuts to local authorities could undermine the proper running of elections in the UK. June's general election had been generally well run, he said, but ""returning officers and electoral administrators face reduced resources and a growing number of skilled professionals are leaving local authority elections teams"". Prime Minister Theresa May hasaccused Russia of ""planting fake stories"" to ""sow discord in the West"", although Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPs last month he had not seen any evidence of Russian interference in the Brexit vote or general election. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh found more than 400 fake Twitter accounts attempting to influence UK politics out of 2,752 accounts suspended by Twitter in the US. The accounts were believed to have been run from the Kremlin-linked Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA). The Commons Culture Select Committee is carrying out a separate inquiry into ""fake news"", and Britain's intelligence and security watchdog isfacing calls to investigate whether Russian ""troll factories"" interfered in UK politics.,external Watchdog reopens Vote Leave probe Tories fined Â£70k over election expenses Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"US President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv has been met with a wave of disapproval. Leaders from within the Arab and Muslim worlds, and from the wider international community, were swift to criticise the move. Some warned of the potential for violence and bloodshed as a result. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel occupied the sector, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Mr Trump said his decision was a ""recognition of reality"", and that the US was ""not taking a position on any final status issues"". President Mahmoud Abbassaid the decision was tantamount to the US ""abdicating its role as a peace mediator"". ""These deplorable and unacceptable measures deliberately undermine all peace efforts,"" he said in a speech broadcast after Mr Trump's announcement. He insisted that Jerusalem was the ""eternal capital of the state of Palestine"". The leader of the Islamist movement Hamas, Ismail Haniya, called for a new ""intifada"", or uprising. ""The American decision is an aggression against our people. It's a declaration of war against our Palestinian people,"" he told a news conference in Gaza. ""We should call for and we should work on launching an intifada in the face of the Zionist enemy,"" he added. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid on Wednesday that the US announcement was a ""historic landmark"" and that Mr Trump's decision was ""courageous and just"". Mr Netanyahu said the speech was ""an important step towards peace, for there is no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel"". The city had ""been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years"", he added. In a speech on Thursday, he said: ""President Trump has inscribed himself in the annals of our capital for all time."" ""His name will now be linked to the names of others in the context of the glorious history of Jerusalem and our people... We are already in contacts with other countries that will declare similar recognition,"" he said, adding: ""It's about time."" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogancondemned the move, saying it was ""throwing the region into a ring of fire"". ""What do you want to do Mr Trump? What kind of an approach is this? Political leaders exist not to create struggles but to make peace,"" he said. His Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu wrote on Twitter that ""the decision is against international law and relevant UN resolutions"". Allow Twitter content?

Saudi Arabia's King Salmantold Mr Trump by telephone on Tuesday that the relocation of the embassy or recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital ""would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world"". On Thursday, a Saudi royal court statement called Mr Trump's decision ""unjustified and irresponsible"". ""The US move represents a significant decline in efforts to push a peace process and is a violation of the historically neutral American position on Jerusalem."" Those views were echoed byEgypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, who warned against ""complicating the situation in the region by introducing measures that would undermine chances for peace in the Middle East"". This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important TheArab Leaguecalled it ""a dangerous measure that would have repercussions"" across the region, and also questioned the future role of the US as a ""trusted mediator"" in peace talks. Iransaid the decision risked a ""new intifada"", or uprising. Its foreign ministry said the US had clearly violated international resolutions. Meanwhile,Jordan's King Abdullahcalled for joint efforts to ""deal with the ramifications of this decision"" and a Jordanian government spokesman said Mr Trump was violating international law and the UN charter. Lebanon's President Michel Aounsaid the peace process would be set back decades, whileQatar's Foreign MinisterSheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thanisaid the move was ""a death sentence for all who seek peace"". Pope Francissaid: ""I cannot silence my deep concern over the situation that has emerged in recent days. At the same time, I appeal strongly for all to respect the city's status quo, in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions."" United Nations Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterressaid President Trump's statement ""would jeopardise the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians"". Mr Guterres said Jerusalem was ""a final status issue that must be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties"". Such negotiations must take ""into account the legitimate concerns of both the Palestinians and the Israeli sides,"" he said. TheEuropean Unioncalled for the ""resumption of a meaningful peace process towards a two-state solution"" and said ""a way must be found, through negotiations, to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of both states, so that the aspiration of both parties can be fulfilled"". EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherinisaid the announcement ""has a very worrying potential impact."" ""It is a very fragile context and the announcement has the potential to send us backwards to even darker times than the ones we are already living in,"" she added. ""The worst thing that could happen now is an escalation of tensions around the holy places and in the region because what happens in Jerusalem matters to the whole region and the entire world."" French President Emmanuel Macronsaid Mr Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""regrettable"". He called efforts for ""avoid violence at all costs.""

""The British embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it,"" a statement said. ""Our position on the status of Jerusalem is clear and longstanding: it should be determined in a negotiated settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and Jerusalem should ultimately be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian states.

"There are increasing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem, the fate of which is one of the most contentious issues in the Israel-Arab conflict. The BBC's Erica Chernofsky takes a closer look at why this city is so important to Christianity, Islam and Judaism, the three religions which trace their shared origins back to the biblical figure of Abraham. Jerusalem - its name resonates in the hearts of Christians, Jews and Muslims alike and echoes through centuries of shared and disputed history. Known in Hebrew as Yerushalayim and in Arabic as al-Quds, it is one of the oldest cities in the world. It has been conquered, destroyed and rebuilt time and again, and every layer of its earth reveals a different piece of the past. This video can not be played Tour guide Shraga Ben Yosef provides a quick trip around Jerusalem's holiest sites While it has often been the focus of stories of division and conflict among people of different religions, they are united in their reverence for this holy ground. At its core is the Old City, a maze of narrow alleyways and historic architecture that characterises its four quarters - Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Armenian. It is surrounded by a fortress-like stone wall and home to some of the holiest sites in the world. Each quarter represents its own population. The Christians have two, because Armenians are also Christians, and their quarter, the smallest of the four, is one of the oldest Armenian centres in the world. It is unique in that their community has preserved its own particular culture and civilisation inside the St James Church and monastery, which comprises most of their section. Inside the Christian Quarter is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a significant focus for Christians all over the world. It is located on a site which is central to the story of Jesus, his death, crucifixion and resurrection. According to most Christian traditions, Jesus was crucified there, on Golgotha, or the hill of Calvary, his tomb is located inside the sepulchre and this was also the site of his resurrection. The church is managed jointly by representatives of different Christian denominations, mainly the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, Franciscan friars from the Roman Catholic Church and the Armenian Patriarchate, but also by the Ethiopians, Coptics and Syrian Orthodox Church. It is one of the main pilgrimage destinations for millions of Christians worldwide who visit the empty tomb of Jesus and seek solace and redemption in prayer at the site. This video can not be played Greek Orthodox Patriarch Theophilus III explains why Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the holiest place in Christianity The Muslim Quarter is the largest of the four and contains the shrine of the Dome of Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque on a plateau known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary. The mosque is the third holiest site in Islam and is under the administration of an Islamic trust called the Waqf. Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad travelled here from Mecca during his night journey and prayed with the souls of all the prophets. A few steps away, the shrine of the Dome of the Rock holds the foundation stone, where Muslims believe Muhammad then ascended to heaven. Muslims visit the holy site all year round, but every Friday during the holy month of Ramadan, hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to pray at the mosque. This video can not be played Sheikh Azzam al-Khatib al-Tamimi explains the importance of Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque to Islam The Jewish Quarter is home to the Kotel, or the Western Wall, a remnant of the retaining wall of the mount on which the Holy Temple once stood. Inside the temple was the Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in Judaism. Jews believe that this was the location of the foundation stone from which the world was created, and where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac. Many Jews believe the Dome of the Rock is the site of the Holy of Holies. Today, the Western Wall is the closest place Jews can pray to the Holy of Holies. It is managed by the Rabbi of the Western Wall and every year hosts millions of visitors. Jewish people from all over the world visit this place to pray and connect to their heritage, especially during the High Holidays.

"This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important US President Donald Trump will recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, senior administration officials have said. He is due to announce the controversial decision in a speech later. Mr Trump is also expected to approve moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but not for several years. Israel welcomes the changes but the Palestinians and Arab leaders have warned they will jeopardise any Middle East peace process. The Palestinians' UK representative, Manuel Hassassian, told the BBC the changes would be the ""kiss of death"" to the two-state peace solution and amounted to declaring war in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to comment officially but Education Minister Naftali Bennett called on other countries to follow Washington's lead. ""Jerusalem has been and always will be the eternal capital,"" he told the Jerusalem Post Diplomatic Conference. Pope Francis called for the ""status quo"" to be respected. Dialogue would only come through ""recognising the rights of all people"" in the region, he said. And UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, said he viewed the reports of what Mr Trump would say ""with concern"". How the world is reacting What makes Jerusalem so holy? Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. In recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the US becomes the first country to do so since the foundation of the state in 1948. The issue goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, who are backed by the Arab and wider Islamic world. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel annexed the sector from Jordan after the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The alternatives to a two-state solution Why settlement issue is so difficult According to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally and all countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. In recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the US could reinforce Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities. Trump administration officials said recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was seen as ""a recognition of reality"" by the US government. However, specific boundaries of the city would remain subject to a final status agreement, the official said. The status of holy sites would not be affected. Mr Trump would also direct the state department to begin the process of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem - but this could take several years as it still has to be designed and built and security concerns would need to be addressed. He originally promised the move to pro-Israel voters during his campaign for the presidency. The US officials added that the president would still sign a regular waiver blocking the embassy's move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem until the new building was completed. Successive presidents have signed waivers on the grounds of national security for the1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act,external, which mandates moving the embassy. Mr Trump has vowed to pursue a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, led by his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner. An administration official said the new US policy on Jerusalem was not designed to favour Israel in that process. Palestinian protesters burned pictures of Donald Trump on Tuesday Saudi Arabia, an ally of the US, called the new policy ""a flagrant provocation to Muslims"" Hamas leader Ismail Haniya called for protests this Friday China warned against escalating tensions in the Middle East Jordan's King Abdullah said the decision would ""undermine efforts to resume the peace process"" Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi urged Mr Trump ""not to complicate the situation in the region"" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday his country could sever ties with Israel US government employees and their families have been barred from personal travel in Jerusalem's Old City and the West Bank for security reasons ahead of expected protests. Israel's intelligence minister Israel Katz told Army Radio that Israel was ""preparing for every option"", including an outbreak of violence. France, the European Union and the Arab League have also expressed concern. Analysis by Barbara Plett-Usher, state department correspondent, BBC News By recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital President Trump is fulfilling a campaign promise. There is no other obvious reason he is doing this now. Administration officials said he would simply be acknowledging reality - that Jerusalem functions as Israel's capital. They said the decision would not determine final status issues such as boundaries and sovereignty - that is still left to negotiations. On other core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Arab and Muslim leaders may be able to work with changes in the US approach but Jerusalem is also holy land, not just a disputed capital. Jordan and Saudi Arabia are custodians of Islam's holy sites and have issued strong warnings that this move could inflame the Muslim world. There is also no indication that this is a bargaining chip to advance the peace process: according to the officials, President Trump is not expected to publicly endorse a two-state solution. It sounds like the Palestinians will get nothing. Perhaps there is a wider strategy at work but it looks like a workaround so the president can satisfy his pro-Israel voters.

"An expected announcement by President Donald Trump that the US will become the first country to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital has been dubbed a ""kiss of death"" for the Middle East peace process by the Palestinians. But an Israeli minister urged other countries to follow the US lead. Mr Trump, expected to confirm the decision later on Wednesday, described the announcement as ""long overdue"". ""Many presidents have said they want to do something and they didn't do it."" Latest updates The president's remarks came ahead of his planned speech in Washington. Mr Trump will also start the process of moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The two decisions - which would fulfil a campaign promise and appeal to Mr Trump's right-wing base - risk a heated reaction from US allies in the Muslim world and, potentially, protests and unrest. They also make it difficult for the US to be seen as a neutral mediator in the Middle East peace process. Pope Francis called for the status quo in Jerusalem to be respected, in line with United Nations resolutions. Donald Trump - seen here in Jerusalem in May - spoke to regional leaders by telephone ahead of the announcement Israel occupied East Jerusalem, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and until now all countries have maintained their embassies in Tel Aviv.

Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. If the US recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it will put it out of step with the rest of the international community and reinforce Israel's position that settlements in the east are valid Israeli communities.

However, specific boundaries of the city would remain subject to a final status agreement, the officials said. The status of holy sites would not be affected. What makes Jerusalem so holy?

Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett described it as a ""big step towards regional peace"" and said other countries should move their embassies too. Theresa May said she would speak to Mr Trump about the US move. The UK's position on Jerusalem had not changed, the prime minister told Parliament. The city's status should be the subject of negotiation and it should be the shared capital of Israel and a Palestinian state, she added. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the step would ""play into the hands of terror groups"". The BBC's Barbara Plett-Usher, in Washington, says Mr Trump is expected to try and calm international alarm by stating that the US is prepared to support a two-state solution, if both Israelis and Palestinians agree to it. But that is not the categorical endorsement of a two-state solution that the Palestinians are looking for, our correspondent adds. Palestinian protesters burned pictures of Donald Trump on Tuesday Saudi Arabia, an ally of the US, called the new policy ""a flagrant provocation to Muslims"" Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said recognition crossed ""all red lines"" China warned against escalating tensions in the Middle East Jordan's King Abdullah said the decision would ""undermine efforts to resume the peace process"" Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi urged Mr Trump ""not to complicate the situation in the region"" Turkey called for a summit of Muslim countries in December to discuss the developments Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said ""Muslims must stand united against this major plot"" Analysis by Yolande Knell, BBC News, Jerusalem Israeli leaders will see Mr Trump's announcements as correcting an historic injustice. It has long been a source of frustration that the US, Israel's closest ally, does not have its embassy in Jerusalem or formally recognise Israeli sovereignty over the city - which is the seat of its government and has 3,000 years of Jewish history. But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - like other Arab leaders -  is warning Mr Trump's moves will jeopardise efforts to broker peace talks and achieve what he has called the ""ultimate deal"". The Palestinians want occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and in the past even small changes - particularly at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount - have led to violence. Already the Islamist group Hamas has warned that the US could trigger a new Palestinian uprising.

"The bone claimed to be from St Nicholas has been radio carbon tested for the first time A fragment of bone claimed to be from St Nicholas - the 4th-Century saintly inspiration for Father Christmas - has been radio carbon tested by the University of Oxford. The test has found that the relic does date from the time of St Nicholas, who is believed to have died about 343AD. While not providing proof that this is from the saint, it has been confirmed as authentically from that era. The Oxford team says these are the first tests carried out on the bones. Relics of St Nicholas, who died in modern-day Turkey, have been kept in the crypt of a church in Bari in Italy since the 11th Century. But the popularity of the saint, and the associations with Christmas, have seen many fragments of bones being taken to other locations, raising questions about how many of these are authentic. The tests in Oxford have been carried out on a fragment of pelvis, which had been in a church in France and is currently owned by a priest, Father Dennis O'Neill, from Illinois in the United States. St Nicholas figures meeting in southern Germany this week, at the start of the Christmas season The radio carbon dating tests, for the Oxford Relics Cluster at Keble College's Advanced Studies Centre, have confirmed that the bone is from the correct era for St Nicholas. Prof Tom Higham, a director of the centre, says this is unlike many such relics which often turn out to be much later inventions. ""This bone fragment, in contrast, suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself,"" says the Oxford archaeologist. There are hundreds of other bones claimed to be from St Nicholas, including a collection in a church in Venice. And the researchers now want to use DNA testing to see how many bones are really from a single individual - and how many might be linked to the bone tested in Oxford. The Oxford team are interested in whether the part of the pelvis they have tested matches the relics in Bari, where the collection does not include a full pelvis. Dr Georges Kazan, co-director of the centre at Keble College, says: ""It is exciting to think that these relics, which date from such an ancient time, could in fact be genuine."" For the researchers, this might seem like Christmas has come early. But the findings cannot provide evidence that this is definitely from the real St Nicholas. ""Science is not able to definitely prove that it is, it can only prove that it is not, however,"" says Prof Higham.

"Israel's prime minister has vowed never to remove settlements again The issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem has long been a major source of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, and most of the international community. The Trump administration has now, however, stated that settlements are not inconsistent with international law. Here is a brief guide to what it is all about. Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. This includes the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The West Bank and East Jerusalem had previously been occupied by Jordan since the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli War. According to the Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now, there are 132 settlements and 113 outposts,external- settlements built without official authorisation - in the West Bank. The group says more than 413,000 settlers live there, with numbers increasing year on year. It says there are 13 settlements in East Jerusalem, inhabited by about 215,000 settlers. Israel also established settlements in the Gaza Strip, seized from Egypt in the 1967 war, but it dismantled them when it withdrew from the territory in 2005. It also built settlements in the Sinai Peninsula, seized too from Egypt in 1967, but removed them in 1982 as part of a peace agreement with Cairo. There are also dozens of settlements on the occupied Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 war. Built-up settlement areas occupy about 2% of the West Bank butcritics point out that the land controlled by settlement activity, such as agriculture and roads, amounts to much more than that,externaland requires a heavy military presence. Settlers themselves choose to live in these communities for a range of reasons - from economic, encouraged by government subsidies, to religious, based on the belief that God gave the land to the Jewish people. What happens with settlements has proven to be one of the most intractable issues between Israel and the Palestinians, and rows about them have caused the collapse of numerous rounds of peace talks. There are dozens of unauthorised settlements, known as outposts, across the West Bank Palestinians say the presence of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land they seek for a future state - make such a state with contiguous territory impossible. They have demanded Israel freeze all settlement activity as a precondition for resuming peace talks. Palestinians' freedom of movement is also restricted by hundreds of checkpoints, roadblocks and other obstacles used to protect both settlements and Israel from militants. This video can not be played Is Palestinian-Israel peace plan out of reach? Israel says the Palestinians are using the issue of settlements as a pretext to avoid direct talks. Under the 1993 Israel-Palestinian Oslo peace accords, the issue of settlements was to be deferred until final status talks - a reason why Israel objects to pre-conditions and UN resolutions on the matter. In two words - a lot. From the beginning of his presidency in January 2017, Donald Trump has displayed a much more tolerant attitude towards settlement activity than his predecessor, Barack Obama. Donald Trump has rarely criticised Israeli settlement activity Up until Mr Trump took office, the US had described the settlements as ""illegitimate"", refraining from calling them ""illegal"" since the Carter administration in 1980. Are there alternatives to a two-state solution? A UN Security Council resolution in December 2016 said settlements had ""no legal validity,externaland constitute[d] a flagrant violation under international law"". However, like previous resolutions on Israel, those adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter are not legally binding. On 18 November 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration was reversing the stance of the previous administration. ""The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law,"" Mr Pompeo said. The Trump administration has also overturned decades of US policy by recognising Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights - to the outrage of Palestinians - making the future of Jewish settlements there much more secure. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also gone further than ever before by declaring his intention to effectively annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as well as the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea in the eastern West Bank, without fear of rebuke by the US. According to media reports, the plan is consistent with Mr Trump's vision for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, expected to be released in the near future. The Palestinians have warned that if Israel extends sovereignty to the settlements, it will kill the peace process. Even if agreement could be reached on settlements in the West Bank, the issue of settlements in East Jerusalem is even more thorny. Israel does not regard places like Har Homa in East Jerusalem as settlements Israel regards East Jerusalem as its eternal, indivisible capital and does not consider the sector in any way occupied - and by extension, it does not regard Jewish neighbourhoods there as settlements. Israel officially extended sovereignty over East Jerusalem in 1980, in a move not accepted internationally until Washington broke rank and recognised the whole of Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017. Only Guatemala and Honduras have followed suit (Paraguay did, but reversed its decision). It looks increasingly likely. For years, Israel said it was prepared to make ""painful concessions"" for peace - code for withdrawal from occupied territory and an accompanying removal of some smaller settlements. It previously demolished settlements in Sinai and Gaza, and four small sites in the West Bank in 2005, during pull-outs. Israel demolished its settlements in Gaza before it withdrew in 2005 While Israel and the Palestinians agreed to decide upon the fate of existing settlements, and Jerusalem, in the final stage of peace talks, the chances of reaching that point seem further away than ever. Mr Netanyahu has crystallised his position, vowing never to dismantle settlements - and if he follows through with his plan to annex them, it will effectively take the issue off the table as far as Israel is concerned. Most of the international community, including the UN and the International Court of Justice, say the settlements are illegal. The basis for this is the1949 Fourth Geneva Convention,externalwhich forbids the transfer by an occupying power of its people to occupied territory. Israel and the UN have repeatedly clashed over the issue of settlements However, Israel says the Fourth Geneva Convention does not apply de jure to the West Bank because, it says, the territory is not technically occupied. Israel says it is legally there as a result of a defensive war, and did not take control of the West Bank from a legitimate sovereign power. It says the legal right of Jewish settlement there as recognised by the 1922 League of Nations Mandate for Palestine was preserved under the UN's charter.

"Selfridges at Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre Shopping centre owner Hammerson, which owns Birmingham's famous Bullring, has agreed a Â£3.4bn takeover of rival Intu. The deal will create the UK's biggest property company, worth Â£21bn. Intu owns the Lakeside shopping centre, in Essex. and the Trafford Centre, in Manchester, while Hammerson owns Bicester Village designer outlet and London's Brent Cross shopping centre. Shares in Intu jumped by nearly 19% on the news, while Hammerson's fell by 3%. At market close, Intu shares were trading up 13.6% at 226p, while Hammerson's was down 6.2% to trade at 501.5p. The combined group plans to target fast growing markets in Spain and Ireland. John Strachan, chairman of Intu, said: ""Intu offers high-quality retail and leisure destinations in the UK and Spain, which, when merged with Hammerson's own top-quality assets in the UK, in France and in Ireland, present a highly attractive proposition for retailers and shoppers in Europe's leading cities."" Hammerson chairman David Tyler said: ""This transaction will deliver real value for shareholders. The financial strength of the enlarged group and its strong leadership team will make it well-placed to take advantage of higher growth opportunities on a pan-European scale."" Hammerson shareholders will own 55% of the combined firm and Intu investors the rest. Shareholders will vote on the deal next year. The combined group would be led by Hammerson chief executive David Atkins and chaired by Mr Tyler. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, described Hammerson's takeover of Intu as ""dramatic, given how terribly Intu's shares have gone down this year, amid fears over not just what Brexit may do to consumer confidence but also the fate of bricks-and-mortar retailers at the hands of Amazon and other online rivals"". The union of Hammerson and Intu - the company formerly known as Capital Shopping Centres - has been the Holy Grail of property investment for more than a decade. The relative underperformance on Intu shares, which have at times traded at a discount to book value as high as 50%, has brought an opportunity for David Atkins, Hammerson's ambitious chief executive. The other key factor was the willingness of John Whittaker, the secretive billionaire who was the big shareholder in Intu, to come to the table. The end result is a shopping centre monster - Â£21bn worth of assets across Europe - that will quickly weed out underperforming properties once the deal is done. GlobalData retail analyst Sofie Willmott said the deal would give the combined group a stake in 12 of the 20 UK super-malls - large shopping centres of more than 20 million sq ft that attract more than 20 million customers a year. This ""dominance"" would ""bolster the group's negotiating power with both retailers and leisure operators"", she added, and help Hammerson to compete better with rival Westfield. According to GlobalData forecasts, spending growth in supermalls is due to outstrip overall spending growth in bricks-and-mortar stores over the next five years. Ms Willmott said she expected the enlarged group to ""prioritise"" supermall development. ""As clothing and footwear retailers focus on super-malls to create large-scale, experience-led stores, physical retail spend will move away from town centres towards destination shopping centres, ensuring supermalls space is hot property,"" she said. ""The proposed deal will net the group a stake in almost 60% of all UK supermalls space, making it a force in the retail landscape, well placed to benefit from retail spend shifting across locations.""

"Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman (left) and Mohammad Aqib Imran appeared at Westminster at Magistrates' Court A man has been remanded in custody after appearing in court accused of a plot to bomb Downing Street's security gates and then kill Theresa May. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, from north London, planned to detonate a homemade bomb and attack the PM with a suicide vest and a knife. A second man also appeared in court charged with preparing terrorist acts. Both men will appear at London's Old Bailey on 20 December. Mr Rahman is charged with the preparation of terrorist acts and is also charged with assisting another man to prepare separate acts of terrorism. The second charge relates to allegedly helping Mohammad Aqib Imran, 21, from Birmingham, who is accused is charged with preparing acts of terrorism. He is alleged to have taken several steps in an attempt to travel to Libya. That included saving money, trying to secure a false passport, and researching extremist ideologies and travel options. The men were arrested by Metropolitan Police officers on 28 November within 90 minutes of one another. The men arrived at court in a police van During the seven minute hearing, the men - dressed in light grey sweatshirts and trousers - confirmed their names, addresses and dates of birth. Mr Rahman gave his nationality as Bangladeshi-British, while Mr Imran gave his as Pakistani-British. Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot remanded the men in custody ahead of the Old Bailey appearance. The magistrates' court appearances comes a day after a security review said it was ""conceivable"" that the Manchester Arena bombing in May, in which 22 people were killed, could have been prevented. But MI5 chief Andrew Parker told Mrs May and the Cabinet on Tuesday that about nine alleged Islamist terror plots have been foiled since March.

"Hallyday broke from France's classic ""chanson"" tradition in the 1950s, starting singing rock and roll in French France's biggest rock star Johnny Hallyday has died after a battle with lung cancer. He was 74. The singer sold about 100 million records and starred in a number of films in a career that began in 1960. He was made a Chevalier of the Legion D'Honneur by President Jacques Chirac in 1997. The French simply called him ""Our Johnny"". However, outside the Francophone zone, Hallyday was virtually unknown. In a statement, his wife Laeticia said: ""Johnny Hallyday has left us. I write these words without believing them. But yet, it's true. My man is no longer with us. ""He left us tonight as he lived his whole life, with courage and dignity."" How France saw itself in Johnny Hallyday Hallyday, whose real name was Jean-Philippe Smet, decided he wanted to be a singer after seeing Elvis Presley on screen in 1957. Hallyday was nicknamed the ""French Presley"" by his numerous fans. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

His children, Laura and David, wrote a joint statement, saying: ""Today we lost our father,"" and thanking fans for the outpouring of support. ""Our pain is immense,"" they said. That sentiment was echoed by Laura's mother, Nathalie Baye, who posted an empty black square to Instagram with the single line caption: ""My grief is immense."" Reacting to the news, French President Emmanuel Macron referenced the title of a recent tribute album by saying: ""There is a little bit of Johnny in all of us."" He added: ""Across generations, he carved himself into the lives of French people. He charmed them through the generosity you saw in his concerts: so epic, so intimate, in huge venues, in small spots."" Other French politicians followed suit, including former presidents FranÃ§ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, and former Prime Minister Alain JuppÃ©. The story of a French rock phenomenon Johnny Hallyday: Life in pictures Can we learn to love 'le pop'? Fans gathered outside the star's home in the town of Marnes-la-Coquette, west of Paris. Speaking to the AFP news agency, one fan said: ""My heart is in two, my heart is broken."" He added that he had hoped to see 1,000 of Johnny's concerts. Another, Michele, told reporters: ""He was a great love of my youth... he always rocked me. I've always loved this man. ""It's an homage to show him, if he still sees us, that I still love him and I'll always love him."" Tributes also rolled in from his peers in the entertainment industry. French film icon of the 1950s and 60s, Brigitte Bardot, wrote that she was ""in shock"". ""Johnny is a monument. He is France,"" she said in a social media post alongside a photo of her hugging the singer. Among those outside of France to pay tribute was American guitarist Lenny Kravitz. Allow Twitter content?

Heavily influenced by Elvis, Hallyday broke from France's classic ""chanson"" tradition in the 1950s and began singing rock and roll in French. ""He introduced rock and roll to France. He's one of the few singers about whom people say that he's an animal on stage,"" journalist Philippe Le Corre once said. ""He's quite incredible. People of all ages like him,"" he added. Despite his success at home, he failed to crack the lucrative American or any English-speaking market. The USA Today newspaper once described him as ""the greatest rock star you never heard of"". Hallyday was known for his hard work and almost non-stop touring. But he was also famous for his wild rock star antics, both on and off stage.

"Ray Dolby died in 2013 at the age of 80 The family of sound pioneer Ray Dolby has donated Â£85m from his estate to Cambridge University. The US-born engineer was best known for his work in developing noise reduction and surround-sound technology. He died in 2013 aged 80. The donation will go to the Department of Physics' Cavendish Laboratory where Dr Dolby worked on his PhD in 1961. It is the second largest gift to the university in its 808-year history afterBill Gates,externaldonated $210m in 2000. Ray Dolby gained a PhD in physics from Pembroke College, Cambridge Dr Dolby came to Cambridge as a Marshall Scholar in 1957 and studied physics at Pembroke College which itselfreceived Â£35m from his estate in 2015. The bequest will complete the redevelopment of the Cavendish Laboratory, known asCav III,external, with the Ray Dolby Centre set to open in 2021/22. A research group and a professorship in physics will also be named in honour of the inventor. Read more Cambridgeshire stories here Professor Andy Parker, head of the Cavendish, said: ""In addition to serving as a home for physics research at Cambridge, it will be a top-class facility for the nation. ""This gift is the most significant investment in physics research in generations."" The money will go towards development of the new Cavendish Laboratory, which specialises in physics Dr Dolby's widow, Dagmar, said the university played a pivotal role in his life ""both professionally and personally"". Cambridge Vice-Chancellor Professor Stephen Toope also described the donation as ""a fitting tribute to Ray Dolby's legacy"". ""His research paved the way for an entire industry,"" he said. ""A century from now, we can only speculate on which discoveries will alter the way we live our lives and which new industries will have been born in the Cavendish Laboratory, in large part thanks to this extraordinarily generous gift."" The multimillion-pound donation also pushes Cambridge University's Â£2bn fundraising campaign - which was launched in 2015 - over the halfway mark.

"Dorothea Bate was born at Napier House in Carmarthen The woman believed to be the first to be employed as a scientist at London's Natural History Museum has had a blue plaque dedicated in her home town. Dorothea Bate, born in 1878, had little formal education but a fascination with wildlife and nature prompted her to leave Carmarthenshire aged 19 and ask for a job at the museum. She spent more than 50 years there and led expeditions around the world. The plaque was unveiled at Napier House in Carmarthen where she was born. Ms Bates became an expert in archaeozoology, the study of animal remains, and her largest discoveries included fossilised elephants and the bones of a giant tortoise in Bethlehem. The plaque will be dedicated by paleobiologist Tori Herridge at a ceremony organised by Carmarthen Civic Society at 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. Dr Herridge said: ""She's pretty special - can you imagine in 1898 marching up to the museum and asking to see the curator of birds? ""I hope anybody who walks past Napier House and looks at that blue plaque, it makes them think 'that's interesting, who is she?' ""Little signs might open people's minds up to a world they weren't previously aware of."" 11-year-old girl wins science prize Lonely at the top for women scientists Where are the female Nobel Prize winners? Dorothea Bate (centre) with Sir Temi Zammit and Dr Joseph Baldacchino at the National Museum in Valletta, Malta, in April 1934 Ms Bate's first job at the museum was classifying bird skins, but the focus of what became her life's work was exploring how and why different species adapt and change. She studied fossils and was fascinated by archaeology which led her to specialise in archaeozoology. Dr Herridge said her work at the museum came from a passion for the natural world that her upbringing afforded ""the money and freedom to explore"". ""She was very self-confident, very clever and very determined and totally and deeply interested in the subject she wanted to study."" Ms Bate's expeditions took her as far afield as Cyprus, Malta, Crete, China and Palestine, from where her finds were taken back to the museum in Kensington. Contrary to what people might expect, Dr Herridge said when Ms Bate was in Crete in 1904, she was one of three female scientists involved in excavations. During World War Two, Ms Bate worked in the zoological branch of the museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, and became its officer in charge.

"Kamal Ahmed and Tina Daheley will help mentor students The BBC is launching a new scheme to help young people identify real news and filter out fake or false information. The project is targeted at secondary schools and sixth forms across the UK. From March, up to 1,000 schools will be offered mentoring in class and online to help them spot so-called fake news. BBC journalists including Kamal Ahmed, Tina Daheley, Amol Rajan and Huw Edwards will also take part in events aimed at helping students. Amol Rajan: Teaching fact from fiction James Harding, the director of BBC News, said: ""This is an attempt to go into schools to speak to young people and give them the equipment they need to distinguish between what's true and what's false."" The move follows a year-long study, conducted by the University of Salford in conjunction with BBC Newsround, looking athow well children aged between nine and 14 can spot false information. Although most of the children from across all age groups said they knew what fake news was, many of them could not always distinguish between fake and real stories when presented with them. BBC Director of News James Harding: ""Some information is downright lies."" The term ""fake news"" was popularised by Donald Trump during his presidential election campaign last year. He used the term to denigrate the output of the traditional news media, although it is also used to describe news stories that achieve significant traction despite being palpably false. Recent examples include a satirical story claiming that the Pope had endorsed Trump for president, which was widely circulated as an established fact. The issue surfaced again this month when the President retweeted three inflammatory videos from a British far-right group whose authenticity was subsequently challenged. In November, The Independent - now an online newspaper - streamed a video ""live from space"" that turned out to be footage recorded in 2015. In July, meanwhile, a Facebook Live videopurporting to show a stormwas outed by social media users as a gif. ""I think that people are getting the news all over the place - there's more information than ever before,"" said Harding. ""But, as we know, some of it is old news, some of it is half truths. Some of it is just downright lies. And it's harder than ever when you look at those information feeds to discern what's true and what's not. ""But there are 'tells', there are ways that you can look at your news feed and identify a story that's true and a story that's not. ""And we think that's a skill that enables people to make good choices about the information they get and good choices in their lives."" Last month a surveyby media watchdog Ofcom,externalfound almost three quarters of children aged between 12 and 15 were aware of so-called ""fake news"" and that half of them has read a story they suspected of being false. The BBC has set up a mailing list for those interested in finding out more about the project. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Christine Keeler worked as a model in the 1960s Christine Keeler, the model embroiled in the 1963 Profumo affair, has died aged 75, her son has said. Seymour Platt said Ms Keeler had been ill for several months,externalwith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He told the BBC: ""She was always a fighter, but sadly lost the final fight against a terrible lung disease."" She became famous for her part in the scandal, which shook Harold Macmillan's government, but her son said that fame came ""at a huge personal price"". At the height of the Cold War, the-then teenager claimed she had an affair with Conservative cabinet minister John Profumo. She also claimed to be in a relationship with a Russian diplomat - Eugene Ivanov, an assistant naval attachÃ© at the Soviet Embassy - at the same time. Obituary: Christine Keeler John Profumo 'had relationship with Nazi spy' Mr Profumo was forced to resign after lying about the affair to Parliament and the scandal is considered to have contributed to the fall of the Macmillan government. Ms Keeler's family said she died on Monday at 23:30 GMT at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington, south-east London. Paying tribute to his mother, Mr Platt told the BBC: ""She earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price."" ""And regardless, we are all very proud of who she was to the end,"" he added. Douglas Thompson, the journalist and author who worked with Ms Keeler on her memoir The Truth At Last, paid tribute to a ""funny and bright"" woman, whom he described as ""one of the most honest people I have ever met"". ""She believed absolutely everything she ever said about the Profumo affair,"" he said. ""She said what she thought,"" he continued. ""I think that honesty is very surprising."" He described Ms Keeler as a ""victim of the time"", adding that she would probably have had her own TV show had the scandal happened today. ""The interesting thing about her is she tried to escape it,"" he said. ""I don't think she ever got away from it - that was a tragedy."" ""She could never stop being Christine Keeler,"" he added. In 1963, Mr Profumo told the House of Commons he and Ms Keeler were ""on friendly terms"" and there was ""no impropriety"" in their relationship, after opposition MPs voiced concerns about national security implications. Eventually he admitted lying to the house and resigned as Secretary of State for War and from the Commons. Ms Keeler was briefly married twice, with both ending in divorce. She had two sons. The Profumo affair will be the subject of a BBC One drama which begins filming next year.

"Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman (left) and Mohammad Aqib Imran appeared at Westminster at Magistrates' Court A man has been remanded in custody after appearing in court accused of a plot to bomb Downing Street's security gates and then kill Theresa May. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 20, from north London, planned to detonate a homemade bomb and attack the PM with a suicide vest and a knife. A second man also appeared in court charged with preparing terrorist acts. Both men will appear at London's Old Bailey on 20 December. Mr Rahman is charged with the preparation of terrorist acts and is also charged with assisting another man to prepare separate acts of terrorism. The second charge relates to allegedly helping Mohammad Aqib Imran, 21, from Birmingham, who is accused is charged with preparing acts of terrorism. He is alleged to have taken several steps in an attempt to travel to Libya. That included saving money, trying to secure a false passport, and researching extremist ideologies and travel options. The men were arrested by Metropolitan Police officers on 28 November within 90 minutes of one another. The men arrived at court in a police van During the seven minute hearing, the men - dressed in light grey sweatshirts and trousers - confirmed their names, addresses and dates of birth. Mr Rahman gave his nationality as Bangladeshi-British, while Mr Imran gave his as Pakistani-British. Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot remanded the men in custody ahead of the Old Bailey appearance. The magistrates' court appearances comes a day after a security review said it was ""conceivable"" that the Manchester Arena bombing in May, in which 22 people were killed, could have been prevented. But MI5 chief Andrew Parker told Mrs May and the Cabinet on Tuesday that about nine alleged Islamist terror plots have been foiled since March.

"Nissan's Easy Ride could launch in Japan in early 2020s Carmaker Nissan plans to test self-driving taxis on Japanese roads from March next year. The company is partnering with Japanese software company DeNA, which operates online services for the gaming, healthcare and automotive industries. It will adapt a Nissan Leaf electric car, which passengers will summon using an app. Nissan joins a growing band of carmakers trialling self-drive cars, including General Motors and Volvo. The free trials will be held over a two-week period in March in Yokohama. The Easy Ride system could be launched in Japan in the early 2020s. ""With 'more freedom of mobility' as its concept, Easy Ride is envisioned as a service for anyone who wants to travel freely to their destination of choice in a robo-vehicle,"" Nissan said in a statement. ""The goal is to allow customers to use a dedicated mobile app to complete the whole process, from setting destinations and summoning vehicles to paying the fare."" During tests, there will be a staff member in the driver's seat to comply with Japanese law. Customers, who can apply from now until 15 January, can select local destinations and sightseeing routes. Meanwhile, Japanese robotics maker ZMP is working with a Tokyo taxi operator to develop self-driving taxis for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

"Hallyday broke from France's classic ""chanson"" tradition in the 1950s, starting singing rock and roll in French France's biggest rock star Johnny Hallyday has died after a battle with lung cancer. He was 74. The singer sold about 100 million records and starred in a number of films in a career that began in 1960. He was made a Chevalier of the Legion D'Honneur by President Jacques Chirac in 1997. The French simply called him ""Our Johnny"". However, outside the Francophone zone, Hallyday was virtually unknown. In a statement, his wife Laeticia said: ""Johnny Hallyday has left us. I write these words without believing them. But yet, it's true. My man is no longer with us. ""He left us tonight as he lived his whole life, with courage and dignity."" How France saw itself in Johnny Hallyday Hallyday, whose real name was Jean-Philippe Smet, decided he wanted to be a singer after seeing Elvis Presley on screen in 1957. Hallyday was nicknamed the ""French Presley"" by his numerous fans. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

His children, Laura and David, wrote a joint statement, saying: ""Today we lost our father,"" and thanking fans for the outpouring of support. ""Our pain is immense,"" they said. That sentiment was echoed by Laura's mother, Nathalie Baye, who posted an empty black square to Instagram with the single line caption: ""My grief is immense."" Reacting to the news, French President Emmanuel Macron referenced the title of a recent tribute album by saying: ""There is a little bit of Johnny in all of us."" He added: ""Across generations, he carved himself into the lives of French people. He charmed them through the generosity you saw in his concerts: so epic, so intimate, in huge venues, in small spots."" Other French politicians followed suit, including former presidents FranÃ§ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo, and former Prime Minister Alain JuppÃ©. The story of a French rock phenomenon Johnny Hallyday: Life in pictures Can we learn to love 'le pop'? Fans gathered outside the star's home in the town of Marnes-la-Coquette, west of Paris. Speaking to the AFP news agency, one fan said: ""My heart is in two, my heart is broken."" He added that he had hoped to see 1,000 of Johnny's concerts. Another, Michele, told reporters: ""He was a great love of my youth... he always rocked me. I've always loved this man. ""It's an homage to show him, if he still sees us, that I still love him and I'll always love him."" Tributes also rolled in from his peers in the entertainment industry. French film icon of the 1950s and 60s, Brigitte Bardot, wrote that she was ""in shock"". ""Johnny is a monument. He is France,"" she said in a social media post alongside a photo of her hugging the singer. Among those outside of France to pay tribute was American guitarist Lenny Kravitz. Allow Twitter content?

Heavily influenced by Elvis, Hallyday broke from France's classic ""chanson"" tradition in the 1950s and began singing rock and roll in French. ""He introduced rock and roll to France. He's one of the few singers about whom people say that he's an animal on stage,"" journalist Philippe Le Corre once said. ""He's quite incredible. People of all ages like him,"" he added. Despite his success at home, he failed to crack the lucrative American or any English-speaking market. The USA Today newspaper once described him as ""the greatest rock star you never heard of"". Hallyday was known for his hard work and almost non-stop touring. But he was also famous for his wild rock star antics, both on and off stage. Heavy drinking, drug-taking and five marriages all contributed a sometimes chaotic lifestyle. Can we learn to love 'le pop'?

"This video can not be played Los Angeles wildfires force thousands to evacuate Some 27,000 residents were forced to flee their homes in the middle of the night as a fast-moving wildfire ripped through southern California. Several thousand homes are under mandatory evacuation in the cities of Ventura and Santa Paula, some 70 miles (115 km) north of Los Angeles. Firefighters warned the fire was moving so fast they were unable to contain it. Fanned by high winds, the fire swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. California Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Ventura County, promising to attack the fire ""with all we've got"". It was earlier reported that one person died in a traffic accident while trying to flee the blaze, but Ventura County Fire Capt Steve Kaufmann has since told the Associated Press that no body was found in an overturned car. Officials said one firefighter was injured. They also said 150 structures had been destroyed, and more than 260,000 people were without power. Hundreds of firefighters worked through the night to tackle the blaze, named the Thomas Fire, but fire chiefs admitted they were fighting a losing battle. ""The prospects for containment are not good. Really, Mother Nature is going to decide,"" Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen earlier told reporters. More than 1,000 firefighters are now battling the fires, which have burned 45,500 acres.Authorities have warned of widespread smoke and advised people with health conditions, the elderly and children to stay indoors in affected areas.,external Forecasters say ferocious Santa Ana winds and low humidity will continue for a few days, making for extremely dangerous conditions.

Residents of Santa Paula and Ventura received mandatory evacuation notices via their phones and from emergency workers going house to house. ""My son is a firefighter and I'm not going to wait around for someone to rescue me,"" June Byrum told CBS, saying her 91-year-old father, husband and dog had already left for a safe place. Santa Paula has 30,000 residents, while Ventura's population is about 110,000. Both are in Ventura County. Another fire broke out early on Tuesday local time closer to Los Angeles, in Sylmar. Homes have been damaged and more than 400 firefighters have been deployed there. The Ventura County fire is believed to have broken out close to Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula at some time after 18:00 local time on Monday (02:00 GMT). It was quickly fanned by gusts of up to 70mph (115 kph) that burned through dry brush. California has been hit hard by wildfires in recent months.

"The artist was congratulated by presenter Goldie and Tate director Maria Balshaw Lubaina Himid has become the oldest winner of the Turner Prize, and the first black woman to pick up the art award. The 63-year-old Zanzibar-born, Preston-based artist won the Â£25,000 prize for work addressing racial politics and the legacy of slavery. The judges praised her ""uncompromising tackling of issues including colonial history and how racism persists today"". She was named the winner at a ceremony in Hull, currently UK City of Culture. This video can not be played Lubaina Himid talks to the BBC about her win Described in Februaryby the Daily Telegraph,externalas ""the under-appreciated hero of black British art"", Himid made her name in the 1980s as one of the leaders of the British black arts movement - both painting and curating exhibitions of similarly overlooked artists. But she has now got the recognition she deserves. Her section of the Turner Prize exhibition in Hull contains work from the 1980s to today, including wooden figures, pottery and newspapers that she has painted on. The centrepiece is 1987's A Fashionable Marriage, based on William Hogarth's Marriage A-la Mode, which features a cast of cut-out characters including a flirting Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Himid's 1987 work A Fashionable Marriage was inspired by William Hogarth There are also porcelain dinner sets, found in junk shops. Himid has painted images of black slaves on some and aristocrats - some of whom are vomiting at the news of the abolition of slavery - on others. She has also painted over parts of newspaper pages to show how they ""used black people in a very subtle way which could be said to undermine their identity."" She is professor of contemporary art at the University of Central Lancashire and was made an MBE in 2010 for services to black women's art. She painted over pages of the Guardian in a comment on the way black people are depicted in the media The Turner Prize panel said they admired Himid's ""expansive and exuberant approach to painting which combines satire and a sense of theatre"". They also said they ""acknowledged her role as an influential curator and educator who continues to speak urgently to the moment"". Turner Prize is 'most diverse to date' Has the Turner Prize gone mainstream? Black artists break Turner age barrier This painting was inspired by the story of a slave ship on which all but one slave went blind Himid said she was ""thrilled"" to win, and thanked a list of long-time supporters in her acceptance speech. She said: ""To the art and cultural historians who cared enough to write essays about my work for decades - thank you, you gave me sustenance in the wilderness years."" Images relating to the slave trade painted on a 100-piece dinner service Lubaina Himid's Turner win is being put down to the well-documented rule change that did away with its 50-or-younger age restriction, which had been in place since 1991. Clearly, the 63-year-old artist wouldn't - couldn't - have won without the removal of the age cap. But there was another, less publicised rule change this year that also benefited her. For the first time the jurors were allowed to take into account the work each artist displayed in the Turner Prize exhibition. ""What?"" you may ask. ""Hasn't that always been the case? Why wouldn't they take the exhibition the public see - and therefore judge by - into account?"" Goodness knows why, but they didn't. Which might help explain some of the previous winners, and certainly makes sense of Himid receiving the contemporary art award for an exhibition packed with work she made some time ago. Her tableau A Fashionable Marriage, a satirical and political 1980s take on a scene from Hogarth's 18th Century series Marriage A-la Mode, was the single best work of art in the entire Turner Prize exhibition. It would have been a worthy winner when she made it in 1986 and - thanks to the rule change - it was a worthy winner last night. Speaking to BBC News afterwards, Himid said some of the art establishment was now catching up with her. ""I was overlooked by critics, by press, but I was never overlooked by art historians or curators or other artists,"" she said. She said her win probably wouldn't change people's perspectives and attitudes, but added: ""I think it will get people talking, which is the point of my work."" Asked how she would spend the Â£25,000 cheque, she said: ""I spend quite a lot of my money working with other artists, sometimes asking them to make things or helping them to make things when maybe they didn't get a grant or whatever. ""So I'll do a bit of that. And I'll buy some shoes."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

After a change in the rules, this was the first time since 1991 that artists over the age of 50 were eligible for the prize, which used to be infamous for rewarding outrageous YBAs [Young British Artists]. As well as Himid, 52-year-old Birmingham painter Hurvin Anderson made it on to this year's shortlist. Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired this year's jury, said there was a desire to celebrate artists who had previously been neglected by the mainstream. And there was a very international feel to the shortlist, which also included Stuttgart-born Andrea Buttner and film-maker Rosalind Nashashibi, who was born in Croydon to Palestinian-Irish parents. Their work is on show at the Ferens art gallery in Hull until 7 January. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Banks should end all unauthorised overdraft charges because they are trapping people in persistent debt, the financial charity StepChange has said. The organisation also wants banks and regulators to do more to identify people caught up in a ""vicious cycle of borrowing"". Even where customers have admitted they are in trouble, it said banks often fail to help. However, High Street banks said they were committed to lending responsibly. In 2016 some 2.1 million people used their overdraft every month of the year, according to industry figures. Unplanned overdraft fees could be banned Lloyds abolishes unplanned overdraft fees The UK's biggest bank, Lloyds, has already abolished charges for unplanned overdrafts. Customers of Barclays cannot get an unauthorised overdraft, but they can apply for ""emergency lending"". However others, including Santander, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest still offer unplanned borrowing. Santander charges up to Â£95 for each month a customer is overdrawn. RBS, NatWest and HSBC have a cap of Â£80 a month. As part of its study into high cost credit the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was considering a ban on charges for unplanned overdrafts - but it is not due to report until 2018. Half of StepChange's clients have overdrafts and each owe an average of Â£1,722. They often use their overdrafts to pay off household bills, so end up in a cycle of debt. Callum Bell told the BBC he is spending more time worrying about debt Callum Bell, a mental health nurse from north-eastern England, is reliant on borrowing to boost his income. ""Every month I'm dipping a little bit more into my overdraft,"" he told the BBC. ""Over Christmas it's even more difficult. ""I spend more time worrying about my finances and I'm not alone in this. It's a problem across the country."" Banks also insist on giving customers large overdrafts, even though they may not be able to afford the repayments, the charity claims. One of its clients was offered an overdraft of Â£2,250, even though they were working part-time and on benefits. It says such banks are guilty of ""unaffordable lending"". Analysis: Brian Milligan, BBC personal finance reporter While it is still well nigh impossible to understand the charging structure for overdrafts, things are better than they used to be. Back in 2014, for example, Oliver Foster-Burnell, from Taunton, won a case against Lloyds TSB, who charged him Â£743 after he went into his overdraft by just Â£2.67. Subsequently banks began capping overdraft fees. Indeed, since September 2017 all banks have been obliged to publish a maximum monthly charge. But while the average borrower benefits from a cap, some individuals end up paying more. When should you worry about your debts? ""Lenders and regulators must take action to need to ensure that overdraft lending is affordable, that borrowers in financial difficulty get the right support and that we break the cycle of persistent overdraft debt,"" said Peter Tatton, head of policy at StepChange. ""Fundamental reform is needed."" However the banking industry said it was already doing its best to help customers in financial difficulty. ""Overdrafts can help customers smooth their household spending, but if circumstances change or they are struggling with their finances, they should contact their lender straightaway,"" said a spokesperson for UK Finance. ""Lenders will support customers and allow them a period of time to seek impartial and independent debt advice."" What is debt and when should you worry?

"This video can not be played Labour: May to blame for Brexit 'embarrassment' Ministers say no part of the UK will be treated differently in the Brexit talks as Labour branded their approach an ""embarrassment"". No agreement has been reached with the EU after a DUP backlash against proposals for the Irish border. Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the government was close to concluding the first phase of talks. DUP leader Arlene Foster said the text of the deal was a ""big shock"" and ""it was not going to be acceptable."" She told the Republic of Ireland national broadcaster RTÃ that her party only saw the text on Monday morning, despite asking to see it for five weeks. Theresa May, speaking as she welcomed Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to Downing Street, said talks with the EU had "" made a lot of progress"". ""There are still a couple of issues we need to work on. But we'll be reconvening in Brussels later this week as we look ahead to the December European Council,"" she said. The phone call that never was Mark Devenport: The Brexit linguistic hole Dublin 'to give May space' on Brexit Ruth Davidson: The deal should be UK-wide Mrs Foster was invited to hold talks with Mrs May in London on Tuesday, but the party's Westminster leader met the government's chief whip instead. The meeting lasted for several hours, but sources suggested to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that there was not much sign of a breakthrough yet, with a DUP insider saying the deal needed ""radical surgery"", rather than a few word changes. A phone call between Mrs May and Mrs Foster had then been expected this evening, but sources added that it would not go ahead, suggesting it had never been arranged. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and Mrs May is under pressure to reach agreement on the Northern Ireland border so negotiations can move forward. The prime minister needs the support of the DUP - the Democratic Unionist Party - which is Northern Ireland's largest party and has 10 MPs at Westminster, because she does not have a majority to win votes in the House of Commons. Responding to an urgent question from Labour in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Davis defended the controversial proposal for ""regulatory alignment"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - intended to avoid the need for border checks after Brexit - saying this would apply to the whole of the UK. The DUP is unhappy about any agreement which treats Northern Ireland differently. Arlene Foster: We waited five weeks to see draft 'I cannot believe there won't be an agreement' The issue threatening to derail Brexit It would not mean ""having exactly the same rules"" as the EU, Mr Davis said, but would involve ""sometimes having mutually recognised rules"". Backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that having ""regulatory divergence"" from the EU after Brexit was a ""red line"". This video can not be played Davis: We are making Brexit progress Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said that when the DUP objected to the draft agreement, ""fantasy met brutal reality"", adding: ""The DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog."" Mr Starmer also called for the government to drop its plan to enshrine the 29 March 2019 Brexit date in UK law. Meanwhile, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith suggested the UK should walk away from the negotiations if the EU does not change its position. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith: EU needs to 'back off' or 'move on' But Tory MP and former cabinet minister, Nicky Morgan, said his comments were ""madness"" and walking away would ""betrays the futures of millions of young people and those who never wanted to leave in the first place"".

The DUP has said ""it is not a question of us budging"" as the talks were between the UK and the EU Dublin - which as an EU member is part of its single market and customs union - has been calling for written guarantees that a ""hard border"" involving customs checks on the island of Ireland will be avoided after Brexit It is concerned this could undermine the 1998 peace treaty - theGood Friday Agreementthat brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr Davis said that while the ""integrity"" of the single market and customs union must be respected after Brexit, it was ""equally clear we must respect the integrity of the United Kingdom"" and individual nations could not have separate arrangements. Mrs May needs to show ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far on ""divorce"" issues before European leaders meet on 14 December to decide whether to allow talks on future trade relations to begin. The three issues that need to be resolved are the Northern Ireland border, citizens' rights and the amount of money the UK will pay as it leaves. Brexitcast: Listen to the BBC's podcast special European press sees May on 'razor edge' Talks between Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without agreement on Monday, after the DUP objected to a draft agreement on the future of the Irish border. Key to the row is how closely aligned Northern Ireland's regulations will be with those of the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the EU, in order to avoid a ""hard"" border. This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" Ireland's deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said Dublin would not budge from its position on the border. The EU is treating the row as a ""domestic British political issue"", BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said. ""The show is now in London,"" said a European Commission spokesman. Downing Street has insisted the border was not the only outstanding problem and disagreement remains over the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing EU citizens' rights in the UK after Brexit.

The phone call that never was Mark Devenport: The Brexit linguistic hole Dublin 'to give May space' on Brexit Ruth Davidson: The deal should be UK-wide Mrs Foster was invited to hold talks with Mrs May in London on Tuesday, but the party's Westminster leader met the government's chief whip instead. The meeting lasted for several hours, but sources suggested to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that there was not much sign of a breakthrough yet, with a DUP insider saying the deal needed ""radical surgery"", rather than a few word changes. A phone call between Mrs May and Mrs Foster had then been expected this evening, but sources added that it would not go ahead, suggesting it had never been arranged. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and Mrs May is under pressure to reach agreement on the Northern Ireland border so negotiations can move forward. The prime minister needs the support of the DUP - the Democratic Unionist Party - which is Northern Ireland's largest party and has 10 MPs at Westminster, because she does not have a majority to win votes in the House of Commons. Responding to an urgent question from Labour in the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Davis defended the controversial proposal for ""regulatory alignment"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - intended to avoid the need for border checks after Brexit - saying this would apply to the whole of the UK. The DUP is unhappy about any agreement which treats Northern Ireland differently. Arlene Foster: We waited five weeks to see draft 'I cannot believe there won't be an agreement' The issue threatening to derail Brexit It would not mean ""having exactly the same rules"" as the EU, Mr Davis said, but would involve ""sometimes having mutually recognised rules"". Backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that having ""regulatory divergence"" from the EU after Brexit was a ""red line"". This video can not be played Davis: We are making Brexit progress Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said that when the DUP objected to the draft agreement, ""fantasy met brutal reality"", adding: ""The DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog."" Mr Starmer also called for the government to drop its plan to enshrine the 29 March 2019 Brexit date in UK law. Meanwhile, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith suggested the UK should walk away from the negotiations if the EU does not change its position. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith: EU needs to 'back off' or 'move on' But Tory MP and former cabinet minister, Nicky Morgan, said his comments were ""madness"" and walking away would ""betrays the futures of millions of young people and those who never wanted to leave in the first place"".

The DUP has said ""it is not a question of us budging"" as the talks were between the UK and the EU Dublin - which as an EU member is part of its single market and customs union - has been calling for written guarantees that a ""hard border"" involving customs checks on the island of Ireland will be avoided after Brexit It is concerned this could undermine the 1998 peace treaty - theGood Friday Agreementthat brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr Davis said that while the ""integrity"" of the single market and customs union must be respected after Brexit, it was ""equally clear we must respect the integrity of the United Kingdom"" and individual nations could not have separate arrangements. Mrs May needs to show ""sufficient progress"" has been made so far on ""divorce"" issues before European leaders meet on 14 December to decide whether to allow talks on future trade relations to begin. The three issues that need to be resolved are the Northern Ireland border, citizens' rights and the amount of money the UK will pay as it leaves. Brexitcast: Listen to the BBC's podcast special European press sees May on 'razor edge' Talks between Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker broke up without agreement on Monday, after the DUP objected to a draft agreement on the future of the Irish border. Key to the row is how closely aligned Northern Ireland's regulations will be with those of the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the EU, in order to avoid a ""hard"" border. This video can not be played Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" Ireland's deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said Dublin would not budge from its position on the border. The EU is treating the row as a ""domestic British political issue"", BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said. ""The show is now in London,"" said a European Commission spokesman. Downing Street has insisted the border was not the only outstanding problem and disagreement remains over the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing EU citizens' rights in the UK after Brexit.

"Christine Keeler worked as a model in the 1960s Christine Keeler, the model embroiled in the 1963 Profumo affair, has died aged 75, her son has said. Seymour Platt said Ms Keeler had been ill for several months,externalwith chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He told the BBC: ""She was always a fighter, but sadly lost the final fight against a terrible lung disease."" She became famous for her part in the scandal, which shook Harold Macmillan's government, but her son said that fame came ""at a huge personal price"". At the height of the Cold War, the-then teenager claimed she had an affair with Conservative cabinet minister John Profumo. She also claimed to be in a relationship with a Russian diplomat - Eugene Ivanov, an assistant naval attachÃ© at the Soviet Embassy - at the same time. Obituary: Christine Keeler John Profumo 'had relationship with Nazi spy' Mr Profumo was forced to resign after lying about the affair to Parliament and the scandal is considered to have contributed to the fall of the Macmillan government. Ms Keeler's family said she died on Monday at 23:30 GMT at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington, south-east London. Paying tribute to his mother, Mr Platt told the BBC: ""She earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price."" ""And regardless, we are all very proud of who she was to the end,"" he added. Douglas Thompson, the journalist and author who worked with Ms Keeler on her memoir The Truth At Last, paid tribute to a ""funny and bright"" woman, whom he described as ""one of the most honest people I have ever met"". ""She believed absolutely everything she ever said about the Profumo affair,"" he said. ""She said what she thought,"" he continued. ""I think that honesty is very surprising."" He described Ms Keeler as a ""victim of the time"", adding that she would probably have had her own TV show had the scandal happened today. ""The interesting thing about her is she tried to escape it,"" he said. ""I don't think she ever got away from it - that was a tragedy."" ""She could never stop being Christine Keeler,"" he added. In 1963, Mr Profumo told the House of Commons he and Ms Keeler were ""on friendly terms"" and there was ""no impropriety"" in their relationship, after opposition MPs voiced concerns about national security implications. Eventually he admitted lying to the house and resigned as Secretary of State for War and from the Commons. Ms Keeler was briefly married twice, with both ending in divorce. She had two sons. The Profumo affair will be the subject of a BBC One drama which begins filming next year.
