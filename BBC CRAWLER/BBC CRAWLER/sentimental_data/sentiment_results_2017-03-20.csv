"Arsenal have won three Premier League titles under Arsene Wenger - the last in 2004 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is like ""an uncle who doesn't want to leave the party"", says former Chelsea striker Chris Sutton. Wenger, in charge since 1996, said he will announce ""very soon"" whether he will remain with the Gunners, after reaching a decision on his future. Arsenal are in danger of ending a second straight season without a major trophy, and Sutton said he should go. ""It's a dictatorship and he surrounds himself with yes men,"" Sutton added. This video can not be played Wenger will reveal decision on his future 'very soon' Wenger's contract expires at the end of the season but he has been offered a new two-year deal. Listen again: 5 live's Monday Night Club The Frenchman, 67, has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with fans responding to defeats in the Premier League, and the10-2 aggregate lossto Bayern Munich in the Champions League, by calling for him to leave. More anti-Wenger banners were held aloft by Gunners fans in the closing stages of lastSaturday's 3-1 defeatat West Brom, while in the first half two planes towed banners over the ground - one criticising the manager and the other supporting him. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live'sThe Monday Night Club,Sutton, a Premier League winner as a player with Blackburn Rovers in 1995, added: ""He's been selfish. I'm surprised Steve Bould [Wenger's assistant] doesn't get hold of him and say this is the reality. ""He's taking the club backwards. They have just accepted mediocrity. ""His work in the transfer market has been a failure lately. ""Do the right thing and if you're not going to do the right thing then tell us."" Arsenal fans who want Arsene Wenger to leave held up banners during their team's 3-1 defeat at West Brom last Saturday Arsenal, sixth in the table, are 19 points behind leaders Chelsea in the Premier League and their last realistic chance of winning a trophy this season is the FA Cup. They face Manchester City in the semi-final at Wembley on Sunday, 23 April (15:00 BST). Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud said the club's players supported Wenger and wanted him to stay and ""continue his adventure"". ""We hope we can win the cup and that Arsenal qualify for the Champions League,"" the France international told Canal Plus. ""We want Arsene Wenger to renew his contract, to continue his adventure, because we support him."" Arsene Wenger: Time to go at Arsenal? Video, 00:01:40Arsene Wenger: Time to go at Arsenal?

"'The best centre half in Ireland': Ryan McBride achieved his dream and became a hero to Derry City's fans When Ryan McBride was appointed captain of his hometown club Derry City in 2015, his modest reaction helps show why he was beloved by the club's fan base. ""Other footballers have dreams of going across the water and playing for Man United and Celtic,"" he told local newspaper the Derry Journal. ""But my dream as a boy was to play for Derry City and that came true."" On Sunday, many of those same fans gathered in shared grief at the player's home, just a kick of a ball from the club's Brandywell Stadium, after hearing of his sudden death aged 27. Derry City captain McBride dies aged 27 Just the day before, McBride was leading the team in a 4-0 league victory against Drogheda United. Another win and clean sheet in Derry's impressive 100% start to the League of Ireland season. That success now feels empty and void in the wake of an event that has devastated the Irish football world. Derry City players emerge from a press conference after the death of captain Ryan McBride The club's scheduled game against Limerick on Tuesday has been postponed, while the Football Association of Ireland has announced that Friday's World Cup qualifier against Wales in Dublin will feature a tribute to the defender. It is the also the third tragedy in just over a year to hit Derry City. The club'srecord goalscorer Mark Farren died in 2016after being diagnosed with a brain tumour, while a year ago to the day winger Josh Daniels lost family members in theBuncrana pier tragedy. Since his debut in 2011, McBride had not only become a mainstay of the club's defence, but an adored hero of Derry City's Red and White Army - an embodiment of the local football ideal. He made more than 170 appearances for the club, with more than 50 as captain after he took over the role permanently two years ago. Derry City updated their social media pages with this illustrated image of Ryan McBride A self-professed quiet man off the pitch, McBride said things were a ""different story"" on it. ""I switch on and then I'm in game mode."" Derry City watchers might describe that as understated - McBride's volume on the pitch was thunderous, whether vocally organising the defence, launching into tackles or winning headers. It wasn't just his ability that made McBride a crowd favourite, although he had no shortage of talent. ""Derry City have lost the best centre half in Ireland,"" club legend Liam Coyle said on Monday morning. It was the number five's fearless attitude and commitment to the club's cause that secured his place in the hearts of the Derry City faithful. Stephen Kenny was the manager who gave McBride his debut in 2011. ""A ferociously brave player, the bravest I've ever seen on a football pitch,"" he told RTÃ. ""He (McBride) just launched himself into every challenge. Aggressive in the air and brave to a fault nearly, which endeared him to everybody. ""He was every fan's favourite player and a great captain of Derry City."" Ryan McBride celebrates scoring for Derry City in 2013 Ryan McBride was 21 when he made his league debut off the bench in a 1-1 draw against Bray Wanderers on 20 May 2011. That season was an unexpected success story for Derry. After being promoted to the League of Ireland's Premier Division, they made an unlikely bid for the league title. It was a talented team too - James McClean, now of West Brom and the Republic of Ireland, was on the wing, while Sheffield United's Danny Lafferty and Southend United's Stephen McLaughlin were also key members. But, it was Ryan McBride who made the biggest breakthrough. ""He was playing for a Saturday morning league team, Brandywell Harps, which was a massive jump to go from there to the first team,"" said Kenny. In July, his second League of Ireland start was in a crucial televised game against Shamrock Rovers. McBride starred in Derry's 1-0 win and while their title ambitions ultimately fell short, the centre half was well on his way. He picked up two man-of-the-match awards and signed a new two-year contract, all in the space of a few weeks. More success followed - McBride played and won in the 2011 League Cup final and was a substitute in Derry City's FAI Cup win in 2012. He went back to the final in 2014 and played, but lost out to St Patrick's Athletic. While the club's fortunes fluctuated, McBride continued as an ever present in the side before becoming the club's captain in 2015. This League of Ireland season was one that had started promisingly for Derry and their captain - four wins from four games, with McBride scoring twice. Now, it's a season left shattered by his loss.

"On the Falls Road, heart of Republican Belfast. there's a new sense of purpose. Sinn Fein pulled the plug on Stormont,did well in the elections,externaland are now, like the Scottish government, demanding a referendum on their future destiny. Brexit -rejected by 55.8% of voters,externalin Northern Ireland - is seen as just the latest imposition by England. It has given a new momentum to their whole reason for existing: the belief the island of Ireland should be one country. Everywhere down the Falls there arereminders of those who killed and died for a united Ireland:,externalhere a mural of a young man with a rifle, there a huge sepia portrait celebrating the provisional Irish government set up in 1922. But there are new signs too, lots of them. Sinn Fein's latest posters sayWest Belfast stands against Brexit.,external The referendum has changed politics here, as all over the UK, even on party night. The West is gyrating in a sea of joyous green on St Patrick's Day. The social club on the Falls Road in Belfast is packed full of people dancing and drinking. Theresa May has said the time is not right for a poll on Northern Ireland's border Some merely wear a token green T-shirt or badge, but several women are in elaborate emerald dress, men in bowlers or stetsons of the appropriate shade: any culture you like as long as its Irish. Inevitably one man is dressed asthat most emerald of animals, a crocodile,external. Here even the plush is political. It's the greatest day of the year, says one woman: about Irishness, about all of Ireland. Does she feel British at all, I ask . ""Not at all, definitely Irish."" Time not right for Irish border poll, Theresa May says Sinn Fein calls for 'urgent' referendum on Irish unity Northern Ireland could face another snap election, says Brokenshire NI Election: Everything you need to know about the 2017 vote British as well as Irish? I ask another reveller. ""No, no, pure Irish."" And another tells me: ""Irish 100%."" What Mrs May calls the UK, the ""precious union of nationsâ¦ the most successful the world has ever known"", is seen very differently here. They are in no doubt about Brexit, either - they are against it, unless you mean exiting from Britain, casting off what they see as the last shackles of the English Empire. There are concerns on both sides of the border over the possible effects of Brexit ""We're not the UK, we're Ireland. We should have the right to vote. Theresa May is a fascist,"" one man tells me. They fear a return to a real border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. ""Borders! Nobody wants 'em. We're nationalists here. Loyalist don't want it. Business people don't want it."" Hence the renewed demand for an all-Ireland referendum is being made by Sinn FÃ©in as they look to exploit their success in the recent elections. You can believe they pulled out of Stormont in a row over an obscure environmental scheme if you want. Butthe real story,externalis deeper. Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister over the handling ofthe botched energy schemethat could cost Â£490m. But others forces were also in play. Sinn Fein activists were increasingly feeling they got little out of devolution, that their partners in government, the DUP, were treating them without respect. So they brought the whole thing crashing down. If they do not do a post-election deal in the coming weeks then there will have to be new elections or London will take over: that's called ""direct rule"". The prime minister appears to have ruled that out. The negotiations are a poker game but Sinn Fein has little to lose by blinking first. Their supporters want real movement on issues dear to their hearts, and a re-run of the election might see them increase their vote. DUP's Nelson McCausland says Brexit ""puts a stop"" to the promotion of cross-border harmonisation via the EU The real thorny issues are old ones, about the role of the Irish language and what are known euphemistically as ""legacy issues,external'': whether people should face criminal prosecution for what they did during the Troubles. The DUP's Nelson McCausland, who lost his assembly seat at the recent election, say this is not an opportunity for Sinn Fein, but a full stop. ""There has been over a number of years within Sinn Fein a concern they had not delivered on their united Ireland dream. What they have used over the years is the European Union and European harmonisation to promote the idea that we are being harmonised with the Republic. Brexit puts a stop to that."" Unionists hardly need to argue against the call for a referendum. The British secretary of state only needs to agree to one if, in the words of the act ""it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting"" want a united Ireland. Pretty hazy. And not a single opinion poll or commentator suggests there is that majority. But the next day I return to the Falls and find a different pictureat a language school,externalfrom the hard line espoused by some of those at the West social club. Five people and their teacher sit around the table practising their Irish conversation. Among them, Linda Ervine who's been learning the language for six years. ""Because I am from the Protestant community I never had the opportunity to engage with the language and I fell in love with it."" She says there are many links with her own heritage. ""We've been very separate, British identity, Irish identity but in the last few years a Northern Irish identity is coming through more and more. For me I see myself as Irish and British, I don't see that as a contradiction."" And there's the flood of people - including many Unionists and Protestants - applying for Irish passports in the wake of Brexit. The Belfast Newsletter newspaper's Sam McBride sees big changes under way. Sinn Fein made major gains at the recent Stormont assembly elections ""Unionism is facing a crisis at the moment, a seismic change.,"" he said. ""The fundamental question is that there is a significant number of Catholics who support the union with the United Kingdom - why are they not voting for unionist parties? I think the answer is the trappings of Orangism and Protestantism put those people off."" There are straws in the wind across the border too. The cabinet in Dublin decided that eventually all Irish passport holders, including in the North, will be able to vote in presidential elections. The opposition party Fianna Fail is preparing is own white paper on plans for a united Ireland. But Republican commentator Chris Donnelly, like most observers on both sides of the divide, thinks there will not be a referendum, and it couldn't be won because many from that tradition feel more economically secure in the North. ""I think Sinn Fein know in their heart of hearts they are 20, 25 years away from when a border poll could actually have a credible chance of being won. It's an example of ""Hail Mary"" politics. It's a lottery move, its not going to happen but it is keeping the issue alive at the centre of political discussions."" While we all get used to all new politics of identity, it has been the language of debate in Northern Ireland for centuries. Brexit has muddied the political waters. And a new political space may be up for grabs.

"Tameka Stigers working in her salon In college, Tameka Stigers wore her hair in thin locks that looked so attractive, parents at her church wanted her to fashion their young daughters' hair. ""They said, 'Can you do it like yours?'"" Stigers recalled. She wore her hair in Sisterlocks, hundreds of tiny locks that allow women with coarse, tightly-wound hair to wear almost any style - from ponytails to braids, curly or straight. She enrolled in a short training course in order to master the technique of creating Sisterlocks - a trademarked technique - with nothing but her two hands, a comb and small elastic bands. She registered as a Sisterlock hair braider online and requests from other people in the St Louis area poured in. To meet the demand, Stigers needed to move her business out of her home. That's where her hair braiding business hit its first snag. Stigers knew that hair salons were regulated by the Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners, but she wasn't sure that her business, which doesn't use any chemicals, heat or scissors, would also fall under the board's purview. She phoned the board to ask if she would have to pay upwards of Â£8,189 ($10,000) and spend thousands of hours in cosmetology school in order to open up a hair braiding shop. Initially, Stigers said she was told that the regulations wouldn't apply to her. The board later reversed its course. In mid-2014, Stigers started pursuing a lawsuit against the board after it told her that she and any other hair braiders running businesses in Missouri would need to get a full cosmetology licence, which requires courses at a registered cosmetology school - courses that Stigers said don't teach any natural or African hair braiding skills at all. Stigers' salon has expanded ""Hair braiding is an art really,"" Stigers said. ""It's something that if I went to cosmetology school today, I couldn't learn how to do braiding."" Stigers joined another braider, Joba Niang, in a lawsuit against the board of cosmetology and barber examiners, seeking reprieve from the regulations. A judge ruled against Stigers in September, 2016, but her lawyers finished filing briefs to appeal the case last week, just as Stigers settled into a new, larger storefront to accommodate a growing number of customers. Stigers didn't get a licence to braid hair, and many of her braiders lack licences, though her business partner does have a cosmetology licence to run the spa area in her new salon. Thus far, the Missouri Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners has declined to enforce its rules while Stigers lawsuit is active, allowing Stigers and other braiders to continue working until the courts resolve the case. If she loses, Stigers and other hair braiders will face the choice of getting the expensive cosmetology licences or closing up shop. Women who run hair braiding salons in up to 21 states face similar regulations. Cosmetology classes mostly focus on how to cut hair, safely dye hair, and treat hair chemically to permanently curl or straighten strands. Hair braiders don't do any of that. The small amount of training that does touch on styling typically does not go into African-style hair braiding, though a few cosmetology textbooks do nod to the techniques. Other professional hair braiders, like Pamela Ferrell, in Washington DC have won in similar cases The Missouri Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners does not comment on ongoing court cases, and could not discuss the regulations surrounding hair braiding. However, board members on cosmetology boards in other states have cautioned against loosening regulations because of concerns over sanitation and safety. Jeanne Chappell, a board member on the New Hampshire Board of Barbering, Cosmetology and Esthetics told the Associated Press that diseases can be passed through the tools used during braiding and that  licensing would allow the board to monitor and enforce against salons that don't use safe practices. Pamela Ferrell, owns a braiding salon in Washington, DC, and successfully fought licensing regulations. She thinks racial biases and gaps in cultural knowledge play a role in the debate. ""It's a constant attack against our hair, our beauty standards, all under the guise of occupational licensing,"" Ferrell said. ""It's culturally disrespectful. They're using irrelevant occupational laws to put this bias on a particular group of people."" While Stigers and her attorneys wait on a judge to set a date for the oral arguments Missouri is working to pass a bill that would make the lawsuit moot by deregulating hair braiding and imposing a simple Â£20 ($25) fee to register the business. Governor Eric Greitens, a Republican, specifically called out Stigers' case as ""burdensome"" in his January state-of-the-state address. ""We need to end frivolous regulations like these so that our people can start their own businesses and create jobs,"" he said. Stigers may have found a political ally in new Missouri governor Eric Greitens The conservative political powerhouse run by Charles and David Koch has also taken a stand against the licensing regulations as part of a Â£737,280,000 ($900m) campaign for a free market that encourages small business growth. Former President Barack Obama issued a call to action to cut down on the state licensing regulations that require nearly one in four American workers to obtain an occupational licence - a huge increase from the  5% who had to get licences in 1950. His administration also allocated federal funds for states who reformed licensing regulations. Stigers works a lot. She has to carve out time to testify in court and in front of the Missouri state legislators. She just expanded her salon to a new storefront that fits ten braiding booths and a full spa with manicure stations and a soon-to-come sauna. When she's not braiding a client's hair, she's running to the bank, buying supplies, or discussing business with the eleven other women her business employs. ""It's a constant attack against our hair, our beauty standards, all under the guise of occupational licensing,"" says braider Pamela Farrell Stigers said she hopes her lawsuit will help other women realise their dreams of opening a hair-braiding salon. ""I am excited because it's something that, the other native African hair braiders, they see me moving and expanding and they don't have to be afraid of being out in the public eye,"" Stigers said.

"Shipowners and traders meet in shipping agency Lloyd's of London's coffeehouse in 1863 Almost a decade ago,I tried to place a bet with a leading UK betting shop that I would die within a year. They should have taken the bet - I am still alive. But they will not gamble on life and death. A life insurance company, by contrast, does little else. Legally and culturally, there is a clear distinction between gambling and insurance. Economically the difference is less visible. Both gambler and insurer agree that money will change hands depending on what transpires in some unknowable future. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Gambling tools such as dice date back millennia - perhaps five thousand years in Egypt. Insurance may be equally old. The Code of Hammurabi - a law code from Babylon, in what is now Iraq - is nearly 4,000 years old. It includes numerous clauses devoted to the topic of ""bottomry"", a kind of maritime insurance bundled together with a business loan. A merchant would borrow money to fund a ship's voyage, but if the ship sank, the loan did not have to be repaid. Many of the provisions of the Code of Hammurabi - as seen on this stone stele - deal with matters of contract and trade Around the same time, Chinese merchants were spreading their risks by swapping goods between ships. If any single ship went down, it would contain a mix of goods from many different merchants. But all that physical shuffling around is a fuss. Much more efficient to structure insurance as a financial contract instead, something the Romans did a few millennia later. Later still, Italian city states like Genoa and Venice developed ever more sophisticated ways to insure the ships of the Mediterranean. Then, in 1687, a coffee house opened on Tower Street, near the London docks. Run by Edward Lloyd, it was comfortable and spacious, and business boomed. Patrons enjoyed the fireside tea and coffee, and - of course - the gossip. There was much to gossip about: London's great plague, the great fire, the Dutch navy sailing up the Thames, and a revolution which had overthrown the king. But above all, the inhabitants of this coffee house loved to gossip about ships: what was sailing from where, with what cargo - and whether it would arrive safely or not. And where there was gossip, there was an opportunity for a wager. Lloyd's patrons were happy to speculate on the likely death of Admiral John Byng, who was shot in 1757 The patrons bet, for example, on whether Admiral John Byng would be shot for his incompetence in a naval battle with the French. He was. The gentlemen of Lloyd's would have had no qualms about taking my bet on my own life. Edward Lloyd realised his customers were as thirsty for information to fuel their bets as they were for coffee, and began to assemble a network of informants and a newsletter full of information about foreign ports, tides, and the comings and goings of ships. His newsletter became known as Lloyd's List. Lloyd's List was published daily until 2013, when it became online-only Lloyd's coffee house hosted ship auctions, and gatherings of sea captains who would share stories. If someone wished to insure a ship, that could be done too: a contract would be drawn up, and the insurer would sign his name underneath - hence the term ""underwriter"". It became hard to say quite where coffee-house gambling ended and formal insurance began. Eight decades after Lloyd had established his coffee house, a group of underwriters who hung out there formed the Society of Lloyd's. Today, Lloyd's of London is one of the most famous names in insurance. Lloyd's is not an insurer: it is a marketplace in which multiple financial backers, grouped in syndicates, come together to pool risk But not all modern insurers have their roots in gambling. Another form of insurance developed not in the ports, but the mountains. Alpine farmers organised mutual aid societies in the early 16th century, agreeing to look after each other if a cow - or child - fell ill.  While the underwriters of Lloyd's viewed risk as something to be analysed and traded, the mutual assurance societies of the Alps saw it as something to be shared. And when the farmers descended from the alps to Zurich and Munich, they established some of the world's great insurance companies. Risk-sharing mutual aid societies are now among the largest and best-funded organisations on the planet - we call them ""governments"". Governments initially got into the insurance business as a way of making money, typically to fight a war in the turmoil of Europe in the 1600s and 1700s. Instead of selling ordinary bonds, which paid in regular instalments until they expired, governments sold annuities, which paid in regular instalments until the recipient expired. Easy to supply, and much in demand. Annuities are a form of insurance: they protect an individual against the risk of living so long that all their money runs out. The warrior monks who invented banking The compiler: Computing's hidden hero How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream Providing insurance is no longer a mere money-spinner for governments. It is regarded as a core priority to help citizens manage some of life's biggest risks - unemployment, illness, disability and ageing. Faced with these deep pools of risk, private insurers often merely paddle. At least, citizens in richer economies expect insurance from their governments. In poorer countries, governments are not much help against life-altering risks, such as crop failure or illness. And private insurers tend not to take much interest, either. The stakes are too low, and the costs too high. That is a shame, because there is growing evidence that insurance doesn't just provide peace of mind, but is a vital element of a healthy economy. A recent study in Ghana showed that farmers were being held back from specialising and expanding by the risk of drought - a risk against which they couldn't insure themselves. Some small scale farmers in Ghana previously struggled to insure themselves When researchers created an insurance company and started selling crop insurance, the farmers bought the the insurance and expanded their businesses. Today, the biggest insurance market of all blurs the line between insuring and gambling: the market in financial derivatives. Derivatives are financial contracts that let two parties bet on something else - perhaps exchange rate fluctuations, or whether a debt will be repaid. They can be a form of insurance. An exporter hedges against a rise in the exchange rate. A wheat farming company covers itself by betting that the price of wheat will fall. The ability to buy derivatives lets companies specialise in a particular market. Otherwise, they would have to diversify - like the Chinese merchants four millennia ago, who didn't want all their goods in one ship. The more an economy specialises, the more it tends to produce. But unlike regular insurance, for derivatives you don't need to find someone with a risk they need to protect themselves against.  You just need to find someone willing to take a gamble on any uncertain event anywhere in the world. It is a simple matter to double the stakes - or multiply them by a hundred. As the profits multiply, all that is needed is the appetite to take risks. Before the international banking crisis broke in 2007, the total face value of outstanding derivatives contracts was many times larger than the world economy itself.

"Jessica's own troubles inspired her to set up a business to help others in a similar situation Jessica May was moving quickly up the career ladder until she was tripped up by mental illness. Following the birth of her first child, Jessica developed a problem with her thyroid gland that greatly exacerbated her pre-existing anxiety disorder. ""I've had anxiety my whole life,"" says the 36-year-old from Canberra, Australia. ""The [thyroid] condition meant that my anxiety got out of control."" This was back in 2012, and Jessica decided to return to her civil service job sooner than originally planned, after she and her doctor agreed that getting back to doing the work she loved would keep her focused and hopefully mitigate her anxiety. But Jessica, who had to reveal her mental health problem to her employers to receive the flexible schedule she needed, claims that her managers and colleagues started to make negative assumptions about her capabilities, and began to exclude her from projects. ""Because of how I was treated... I didn't really get better,"" she says. Having previously managed 17 staff, Jessica says she felt disheartened and devalued. Enabled helps people with disabilities find employment However, the bad experience did ultimately have a positive impact - it made Jessica determined to help other people with mental or physical disabilities, and gave her the idea for setting up a business to do this. ""I knew there needed to be something for people with disabilities who just need a little bit of flexibility from their employers,"" she says. Breaking the mental health taboo: 'Please talk about it' 'I was dragged to a psychiatrist - and it was the best thing I did' Schools 'must do more' on mental health So she decided to quit her government job and launch Enabled Employment, a recruitment consultancy that helps people with a disability find paid work. Today, the Canberra-based company helps thousands of people find work at more than 400 businesses in Australia, including accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, taxi hire service Uber, and even the Australian Defence Force. To help get Enabled up and running, Jessica successfully applied for a small entrepreneurship grant from the Australian Capital Territory government. She left her civil service job one Friday in December 2012, and started work at Enabled the following Monday, with help and support coming from a local start-up support initiative called the Griffin Accelerator. The number of people and companies using the business then slowly started to grow. Jessica May has won numerous business awards The business is similar to a regular recruitment agency, in that it maintains an online listing of available jobs, and acts as a mediator between would-be employees and hiring managers. However, Enabled also offers what it calls ""accessibility brokering"", which means that it works to ensure that businesses are able to offer employees the working conditions they need to perform at their best. This includes checking on flexible working hours and ensuring that offices have disabled access and toilets. Jessica is keen to stress that the company is not a charity. Instead it is a for-profit business. She believes that charities that pay businesses to take on disabled staff can reinforce negative stereotypes about disabled people. ""It really devalues people with disabilities who are totally capable,"" she says. ""We don't want anyone to feel like a charity case."" Instead, Enabled charges companies, typically a one-off fee equivalent to 10% of a person's annual salary. By contrast, people who use Enabled to find work don't have to pay it anything. The late Australian comedian Stella Young (centre) was an Enabled Employment ambassador ""There's 4.2 million people in Australia with a disability. Many of these people are very competent, it is really about trying to break down their barriers to work,"" says Jessica. ""We charge businesses for our services because you should be paying for amazingly qualified people, and you should also be paying for the diversity that it brings."" Enabled is valued at more than six million Australian dollars ($4.6m; Â£3.9m), and has expanded its services to include military veterans and indigenous Australians. Suzanne Colbert, the founder of the Australian Network on Disability, says that Enabled has ""freshened up"" the Australian job market's otherwise ""stale"" attitude towards hiring people with disabilities. She adds that Enabled has allowed employers to ""tap into new sources of talent"". When it comes to its own staff, Enabled practises what it preaches. Four of its seven full-time employees have a disability and work within a schedule that accommodates them best. Jessica balances her work with looking after her two young children The company and Jessica have also won a number of Australian awards, including start-up of the year in 2015, and a National Disability Award for community accessibility. Looking ahead, Jessica says she plans to expand the business in Australia before considering any moves overseas. But for now, she says she is ""the happiest she's ever been"". ""I still have anxiety. It doesn't ever go away, but I can definitely manage it with the flexibility that we have at Enabled.""

"This video can not be played Volunteers in Singapore are teaching people the Kristang language Until two years ago, university student Kevin Martens Wong had never even heard of his ancestral tongue, let alone spoken it. The Singaporean linguist was researching endangered languages when he stumbled upon Kristang in a book. As he dug deeper, he realised it was the language of his maternal grandparents. Mr Wong had heard smatterings of Kristang while growing up. But his grandparents were hardly fluent. His mother couldn't speak Kristang at all. Mr Wong is the co-founder of Kodrah Kristang, a project that aims to revive the Kristang language ""As a child I had learnt Mandarin and English in school, and my parents speak in English to me. So I never really recognised that side of my heritage,"" says Mr Wong, who is half Chinese and half Portuguese Eurasian. Kristang is the language of the Portuguese Eurasians, a minority group descended from Portuguese settlers who arrived in the region in the 16th Century and married locals. A unique creole of Portuguese and Malay, with elements of Chinese languages such as Mandarin and Hokkien, it was spoken by at least 2,000 people across the Malayan archipelago at its peak in the 19th Century, according to Mr Wong. But today there may be as few as 50 fluent speakers left in Singapore, along with more in Malaysia where the language is also in decline. Where are England's steepest streets? Why it's hard to be a Kevin in France Murder in the Lucky Holiday Hotel The main reason for its decline is that its own community has come to see it as economically irrelevant. When the British ran Singapore and what is now Malaysia, many Portuguese Eurasians found work in the civil service. English therefore came to be seen as more important than Kristang, and many began to discourage their children from speaking it. Bernard Mesenas, 78, remembers being belted as a child by his father when he was caught speaking Kristang. ""My father did not like it, he said I couldn't speak it because it would spoil my English,"" he told the BBC. ""I would argue, 'But it's Grandma's tongue.' Then he would put his hands on his belt and I would hide behind my mother."" Bernard Mesenas is one of the very few fluent Kristang speakers in Singapore When the British left, the newly independent countries of Malaysia and Singapore set about the task of deciding which languages spoken by their multicultural populations should be officially recognised - Kristang was not one of them. It continued to decline as Eurasians married other races, and their children spoke other languages. In Singapore, where every child must learn a second language after English, many Eurasians have chosen to learn Mandarin. Even in the Portuguese settlement of Malacca, the birthplace of Kristang and still home to a large Portuguese Eurasian community, the language is slowly fading away. Kristang researcher Prof Stefanie Pillai of the University of Malaya says many families have long tolerated their children speaking English. ""Thus, sadly, even though you can hear the creole being spoken in the settlement... there are young people who grew up here but are not fluent in the creole, and instead are dominant speakers of English,"" she says. But Mr Wong and a group of language enthusiasts hope to change things. Their group, called Kodrah Kristang - ""Awaken Kristang"" - holds weekly free language classes. They aim to build a critical mass of fluent Kristang speakers who can pass it on to future generations. Each week, about 200 students - many of them Portuguese Eurasians - attend their classes. Among them are Mr Wong's own grandparents. Among those learning Kristang is Mr Wong's octogenarian grandmother Maureen The irony of learning their native tongue from their grandson is not lost on them. ""It never dawned on me that Kristang was my language, I'd always thought it was English,"" says Mr Wong's 80-year-old grandmother Maureen. ""I've missed it, I feel I should have learnt it better to speak it to my own children. ""But it's not too late to learn,"" she adds. ""And I think it's great that a younger person can teach an older person, especially when it's your grandchild."" But reviving a dying language is not easy. One main challenge is that Kristang is mostly a spoken language and has rarely been recorded. There is no standardised spelling or pronunciation system - one word can have dozens of variations. The word for four, quartu, can be spelt and pronounced in 20 different ways. And because it has been in decline for so long, it has huge gaps in its vocabulary. Kristang does not have words for basic concepts such as apple, nurse, station or camera. ""But we do have several words for genitalia,"" deadpans Mr Wong. To solve this problem, his group invented new words with mash-ups of Kristang's root languages. For instance, the Kristang word for apple is ""manzang"", an adaptation of the Portuguese word ""maca"" using a Malay linguistic rule. A panda is ""bruangatu"" or ""bear cat"", a translation of the Chinese term for panda using Malay words. Some of these linguistic inventions can take on a poetic bent - a camera is ""pintalumezi"" or ""light-painting machine"", while grammar is ""osulingu"", or ""bones of language"". Kodrah Kristang recently visited Portuguese Eurasians in the historic Portuguese Settlement in Malacca The group has also organised visits to the Portuguese Settlement in Malacca, started work on a dictionary and textbook, created free online audio courses, and even done YouTube covers of pop songs in Kristang. In May they will hold the first ever Kristang festival called Festa, featuring talks, workshops and a heritage tour. In a welcome sign, the event has received Singapore government funding. They may still be a long way off from seeing Kristang become a living, breathing, widely spoken language again, but it's a first step. ""One day we would like to see Kristang be recognised by the wider community,"" says Mr Wong. ""There are no economic reasons for it to come back. But it's part of our shared historical fabric and heritage.""

"Diamo and his younger brother Lu'ay Diamo Parvez was born with cerebral palsy and died from complications when he was nine years old. During his life his parents were constantly struggling to get him the braces and splints he needed to support his body - and have channelled the pain of their loss into the search for a new, fast way of making them. Diamo's arms and legs were paralysed and he had very little control of his head. He needed a back brace, hand splints and ankle splints - technically known as orthoses - to prevent him suffering pain. The main problem, says his mother, Samiya, is that when a muscle isn't used it shrinks and tightens. ""Diamo's muscles were so tight they were pulling his hips out of his joints,"" she says. ""The orthosis stretches the muscles and helps to hold the body in the right posture, and avoids the need for surgery."" Getting an orthosis, though, is a drawn-out process, involving different appointments, at different locations. And there is one ""horrific"" stage, Samiya says, when children have to remain absolutely still for up to an hour as a plaster of Paris mould is made of their body. Samiya and Diamo's father, Naveed, would often have to resort to restraining their son to keep him from moving. A child being held in plaster, as seen in a video on the Andiamo website ""We saw how much our son hated being pinned down for the plaster - he would scream and scream and it was a real struggle,"" says Samiya. ""I know kids who break down and start crying if their parents even drive past a hospital because they think they're going to get a plaster cast."" Next comes a wait for the brace to be created from the mould - and then a trial-and-error process of fitting and refitting. ""Sometimes it would be ever so slightly out and cause him to have sores and bruising so we'd have to start again and hope to keep him still enough for the mould to be accurate,"" Samiya says. The whole process could take as long as six months - by which point Diamo had inevitably grown. Throughout his life, Diamo would go through the casting process at least eight times per year his parents say. And that was just for the back brace. Without a back brace, Diamo would slip out of his wheelchair, so there were periods between outgrowing the old one and a getting a new one when he would be unable to go to school. ""For a good three weeks we were housebound as a family because we couldn't put him in the wheelchair to be able to go out,"" says Samiya. She even knows of children who can walk but have had to use a wheelchair while waiting for a new orthosis. Diamo died five years ago this month. Less than a year later, Naveed attended a tech conference and saw someone making 3D scans of old steam trains in order to reproduce parts with a 3D printer. ""The new parts were so accurate that the scratches in the paintwork of the original were perfectly reflected in the print,"" he says. He began to think about how that technology could translate into making orthoses. ""I had a lightbulb moment - not just because of the technology but because of the realisation that all that pain could be turned to good,"" he says. ""We were grieving - we still are - but then it was very raw and I thought that this is something Diamo could leave behind."" Within a year they'd created a prototype and with help from a charity, the Nominet Trust, they set up ahealth technology company, Andiamo,external. Samiya with Naveed (right) and Andiamo co-founder Lee Provoost Andiamo does not use plaster casts. Instead, a 3D scanner is swept over the child's body for between 60 and 90 seconds. Inside the scanner a number of high-speed cameras take photographs from different angles and these images are then digitally stitched together to make a 3D image, which can be fed into a 3D printer. ""These children are already stressed and in pain, coming to appointments is never fun - but we have been able to turn some of that experience around and get the children excited about the 3D printing,"" says Samiya. And the aim is to reduce waiting times from months to 48 hours. So far they've got it down to two weeks. ""We could have avoided so much pain in our lives if that technology had been available to us,"" says Samiya. The scanner produces a 3D image The high-accuracy scanning system produces orthoses that are a better fit, and this combined with the use of lighter, stronger materials results in a finished product that is less bulky and less than half the weight of traditional orthoses, Naveed says. Fourteen-year-old Sahara - one of Andiamo's first clients - can attest to this. She has cerebral palsy which affects all four limbs but can stand up and bear down on her feet with some support. From the age of two she has worn ankle-foot orthoses - known as AFOs - to hold her ankle in the right position and keep her controlled and grounded when she stands. The Andiamo AFO ""feels great, very lightweight"", she says, compared with her old one, which now feels ""thick and heavy"" by comparison. Lifting her feet is now easier - and as a result it's also easier for her to keep her balance. Orthoses can be used by people with a range of conditions, says Samiya, to relieve pain, increase mobility and to help protect tissue while it heals They can also be used to help people support their limbs after a car accident, or chemotherapy Chronic obesity can also lead to musculoskeletal problems ""People need orthosis after cancer care, obesity and diabetes - all of which are on the rise - but the capacity to serve them is shrinking,"" Samiya says Sahara's mum, Salome, used to take the old AFO out with her when shopping for shoes, to see which would be big enough to accommodate its cumbersome shape. ""Children with traditional AFOs have that Frankenstein appearance - skinny legs with massive feet because they're made to be very big and bulky with extra room for the foot to grow,"" she says. This is another problem Andiamo may help to fix. A foot being prepared for scanning Since seeing its first patient in December 2014, the Andiamo team has been working with 16 patients to develop the technology, and is now ready to see more. ""We have been focusing on ensuring the devices fit, are comfortable, and have a level of quality we are happy with,"" says Naveed. ""It is easy to do a one-off. It is much harder to have a consistent approach that allows you to scale."" The plan is to see at least 100 patients in 2017, to make more than 40,000 orthoses over the next five years, and to open a permanent clinic in London after a crowdfunding campaign in the near future. Orthoses make a big improvement to the wearer's quality of life, Naveed says, ""but they aren't sexy, they don't make a lot of money and they don't come with huge research and development budgets so they've been overlooked."" The extra accuracy of the orthoses should also result in less time being wasted by patients and medical staff at appointments. The British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists estimates there are only 450 qualified orthotists in the UK It is an ageing profession, NHS England says, andmany orthotists will retire with no-one to take their place,external At the same time, demand is rising by 6% each year, says Samiya This is partly because patients are now surviving conditions and trauma that would have killed them in the past, says Naveed Five years after his death, Diamo remains sorely missed. ""He was a happy, very relaxed kid who would only cry when he was in real pain,"" says his mother. ""He really enjoyed food and especially loved dark chocolate mousse."" Another passion was the music of James Blunt, which came about after the chance discovery by his carer, Carolina, that it would instantly relax him. ""It was painful,"" Samiya says. ""Why did it have to be James Blunt? I even had to suffer through one of his concerts!"" Diamo and Samiya at the James Blunt concert ""People make real assumptions about children with a disability"" says Naveed, ""but they get obsessed with stuff, just like other kids do. In Diamo's case, it was James Blunt."" Andiamo, which means ""let's go"" in Italian, is named after him. ""Although I don't have the same pain any more,"" says Naveed, ""if we can reduce another family's and make life a bit better for someone else, it's worth it.""

"George Osborne will take over as editor of the London Evening Standard Editing a newspaper is an extremely rewarding and tough job, probably harder these days than a few decades ago, because of scarcity of resources and the demands of the internet. But being an editor isn't just an editorial job. The editorial side of it is the most fulfilling and intellectually stimulating part, but it is only a part. There are also huge commercial responsibilities - how do we make money and save money? - and leadership and management duties. Leadership is about creating a moral vision for where you want to take a team; management is the daily activity of getting them there. It has always seemed to me that in rich newspapers, the editor gets to focus on editing, while other people think about the commercial and managerial side of it. For instance, the Daily Mail has several busy managing editors, whereas the Evening Standard has only one. George Osborne to become Standard editor Osborne Evening Standard job prompts call for inquiry George Osborne: From history buff to austerity editor Read more from Amol At organisations that are strapped for cash - and the Standard is facing big commercial challenges - editors have to spend relatively more of their time thinking about commercial and managerial obligations. And all of that is hugely time consuming. It leaves less time than you would like for the really exciting bit: editing. Editing is an exercise in selection and judgement: what to put in and - just as important - what to leave out. Which pictures, campaigns, and above all stories to run? What's the best headline on that front page splash? Shall we give this or that person a kicking in the sports pages? And should our cartoonist really depict Nigel Farage as an amphibian yet again? When making these decisions, based on your judgement, which is in turn informed by your values and experience, an editor has three sacred loyalties - in my view, in no particular order. First, to the truth; second, to the reader; and third, to the integrity and reputation of the newspaper. Some would argue that there are other loyalties. An editor of The Catholic Herald might think they had a duty to God, for instance; an editor of Country Life might feel they had a duty to England's enchanted land; and all editors are likely to feel a duty to those paying the bills. But those earlier loyalties are supreme. They are very different to the loyalties required by political parties. I have never been a member of a political party, but I suspect those who have would say their loyalties aren't primarily to truth, readers, or newspaper reputations. A political party is an institution that organises its members to acquire and exercise legislative power. Its members have loyalty above all to that task. If they are committed, they wake up every day thirsting for power. Once they have acquired it, fidelity to their tribe makes them determined not to relinquish it. Quite aside from the sheer practical workload, it is not easy to see how the loyalties required by editorship and the loyalties required by membership of a political party can be reconciled. The latter long to inhabit the corridors of power. The former want to throw grenades at it. Journalism, at its best, is about the ferocious scrutiny of power. That requires a certain distance from it. Of course, there are different types of journalism. I can see how it might be feasible for a theatre critic to be group secretary of his local Socialist Workers Party. I can also see how a brilliant football correspondent could be a member of the neo-Nazis. But an editor, who has to conduct daily combat with politicians? In being a member of the Conservative Party and, soon, editor of the London Evening Standard, George Osborne faces both practical and philosophical problems. The practical one is when to sleep. The philosophical one is how to reconcile his clearly divided loyalties. Which of his constituents matter most - those in Tatton, or his near-million readers at the Standard? How does he cover, say, a Budget: as a loyal Conservative MP, or as a fearless editor? It is hard enough to see how you reconcile being a member of a political party with being a journalist, let alone being an editor. However, being not only a member of a political party, but a sitting MP and a recent chancellor, as well as someone who retains political ambitions, is much tougher still. And that's before we even consider BlackRock. How can you cover the world of asset managementwhile being paid Â£650,000 by it? The idea that Mr Osborne could recuse himself from stories about that industry, or indeed the City pages altogether, strikes me as sub-optimal, to put it mildly: it would be bizarre to have a former chancellor as editor, only for him to have no involvement in business coverage. These conflicts of interest are untenable, and so - as I said on Friday - I can't see it lasting. Given his sources of income, he's much likelier to give up being an MP before he gives up having lunch at BlackRock. Whether it happens when Tatton disappears as a constituency, or before, I suspect he will be editor of the London Evening Standard after he is an MP in Cheshire. As I mentioned in my previous posts, his task at the paper - setting out a clear strategy, improving the product, raising its profile, and turning the business around by finding new revenue streams - is one for which he has relevant experience and connections. That said, it strikes me as a full-time job. Perhaps, therefore, Osborne hasn't fully grasped the function of an editor. I hope this post helps.

celebrations after the 39-year-old collected his fourth Super Bowl MVP award,
having helped the Patriots rally from a 25-point deficit to beat the Atlanta

"This video can not be played Key stats from a ComRes/BBC doping in amateur sport poll Drug use at every level of sport is ""fast becoming a crisis"" according to UK Anti-Doping - responding to a BBC poll into doping in amateur sport. It found more than a third (35%) of amateur sports people say they personally know someone who has doped, and 8% said they had taken steroids. Half believe performance enhancing substance use is ""widespread"" among those who play sport competitively. Ukad chief Nicole Sapstead described the figures as ""incredibly alarming"". A BBC State of Sport investigation into doping in UK amateur sport also found that 49% thought performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) were ""easily available"" among people who play sports regularly. According to figures from UK Anti-Doping (Ukad), the national body responsible for protecting clean sport, there are currently 52 athletes and coaches serving bans. Of these, only 12% are professional sports men or women; 62% are amateurs, 21% are semi-professional, and 5% are coaches. Of the 186 sanctions handed out across 22 separate sports by Ukad since it formed in 2009, 46% have been rugby union or league players - mainly at amateur and semi-professional levels. Reacting to the ComRes poll for BBC Sport of more than 1,000 men and women who are members of sports clubs and teams, Sapstead said: ""Certainly the figures as regards the prevalence of performance-enhancing substances at an amateur level are incredibly alarming. ""That said, it does confirm what UK Anti-Doping has long suspected and also seen through some of our intelligence-led testing. ""I don't think any sport can say that they don't have a problem at an amateur level. ""I think now is the time for everybody to sit up and acknowledge that this is a reality in every single sport and that you can't just be washing your hands of it or hoping that someone else will address it."" Sapstead also told BBC Sport: Ukad needs an extension of powers and extra cash from individual sports governing bodies to ""address what is fast becoming a crisis for sport"". There is a ""woeful lack of education"" at amateur level about the health risks of doping. There is a ""robust"" anti-doping programme in the UK, but it faces ""challenges"". Ukad works with police forces to target suppliers of drugs to amateur dopers. This video can not be played State of Sport: Can Ukad do more to tackle doping? Of the 79 people interviewed who had specifically taken anabolic steroids, 41% said improving performance was the main reason for taking them, followed by pain relief (40%) and improving how they look (34%). However, when this is widened out to include those who admitted taking other performance-enhancing substances, boosting results was no longer the primary reason. Only 25% of users overall claim they have taken substances with the intention of improving performance. Over half say they were primarily used for pain relief, while 17% say they were used to improve looks. ""I think there are clearly a group of individuals seeking to enhance their performance by taking prohibited substances,"" said Sapstead, ""and then there are others who were taking these substances because they have a body image problem, or actually because they think it's the done thing."" Younger people are the main users of anabolic steroids in amateur sport, according to the poll for BBC Sport. Among sports club members aged 18-34, 13% say they have taken steroids to support performance or recovery while playing. Not one interviewee aged 55 or over said they had used anabolic steroids. However, users aged between 35 and 54 are significantly more likely than those aged 18-34 to say pain relief is among the main reasons they have used steroids or other sports supplements. But there is hardly any difference in gender, with 9% of men admitted taking steroids, compared with 8% of women. And 71% of all those polled said they would not know where to get hold of anabolic steroids. Using steroids for image reasonsis a ""worrying"" problem among young people in Wales,according to the nation's social services and public health minister Rebecca Evans, who said in January: ""It's not just a problem in sport - it is a wider societal issue."" The law More than 50 types of anabolic steroids are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), the independent body responsible for the list of substances prohibited in sport. The possession of steroids, which are class C drugs, is not illegal under UK law as long as they are only for personal use. It is illegal, however, to supply them to other people. According to the poll, a wide range of substances - both legal and illegal - are taken by amateur sports men and women to support their performance or recovery. Performance-enhancing substances can also include recreational drugs and prescribed medications: 26% of amateur sports people say they have taken prescribed medications such as cortisone injections or asthma inhalers. 14% say they have taken recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA or cannabis. 8% say they have taken anabolic steroids such as nandrolone, testosterone or HGH. We also asked people about other substances they consumed while playing sport, including: energy drinks (68% had), pain-relief gels (60%), over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (59%) and protein shakes (46%). This video can not be played Amateur doper Dan Stevens: Were you ever scared of getting caught? Former amateur cyclist Dan Stevens was banned after refusing a test in 2014. He turned whistleblower but labelled Ukad's handling of his information""a catastrophic failure"". Responding to the BBC Sport poll, Stevens, 41, said: ""I think it is widespread in all ranks. I think it is widespread in celebrity, I think it is widespread in the beauty industry; I think it is certainly widespread in the sports industry. ""I also think it is just a way of modern day life - we are living in a pharmacised world."" Stevens said he took thyroxine and testosterone on prescription, and EPO out of ""curiosity"". ""I'd always been a clean athlete and this situation happened to me when I was 39 years old. That was enough to see a huge, huge gain. ""But the real thing for me wasn't really about racing - I didn't do a lot of racing on these substances. The main thing was curiosity. ""I don't think in the amateur ranks it is about winning. You've got a situation where someone is overweight, a little bit fat, need to lean down, get in shape. And they get in shape. ""They then get railroaded into doing a marathon or a long bike ride or some kind of competitive event and they improve their fitness levels again and they become a healthier individual and become more body conscious and more health-orientated."" More than a third of people (36%) who report consuming recreational drugs to support their performance while playing amateur sport have also taken steroids. Dr Lambros Lazuras, an assistant professor of social psychology at Sheffield Hallam University who studies doping behaviour, told BBC Sport that there is a ""pill-taking culture"" in amateur sport and general society, which can act as a ""gateway"" to stronger substances. ""There are people who engage in stacking practices, using as many as 10 substances at the same time,"" he explained. ""For these people, it's not what they use anymore, it's what they want to achieve."" This video can not be played Heart disease and mental health: What are the health risks of doping? ""The use of steroids, for example, has been associated with problems like heart disease, kidney failure and even sudden death,"" said Dr Lazuras. ""You're not just cheating, you're putting your life at risk. ""This is an emerging public health issue,"" claimed Dr Lazuras. ""You're using substances that are meant to treat diseases, and you're actually misusing them without any prescription. ""We push people into exercise because we want to promote the health benefits. We forget that people in most exercise settings might consider using substances. ""This is actually the dark side of exercise. You don't care about your health anymore. You care about your performance and how you look to other people - or yourself."" 10 weightlifters have been banned by Ukad since 2009 A British weightlifter who has served a doping ban told BBC Sport steroid abuse is rife at all levels in his sport and that the culture starts at amateur level. ""It begins in the gym,"" the weightlifter, who wishes to remain anonymous, said. ""In weightlifting it gets to the point where you're not growing anymore. You can train, train, train and not get anywhere. ""Every weightlifter will take steroids. Some of them are taking light stuff and some of them are really heavily using steroids  - it all depends how much money you have. ""Is it easy to buy bread in the shop? That's how easy it is to get steroids in the UK. ""If you're not taking steroids, basically you're nowhere in the competition, you're not going to get anywhere really. ""I'm really proud of how they fight steroids in England. But the problem is, why are England losing? England won't cheat. ""I've been caught because I didn't think that somebody would come to my house. I left taking steroids one month before competition and I never ever thought somebody would come to my house and test."" ""I can't do something that I really love. Only because I've been cheating with steroids, come on. It's like I killed somebody. I'm not even an Olympic sportsman."" Lewis Conlin, 32, a publisher from Buckinghamshire, used a supplement containing the banned substance DMAA when he started weight-training in his early 20s. DMAA is an amphetamine-derived substance banned from sale in the UK and named on Wada's prohibited list. It has been linked with high blood pressure, tightening of the chest, stroke, heart attacks and even death,according to,externalthe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. ""In terms of the energy and focus that I got, it was the best pre-workout supplement I'd ever had,"" Conlin, who was weight-training four or five days per week with friends, told BBC Sport. ""You felt invincible, you felt you could do anything, you were just completely zoned out. You'd stare at a weight and go and lift it. That was great. Afterwards wasn't so great. ""About three hours later you would have a crash and you'd have a real comedown. I'd be depressed and I'd be ratty, happy just to keep myself in isolation and then later on that day I was getting chest pains. ""I would have trouble sleeping and would have heart palpitations - but that didn't actually stop me from taking it the next day. The training I was doing was so high and so intense I just wanted to have that every day. ""Had I known at the time exactly what DMAA did to your blood pressure and your heart rate then there is no way I would have carried on taking it."" More drug testing among amateur sports people is a ""waste of time"", according to one amateur cyclist who received a two-year ban for missing a post-race drugs test. It would cost too much money and detract from focusing on drug use in the professional ranks, he added. ""I don't see the point at all,"" said the Briton, who asked to remain anonymous. ""What effect is it going to have on anything, unless it is something like a national championship where people can move on in the professional ranks and actually earn a living from it? It is a problem then because you're actually affecting people's lives. ""How far do you go - do you want to test people for doing a fun run? It's up to them if they want to do whatever they want to do, in my opinion,"" he said. ""If you want to catch someone then catch the right people - like the people that win the Tour de France and get away with it. ""But then that's too much politics and money involved. They would rather get someone that doesn't mean anything because it is easy."" Ukad has an annual budget of around Â£7m, mainly state funding. A single drug test costs around Â£350. Ukad directs the vast majority of its testing to elite sport, with Sapstead saying: ""I would love to able to address the issues that we see at an amateur level, but the reality is we just don't have the resources to do that. ""I strongly believe a further investment needs to be paid from sport, whether that's from a levy on ticket sales - some contribution into a greater integrity pot of money, that's distributed not just to anti-doping, but anti-corruption bodies. ""Someone somewhere needs to put their hand in their pocket and their money where their mouth is, and start to help pay for us to do this job, and do it as effectively and efficiently as possible. ""Cheating impacts against the people you are competing against. So it doesn't matter if you're an Olympian, or a Paralympian, and it doesn't matter if you don your trainers at a weekend for a fun run. ""Actually, you're competing, and therefore it absolutely matters that everyone is toeing the line and playing a fair game."" BBC Sport - using ComRes to conduct the poll - interviewed 1,025 British adults, who are members of sports clubs, teams or gyms, online, between 27 and 31 January 2017.
