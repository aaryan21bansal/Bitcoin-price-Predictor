"The Late Late Show has been a fixture on US television for years Entertainment giants CBS and Viacom are to merge in the latest media mega-deal as broadcasters adapt to changing consumer demands. The new company will have $28bn in revenue and comprise brands like MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures. The deal would reunite the two firms, which were previously under the same corporate umbrella until a 2006 split. The move comes amid an increasingly competitive landscape dominated by Netflix, Disney-Fox and other rivals. The merged firm, to be called ViacomCBS, would be controlled by National Amusements, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari. There have been at least three attempts to re-combine the companies, but all failed due to clashes between executives and investors over who got the top jobs as well as the valuations of the business. There was also the dramatic fall of CBS's boss Les Moonves,ousted after allegations of sexual misconduct. Viacom chief executive Bob Bakish will be the president and chief executive of the combined company. Joe Ianniello, interim chief executive of CBS, will be named chairman and chief of CBS. The companies said,externalthey expected about $500m cost savings from the tie-up, which brings together a movie studio, string of cable channels, and some of US TV's most-watched shows, including 60 Minutes and The Big Bang Theory. In addition to their US operations, the merged group will have a global reach, including in Britain, Argentina and Australia. ""I am really excited to see these two great companies come together so that they can realise the incredible power of their combined assets,"" said Shari Redstone, who will chair the new company, ViacomCBS. The daughter of Sumner Redstone said: ""My father once said 'content is king,' and never has that been more true than today. We will establish a world-class, multiplatform media organisation that is well-positioned for growth in a rapidly transforming industry."" Mr Redstone broke up CBS and Viacom 14 years ago. He believed it would unlock the value of Viacom, which was broadcasting some of TV's most popular shows at a time when CBS was becoming less popular. Shari Redstone had been a big backer of re-combining the companies in the face of tough competition. The mergers of Disney with Fox,  and AT&T and Time Warner, coupled with expanding streaming services, left CBS and Viacom in a weaker position.

"Budget airline Norwegian Air has said it will end flights between Ireland and the US next month, blaming the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. ""We have concluded these routes are no longer commercially viable,"" it said. Norwegian, which has struggled to make a profit,said last monththe grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane could undo its plan to return to profitability. Norwegian said all six routes from Dublin, Cork and Shannon to the US and Canada would end on 15 September. Boeing's 737 Max fleet was grounded after two fatal crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March. In total 346 people were killed. Norwegian Air chief executive steps down Norwegian Air seeks cash injection ""Since March, we have tirelessly sought to minimise the impact on our customers by hiring replacement aircraft to operate services between Ireland and North America. However, as the return to service date for the 737 Max remains uncertain, this solution is unsustainable,"" said Matthew Wood, senior vice president of Norwegian's long-haul division. The airline said any customers who already had flights booked would be rerouted onto other Norwegian services. If passengers no longer wanted to travel with the airline, Norwegian said they would be offered a full refund. ""We will continue to offer scheduled services from Dublin to Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen as normal,"" said Mr Wood. The airline said any redundancies resulting from the decision to end the Ireland-US routes would be ""a last resort"". ""Our 80 Dublin-based administrative staff at Norwegian Air International and Norwegian Group's asset company, Arctic Aviation Assets, will not be affected by the route closures,"" Mr Wood added. Norwegian Air was founded in 1993 as a small domestic airline, but changed strategy in 2002 to become a budget carrier. Its low fares have helped it grow rapidly, and it is now Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier. Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff. Its big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport. It has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa,according to figures from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.,external However, that growth has come at the expense of profits. The airline lost 1.45bn kroner (Â£135m) last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft. In March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft.

"This video can not be played Graeme Stenhouse said the Apprentice Boys had no prior knowledge of the uniform worn by Clyde Valley Flute Band The Apprentice Boys of Derry have said they recognise the potential upset caused to nationalists by a Parachute Regiment emblem worn by a visiting flute band during a parade in the city. They said they had no prior knowledge of the uniform worn by Clyde Valley Flute Band during Saturday's march. The Larne group wore a Parachute Regiment insignia on their shirts as they paraded, bearing the letter 'F'. Police escorted them during the parade, and later stopped the band's bus. The Apprentice Boys governor said on Tuesday night that the Apprentice Boys were unaware of the incident until after the parade. PSNI defends loyalist parade tactics Petrol bombs thrown at police in Londonderry Thousands in Derry for Apprentice Boys parade ""We had no prior knowledge of the band's uniform, or this incident, until the conclusion of the main parade on Bond Street,"" he said. ""We recognise this may have caused upset to many in the nationalist community."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the Apprentice Boys statement as a ""positive step that will contribute to healing in the city"". ""It is welcome and demonstrates the kind of leadership that Derry and the north needs right now,"" he added. Mr Stenhouse added that the main focus of the parade is to commemorate the 1689 Siege of Derry. He said it should in no way be used as a means to ""heighten tensions in a shared city"". The governor again rejected claims that an agreement about symbols supporting the Parachute Regiment had been put in place before the march. ""This agreement never took place,"" he said. ""We would never place our marshals under such difficult circumstances."" Members of Clyde Valley Flute Band from Larne wore the symbol with the letter 'F' on their shirts Mr Stenhouse said the police were ""heavy handed"" in how they dealt with the band and that he would discuss the matter further with local police commanders. ""A lot of hard work has been contributed to ensuring peaceful parades over many years,"" he said. ""We wish to continue with this constructive dialogue to ensure that good will and understanding prevails. ""We also wish to ensure our city continues to lead in promoting reconciliation and is a model of respect to all communities."" This video can not be played Arlene Foster said the policing of an Apprentice Boys parade in Londonderry was not balanced. Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said that a lot of loyalists are concerned by the police approach. ""It is important that everybody in the community in Northern Ireland has support for the police service. That's a fundamental of our society,"" she said. ""Therefore it concerns us greatly if there's a perception building that there isn't that confidence in policing. It's something that we are very concerned about."" The DUP and UUP met PSNI officials separately to discuss Saturday's policing operation. UUP leader Robin Swann, who led his party's delegation, said ""intervention could've been handled in a completely different way"". This video can not be played UUP leader Robin Swann ""The deployment of the TSG (Tactical Support Group), in my opinion, was uncalled for, unnecessary, and obviously too early because they should have given the elected representatives and stewards from the Apprentice Boys of Derry an opportunity to see what resolution could have come about before the TSG was deployed,"" he added. Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said he ""listened carefully to all the strong concerns that have been raised"" and that there will be a full debrief of the force's actions. Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. This video can not be played Apprentice Boys: Police parade approach 'kept people safe' An ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, is facing prosecution for two murders. Relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday said the band's display caused great hurt. ""People are very angry about what happened,"" said John Kelly, whose brother, Michael, was killed on Bloody Sunday. ""The way we look at it, and I'm talking about the families, and the people of Derry, we found it very, very provocative."" Members of the Apprentice Boys, one of the Protestant Loyal Orders, made their way around the city's historic walls accompanied by bands Police said an agreement had been put in place before the march, and officers flanked the band during the parade. But DUP MP Gregory Campbell shared Mr Stenhouse's opinion that there was no such agreement. Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said the insignia display by the band had caused ""deep anger in the city"". ""Ahead of Saturday's parade, assurances were given that there would be no Parachute Regiment or Soldier F imagery involved but this agreement was broken,"" she said. ""Subsequent Apprentice Boys denials of such an agreement do not stand up to scrutiny, and are in direct contravention of the accounts from the PSNI and the Bogside Residents Group."" Responding to criticism of how police handled the incident,Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd it was ""proportionate, responsible and constructive"". The Parades Commission said it had received a number of complaints regarding the Apprentice Boys parade. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, laid a wreath at the cenotaph in Derry on Saturday Clyde Valley Flute Band said that the symbol on their shirts was an expression of ""a legitimately held view which they are entitled to hold"". ""The officers of the band wish to correct any false impression which may be held regarding the band's uniform being deliberately provocative and specifically designed for the parade in Londonderry,"" the band said in a statement. Mr Stenhouse earlier said he would be willing to meet the Bloody Sunday families and other community representatives. ""I'm more than willing to meet them if that's something that they wish to do,"" he said. ""What the Apprentice Boys have achieved over the last 20 years is taking things forward by talking to different communities. ""That's why we do have very successful parades now in the Maiden City. We'll discuss with other community representatives and if there's some hard, straight talking to be done, then that's something that we'll have to do.""

"The Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has told the BBC that unemployment ""could go up"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. She also said the prime minister and cabinet should remember parliament could not be ignored in a push towards what she said was a ""far inferior"" no-deal Brexit. The cabinet minister said she was delighted withTuesday's record employment figures, which showed wages rising faster than prices for nearly a year and a half. But after her apparent U-turn on no deal ahead of rejoining the cabinet under Boris Johnson, Ms Rudd cautioned against both ignoring the Commons and setting an election date to avoid a parliamentary say on no deal. Reminded that she had previously said shutting down parliament would be a ridiculous thing to do, Ms Rudd said she remained ""a great admirer of parliament and of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""I will continue to argue for the executive of the government that I'm part of to work with parliament, not against them,"" she said. Asked if she could back a situation where an election was held on purpose so that parliament did not have its say on no deal, she said there had been a lot of speculation. ""I will play my part in cabinet and privately with the prime minister and with ministers in arguing strongly for respecting parliamentary sovereignty. ""And you know, I'm a member of parliament. The prime minister and all cabinet members are members of parliament. We need to remember where our authority comes from."" Ms Rudd was speaking to the BBC in her first full interview after rejoining the cabinet, on a visit to female engineers working on the Thames Tideway infrastructure project. She said she was ""jealous"" of ""every single pound"" of the Â£2bn of new money earmarked towards no-deal Brexit preparations and wanted to see more money going towards universal credit and ending the benefits freeze. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a no-deal scenario that showed Â£9bn extra in welfare spending and a 400,000 reduction in employment. Ms Rudd said she did not accept the specific numbers, and said the government was focused on putting in place measures to mitigate any job losses. ""Government is certainly aware that if we do have a no-deal exit, there will be adverse consequences. [Unemployment] could go up, yes. And I would much prefer to see us get a deal"". Asked why her cabinet colleagues were gung ho for an outcome that could hit workers' jobs, she replied: ""I don't think people are gung ho - certainly not the people I sit with in cabinet. We know that no deal is a far inferior prospect than a deal"".

"This video can not be played The ex-chancellor says removing the Irish border 'backstop' is a ""wrecking tactic"" Former Chancellor Philip Hammond has accused the PM of trying to wreck the chance of a new Brexit deal, by making demands the EU could never accept. In a Times article,,externalMr Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would be ""a betrayal"" of the 2016 referendum result. He told the BBC he was ""confident"" that Parliament ""has the means"" to express its opposition to a no-deal exit. A No 10 source said the UK would leave on 31 October despite Mr Hammond's ""best efforts to the contrary"". The source added that Mr Hammond, as chancellor, ""did everything he could"" to block preparations for leaving and had ""undermined negotiations"". The former chancellor rejected this suggestion in a tweet, saying he wanted to deliver Brexit ""and voted to do so three times"". Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU with a deal, but the UK must leave ""do or die"" by the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October. He wants the EU to ditch theIrish border backstop planfrom the deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May, which was rejected three times by Parliament. This video can not be played Last week Boris Johnson said the EU should show 'common sense' on Brexit But the EU has continued to insist that deal, including the backstop arrangements, is the only agreement possible. Many of those who voted against the deal had concerns over the backstop, which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Who are Boris Johnson's key advisers? Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hammond said a no-deal exit would be ""just as much a betrayal of the referendum result as not leaving at all"". He said that Mr Johnson's demand for the backstop to be entirely removed from the deal meant a no-deal was inevitable on the current 31 October deadline. He said that agreeing to changes now would ""fragment"" the EU, adding: ""they are not going to take that risk"". ""Pivoting to say the backstop has to go in its entirety - a huge chunk of the withdrawal agreement just scrapped - is effectively a wrecking tactic,"" he said. He also told Today that he was ""very confident"" MPs would be able to pass legislation to express their opposition to a no-deal exit. However he said he did not favour the tactic of replacing the PM with a national unity government designed to prevent no deal, saying: ""I don't think that's the answer"". In his Times article, Mr Hammond said ""the unelected people who pull the strings of this government know that this is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to."" BBC political correspondent Tom Barton said that remark was an apparent aim at the prime minister's closest adviser, Dominic Cummings - the former Vote Leave campaign director. It was a ""travesty of the truth"", Mr Hammond wrote, to pretend that Leave voters backed a no-deal Brexit in the 2016 referendum. But Leave-supporting former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, also speaking on the Today programme, said he was ""astounded"" by Mr Hammond's remarks. ""Talk about hubris. This man did nothing to prepare us for leaving with no deal,"" he said. ""The fact we are now doing that means we have a much better chance to get some kind of agreement from them because they now know we're going to leave with no deal and he's undermining that."" Mr Hammond's comments come as Downing Street said it expected a group of MPs to try to block a no-deal Brexit by attempting to pass legislation when Parliament returns next month. The Daily Telegraph reports,externalthat Commons Speaker John Bercow told an audience at the Edinburgh Fringe festival that he ""strongly"" believes the House of Commons ""must have its way"". He said he would ""fight with every breath in my body"" any attempt by the prime minister to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal against MPs' wishes. Amber Rudd says the government shouldn't work against MPs by suspending Parliament On Tuesday, Work and Pensions SecretaryAmber Rudd urged Mr Johnson not to force througha suspension. She told the BBC: ""I remain a great admirer of Parliament and of parliamentary sovereignty and I will continue to argue for the executive of the government that I'm part of to work with Parliament, not against them."" Meanwhile, 20 other senior Tory MPs have written to the prime minister to say his demand to scrap the Irish backstop ""set the bar so high that there is no realistic probability of a deal being done"". The MPs said they were ""alarmed by the 'Red Lines' you have drawn which, on the face of it appear to eliminate the chance of reaching agreement with the EU"". The group also demands that Mr Johnson declares he is firmly committed to leaving the EU with a deal and is ready to compromise to get one - pointing out those were assurances he gave during the leadership campaign ""both publicly and privately"". Seven other former cabinet ministers have signed the letter, including David Lidington, David Gauke, Rory Stewart and Greg Clark, all of whom resigned before Mr Johnson took office.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to leave the EU ""do or die"" by the 31 October - the date the UK must depart if no deal has been reached. But a government document outlining ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" in the event of such a no-deal Brexit has warned of rising food and fuel prices, disruption to medicine supplies and public disorder. An extra Â£2.1bn of funding has been announced to help deal with the consequences of no deal. How could you be affected if the UK does leave the EU without an agreement? What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects. Almost 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more scarce and more expensive in the event of no deal. Thefive-page document spelling out the government's worst-case assumptions under Operation Yellowhammer,external- the government's no-deal contingency plan - warns: Some fresh food supplies will decrease Key ingredients for food made in the UK may be in shorter supply There won't be a shortage of food overall, but there could be reduced availability and choice Prices may also increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" Supermarkets themselves have warned thatthere could be empty shelves and higher prices. In preparation, supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg. Stockpiling is more of a challenge at this time of year too, businesses say, aswarehouse capacity is already strained by the seasonal stock build-up ahead of Black Friday and Christmas,external. The government has said it will continue to recognise EU standards for imported food, to minimise disruption. It has alsopublished a ""tariff schedule"",,externalwhich has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of no deal. Shoppers planning to buy from companies based in the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland after a no-deal Brexit have also been warnedcredit and debit card charges may be higher and payments may take longer,external. Government advice for the food and drink sector,external Government advice on buying things from Europe after Brexit,external What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal impact? Although there is not expected to be an immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies, there arelikely to be significant price rises,externalfor businesses and households, the government's Yellowhammer report warns. The market price for electricity could climb because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, but also as a result of cutting ties with EU energy markets. Yellowhammer warned this could mean that some energy firms ""exit"" the energy market, ""exacerbating"" the economic and political impact of Brexit. The warnings echo the findings of a 2017 House of Lords report, which saidthe UK could be ""more vulnerable to supply shortages,externalin the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  46%UK domestic production 45%Imported via European pipelines, inc from Russia and Norway 8%Liquefied natural gas imports The risk would arise as a result of the UK's exit from the EU's Internal Energy Market, it said. The bulk of the UK's natural gas imports come via Norway, which is part of the Internal Energy Market, although it is not an EU member. But the government says trade in gas between the UK and Norway will continue in its current form regardless. Brexit 'could leave UK short of energy' Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe. If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork. Travel to Ireland will not change, even if there's no deal. You'll continue to be able to travel and work there in the same way as before. Passports The government isadvising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months,externalif you are travelling to most countries in Europe - thefull list is here,external. Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document. But the government has now warned that this time carried over may not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit. You can check if your passport has enough time leftwith this government tool.,external You'll need torenew your passport before travelling,externalif you do not have enough validity left. It usually takes three weeks. Visas You won't need a visa for stays of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period in the EU or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (the European Economic Area). However, you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, or to work or study. When new rules are confirmed, information about visa requirements will be oneach country's travel advice page.,external Border control The government has also advised that at EU borders you may need to: show a return or onward ticket show you have enough money for your stay use separate queueing lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens The government's Yellowhammer report also warns there may also be increased immigration checks at EU borders causing delays at airports and ports. European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, thenin theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist. The government is advising travellers ""whether there's a deal or not"" to ""get appropriate travel insurance with healthcare cover"". Ministers say it is ""particularly important"" to get travel insurance with the right cover if you have a pre-existing medical condition.,externalThis is because the EHIC scheme covers pre-existing conditions, while many travel insurance policies do not. Travel However you intend to travel, in the event of no-deal Brexit, the government says, you should check before you leave for any delays or disruption. If you intend to drive in the EU, you'll need some extra documents: a ""green card"", which proves your insurance provides the minimum required cover (obtained from your vehicle insurance company) a GB sticker an International Driving Permit for some countries (you cancheck if you need one,externalon the Post Office website) The government says flights, ferries and cruises, the Eurostar and Eurotunnel and bus and coach services between the UK and the EU will continue to run as normal. An earlier government assessment hadwarned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK,external, but Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensuretheir services run as smoothly as possible. However, the government does warn some bus and coach services to non-EU countries, such as Switzerland or Andorra, may not be able to run. Pets After Brexit you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme and will instead need to follow adifferent process, involving a number of vet's tests,external. The process could take up to four months. Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway,the government has warned that it may become more expensive.,external Full government travel advice,external How will it affect my holidays to Europe? While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there areconcerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse. The government's Yellowhammer document warns supplies of medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at Channel ports. While some products can be stockpiled, others can't because of their short shelf life, it says. More than 12,000 medicines are used by the NHS, andabout 7,000 come from or via the EU. Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU. The government has announced a further Â£434m of funding and other measures, including: extra warehouse space for medicines securing additional roll-on, roll-off freight capacity in ports away from Dover and Folkestone building buffer stocks booking plane space for products requiring immediate shipment making changes to regulatory requirements strengthening processes to deal with shortages However, the National Audit Office has said there are still""significant"" gapsin the government's preparation regarding the NHS and care homes. Government advice on medicine supply,external Should NHS patients be worried? About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries. The UK government has requested that EU countries reciprocate its promise to uphold the rights of EU citizens in the UK, meaning UK citizens living in the EU would be able to continue their lives broadly as now. In event of no deal, this would ensure they would have continued access to employment, healthcare, education, benefits and other services. However, the government's Yellowhammer document warns that as UK nationals will lose their EU citizenship, they can ""expect to lose associated rights and access to services over time"". The government has announced a public information campaign and an increase in consular support for Britons living abroad, costing Â£138m. It advises UK citizens living in the EU to subscribe to updates from the relevantcountry advice pages.,external Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU with no deal. This will depend on decisions made by each country. However, the UK government says it is seeking bilateral agreements to maintain healthcare rights, as a top priority. Its Yellowhammer report warns that whileEU countries should treat people with urgent needs, they may be required to pay. This could mean some people facing ""substantial costs"".,external Information on how to access healthcare abroad,externalcan be found on the NHS website. Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU. Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements, which apply to EU countries. These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income or gain - and determine which country has primary taxing rights. Full government advice for UK nationals living in the EU,external How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? Drivers UK nationals who live in the EU, European Economic Area or Switzerland should swap their UK driving licences for a local licence before 31 October 2019. If there is no deal, licence exchange arrangements may stop and UK licence holders may have to retake their driving test in the country where they live. The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK. There are currently 2.37 million EU nationals working in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). The ONS has revised its estimates for overall arrivals to the UK - both from the EU and the rest of the world. Those new figures show the number of people arriving from the EU had been rising before the referendum. Statisticians have not yet adjusted the figures for EU immigration after 2016, but unrevised figures showed a steep decline. If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has atool to find out what you need to do and when.,external Government advice on applying for settled and pre-settled status,external Home Office minister Brandon Lewis has warned thatthe UK will deport EU citizensafter Brexit if they do not apply for the right to remain in time. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure. As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU. But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply. UK businesses will need to apply the same processes to EU trade that apply when trading with the rest of the world. Individuals may also have to pay VAT, duty and fees if they receive parcels worth more than Â£135. In March,the government published a 1,477-page documentoutlining its plans for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In October it published anupdate,externalto the plans which trade minister Conor Burns said are designed to support the UK economy. A tariff is a tax applied to goods that are traded on international markets. Mostly, they are applied to imported goods by the country importing them. But there can also be tariffs on exported goods. Under the temporary scheme, 88% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access. At the moment, 80% of imports are tariff free. Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture. Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection. How will the new tariff system work? Government guide to no-deal tariffs,external Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market. UK house pricesrose at a slower rate in the year to July than at any time since September 2012,according to the Office of National Statistics. Brexit uncertainty meant key aspects of the housing market were""pretty much flatlining"", the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said. The Bank of England says theimpact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant. It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a ""disorderly Brexit"". In July, the Office for Budget responsibility estimated a possible 10%fall in house prices,externalby 2021 in the event of no-deal. But bad news for homeowners might be better news for first time buyers trying to get a foot on the property ladder. Will the value of your home change in 2019? Up to85% of lorries using the main channel crossings ""may not be ready"" for French customs and could face queues of two-and-a-half days,,externalthe government's Yellowhammer report warns. These queues at Channel ports could reduce the flow of trucks to 40-60% of current levels within a day, it says, with the worst disruption lasting up to three months. Even after that time, traffic flows may only reach 50-70% of current levels and delays could lead to queues in Kent and other routes to France for significantly longer, the report said. A simple guide to the UK leaving the EU A jargon-busting guide to the key terms In the event of bottlenecks, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20. Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side. If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used. Kent County Council says it hasemployed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal. To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The government has also announced Â£344m more funding to be spent on new border and customs operations. Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17. UK universities say they would expecta similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.,external The government and the EU have agreed thatpeople who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them,external. This is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK. The government has also issued a ""guarantee"" that funding will be available to UK organisations who have had Erasmus applications approved by the European Commission at the time the UK departs, but which have not yet begun. Institutions are beingadvised to apply for this ""HMG guarantee"",externalto ensure they get the funding.

"The Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has told the BBC that unemployment ""could go up"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. She also said the prime minister and cabinet should remember parliament could not be ignored in a push towards what she said was a ""far inferior"" no-deal Brexit. The cabinet minister said she was delighted withTuesday's record employment figures, which showed wages rising faster than prices for nearly a year and a half. But after her apparent U-turn on no deal ahead of rejoining the cabinet under Boris Johnson, Ms Rudd cautioned against both ignoring the Commons and setting an election date to avoid a parliamentary say on no deal. Reminded that she had previously said shutting down parliament would be a ridiculous thing to do, Ms Rudd said she remained ""a great admirer of parliament and of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""I will continue to argue for the executive of the government that I'm part of to work with parliament, not against them,"" she said. Asked if she could back a situation where an election was held on purpose so that parliament did not have its say on no deal, she said there had been a lot of speculation. ""I will play my part in cabinet and privately with the prime minister and with ministers in arguing strongly for respecting parliamentary sovereignty. ""And you know, I'm a member of parliament. The prime minister and all cabinet members are members of parliament. We need to remember where our authority comes from."" Ms Rudd was speaking to the BBC in her first full interview after rejoining the cabinet, on a visit to female engineers working on the Thames Tideway infrastructure project. She said she was ""jealous"" of ""every single pound"" of the Â£2bn of new money earmarked towards no-deal Brexit preparations and wanted to see more money going towards universal credit and ending the benefits freeze. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility released a no-deal scenario that showed Â£9bn extra in welfare spending and a 400,000 reduction in employment. Ms Rudd said she did not accept the specific numbers, and said the government was focused on putting in place measures to mitigate any job losses. ""Government is certainly aware that if we do have a no-deal exit, there will be adverse consequences. [Unemployment] could go up, yes. And I would much prefer to see us get a deal"". Asked why her cabinet colleagues were gung ho for an outcome that could hit workers' jobs, she replied: ""I don't think people are gung ho - certainly not the people I sit with in cabinet.

"Budget airline Norwegian Air has said it will end flights between Ireland and the US next month, blaming the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. ""We have concluded these routes are no longer commercially viable,"" it said. Norwegian, which has struggled to make a profit,said last monththe grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane could undo its plan to return to profitability. Norwegian said all six routes from Dublin, Cork and Shannon to the US and Canada would end on 15 September. Boeing's 737 Max fleet was grounded after two fatal crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March. In total 346 people were killed. Norwegian Air chief executive steps down Norwegian Air seeks cash injection ""Since March, we have tirelessly sought to minimise the impact on our customers by hiring replacement aircraft to operate services between Ireland and North America. However, as the return to service date for the 737 Max remains uncertain, this solution is unsustainable,"" said Matthew Wood, senior vice president of Norwegian's long-haul division. The airline said any customers who already had flights booked would be rerouted onto other Norwegian services. If passengers no longer wanted to travel with the airline, Norwegian said they would be offered a full refund. ""We will continue to offer scheduled services from Dublin to Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen as normal,"" said Mr Wood. The airline said any redundancies resulting from the decision to end the Ireland-US routes would be ""a last resort"". ""Our 80 Dublin-based administrative staff at Norwegian Air International and Norwegian Group's asset company, Arctic Aviation Assets, will not be affected by the route closures,"" Mr Wood added. Norwegian Air was founded in 1993 as a small domestic airline, but changed strategy in 2002 to become a budget carrier. Its low fares have helped it grow rapidly, and it is now Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier. Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff. Its big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport. It has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa,according to figures from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.,external However, that growth has come at the expense of profits. The airline lost 1.45bn kroner (Â£135m) last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft. In March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft.

"The Late Late Show has been a fixture on US television for years Entertainment giants CBS and Viacom are to merge in the latest media mega-deal as broadcasters adapt to changing consumer demands. The new company will have $28bn in revenue and comprise brands like MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures. The deal would reunite the two firms, which were previously under the same corporate umbrella until a 2006 split. The move comes amid an increasingly competitive landscape dominated by Netflix, Disney-Fox and other rivals. The merged firm, to be called ViacomCBS, would be controlled by National Amusements, the holding company owned by billionaire Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari. There have been at least three attempts to re-combine the companies, but all failed due to clashes between executives and investors over who got the top jobs as well as the valuations of the business. There was also the dramatic fall of CBS's boss Les Moonves,ousted after allegations of sexual misconduct. Viacom chief executive Bob Bakish will be the president and chief executive of the combined company. Joe Ianniello, interim chief executive of CBS, will be named chairman and chief of CBS. The companies said,externalthey expected about $500m cost savings from the tie-up, which brings together a movie studio, string of cable channels, and some of US TV's most-watched shows, including 60 Minutes and The Big Bang Theory. In addition to their US operations, the merged group will have a global reach, including in Britain, Argentina and Australia. ""I am really excited to see these two great companies come together so that they can realise the incredible power of their combined assets,"" said Shari Redstone, who will chair the new company, ViacomCBS. The daughter of Sumner Redstone said: ""My father once said 'content is king,' and never has that been more true than today. We will establish a world-class, multiplatform media organisation that is well-positioned for growth in a rapidly transforming industry."" Mr Redstone broke up CBS and Viacom 14 years ago. He believed it would unlock the value of Viacom, which was broadcasting some of TV's most popular shows at a time when CBS was becoming less popular. Shari Redstone had been a big backer of re-combining the companies in the face of tough competition. The mergers of Disney with Fox,  and AT&T and Time Warner, coupled with expanding streaming services, left CBS and Viacom in a weaker position.

"City have been fined Â£315,000 by Fifa for breaches of article 19 on international transfers of under-18s Manchester City have avoided a transfer ban after admitting breaching Fifa rules on signing youth players. The Premier League champions have been fined 370,000 Swiss Francs (Â£315,000). Fifa said City breached article 19 of its regulations: ""International transfers of players are only permitted if the player is over the age of 18."" City say the breaches, which all occurred before December 2016, were as a result of ""misinterpretation of the regulations in question"". Chelsea werebannedfrom signing players for two transfer windows for a similar rule breach - but the club are appealing to have that overturned. City said the rule breach was in relation to players on trial and their participation in friendly games, and that the club had been ""fully compliant"" since. The club also said they ""co-operated fully"" with Fifa's investigation. ""The club accepts responsibility for the breaches which arose as a result of misinterpretation of the regulations in question,"" said City. Last year, two players from Ghana's Right to Dream football academy - Sierra Leone's George Davies and Ghanaian Dominic Oduro - told Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten that they signed for City and played in youth matches before they turned 18. ""The Fifa disciplinary committee has sanctioned English club Manchester City FC for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18,"" said football's world governing body in a statement. ""Manchester City FC was found to have breached, among others, article 19 of the Fifa Regulations on the status and transfer of players. ""The disciplinary committee took into account the fact that Manchester City FC accepted its responsibility and sanctioned the club with a fine of CHF 370,000."" Chelsea weresanctioned by Fifa,externalin February for breaching rules in relation to 29 youth players, and were fined Â£460,000 in addition to their transfer ban. In June the Blues, who were not allowed to make any signings in the summer transfer window, announced they were taking their appeal to theCourt of Arbitration for Sport, having failed with their first appeal to Fifa. In May 2017, City werebannedfrom signing academy players for two years and fined Â£300,000 after breaching Premier League transfer rules. The club are currently being investigated by Uefa for alleged financial fair play violations. Fifa bans the international transfer of under-18s unless they meet strict criteria. It brought in the rules to help protect children from exploitation and trafficking. Under-18s can only be transferred abroad if: The player's parents move to the country in which the new club is located for non-footballing reasons. Both clubs are in the European Union or European Economic Area and the player is aged between 16 and 18. Even then, the buying club must meet more criteria relating to education, training, living conditions and support. They live within 100km of the overseas club.

"The UK is ""first in line"" for a trade deal with the US, President Trump's national security adviser has said. John Bolton said the US supported a no-deal Brexit and added Washington would propose an accelerated series of trade deals. Mr Bolton claimed deals could be done on a ""sector-by-sector"" basis, with an agreement on manufacturing made first. However, critics warned the UK would have to give in to some US demands in return for any trade agreement. His comments came after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson at No 10. According to Mr Bolton, a bilateral agreement or ""series of agreements"" could be carved out ""very quickly, very straight-forwardly"". A trade deal for financial services and agriculture would not be the first to be agreed, he added. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? Who is John Bolton? Mr Bolton said ""doing it in pieces"" was not unprecedented and the US understood the importance of doing as much as possible as rapidly as possible before the 31 October exit date. He said there would be enthusiastic bipartisan support in Congress for speedy ratification at each stage. Mr Johnson said there ""all sorts"" of opportunities for UK business in the US, particularly service companies, but the negotiations will be a ""tough old haggle"". ""The single biggest deal we need to do is a free trade deal agreement with our friends and partners over the Channel,"" he said. But Nancy Pelosi, who leads the Democrats in the US House of Representatives, said inApril that a US-UK trade deal would not be ""on the cards""if Brexit damaged the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. Asked whether his proposed plan would follow World Trade Organisation rules, Mr Bolton said ""our trade negotiators seem to think it is"". And he insisted the UK was ""constantly at the front of the trade queue"" for the Trump administration. By BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker There is a problem with sector-by-sector trade agreements. They are not compatible with WTO rules, which say free trade agreements for goods should cover ""substantially all the trade"". There is no formal definition of that term but a figure of 90% has often been suggested. It is unlikely a deal covering a few sectors would qualify. Other WTO members could start a dispute and would, on the face of it, have every chance of winning. However, it does not mean it would be impossible. WTO rules are not enforceable in national courts so if the UK and the US wanted to go ahead they probably could. But it would be a strange move for any country committed to the rules-based global trade system that has the WTO at its heart. There is another problem for any trade agreement: whether it meets the ""substantially all the trade"" criterion or not, it would need to be ratified by the US Congress. There is a substantial body of American legislators who would be likely to vote against it if they thought that Brexit had taken place in a way that posed a danger to the peace process and the open border on the island of Ireland. Mr Bolton also referenced Mr Johnson's willingness to participate in Operation Sentinel, which aims to beef up the military presence in the Gulf in the face of tensions between the West and Iran, saying he was ""pleased"" as this ""reflects a change"" from Theresa May's government. Meanwhile, former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw described Mr Bolton as ""dangerously bellicose"", and suggested the UK would have to agree to some US demands, for example allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken. ""This is a highly transactional administrationâ¦ you don't get something for nothing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The EU currently bans chlorine-washed chicken products on welfare grounds Lewis Lukens, a former deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in London and former acting US ambassador, said Mr Bolton was aligned to President Trump's ""America first agenda"" and would be making ""strong demands"" on the UK to back the US position on issues like Huawei, China and Iran. Mr Johnson is expected to have his first face-to-face meeting as prime minister with Mr Trump later this month at the G7 summit in France. By BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins It would be hard to find a more enthusiastic champion of Brexit than John Bolton: a thoughtful, intellectual, highly combative and controversial champion of the nation state. He caused havoc as US ambassador to the United Nations between 2005 and 2006 with his open rejection of the UN's usefulness except where it served the direct interests of the US. So it should be no surprise that he told us at a briefing during his London visit: ""Britain's success in successfully exiting the European Union is a statement about democratic rule and constitutional government that's important for Britain, but it's important for the United States too."" He stressed it was very much in the US interest and there was no ""quid pro quo"" with any other issues. By that, he was denying all suggestions that Britain would be expected to fall into line with Washington's Iran policy - although he clearly hoped that it might. Likewise, he welcomed Mr Johnson's position on Huawei and 5G technology, calling it ""Britain going back to square one"" and re-examining the issue. For now, Mr Bolton said, Britain was entirely focused on Brexit. The US is willing to wait. But that does leave open many questions about future relations and possible political trade-offs with the United States. If Mr Bolton's major intervention in trade negotiations has raised some eyebrows, the National Security Advisor had a forthright answer to that. He pointed us to the National Security Act of 1947 and told us firmly that his remit includes economic security, because the security of a nation depends fundamentally on its prosperity.

"A new system designed to tackle fraud in online shopping has been delayed for 18 months. Banks and retailers had been expected to introduce a new layer of security from mid-September. This would normally see a passcode sent to a customer's mobile phone at the point of checkout for online purchases of Â£28 or more. However, following pressure from the industry, the City regulator has effectively granted an 18-month delay. Open Banking 'revolution' to challenge banks' dominance Want to shop online? Best have a mobile signal Jonathan Davidson, from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ""The FCA has been working with the industry to put in place stronger means of ensuring that anyone seeking to make payments is not a fraudster. ""While these measures will reduce fraud, we want to make sure that they won't cause material disruption to consumers themselves, so we have agreed a phased plan for their timely introduction."" An estimated Â£671m was lost to fraud on UK payment cards in 2018, a 19% increase on the previous year. An EU directive called Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), to be adopted in the UK, was designed to cut this type of fraud. If an online shopper spent more than about Â£28 (â¬30 under the EU directive) in one transaction, payment providers would be required to ask for an extra form of verification, usually sent as a one-time password by text to a mobile phone. Alternative forms of verification could include a thumbprint on a smartphone or voice recognition. The same would apply once the shopper had made five separate payments of Â£28. Exemptions were also possible, such as if a retailer decided that the purchase was low risk, or the bank could prove to the regulator that it has a good record on fraud. However, there were strong complaints from retailers, payment providers and banks. which said that the system would slow the customer buying experience, and call into question saved details that allowed one-click transactions. Consumer groups also questioned how the system could work for people living in areas with a poor mobile signal, who would have difficulty receiving passcodes sent to their phones. The FCA, in line with European counterparts, is easing the mid-September deadline. The regulator said that it would not enforce the rules for a further 18 months, where providers could show evidence that they were ""taking steps"" to comply with the system. A lack of preparation, complexity of the system, and the potential impact on consumers were given as reasons for the delay. The FCA will also review the way the system is planned to work. Analysts said the decision would be met with relief in the affected industries. Jeremy Drew, co-head of retail at law firm RPC, said: ""Retailers are going to be delighted that the FCA is taking a pragmatic approach to enforcement of SCA.

"Wage growth in the UK reached an 11-year high in the year to June, and the employment rate was its joint highest since 1971, official figures show. Wage growth rose to 3.9%, while the estimated 76.1% employment rate was the best since comparative records began. Overall, a record high of 32.81 million people were in employment,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external This was 425,000 more than a year earlier and was largely because of more people working full-time. However, the unemployment rate in the April to June period showed a slight rise. Figures released last week indicated thatthe UK's economy shrank 0.2% in the second quarter of the year,the first contraction since 2012. Wages have been increasing at a faster pace than inflation since March 2018. The 3.9% increase in regular pay - which excludes bonuses - was up from last month's figure of 3.6%. Part of the reason for the rise was the unusual timing of annual pay rises for public health workers last year, when a larger-than-usual increase was deferred until July. In real terms (after adjusting for inflation), regular pay is estimated to have increased by 1.9%. Matt Hughes, the ONS deputy head of labour market statistics said: ""Excluding bonuses, real wages are growing at their fastest in nearly four years, but pay levels still have not returned to their pre-downturn peak."" The employment rate for women was 72.1% - the highest on record - and for men was 80.1%, slightly lower than the previous three-month period. Mr Hughes added: ""Employment continues to increase, with three-quarters of this year's growth being due to more women working. ""However, the number of vacancies has been falling for six months, with fewer now than there were this time last year."" The unemployment rate edged up slightly to 3.9%, which was a little lower than a year earlier. The economic inactivity rate, which is defined as people not in employment who have not looked for work in the past four weeks or cannot start in the next fortnight, was estimated at 20.7%, a joint record low. Chancellor Sajid Javid said: ""Every person deserves the chance to succeed and provide for their families through a steady income. ""Today's figures are another sign that despite the challenges across the global economy, the fundamentals of the British economy are strong as we prepare to leave the EU."" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures should silence any calls for a cut in interest rates. ""The labour market tends to lag developments in the wider economy,"" he said. ""Firms, however, have lived with high levels of economic uncertainty for the best part of a year, and still want to fill new positions. ""In the event that Brexit is delayed further... or an agreement is reached in October and the economy starts to rebuild a little momentum, the [Bank of England's] MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) will need to move in short order to raise the bank rate again."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that while the jobs market remained ""a source of strength for the UK economy"", it may be reaching its peak. ""As more workers have been snapped up, firms have found it harder to fill their openings. While competition has pushed up salaries, thin margins and low productivity may set a ceiling for pay growth. Although vacancies remain high by historic standards, the number has been dropping since the start of the year."" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The days of sharply falling unemployment are behind us, but a tight labour market points to further gains in wages and spending power. Despite a second quarter decline in growth, the UK economy still has momentum.""

"The US is delaying imposing tariffs on some imports from China until 15 December because of ""health, safety, national security and other factors"". The products include mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, and certain footwear and clothing. The surprise news from the United States Trade Representative,externaloffice sparked a rally in share prices. Other items facing a 10% tariff will go ahead as planned on 1 September. US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters, said that the delay was in part to avoid hitting US shoppers this Christmas. The USTR's announcement was released minutes after China's Ministry of Commerce said Vice Premier Liu He had conducted a phone call with US trade officials. US-China trade war in 300 words Technology investors welcomed news of the exemptions, pushing an index of chip stocks up 2.8%. Retailers and industrial shares also rose, with General Electric up 4.4%. On Wall Street, the three main share indexes were up more than 2% at one stage. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 finished 1.4% ahead, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq finished up 1.9% - led by a 4% rise in Apple. In the UK, stocks exposed to global trade also rose, with miner Glencore closing up 2.3%. Mr Trump said on 1 August he would impose a 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese goods, blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. He also personally criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to stem sales of the synthetic opioid fentanyl amid an opioid overdosing crisis in the US. But in a tweet on Tuesday, Mr Trump hinted that he was expecting something in return, suggesting that China's failure to ""buy big"" from US farmers could be about to change. The USTR's announcement comes amid growing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that fears of the US-China trade war leading to a recession were increasing. Some analysts said Tuesday's delay does not mean the trade war is over. Elena Duggar, associate managing director at credit rating agency Moody's, said: ""This seeming de-escalation in ongoing tensions may be a temporary reprieve... Relations between the world's two largest economies will remain contentious, punctuated with occasional steps towards compromise."" Earlier on Tuesday, China's chief trade negotiators, Vice Premier Liu He and Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, spoke to their US counterparts, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. The Xinhua news agency said that the Chinese officials issued ""a solemn protest"" against the punitive duties set to come into effect on 1 September. Mr Lighthizer and Mr Liu have scheduled another telephone call in two weeks. The two sides were due to hold another round of meetings in Washington in September, but the deterioration in relations in the past two weeks cast doubt on whether the talks would take place. Additional details and lists of the specific product types affected by the announcement are due to be published by USTR later.

"A couple who claim that the ""angel's share"" from a whisky bond has blighted their property have been given the go-ahead to take the case to court. Thomas and Gail Chalmers claim that the vapour has caused damage to outdoor furniture and their house in Bonnybridge, near Falkirk. The couple are suing drinks giant Diageo for Â£40,000. The firm is contesting the Court of Session action, claiming the property's value is not adversely affected. The ""angel's share"" is the term given to the loss of whisky volume, into the wooden cask and through evaporation, as the spirit matures. Up to 2% can enter the atmosphere a year. In the action, the couple, from the town's Woodlea Gardens, claim that the ""nuisance"" of the ethanol vapour has caused a black fungus on houses in the area. They say the fungus has also attacked wooden garden furniture, paving stones and damaged a sundeck. Theissue was first raised,externalmore than a decade ago. The couple maintain that the value of their house has been reduced by between 5 and 10% because of the effects of the fungus on properties. They also said their cars were affected by the fungus. Diageo claims that the blackening complained of does not cause serious disturbance, substantial inconvenience or material damage and property values are not affected. The firm previously tried to have the claim dismissed but a judge rejected the move and a second bid to get the case thrown out has been rejected. It will now go to an evidential hearing.

"Along with the pomp, protests and politics, President Trump's visit to the UK brought renewed debate about whether a post-Brexit trade deal between the two countries could involve opening up the NHS to US companies. Speaking at a press conference, President Trump said that ""when you're dealing with trade, everything's on the table -  so the NHS or anything else"". He quickly rowed back, saying he did not consider the NHS to be part of trade - though not before MPs from across the political spectrum had come out to say the health service was ""not for sale"". The question is what ""for sale"" would actually mean. As health think tank the Nuffield Trust points out, ""a trade deal would not have the power to stop the NHS being a free, universal service"". But could greater market access to the health service for US companies be up for negotiation? The NHS is funded by government through taxes. Decisions about how to spend money and how to deliver care are made by public bodies, not operating for profit. But there are already various opportunities for private companies - including US firms - to win business within the NHS. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. All drugs and equipment have to be bought from the private sector, and the UK imports about Â£2bn of pharmaceutical products a year from the US - 9% of total drug imports in 2018. And while the vast majority of care is done by staff directly employed by the NHS, the health service also pays private companies to deliver some care, which is still free for patients at the point of use. That might be via a contract to run a specific service, like an immunisation programme, or under a rolling agreement with a private hospital that they will take on some NHS patients for elective surgeries like hip and knee replacements. Trump- 'NHS on the table in US-UK trade deal' - BBC News Trump rows back on NHS trade remarks US companies can already bid for these kinds of contracts. It's worth pointing out that health is a devolved matter and there are different commissioning arrangements in place around the UK. There are a number of US companies working in the NHS, particularly in England, though on a fairly small scale. The biggest private providers of NHS services at the moment are British, while companies from Australia, South Africa, the EU and elsewhere also deliver some services. US healthcare giant UnitedHealth has an offshoot company in the UK called Optum. It gathers and analyses data on population health, which is then used to help make decisions about which services to buy in. It doesn't run any clinical services, although its parent company UnitedHealth did run six GP practices until 2011. HCA Healthcare, also known as the Hospital Corporation of America, runs some private hospitals, mainly in London. HCA runs the private Portland Hospital, birthplace of celebrities' babies and royals including Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie It says that less than 1% of the care it provides is to NHS patients, ""predominantly where we have provided additional capacity to the NHS when they are faced with increased pressures in their hospitals."" It has three ""joint ventures"" with the NHS in London and Manchester, where it provides paid-for treatment for private patients within an NHS hospital. HCA pays the NHS for use of the hospital space. The Acadia Group, which owns the Priory chain of hospitals, again mainly does private work in the UK. But it does have beds for NHS patients in 87 of its hospitals, which provide a range of mental health services including for addiction and eating disorders. The UK currently opens up its market, including public services, to competition as part of the EU single market. That means companies can use competition law to sue the NHS. This was taken further in England by the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which says that contracts have to be put out to competitive tender. Under EU law, though, there are explicit protections for health services which a judge has to take into consideration if a dispute between a foreign company and a member state gets to court. It's possible the US would want a trade deal that didn't include these kinds of protections, according to Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It's also possible, according to Prof McKee, that the US negotiators could use a trade deal as an opportunity to push for more favourable contracts in the NHS, for example contracts allowing them to only treat less complex and more lucrative patients, leaving the NHS with the most challenging and expensive cases. Whether the UK would agree to this is a different matter. Campaigners in London protesting against the US-EU trade deal known as TTIP This was a sticking point in the negotiations over an EU-US trade deal - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - which failed. The US wanted to be able to use an Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) process which is very commonly used in international treaties. It means that if an investor in a country feels it is being discriminated against, it can take that country to an arbitration panel to seek compensation. The concern from campaign groups in the UK at the time was that this process would be closed and not as transparent as if it had to go through the courts. These are all issues which would be likely to become relevant again in any future trade negotiations. Independent MP Sarah Wollaston told the BBC that President Trump's recent comments still left the door open for drug prices being part of trade negotiations. She referred to comments by the US health secretary on CNBC last year that the country would use trade talks to ""pressure"" other countries to pay more for their drugs. A document from the Office of the US Trade Representative in February, setting out negotiating objectives with the UK, includes a section on pharmaceuticals mentioning ""full market access for US products"". Jane Lethbridge, director of the Public Services International Research Unit at the University of Greenwich, says drug companies could use trade talks as an opportunity to lobby for more influence on decision-making. For example, they could attempt to influence the fixed cost per benefit price the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) uses to decide whether a drug should be commissioned in the NHS, opening up a market for more US drugs. And they could seek to push up drug prices. In the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal, the US negotiated greater protections for new drugs it develops, stopping competition from other companies to develop generic versions of them for longer periods, keeping prices higher. It remains to be seen what the US would ask for as part of trade negotiations, but it would still be the case that the NHS as a large single buyer has a lot of clout to negotiate prices.

"Bosses of more than 50 retailers including Asda and Boots have written to the chancellor urging him to change tax rules to boost the UK High Street. The group said it wanted him to fix the ""broken business rates system"", which it called outdated. It said the tax had jumped by 50% since the 1990s and had contributed to some retailers going out of business. The Treasury said it had announced a Â£3.6bn fund last month ""to support our High Streets and town centres"". ""The chancellor will announce further details of the government's policy programme in the coming weeks and months,"" it added. In the letter to the chancellor, co-ordinated by the British Retail Consortium trade body, the group pointed out that the retail sector accounted for 5% of the economy but paid 25% of all business rates, a property-based tax. It said ""this disparity"" was damaging High Streets and ""harming the communities they support"". As a result, the group said there was a growing number of empty shops, with vacancy rates at a four-and-a-half year high. Empty shops hit highest level for four years The town battling the High Street blues Business rates are a tax on properties used for business. They are charged by the local council, but set by central government. The tenants or owners of offices, shops, pubs, and warehouses all pay business rates. James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's a really outdated system, it's designed for a time when there only was physical retail, and people doing business from physical premises. That has been changing for a long time. ""The biggest thing is the way it's a disincentive to investment - so if you take a retail shop and you improve it, you put in things that are not just important to the business, but are probably important to that community, like CCTV, solar panels perhaps, bringing in a cash machine, that sees your business rates bills significantly increase. ""Now surely it should be the other way round. We should be encouraging and incentivising investment, rather than penalising businesses for it."" Among other things, the group wants businesses in London and the South East to pay more business rates to take pressure off firms in the North and the Midlands. However, it also said it wanted to avoid a tax rise overall. ""The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit appears to be increasing, which we believe would place a considerable strain on retailers in the UK,"" says the letter. ""In this context, the prime minister's intention to pursue an economic package to boost business and investment in the UK is crucially important; we strongly believe that reform of the broken business rates system should be front and centre of that package."" Retailers employ three million people in the UK which makes the industry the UK's largest private sector employer, according to the British Retail Consortium. The retail sector is not alone in asking for concessions to help it prepare for a potential no-deal Brexit. The UK food industry, for example, has asked the government to waive aspects of competition lawto allow firms to co-ordinate and direct supplies with each other after a no-deal Brexit. On the other hand, government funding to help UK companies cope with a possible no-deal Brexit customs system has had a ""concerningly low"" take-up,the BBC's Newsnight programme reported last week. In December, the Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs unveiled an Â£8m training fund which companies and trade intermediaries, such as freight forwarders, could apply for, but just 741 companies have applied for the grants.

"This video can not be played Graeme Stenhouse said the Apprentice Boys had no prior knowledge of the uniform worn by Clyde Valley Flute Band The Apprentice Boys of Derry have said they recognise the potential upset caused to nationalists by a Parachute Regiment emblem worn by a visiting flute band during a parade in the city. They said they had no prior knowledge of the uniform worn by Clyde Valley Flute Band during Saturday's march. The Larne group wore a Parachute Regiment insignia on their shirts as they paraded, bearing the letter 'F'. Police escorted them during the parade, and later stopped the band's bus. The Apprentice Boys governor said on Tuesday night that the Apprentice Boys were unaware of the incident until after the parade. PSNI defends loyalist parade tactics Petrol bombs thrown at police in Londonderry Thousands in Derry for Apprentice Boys parade ""We had no prior knowledge of the band's uniform, or this incident, until the conclusion of the main parade on Bond Street,"" he said. ""We recognise this may have caused upset to many in the nationalist community."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the Apprentice Boys statement as a ""positive step that will contribute to healing in the city"". ""It is welcome and demonstrates the kind of leadership that Derry and the north needs right now,"" he added. Mr Stenhouse added that the main focus of the parade is to commemorate the 1689 Siege of Derry. He said it should in no way be used as a means to ""heighten tensions in a shared city"". The governor again rejected claims that an agreement about symbols supporting the Parachute Regiment had been put in place before the march. ""This agreement never took place,"" he said. ""We would never place our marshals under such difficult circumstances."" Members of Clyde Valley Flute Band from Larne wore the symbol with the letter 'F' on their shirts Mr Stenhouse said the police were ""heavy handed"" in how they dealt with the band and that he would discuss the matter further with local police commanders. ""A lot of hard work has been contributed to ensuring peaceful parades over many years,"" he said. ""We wish to continue with this constructive dialogue to ensure that good will and understanding prevails. ""We also wish to ensure our city continues to lead in promoting reconciliation and is a model of respect to all communities."" This video can not be played Arlene Foster said the policing of an Apprentice Boys parade in Londonderry was not balanced. Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said that a lot of loyalists are concerned by the police approach. ""It is important that everybody in the community in Northern Ireland has support for the police service. That's a fundamental of our society,"" she said. ""Therefore it concerns us greatly if there's a perception building that there isn't that confidence in policing. It's something that we are very concerned about."" The DUP and UUP met PSNI officials separately to discuss Saturday's policing operation. UUP leader Robin Swann, who led his party's delegation, said ""intervention could've been handled in a completely different way"". This video can not be played UUP leader Robin Swann ""The deployment of the TSG (Tactical Support Group), in my opinion, was uncalled for, unnecessary, and obviously too early because they should have given the elected representatives and stewards from the Apprentice Boys of Derry an opportunity to see what resolution could have come about before the TSG was deployed,"" he added. Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin said he ""listened carefully to all the strong concerns that have been raised"" and that there will be a full debrief of the force's actions. Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. This video can not be played Apprentice Boys: Police parade approach 'kept people safe' An ex-paratrooper, known as Soldier F, is facing prosecution for two murders. Relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday said the band's display caused great hurt. ""People are very angry about what happened,"" said John Kelly, whose brother, Michael, was killed on Bloody Sunday. ""The way we look at it, and I'm talking about the families, and the people of Derry, we found it very, very provocative."" Members of the Apprentice Boys, one of the Protestant Loyal Orders, made their way around the city's historic walls accompanied by bands Police said an agreement had been put in place before the march, and officers flanked the band during the parade. But DUP MP Gregory Campbell shared Mr Stenhouse's opinion that there was no such agreement. Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said the insignia display by the band had caused ""deep anger in the city"". ""Ahead of Saturday's parade, assurances were given that there would be no Parachute Regiment or Soldier F imagery involved but this agreement was broken,"" she said. ""Subsequent Apprentice Boys denials of such an agreement do not stand up to scrutiny, and are in direct contravention of the accounts from the PSNI and the Bogside Residents Group."" Responding to criticism of how police handled the incident,Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd it was ""proportionate, responsible and constructive"". The Parades Commission said it had received a number of complaints regarding the Apprentice Boys parade. Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graeme Stenhouse, laid a wreath at the cenotaph in Derry on Saturday Clyde Valley Flute Band said that the symbol on their shirts was an expression of ""a legitimately held view which they are entitled to hold"". ""The officers of the band wish to correct any false impression which may be held regarding the band's uniform being deliberately provocative and specifically designed for the parade in Londonderry,"" the band said in a statement. Mr Stenhouse earlier said he would be willing to meet the Bloody Sunday families and other community representatives. ""I'm more than willing to meet them if that's something that they wish to do,"" he said. ""What the Apprentice Boys have achieved over the last 20 years is taking things forward by talking to different communities. ""That's why we do have very successful parades now in the Maiden City. We'll discuss with other community representatives and if there's some hard, straight talking to be done, then that's something that we'll have to do.""

"Part of last summer's parade as part of Pride Cymru in Cardiff A campaigner has called for Pride Cymru to reject support from a company that has donated money to US politicians ""working against"" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. Peter Tatchell claimed General Electric (GE) support for Wales' biggest LGBT festival in Cardiff was inappropriate. He said this was because it had backed politicians criticised by an LGBT advocacy group for their voting record. GE said it was ""committed"" to promoting human rights and diversity. Pride Cymru added that it worked with corporate partners to ""raise awareness of challenges faced by the LGBT+ community"". The annual event, which takes place later this month, expects to attract around 50,000 people over three days, with live acts including Liberty X, Texas and Atomic Kitten. GE is among a group of official ""supporters"", who make smaller donations rather than being one of the main event sponsors. Research by US journalist Judd Legum,externalfound that nine companieswho have been given the highest possible rating by the American Human Rights Campaign (HRC),external, an LGBT advocacy group, had donated more than $1m to politicians who had themselves been given the lowest possible rating by the HRC, based on their voting record on LGBT matters. Mr Legum told BBC Wales: ""The point was to show that the companies that on the outside try to project a very gay-friendly vibe - behind the scenes they're financing the politicians who are working to undermine LGBTQ rights so I do think there's a hypocrisy there that needed to be exposed."" One of the companies identified was GE, which is also a big investor in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. GE Aviation employs around 1,400 people at its maintenance plant at Nantgarw near Caerphilly. Peter Tatchell during Pride in London last month Mr Tatchell, a veteran gay rights and human rights activist, said it was not appropriate for the company to support Pride Cymru. ""I've got no objection in principle to corporations funding pride events, providing they're ethically vetted to make sure they're ethical companies that do not invest in countries that criminalise homosexuality and they do not fund organisations and politicians that work against LGBT rights,"" he said. ""I hope Pride Cymru will reconsider their acceptance of General Electric sponsorship. It's not ethical and it's not appropriate."" Garbielle 'gutted' after Pride gig cancelled Pride Cymru: Then and now 'Huge distance' travelled in LGTB issues in Wales But Gian Molinu, chair of Pride Cymru said he was ""disappointed"" with Mr Tatchell's criticism, and felt it was important for the charity to work with multinational companies. ""By engaging with them, we are working to break down barriers and we are ensuring that they listen to the voices of the LGBT+ community,"" he said. ""Although this can be problematic, especially with organisations that operate on a larger, international scale, it's necessary that we do not shy away from approaching and working with those organisations."" He added: ""We cannot campaign for change and become an inclusive society by avoiding relationships and conversations with global organisations."" A GE spokesman said it operated in 180 countries that all had ""unique political systems and domestic complexities"". He added: ""We are committed to promoting human rights, diversity and ethical practices within our operations and supply chain. ""We believe our engagement helps drive toward human progress through technological improvement, transparency and workforce development. ""GE is an equal opportunities employer with an active alliance dedicated to supporting and developing our LGBT employees.""

"Bosses of more than 50 retailers including Asda and Boots have written to the chancellor urging him to change tax rules to boost the UK High Street. The group said it wanted him to fix the ""broken business rates system"", which it called outdated. It said the tax had jumped by 50% since the 1990s and had contributed to some retailers going out of business. The Treasury said it had announced a Â£3.6bn fund last month ""to support our High Streets and town centres"". ""The chancellor will announce further details of the government's policy programme in the coming weeks and months,"" it added. In the letter to the chancellor, co-ordinated by the British Retail Consortium trade body, the group pointed out that the retail sector accounted for 5% of the economy but paid 25% of all business rates, a property-based tax. It said ""this disparity"" was damaging High Streets and ""harming the communities they support"". As a result, the group said there was a growing number of empty shops, with vacancy rates at a four-and-a-half year high. Empty shops hit highest level for four years The town battling the High Street blues Business rates are a tax on properties used for business. They are charged by the local council, but set by central government. The tenants or owners of offices, shops, pubs, and warehouses all pay business rates. James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's a really outdated system, it's designed for a time when there only was physical retail, and people doing business from physical premises. That has been changing for a long time. ""The biggest thing is the way it's a disincentive to investment - so if you take a retail shop and you improve it, you put in things that are not just important to the business, but are probably important to that community, like CCTV, solar panels perhaps, bringing in a cash machine, that sees your business rates bills significantly increase. ""Now surely it should be the other way round. We should be encouraging and incentivising investment, rather than penalising businesses for it."" Among other things, the group wants businesses in London and the South East to pay more business rates to take pressure off firms in the North and the Midlands. However, it also said it wanted to avoid a tax rise overall. ""The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit appears to be increasing, which we believe would place a considerable strain on retailers in the UK,"" says the letter. ""In this context, the prime minister's intention to pursue an economic package to boost business and investment in the UK is crucially important; we strongly believe that reform of the broken business rates system should be front and centre of that package."" Retailers employ three million people in the UK which makes the industry the UK's largest private sector employer, according to the British Retail Consortium. The retail sector is not alone in asking for concessions to help it prepare for a potential no-deal Brexit. The UK food industry, for example, has asked the government to waive aspects of competition lawto allow firms to co-ordinate and direct supplies with each other after a no-deal Brexit. On the other hand, government funding to help UK companies cope with a possible no-deal Brexit customs system has had a ""concerningly low"" take-up,the BBC's Newsnight programme reported last week. In December, the Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs unveiled an Â£8m training fund which companies and trade intermediaries, such as freight forwarders, could apply for, but just 741 companies have applied for the grants.

"Parents said they spent hundreds of pounds per child on their school uniform It's the time of year when many parents are buying their children's school uniform, which some say can cost more than Â£200. What can they do to make it cheaper? Research by market analysts Mintel suggests British parents spend about Â£1.2bn on clothing and equipment for school. The Department for Education (DfE)asked 1,183 parents about uniform costs in 2015,externaland found it came to almost Â£213 per child. Adjusting its figures for inflation, it would make the average cost of uniform in 2019 almost Â£230 per pupil. What parents recalled spending Â£230Average spend on uniform (excluding PE kit) Â£259Secondary school girl Â£249Secondary school boy Â£217Primary school girl Â£207Primary school boy Adding in PE kit, the parents surveyed spent the equivalent to Â£70 more for primary school children and between Â£111 and Â£140 extra for those of secondary school age. The results were based on parents' memories of how much they had spent during the school year. Separate estimates from The Children's Society in 2018 put the total cost of uniform at Â£256 per primary school child and Â£338 per secondary school pupil. Yvonne Hall created a swap group after experiencing the ""huge expense"" of buying uniforms One way of cutting the cost is to swap uniform with other parents. Thousands of people are members of social media groups that do this. Yvonne Hall, 38, from Stockton-on-Tees, set up a Facebook group for parents to donate used school uniforms. Her 16-year-old son changed schools in the first term of last year and Mrs Hall said she found herself with ""another hefty uniform bill"" of about Â£100 on top of the cost of the old uniform. ""I decided to donate the brand new uniform my son had only worn for a week on Facebook and it was snapped up instantly,"" she said. The page now has parents sharing uniforms, PE kits and revision guides. A sample of 100 Facebook groups set up in Britain and containing the words ""school uniform"" and ""swap"" or ""free"" showed they had 34,110 members between them, an average of more than 340 each.

Councils say they are finding it ""increasingly difficult"" to help parents with uniform costs Hackney Council spent Â£72,300 on school uniform grants in 2018-19. Manchester City Council spent Â£208,529 on school uniform grants in 2014-15 but stopped offering them the following year. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said funding cuts from central government had resulted in councils finding it ""increasingly difficult"" to provide grants for school uniforms.

InNorthern Ireland,externalfunding varies from Â£35.75 to Â£56 depending on the age of the child. The BBC compared school clothing on the websites of four large UK supermarkets and found the average prices were about Â£58 less for a primary school uniform and Â£118 less for a secondary school uniform than in the government's survey of parents. The saving is likely to be higher as the analysis is based only on buying one of each item, excluding any spares parents would typically purchase. It also depends on whether schools would permit parents to use supermarket uniform or whether they have to have items with the school's logo. Suppliers of school uniforms said their costs were lower than the estimates in the government's survey. A spokeswoman for Price and Buckland said uniforms should be affordable for everyone, adding: ""We work with some schools that offer pupil premium and offer vouchers to parents to support them with purchasing uniform."" Michael Franklin from National School Uniforms said supermarket clothing, while cheaper, was generally ""far inferior to the norm"", with bespoke items lasting ""three times as long"". Carolyn Budding from YourSchoolUniform.com said schools should take out contracts with single suppliers, who could ""offer more competitive prices"". ""This is contrary to government advice to schools to offer a choice of suppliers,"" she said. MP Emma Hardy wants parents to be allowed to buy uniform from any shop Emma Hardy, Labour MP for West Hull and Hessle and a former primary school teacher, said schools needed to ""poverty proof"" their uniform policies and remove the need for clothing with school branding so they could be bought ""from any shop"".

"This video can not be played Electric vehicles account for more than 2% of all cars and vans on the road in Orkney Orkney is leading the charge on electric vehicles, with one of the highest uptakes in the UK. As BBC Scotland continues its season of special news coverage on the ""climate emergency"", we look at changes needed in transport and what could be learned from islanders. When it comes to energy, Orkney is in the fast lane. The islands produce more power than they're able to consume, so diverting some of that into electric vehicles (EVs) seems an obvious move. The likes of the Nissan Leaf or Renault Zoe are a more frequent sight here than any other part of Scotland - you'll even see the odd Tesla. But despite their prevalence, are people here really bought in? The idea of owning an electric vehicle in the future appeals to newly qualified driver Charlotte Baird For newly qualified driver Charlotte Baird from Houton, EVs offer the environmental credentials that many young people seek. But their hefty price tag can mean they are financially out of reach. Charlotte's petrol car cost her just Â£600. On an EV test drive she told me: ""This is a lot more smooth and a lot less noisy. ""It will also help the local environment because there's no pollution. ""When I get the money I'll come and get one. Maybe when I've been to college and I've got a few years under my belt."" The council in Orkney has been able to pack lots of charging infrastructure into a relatively small area You might think plug-in cars would best be suited to city driving where average journeys are just a few miles. But despite being rural and remote the longest journey in Orkney from north to south is about 60 miles. How to tackle Scotland's 'climate emergency' Ten ways to act on climate change Scotland to set 'faster' climate change target So the council can pack lots of charging infrastructure into a relatively small area. Orkney now has well over 200 fully electric vehicles, more than 2% of the total cars and vans on the road. It costs about Â£2/Â£3 to travel 100 miles in a fully electric car compared with Â£10 or more for petrol or diesel Most of them have been sold by Jonathan Porterfield, from his business Ecocars, based at home near Evie. He believes interest is growing fast and says some customers even buy online, without a test drive. ""The demand has just gone off the scale in the last 12 to 18 months as more and more people realise that this is an option,"" he said. ""People just want to get into an electric car, initially to save money but then for the feel-good factor of doing their little bit for the environment as well."" Orkney Islands Council claims to have one of the highest proportions of electric cars in the country. Orkney is home to what is thought to be the first fully electric vehicle in Scotland to be converted into a motorhome For our journey, I travelled in a fully electric vehicle thought to be the first in Scotland to be converted into a motorhome. Owner Paul Hudd, from JP Orkney, explained: ""People have fed back how easy it is to drive an electric vehicle, how easy the automatic gearbox is. ""From a camping perspective they like the fact that it fits into the environment really well."" Orkney has long been a pioneering place when it comes to energy. The longest journey in Orkney from north to south is about 60 miles Wind power to the national grid started here in the 1950s and in the last decade they've been harnessing the waves and tide. The local authority is even trialling electric vans with hydrogen tanks which can charge the battery on the move and extend the range. While public charging is free across Scotland, here that incentive has just been abolished. But it still costs only Â£2/Â£3 to travel 100 miles in a fully electric car compared with Â£10 or more for petrol or diesel. ""As you put the infrastructure in, the costs need to be met, whether that be electricity, maintenance, fees and charges etc. It's many tens of thousands of pounds,"" said Darren Richardson from Orkney Islands Council. The council in Orkney has now introduced a fee for recharging ""What the council has done is take a decision to introduce a charge. Not to make any profit. It's just a cost recovery model. ""At the moment we're supported by government in terms of the capital costs - the cost of putting in the chargers - and we hope that continues. ""But it's inescapable there is a running cost and I think that's an area we need to look at very closely because we want this to grow and we want it to be incentivised so that people continue to use electric vehicles. ""Councils generally face challenges financially and we need to recover costs unless they were subsidised by government."" But how will large scale behaviour change come about? Prof Iain Black from the University of Stirling explained: ""We're all lazy and we'll change to those things when we have to and when it's no longer convenient for us. ""That's where the government comes in, in making it much more convenient for us to drive electric cars and also putting a lot of pressure on the businesses, the car manufacturers, to develop the machines that we need."" Electric cars are clearly still a specialist vehicle. But Orkney offers a window into the future for all of us. With manufacturers already planning for a tipping point away from fossil fuels, the question is not ""if"" but ""when"" it will happen.

James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's a really outdated system, it's designed for a time when there only was physical retail, and people doing business from physical premises. That has been changing for a long time. ""The biggest thing is the way it's a disincentive to investment - so if you take a retail shop and you improve it, you put in things that are not just important to the business, but are probably important to that community, like CCTV, solar panels perhaps, bringing in a cash machine, that sees your business rates bills significantly increase. ""Now surely it should be the other way round. We should be encouraging and incentivising investment, rather than penalising businesses for it."" Among other things, the group wants businesses in London and the South East to pay more business rates to take pressure off firms in the North and the Midlands.

"Along with the pomp, protests and politics, President Trump's visit to the UK brought renewed debate about whether a post-Brexit trade deal between the two countries could involve opening up the NHS to US companies. Speaking at a press conference, President Trump said that ""when you're dealing with trade, everything's on the table -  so the NHS or anything else"". He quickly rowed back, saying he did not consider the NHS to be part of trade - though not before MPs from across the political spectrum had come out to say the health service was ""not for sale"". The question is what ""for sale"" would actually mean. As health think tank the Nuffield Trust points out, ""a trade deal would not have the power to stop the NHS being a free, universal service"". But could greater market access to the health service for US companies be up for negotiation? The NHS is funded by government through taxes. Decisions about how to spend money and how to deliver care are made by public bodies, not operating for profit. But there are already various opportunities for private companies - including US firms - to win business within the NHS. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. All drugs and equipment have to be bought from the private sector, and the UK imports about Â£2bn of pharmaceutical products a year from the US - 9% of total drug imports in 2018. And while the vast majority of care is done by staff directly employed by the NHS, the health service also pays private companies to deliver some care, which is still free for patients at the point of use. That might be via a contract to run a specific service, like an immunisation programme, or under a rolling agreement with a private hospital that they will take on some NHS patients for elective surgeries like hip and knee replacements. Trump- 'NHS on the table in US-UK trade deal' - BBC News Trump rows back on NHS trade remarks US companies can already bid for these kinds of contracts. It's worth pointing out that health is a devolved matter and there are different commissioning arrangements in place around the UK. There are a number of US companies working in the NHS, particularly in England, though on a fairly small scale. The biggest private providers of NHS services at the moment are British, while companies from Australia, South Africa, the EU and elsewhere also deliver some services. US healthcare giant UnitedHealth has an offshoot company in the UK called Optum. It gathers and analyses data on population health, which is then used to help make decisions about which services to buy in. It doesn't run any clinical services, although its parent company UnitedHealth did run six GP practices until 2011. HCA Healthcare, also known as the Hospital Corporation of America, runs some private hospitals, mainly in London. HCA runs the private Portland Hospital, birthplace of celebrities' babies and royals including Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie It says that less than 1% of the care it provides is to NHS patients, ""predominantly where we have provided additional capacity to the NHS when they are faced with increased pressures in their hospitals."" It has three ""joint ventures"" with the NHS in London and Manchester, where it provides paid-for treatment for private patients within an NHS hospital. HCA pays the NHS for use of the hospital space. The Acadia Group, which owns the Priory chain of hospitals, again mainly does private work in the UK. But it does have beds for NHS patients in 87 of its hospitals, which provide a range of mental health services including for addiction and eating disorders. The UK currently opens up its market, including public services, to competition as part of the EU single market. That means companies can use competition law to sue the NHS. This was taken further in England by the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which says that contracts have to be put out to competitive tender. Under EU law, though, there are explicit protections for health services which a judge has to take into consideration if a dispute between a foreign company and a member state gets to court. It's possible the US would want a trade deal that didn't include these kinds of protections, according to Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It's also possible, according to Prof McKee, that the US negotiators could use a trade deal as an opportunity to push for more favourable contracts in the NHS, for example contracts allowing them to only treat less complex and more lucrative patients, leaving the NHS with the most challenging and expensive cases. Whether the UK would agree to this is a different matter. Campaigners in London protesting against the US-EU trade deal known as TTIP This was a sticking point in the negotiations over an EU-US trade deal - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - which failed. The US wanted to be able to use an Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) process which is very commonly used in international treaties. It means that if an investor in a country feels it is being discriminated against, it can take that country to an arbitration panel to seek compensation. The concern from campaign groups in the UK at the time was that this process would be closed and not as transparent as if it had to go through the courts. These are all issues which would be likely to become relevant again in any future trade negotiations. Independent MP Sarah Wollaston told the BBC that President Trump's recent comments still left the door open for drug prices being part of trade negotiations. She referred to comments by the US health secretary on CNBC last year that the country would use trade talks to ""pressure"" other countries to pay more for their drugs. A document from the Office of the US Trade Representative in February, setting out negotiating objectives with the UK, includes a section on pharmaceuticals mentioning ""full market access for US products"". Jane Lethbridge, director of the Public Services International Research Unit at the University of Greenwich, says drug companies could use trade talks as an opportunity to lobby for more influence on decision-making. For example, they could attempt to influence the fixed cost per benefit price the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) uses to decide whether a drug should be commissioned in the NHS, opening up a market for more US drugs. And they could seek to push up drug prices. In the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal, the US negotiated greater protections for new drugs it develops, stopping competition from other companies to develop generic versions of them for longer periods, keeping prices higher. It remains to be seen what the US would ask for as part of trade negotiations, but it would still be the case that the NHS as a large single buyer has a lot of clout to negotiate prices.

"Part of last summer's parade as part of Pride Cymru in Cardiff A campaigner has called for Pride Cymru to reject support from a company that has donated money to US politicians ""working against"" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. Peter Tatchell claimed General Electric (GE) support for Wales' biggest LGBT festival in Cardiff was inappropriate. He said this was because it had backed politicians criticised by an LGBT advocacy group for their voting record. GE said it was ""committed"" to promoting human rights and diversity. Pride Cymru added that it worked with corporate partners to ""raise awareness of challenges faced by the LGBT+ community"". The annual event, which takes place later this month, expects to attract around 50,000 people over three days, with live acts including Liberty X, Texas and Atomic Kitten. GE is among a group of official ""supporters"", who make smaller donations rather than being one of the main event sponsors. Research by US journalist Judd Legum,externalfound that nine companieswho have been given the highest possible rating by the American Human Rights Campaign (HRC),external, an LGBT advocacy group, had donated more than $1m to politicians who had themselves been given the lowest possible rating by the HRC, based on their voting record on LGBT matters. Mr Legum told BBC Wales: ""The point was to show that the companies that on the outside try to project a very gay-friendly vibe - behind the scenes they're financing the politicians who are working to undermine LGBTQ rights so I do think there's a hypocrisy there that needed to be exposed."" One of the companies identified was GE, which is also a big investor in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal. GE Aviation employs around 1,400 people at its maintenance plant at Nantgarw near Caerphilly. Peter Tatchell during Pride in London last month Mr Tatchell, a veteran gay rights and human rights activist, said it was not appropriate for the company to support Pride Cymru. ""I've got no objection in principle to corporations funding pride events, providing they're ethically vetted to make sure they're ethical companies that do not invest in countries that criminalise homosexuality and they do not fund organisations and politicians that work against LGBT rights,"" he said. ""I hope Pride Cymru will reconsider their acceptance of General Electric sponsorship. It's not ethical and it's not appropriate."" Garbielle 'gutted' after Pride gig cancelled Pride Cymru: Then and now 'Huge distance' travelled in LGTB issues in Wales But Gian Molinu, chair of Pride Cymru said he was ""disappointed"" with Mr Tatchell's criticism, and felt it was important for the charity to work with multinational companies. ""By engaging with them, we are working to break down barriers and we are ensuring that they listen to the voices of the LGBT+ community,"" he said. ""Although this can be problematic, especially with organisations that operate on a larger, international scale, it's necessary that we do not shy away from approaching and working with those organisations."" He added: ""We cannot campaign for change and become an inclusive society by avoiding relationships and conversations with global organisations."" A GE spokesman said it operated in 180 countries that all had ""unique political systems and domestic complexities"". He added: ""We are committed to promoting human rights, diversity and ethical practices within our operations and supply chain. ""We believe our engagement helps drive toward human progress through technological improvement, transparency and workforce development. ""GE is an equal opportunities employer with an active alliance dedicated to supporting and developing our LGBT employees.""

"This video can not be played Electric vehicles account for more than 2% of all cars and vans on the road in Orkney Orkney is leading the charge on electric vehicles, with one of the highest uptakes in the UK. As BBC Scotland continues its season of special news coverage on the ""climate emergency"", we look at changes needed in transport and what could be learned from islanders. When it comes to energy, Orkney is in the fast lane. The islands produce more power than they're able to consume, so diverting some of that into electric vehicles (EVs) seems an obvious move. The likes of the Nissan Leaf or Renault Zoe are a more frequent sight here than any other part of Scotland - you'll even see the odd Tesla. But despite their prevalence, are people here really bought in? The idea of owning an electric vehicle in the future appeals to newly qualified driver Charlotte Baird For newly qualified driver Charlotte Baird from Houton, EVs offer the environmental credentials that many young people seek. But their hefty price tag can mean they are financially out of reach. Charlotte's petrol car cost her just Â£600. On an EV test drive she told me: ""This is a lot more smooth and a lot less noisy. ""It will also help the local environment because there's no pollution. ""When I get the money I'll come and get one. Maybe when I've been to college and I've got a few years under my belt."" The council in Orkney has been able to pack lots of charging infrastructure into a relatively small area You might think plug-in cars would best be suited to city driving where average journeys are just a few miles. But despite being rural and remote the longest journey in Orkney from north to south is about 60 miles. How to tackle Scotland's 'climate emergency' Ten ways to act on climate change Scotland to set 'faster' climate change target So the council can pack lots of charging infrastructure into a relatively small area. Orkney now has well over 200 fully electric vehicles, more than 2% of the total cars and vans on the road. It costs about Â£2/Â£3 to travel 100 miles in a fully electric car compared with Â£10 or more for petrol or diesel Most of them have been sold by Jonathan Porterfield, from his business Ecocars, based at home near Evie. He believes interest is growing fast and says some customers even buy online, without a test drive. ""The demand has just gone off the scale in the last 12 to 18 months as more and more people realise that this is an option,"" he said. ""People just want to get into an electric car, initially to save money but then for the feel-good factor of doing their little bit for the environment as well."" Orkney Islands Council claims to have one of the highest proportions of electric cars in the country. Orkney is home to what is thought to be the first fully electric vehicle in Scotland to be converted into a motorhome For our journey, I travelled in a fully electric vehicle thought to be the first in Scotland to be converted into a motorhome. Owner Paul Hudd, from JP Orkney, explained: ""People have fed back how easy it is to drive an electric vehicle, how easy the automatic gearbox is. ""From a camping perspective they like the fact that it fits into the environment really well."" Orkney has long been a pioneering place when it comes to energy. The longest journey in Orkney from north to south is about 60 miles Wind power to the national grid started here in the 1950s and in the last decade they've been harnessing the waves and tide. The local authority is even trialling electric vans with hydrogen tanks which can charge the battery on the move and extend the range. While public charging is free across Scotland, here that incentive has just been abolished. But it still costs only Â£2/Â£3 to travel 100 miles in a fully electric car compared with Â£10 or more for petrol or diesel. ""As you put the infrastructure in, the costs need to be met, whether that be electricity, maintenance, fees and charges etc. It's many tens of thousands of pounds,"" said Darren Richardson from Orkney Islands Council. The council in Orkney has now introduced a fee for recharging ""What the council has done is take a decision to introduce a charge. Not to make any profit. It's just a cost recovery model. ""At the moment we're supported by government in terms of the capital costs - the cost of putting in the chargers - and we hope that continues. ""But it's inescapable there is a running cost and I think that's an area we need to look at very closely because we want this to grow and we want it to be incentivised so that people continue to use electric vehicles. ""Councils generally face challenges financially and we need to recover costs unless they were subsidised by government."" But how will large scale behaviour change come about? Prof Iain Black from the University of Stirling explained: ""We're all lazy and we'll change to those things when we have to and when it's no longer convenient for us. ""That's where the government comes in, in making it much more convenient for us to drive electric cars and also putting a lot of pressure on the businesses, the car manufacturers, to develop the machines that we need."" Electric cars are clearly still a specialist vehicle. But Orkney offers a window into the future for all of us. With manufacturers already planning for a tipping point away from fossil fuels, the question is not ""if"" but ""when"" it will happen.

"Bosses of more than 50 retailers including Asda and Boots have written to the chancellor urging him to change tax rules to boost the UK High Street. The group said it wanted him to fix the ""broken business rates system"", which it called outdated. It said the tax had jumped by 50% since the 1990s and had contributed to some retailers going out of business. The Treasury said it had announced a Â£3.6bn fund last month ""to support our High Streets and town centres"". ""The chancellor will announce further details of the government's policy programme in the coming weeks and months,"" it added. In the letter to the chancellor, co-ordinated by the British Retail Consortium trade body, the group pointed out that the retail sector accounted for 5% of the economy but paid 25% of all business rates, a property-based tax. It said ""this disparity"" was damaging High Streets and ""harming the communities they support"".
