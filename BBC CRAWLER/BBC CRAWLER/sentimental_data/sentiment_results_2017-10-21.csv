"President John F Kennedy was given a state funeral, after hundreds of thousands of people viewed his casket Donald Trump has said he plans to allow the opening of a trove of long-classified files on the assassination of former president John F Kennedy. The president tweeted to say he would allow the release ""subject to receipt of further information"". The files are scheduled to be opened by the US National Archives on 26 October, but the president is entitled to extend their classified status. Kennedy was shot dead by a sniper on 22 November 1963 in Dallas, Texas. The National Archives has already released most documents related to the assassination but a final batch remains under lock and key. ""Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,"" Trump said in atweet,external. Congress ruled in 1992 that all JFK documents should be released within 25 years, unless the president decided the release would harm national security. The archive contains more than 3,000 previously unreleased documents, and more than 30,000 that have been released before but with redactions. This video can not be played JFK at 100: 'His life was not as glamorous as you think' It is unclear whether Mr Trump intends to allow the release in full or with redactions. Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any bombshells, according toa Washington Post report,external. But the files may shed more light on Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City just months before the assassination. Oswald was arrested in Dallas on the day of the shooting and charged with the president's murder. He denied the charges, claiming he was a ""just a patsy"". He was gunned down by nightclub owner Jack Ruby while in police custody two days later, and the plot to kill Kennedy became the most powerful conspiracy theory in American history. ""The American public deserves to know the facts, or at least they deserve to know what the government has kept hidden from them for all these years,"" Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of a book about Kennedy, told the Associated Press news agency.

"This video can not be played Some 450,000 people protested on Saturday, local police said The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, says the region will not accept Madrid's plan for direct rule. He described it as the worst attack on Catalonia's institutions since General Franco's 1939-1975 dictatorship, under which regional autonomy was dissolved. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's plans include the removal of Catalonia's leaders and curbs on its parliament. An independence referendum went ahead on 1 October, despite being banned by Spain's Constitutional Court. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Cases for and against independence The crisis in 300 words Mr Puigdemont said the Spanish government was acting against the democratic will of Catalans after refusing all offers of dialogue. This video can not be played Catalan president's message to Europe He said he would call for a session of the Catalan parliament to debate a response to Mr Rajoy's plans. Addressing European citizens in English, he added that the EU's founding values were ""at risk"" in Catalonia. Barcelona police said 450,000 people protested in the regional capital earlier on Saturday, with many chanting ""freedom"" and ""independence"". Mr Rajoy said he was triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which allows for direct rule to be imposed in a crisis on any of the country's autonomous regions. Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting, Mr Rajoy stopped short of dissolving the region's parliament but put forward plans for elections. He insisted the measures would not mean Catalan self-government itself was being suspended. Instead, he said, the plan was to remove those people who had ""taken self-government outside the law and the constitution"". The measures, which are supported by opposition parties, must now be approved by the Senate in the next few days. Mr Rajoy said the government would apply Spain's Article 155 Reports say Spain's interior ministry is preparing to take control of Catalonia's Mossos d'Esquadra police force and remove its commander, Josep LluÃ­s Trapero, who is already facing sedition charges. The government is also considering taking control of Catalonia's public broadcaster TV3, El PaÃ­s newspaperreports (in Spanish),external. ""Return to the past"" is how Catalonia's Catalan-language, pro-independence El Punt Avui sums up Saturday's developments on its front page. Inan opinion piece,external, Xevi Xirgo argues that Madrid is mounting a ""coup d'etat"" to submit Catalonia to central rule in a way not seen since the 18th Century. Inan editorial in El PeriÃ³dico,external, Spain's fifth-biggest newspaper which publishes both in Spanish and Catalan, Enric HernÃ ndez argues that Madrid responded in kind to ""the aggression of the independence camp"", which ignored Spanish law to hold a ""sham referendum"". HernÃ ndez calls on Mr Puigdemont to agree to Mr Rajoy's call for early regional elections as the best way out of the crisis or else face a ""social revolt with unforeseeable consequences"". Meanwhile El PaÃ­s, Spain's biggest paper, a left-of-centre daily, endorses the government inan editorial entitled ""The democratic state responds"",externaland declares that Mr Rajoy is acting to ""restore constitutional legality in Catalonia"". ""Democracy not only has the right to defend itself but a duty to do so,"" it says. The use of Article 155 has sparked widespread criticism in Catalonia, where many say it amounts to a suspension of the region's powers of self-government. The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Carme Forcadell, called the measures a ""de facto coup d'etat"". This video can not be played Police inspector: 'We are not politicians' Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau said it was a ""serious attack on the rights and freedoms of all, both here and elsewhere"". But InÃ©s Arrimadas, head of the centrist Ciudadanos party in Catalonia, which is against independence, said holding fresh elections would ""restore goodwill and democracy"" in the region. Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Mariano Rajoy's use of Article 155 had been widely anticipated but his announcement when it came still had a huge impact. The article has never been invoked before, so there was a certain amount of mystery surrounding its potential reach and meaning. Although Mr Rajoy insists Catalonia's self-government is not being suspended, many will disagree. The removal from office of Carles Puigdemont and all the members of his cabinet, to allow ministers in Madrid to take on their duties, amounts to a major reining in of Catalonia's devolved powers. The Spanish prime minister said one of his aims was to restore peaceful co-existence to Catalonia with these measures. Many Catalans who want to remain in Spain will approve of this strident action. But those who want independence for their region are likely to see this as a provocation rather than a solution. Even though Spain's constitutional court ruled it illegal, Catalonia's regional government held a referendum on 1 October to ask residents of the region if they wanted to break away. Of the 43% of Catalans said to have taken part, 90% voted in favour of independence. Unionist parties who won about 40% of the vote at the 2015 Catalan elections boycotted the ballot and many anti-independence supporters stayed away, arguing it was not valid. Mr Puigdemont and other regional leaders later signed a declaration of independence but immediately suspended it in order to allow for talks. He then defied two deadlines set by the national government to clarify Catalonia's position.

"The building was officially opened in an extravagant ceremony The Church of Scientology has opened a Â£4.2m HQ in Birmingham. Grade II listed Pitmaston House, in the Moseley suburb, was snapped up in 2007 by the group, which was founded by science fiction author L Ron Hubbard. There was a heavy security presence around the building during an opening ceremony, at which senior church figures gave speeches. A request for an interview about the new ""Ideal Org"", or headquarters, was turned down. The church claims the building, which is the second of its kind in the UK, will house a training centre and a chapel. A huge blue rosette and ribbons were draped across the front of the building ahead of the opening ceremony, while lighting and camera equipment could also be seen. Speeches were played back on two large screens erected on either side of the main entrance. Groups of protesters, including ex-church members, gathered outside during proceedings, according to theBirmingham Mail,external. There was a heavy security presence outside the building Protesters gathered outside Scientology offers believers a life improvement strategy it calls dianetics. People take courses of dianetics counselling, known as auditing, in the hope of ridding themselves of destructive influences from their current or past lives. Scientologists say it is a religion, but a string of defectors have accused it of being a dangerous cult. They allege physical and emotional abuse, brainwashing and unethical fundraising, which the church has always strongly denied. It has a number of celebrity followers, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta. A promotional video released by the church claimed the new HQ would provide ""community programmes for the betterment of Birmingham"". It claims to have had a dedicated following in the area since the 1980s. Plans to convert Pitmaston House met with some opposition when they were approvedin 2013, although a local community group said its main worry was an increase in traffic.

"The letter was written by Oscar Holverson to his mother One of the last known letters to have been written on the Titanic has sold for a world record price at auction. The letter, written by American businessman and Titanic passenger, Oscar Holverson, fetched Â£126,000. It was sought-after because he wrote it on 13 April 1912 - the day before the Belfast-built ship hit an iceberg. It is the only known letter, on headed Titanic notepaper, to have gone into the Atlantic and survived. Titanic 100 - BBC's centenary coverage of disaster The sea-water stained document was sold to a British buyer, whose bid to the auction in Wiltshire came in via phone. The auctioneer, Andrew Aldridge, described the anonymous customer as someone ""who collects iconic items from history"". Mr Holverson, a successful salesman, wrote the letter to his mother while travelling on the ill-fated ship with his wife, Mary. The couple boarded the Titanic in Southampton and planned to travel back to their home in New York. Oscar Holverson was a successful American businessman In his note, the writer seems in awe of his surroundings, telling his mother that ""the boat is giant in size and fitted up like a palatial hotel"". Mr Holverson, who has an idiosyncratic style to his syntax, also writes about seeing ""the richest person in the world at that time"" - John Jacob Astor - on the ship, accompanied by his wife. ""He looks like any other human being even tho (sic) he has millions of money,"" he adds. ""They sit out on deck with the rest of us."" The letter had a reserve price of between Â£60,000 and Â£80,000. Speaking ahead of Saturday's sale, Mr Aldridge said that ""even if the letter was virtually blank, it would still rank as amongst the most desirable, such is the nature of the paper, its markings and history"". Having been an auctioneer of Titanic memorabilia for 20 years, he said that its content takes it to another level, ""because of its date, the fact it went into the Atlantic and the observations it contains"". One prophetic entry in Mr Holverson's letter never came true, when he wrote: ""If all goes well we will arrive in New York Wednesday AM."" When the Titanic sank, Oscar Holverson, along with JJ Astor, died along with more than 1,500 people. Mary Holverson survived. Her husband's body was recovered and, inside a pocket book, the letter was found. It still bears the stains of the sea water and the water mark of the White Star shipping line. The letter eventually made its way back to his mother. Mr Aldridge said that makes it ""possibly, the only onboard letter written by a victim that was delivered to its recipient without postage"". The letter still bears the stains of the sea and the water mark of the White star shipping line Mr Holverson was buried in Woodlawn cemetery in New York, unaware that, 105 years later, his unposted letter would generate such interest. Mr Aldridge, who has auctioned everything from a set of Titanic keys for Â£85,000, to a violin that was played as the ship sank, for Â£1.1m, said he was also excited to see the letter. He said it was ""one of the most iconic and important items from the Titanic ever offered at auction and shows that interest in the ship and its passengers remains incredibly strong"". Other items in Saturday's auction included a set of keys belonging to a steward in the Titanic's First Class, which fetched Â£76,000. Two previously unpublished photos of the Titanic went for Â£24,000. Theprevious world record for a Titanic letter sold at auction was Â£119,000, set in April 2014, for a letter written a few hours before the ship hit the iceberg.

"Mr Babis and his colleagues celebrated their poll-topping performance Populist billionaire candidate Andrej Babis and his party have won the Czech Republic's general election. Mr Babis, 63, is the country's second-richest man and campaigned on an anti-establishment and Eurosceptic platform. With all votes counted, his centrist movement ANO (Yes) collected a share of almost 30% - nearly three times that of its closest rival. The centre-right Civic Democrats and the Pirates Party came second and third with more than 10% each. The Pirates will make their debut in parliament with 22 seats, the news agency AFP reported. Turnout was almost 61%. Mr Babis is now set to become prime minister after coalition negotiations. However, he told news agency Reuters that while he had ""invited everyone for talks"", he was not prepared to ""cooperate"" with either the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy party or the Communist Party. The 63-year-old made his estimated $4bn (Â£3bn) fortune in chemicals, food and media - but he has also faced numerous scandals including a fraud indictment and accusations he was a communist-era police agent. He says he would not bring the Czech Republic in to the eurozone but he wants the country to stay in the EU, telling Reuters he would propose changes to the European Council on issues like food quality and a ""solution to migration"". Andrej Babis profile The ANO's current coalition partner, the ruling centre-left Social Democrats (CSSD), saw its share of the vote tumble to become the sixth-largest party, and has talked down the possibility of another coalition. The Civic Democrats have also ruled themselves out of governing alongside Mr Babis. Far-right and anti-establishment groups made gains in the election. The largest parties now include: ANO (Yes): 29.6% Civic Democratic Party: 11.3% The Czech Pirate Party: 10.8% Freedom and Free Democracy party (SPD) : 10.6% Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM): 7.8% Social Democrats (CSSD): 7.3% The BBC's correspondent in Prague, Rob Cameron, said the SPD's performance was particularly noteworthy, as the far-right party wants to ban Islam in the Czech Republic. Its leader has urged Czechs to walk pigs near mosques. Parties closer to EU liberal establishment values were left massively depleted. Rob Cameron, BBC News, Prague Andrej Babis has long decried what he says is a ""campaign"" against him by a self-serving political establishment. He sees the hand of this shadowy deep state everywhere; the media, the Czech prosecutor's office, the Slovak Constitutional Court, even the EU's anti-fraud unit. A host of enemies ranged against him in a vast anti-Babis conspiracy. Well, if there was such a conspiracy, it's failed. His message to voters - that he alone could heal the ills of the Czech political and economic system, that he alone could decapitate the hydra of corruption, that he alone could defend Czech national interests - appears to have been heard. They have given him a convincing mandate. He has truly crushed his rivals. He still needs friends - 78 seats is far from enough in a 200-seat lower house to do much of anything, let alone the sweeping constitutional changes he dreams of. With eight other parties in parliament - from centre-left to far-right - he has a bewildering choice of coalition partners. It's a choice that will determine the future course of the country. The country's outgoing leader, Social Democrat Bohuslav Sobotka, headed a coalition formed with Mr Babis's party after a 2013 snap election. But in May, Mr Sobotka submitted his government's resignation because of a disagreement with Mr Babis, who was serving as finance minister at the time. He was unhappy about alleged unexplained business dealings involving Mr Babis. On seeing the rise of the SPD Mr Sobotka was shocked, saying; ""How is it possible that in the Czech Republic, in a situation when the country is doing very well, when we are a stable, safe country, we have achieved many things in the social sphere in the past four years, people are increasingly in favour of extreme views?"" The Social Democrats' tally of 7.3% was their worst result since the Czech Republic split from Slovakia in 1993.

"The RAC advised drivers to check airport charges in advance ""or be prepared for an unpleasant shock"" Charges for picking up and dropping off passengers at some of the UK's busiest airports have risen by as much as 100% over the past year, a new study claims. RAC research found eight of the top 20 UK airports had increased pick-up fees, while five airports had raised charges for drivers dropping passengers off. The RAC described tariffs as high as Â£3.50 for 10 minutes as ""eye-watering"". But the Airport Operators Association said fees were ""clearly flagged"" and were channelled into site facilities. Seven airports, including London's Heathrow and Gatwick, continue to offer free drop-off parking. London Stansted is currently the most expensive airport in the UK to drop passengers at the terminal, the RAC said - with prices jumping by 50p to Â£3.50 for 10 minutes in the last year. Liverpool's John Lennon airport, the second most expensive, raised drop-off fees by 50% - from Â£2 for 20 minutes to Â£3 for 20 minutes, while Birmingham doubled the cost, raising prices from Â£1 to Â£2 for 10 minutes. Glasgow airport, where it was previously free to drop off passengers,introduced a charge of Â£2 for 10 minutes in April.Similarly, Southampton has introduced a Â£1 fee for 10 minutes. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The eye-watering drop-off and pick-up costs at some airports is likely to be viewed by drivers as another way of making money out of them - particularly in instances where public transport to and from the airport simply isn't a viable option."" ""Drop-off charges are the biggest bone of contention, as for many they appear severe when they are simply pulling up for less than five minutes and often don't even get out of the car themselves."" Rising pick-up charges are also exposed by the research. Motorists collecting family or friends from London Luton are charged the most in the UK at Â£7 for 40 minutes, according to the report - although there was no increase in charges for 2017. London Stansted was again among the most expensive airports - this time for collection - raising charges by 50p to Â£5 for 30 minutes, Â£1.50 more expensive than London Gatwick for the same service, which increased changes by 30p. London Heathrow, the UK's busiest passenger airport, does not charge to drop off passengers London City airport raised fees by Â£1, to Â£3.50 for a 10-minute stop, while Southampton and Cardiff airports both introduced pick up charges of Â£1 for 10 minutes, having previously charged nothing for the first 10 or 20 minutes respectively. Belfast City and Liverpool John Lennon continue to offer free short-stay parking for passenger collection. Mr Williams said airport charges for short-stay parking had turned ""a good deed [into] a costly experience"". But a spokesman for the Airport Operators Association defended the charges, saying the income earned was channelled into airport facilities and allowed airports ""to keep charges to airlines low, benefiting travellers through lower air fares"". He cited congestion and environmental impact among the reasons for the range of charges across the regions. The spokesman said charges were clearly flagged up and passengers had a ""high level of awareness of the different ways they can choose to get to the airport, ranging from public transport to travelling by car"".

"This video can not be played Leanne Wood says she would prefer critics to ""say it to my face"" rather than brief in private Leanne Wood has made a public appeal to Plaid Cymru AMs to stop making anonymous criticisms of her leadership to journalists. Speaking on BBC Wales, she said: ""I mean it's just ridiculous. We need to be adults about this."" ""If anybody's got anything to say I'd really prefer it if they'd say it to my face,"" Ms Wood added. It follows reports of disquiet among some Plaid AMs over whether she should lead the party for another four years. Plaid leader's 'earn your trust' pledge Wood 'will still lead Plaid in 2021' Throughout the party's annual conference in Caernarfon, Ms Wood has insisted she will be Plaid's leader at the next assembly election, and that she has the backing of the membership. The party's Mid and West Wales AM Simon Thomas told the BBC's live conference programme Plaid Cymru's rules would allow a leadership race in 2018. ""If anyone wants to challenge Leanne next year, then let them come forward and challenge her,"" he said, ruling himself out of such a challenge.

""And I said that day and as I say today, yes I am."" Arfon Plaid MP Hywel Williams said it would be ""eminently reasonable"" for Ms Wood to be leader at the next assembly election. In the conference hall on Saturday, Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Adam Price outlined plans for a ""youth basic income"" for 18 to 24-year-olds. This video can not be played Adam Price said the youth basic income could help attract graduates back to Wales It would comprise of four options, including a ""guaranteed"" job, a national citizen service, support for further and higher education and grants to help young people get businesses off the ground. Mr Price said the party would offer the ""most comprehensive package of support for young people across the entire world"". Youth unemployment in Wales was 13.1% for the year to the end of June 2017. The overall unemployment rate was4% between June and August. Detailed research on how to finance the proposal will be undertaken by Plaid's new think tank, Nova Cambria, which will be launched before the end of the year and will be tasked with coming up with ""bold, original ideas"". One of those ideas would include calling for ""an end to free cash for foreign owned companies"", Mr Price told the conference floor.

The opposition party wants to issue a rail bond to finance electrification to Swansea - a model it says could also be used to create a Metro public transport network for the Swansea Bay and Western Valleys region. Ms Wood said: ""We would re-establish a Carmarthen to Aberystwyth rail line and ensure that it links with the north, to Pwllheli and beyond.

It says Catalan separatists are preparing for a war of attrition against direct rule from Madrid, amid growing anger at the inability of either side to swallow their pride and take a step back. TheSunday Times says the announcement prompted vows of resistance,externalfrom independence supporters, who are planning a peaceful campaign of civil disobedience.

"Taxpayer-funded medical research is producing medicines which are increasingly unaffordable for patients who need them, says a new report. Campaigners claim that the NHS spent more than Â£1bn on drugs developed from publically funded research in 2016. A government spokesperson said it wanted the UK to be a global leader in research and development"". But NHS England said it was concerned about price ""anomalies"", and questioned whether regulatory action was needed. It said that was essential that drug companies price their products responsibly. It added: ""Although the responsibility for the how prices are set for medicines lies with the Department of Health, and in general the system delivers value for money for patients, we are concerned about pricing anomalies at a time when the NHS needs to make significant savings which suggests further regulatory action may be needed."" The government said that it was committed to ensuring patients could access the effective medicines they needed, at a price that represented value for the NHS and for taxpayers. A new report,external, seen by 5 live Investigates, claims that UK taxpayers and patients worldwide are being denied the medicines they need, despite the public sector playing a pivotal role in the discovery of new medicines. The report, published by campaign groupsGlobal Justice Now,externalandStop Aids,external, says that even when the government has part-funded the research and development, there is no guarantee that patients will be able to access the medicines at an affordable price. It says: ""In many cases, the UK taxpayer effectively pays twice for medicines: first through investing in R&D, and then by paying high prices for the resulting medicine once ownership has been transferred to a private company."" It claims the high prices of new medicines are ""unsustainable for an already underfunded NHS"". Industry representatives counter that the situation is not that straightforward. They say that turning scientific discoveries into medicines takes years of scientific trials and costs billions of pounds, and the process is risky, so not every drug they test will make it to market. However, campaigners say drug companies are generating huge private profits from public funds. Emma believes drug companies should reduce the price of cancer drugs Emma Robertson, 35, has incurable breast cancer and is taking the drug, palbociclib. This drug was originally developed using work carried out by publicly funded Cancer Research UK scientists in the 1980s, for which they won the 2001 Nobel Prize. In February, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice) made a provisional decision not to recommend the drug because the cost was too high in relation to its potential benefits. However Ms Robertson is receiving the drug through a free trial provided by the drug company Pfizer. A full course of treatment with palbociclib costs Â£79,650, which campaigners say means the manufacturer is vastly overpricing the drug. They claim it could be made and sold for a profit for Â£1 per pill, but say in fact it is currently sold for 140 times more. ""Pfizer needs to dramatically reduce the price that it wants to charge for this drug,"" Ms Robertson says. ""We need to be asking some really serious questions about how drugs are researched and developed,"" she adds. Pfizer denied the drug costs Â£1 per pill. It told the BBC that it took more than 20 years to build on the work of the Cancer Research UK scientists. Turning scientific discoveries into medicines takes ""billions of pounds of investment, millions of hours of science and thousands of clinical trials,"" the firm explained. There are around 45,000 new diagnoses of breast cancer each year in England. Meanwhile, health bosses estimate that around 5,500 people in England would be eligible for treatment with palbociclib. Richard Sullivan, professor of cancer and global health at Kings College London, said that while some drug companies price their drugs correctly, others ""vastly overprice"" their drugs. ""Many of these drugs are extremely profitable"", he said, ""but there is absolutely no link between the price set and with the returns on the research - it's a complete myth."" ""When a drug is refused by Nice there's only one reason it's refused - the company has knowingly overpriced the drug."" Professor Sullivan told the BBC that the public sector had contributed anywhere between ""30% and up to 90% of the overall research intellectual input"" in the development of drugs. ""The public sector is essential for developing new medicines for cancer patients,"" he added. The Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry responded by saying that the suggestion that companies intentionally overpriced drugs ""doesn't make sense"" because their overall objective is to ensure that the drugs are approved by Nice and then used by patients. In 2015, the UK government spent Â£2.3bn on health research and development and the relationship been public funding and profits is complex. Campaigners say more needs to be done to reform the system and that research and development should not be linked to sales revenue. Instead, campaigners argue, companies should be rewarded for their research in exchange for limiting the price of drugs. However the pharmaceutical industry says it provides thousands of jobs and the current system is crucial to encouraging drug development. 5 live Investigatesis broadcast on Sunday 22nd October 2017 at 11am BST.

"Heavy rain hit southern Japan as people voted on Sunday Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's coalition has won a resounding victory in Sunday's general election, according to exit polls. On hearing of his victory he said he would ""firmly deal with"" threats from North Korea. The public broadcaster NHK put Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition at 312 seats, allowing it to retain its two-thirds ""super majority"". This is vital to his ambition to revise Japan's post-war pacifist constitution. Mr Abe has pushed for a shift in Japan's defence policy, calling for formal recognition of the military in the constitution. He said he would try to ""gain support from as many people as possible"" for the task. Japan's snap election explained Country profile He said on Sunday: ""As I promised in the election, my imminent task is to firmly deal with North Korea. ""For that, strong diplomacy is required."" Mr Abe announced the election on 25 September, saying he needed a fresh mandate in order to deal with the ""national crises"" facing Japan. The crises include North Korea, which has threatened to ""sink"" Japan into the sea. Pyongyang has also fired two missiles over Hokkaido, the northernmost island in Japan. A win in the election raises Mr Abe's chances of securing a third three-year-term as leader of the LDP when the party votes next September. That would give him the opportunity to become Japan's longest serving prime minister, having been elected in 2012. Japan went to the polls on Sunday as Typhoon Lan lashed parts of the country. The category four storm brought strong winds and heavy rain to the south of the country, causing flights to be cancelled and rail services to be disrupted. It is expected to blow into the Tokyo area early on Monday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

"Artwork: Most of Tiangong-1 will not survive to the surface China's Tiangong-1 space station is currently out of control and expected to fall back to Earth next year. But not in the remote place where many other spacecraft end their days. Explorers and adventurers often look for new places to conquer now that the highest peaks have been climbed, the poles reached and vast oceans and deserts crossed. Some of these new places are called the poles of inaccessibility. Two of them are particularly interesting. One is called the continental pole of inaccessibility - it's the place on Earth furthest from the ocean. There is some debate as to its exact position but it's considered by many to be near the so-called Dzungarian Gate - a mountain pass between China and Central Asia. The equivalent point in the ocean - the place furthest away from land - lies in the South Pacific some 2,700km (1,680 miles) south of the Pitcairn Islands - somewhere in the no-man's land, or rather no-man's-sea, between Australia, New Zealand and South America. This oceanic pole of inaccessibility is not only of interest to explorers, satellite operators are interested in it as well. That's because most of the satellites placed in orbit around the Earth will eventually come down, but where? Smaller satellites will burn up but pieces of the larger ones will survive to reach the Earth's surface. To avoid crashing on a populated area they are brought down near the point of oceanic inaccessibility. Scattered over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) on the ocean floor of this region is a graveyard of satellites. At last count there were more than 260 of them, mostly Russian. China space station to fall to Earth in 2017 The race to destroy space garbage Ugandan garden hit by space junk,external 1979: Skylab tumbles back to Earth,external The wreckage of the Mir space station lies there. It was launched in 1986 and was visited by many teams of cosmonauts and international visitors. With a mass of 120 tonnes it was never going to burn up in the atmosphere, so it was ditched in the region in 2001 and was seen by some fishermen as a fragmenting mass of glowing debris racing across the sky. A computer-simulated image of Mir's descent and break-up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere in 2001 Many times a year the supply module that goes to the International Space Station burns up in this region incinerating the station's waste. No one is in any danger because of this controlled re-entry into our atmosphere. The region is not fished because oceanic currents avoid the area and do not bring nutrients to it, making marine life scarce. One future visitor to this desolate place will be the International Space Station. Current plans are for it to be decommissioned in the next decade and it will have to be carefully brought down in the oceanic pole of inaccessibility. With a mass of 450 tonnes - four times that of the Mir space station - it will make a spectacular sight. Sometimes however, it's not possible to bring a satellite or space station down in the South Pacific if ground controllers have lost contact with it. The Earth is surrounded by thousands of pieces of space junk (dots not to scale) Such a thing happened with the 36-tonne Salyut 7 space station in 1991 which came down in South America or the American Skylab that struck Australia in 1979. No one on the ground was injured, or indeed as far as we know, ever has been hit by a piece of falling spacecraft debris. We will face that problem again next year. Between January and April the Chinese Tiangong-1 will come back to Earth. It was launched in 2011 as China's first space station. The following year it was visited by China's first female astronaut, Liu Yang. Tiangong-1's orbit is decaying as it heads towards re-entry. But Chinese engineers have lost control of it and cannot fire its thrusters to bring it down in the South Pacific. Instead it will come down somewhere between 42.8 degrees north and south. That's between the latitude of northern Spain and southern Australia, and we won't be able to be more precise than that until just a few hours before it burns up. Tiangong-1 is one space station that probably won't join its companions in the remote South Pacific. Dr David Whitehouse was the BBC's science correspondent from 1988 until 2006, and is a former science editor at the BBC News website.

"This video can not be played Some 450,000 people protested on Saturday, local police said The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, says the region will not accept Madrid's plan for direct rule. He described it as the worst attack on Catalonia's institutions since General Franco's 1939-1975 dictatorship, under which regional autonomy was dissolved. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's plans include the removal of Catalonia's leaders and curbs on its parliament. An independence referendum went ahead on 1 October, despite being banned by Spain's Constitutional Court. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Cases for and against independence The crisis in 300 words Mr Puigdemont said the Spanish government was acting against the democratic will of Catalans after refusing all offers of dialogue. This video can not be played Catalan president's message to Europe He said he would call for a session of the Catalan parliament to debate a response to Mr Rajoy's plans. Addressing European citizens in English, he added that the EU's founding values were ""at risk"" in Catalonia. Barcelona police said 450,000 people protested in the regional capital earlier on Saturday, with many chanting ""freedom"" and ""independence"". Mr Rajoy said he was triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which allows for direct rule to be imposed in a crisis on any of the country's autonomous regions. Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting, Mr Rajoy stopped short of dissolving the region's parliament but put forward plans for elections.

"This video can not be played Some 450,000 people protested on Saturday, local police said The Spanish prime minister has outlined plans to remove Catalonia's leaders and take control of the separatist region. Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday, Mariano Rajoy stopped short of dissolving the region's parliament but put forward plans for elections. The measures must now be approved by Spain's Senate in the next few days. The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Carme Forcadell, called the measures a ""de facto coup d'etat"". ""It is an authoritarian coup inside a member state of the European Union,"" she said, adding that Mr Rajoy intended to ""put an end to  a democratically elected government"". Large crowds have gathered in Barcelona to protest against direct rule from Madrid. It comes almost three weeks after Catalonia held a disputed independence referendum. Spain's supreme court had declared the vote illegal and said it violated the constitution, which describes the country as indivisible. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has ignored pleas from the national government to abandon moves towards independence. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Cases for and against independence The crisis in 300 words Mr Rajoy said the the Catalan government's actions were ""contrary to the law and seeking confrontation"". He said it was ""not our wish, it was not our intention"" to impose direct rule. This will be via Article 155 of Spain's constitution, which allows it to impose direct rule in a crisis on any of the country's semi-autonomous regions. Mr Rajoy said the government would apply Spain's Article 155 Spanish law dictates that elections must be held within six months of Article 155 being triggered, but Mr Rajoy said it was imperative that the vote be held much sooner. Reports say that Spain's interior ministry is preparing take control of Catalonia's Mossos police force and remove its commander Josep LluÃ­s Trapero, who is already facing sedition charges. The government is also considering taking control of Catalonia's public broadcaster TV3, El PaÃ­s newspaperreported,external.

The president of Barcelona football club,Josep Maria Bartomeu,external, said the club gave its ""absolute support for the democratic institutions of Catalonia chosen by its people"". But he called for any reaction to be ""civil and peaceful"" and said dialogue was the only way to a solution.

"Joseph Hale, from Cleethorpes, says he is ""excited"" by his modelling debut An 11-year-old boy with Down's syndrome has landed his first modelling job in a high street store's new advertising campaign. Joseph Hale, from Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, has become one of the faces of River Island's new children's clothing range. His mum Karen Hale said she hoped it would encourage equal representation of disabilities in the media. The young model said he was ""excited"" by the opportunity. ""It's really good. I had to pose, we had our hair and make-up done and I wore magic shiny shoes,"" he said. Karen Hale says her son's disability ""does not define him at all"" Mrs Hale, 49, said the family was ""very proud"" of their son and that Joseph took to modelling ""like a duck to water"". ""He gets excited when he sees his photo. He's shown it to his friends at school,"" she said. ""Everyone's been really supportive, it's absolutely brilliant."" She says Joseph's Down's syndrome ""does not define him at all"" and he has an ""infectious personality, he's just one big ball of fun"". ""We're hoping campaigns like this one by River Island will pave the way for more inclusion and acceptance for people with disabilities in the wider world. ""Advertising can have a massive impact and people need to see that these individuals still have emotions, thoughts, feelings, dreams, aspirations the same as anyone else... and they need to be seen as equals at all times."" Joseph said he hoped to do more modelling jobs in future Joseph, who attends Cambridge Park Academy in Grimsby, says he enjoys dancing and spending time with his family. He said he would like to continue doing ""more modelling"" but would like to pursue a career in hairdressing when he gets older. The youngster's opportunity came by chance through his agency Zebedee Management, Mrs Hale said. Josie Cartridge, customer director of River Island, said Joseph had a ""star presence"" and the company wanted to portray ""a diverse group of children"". kids squad - River Island Last chance for public to have say on North East Lincolnshire Council budget plans 'Gritters were out in force' - council doubles amount of salt during weather warnings Watch: Police find 35 puppies and a dog living in an abandoned caravan Increase in women seeking new year free from abuse!

"Critics say health services have collapsed under Mr Mugabe's rule The choice of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe as a World Health Organization (WHO) goodwill ambassador has been criticised by several organisations including the British government. It described his selection as ""surprising and disappointing"" given his country's rights record, and warned it could overshadow the WHO's work. The opposition in Zimbabwe and campaign groups also criticised the move. The WHO head said he was ""rethinking his approach in light of WHO values"". Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had previously praised Zimbabwe for its commitment to public health. He said it was a country that ""places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all"". Profile: Robert Mugabe Africa's 'medical tourist' presidents Mr Mugabe's appointment as a ""goodwill ambassador"" to help tackle non-communicable diseases has attracted a chorus of criticism. Critics have long argued that Zimbabwe's health service is not meeting the needs of patients The British government said it was all the more surprising given US and EU sanctions against him. ""We have registered our concerns"" with the director general, a spokesman said. ""Although Mugabe will not have an executive role, his appointment risks overshadowing the work undertaken globally by the WHO on non-communicable diseases."" Zimbabwe's leader has been frequently taken to task over human rights abuses by the European Union and the US. Critics say Zimbabwe's health care system has collapsed, with staff often going without pay while medicines are in short supply. Dr Tedros, who is Ethiopian,is the first African to lead the WHO. He was elected in May with a mandate to tackle perceived politicisation in the organisation. US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it was an embarrassment to give the ambassador role to Mr Mugabe, because his ""utter mismanagement of the economy has devastated health services"". Critics of the president say that Zimbabwe's health care system is in a shambolic state HRW's Kenneth Roth said Mr Mugabe's appointment was a cause for concern because the president and some of his officials travel abroad for treatment. ""When you go to Zimbabwean hospitals, they lack the most basic necessities,"" he said. Zimbabwe's main MDC opposition party also denounced the WHO move. ""The Zimbabwe health delivery system is in a shambolic state, it is an insult,"" spokesman Obert Gutu told AFP. ""Mugabe trashed our health delivery system... he allowed our public hospitals to collapse."" Other groups who have criticised Mr Mugabe's appointment include the Wellcome Trust, the NCD Alliance, UN Watch, the World Heart Federation and Action Against Smoking. President Mugabe heard about his appointment while attending a conference held by the WHO, a UN agency, on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Montevideo, Uruguay. He told delegates his country had adopted several strategies to combat the challenges presented by such diseases,which the WHO says kill about 40 million people a year,externaland include cancers, respiratory diseases and diabetes. ""Zimbabwe has developed a national NCD policy, a palliative care policy, and has engaged United Nations agencies working in the country, to assist in the development of a cervical cancer prevention and control strategy,"" Mr Mugabe was reportedby the state-run Zimbabwe Herald newspaper,externalas saying. But the president admitted that Zimbabwe was similar to other developing countries in that it was ""hamstrung by a lack of adequate resources for executing programmes aimed at reducing NCDs and other health conditions afflicting the people"". Medicine is often in short supply at Zimbabwe's hospitals, critics say Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva The UN has a bit of thing for goodwill ambassadors, especially famous ones. Angelina Jolie, as ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency, was regularly pictured comforting displaced families in over-crowded camps. Swiss tennis star Roger Federer visits aid projects in Africa for Unicef and plays charity matches to raise money. Further back in time, film star and Unicef goodwill ambassador Audrey Hepburn visited disaster zones and graced gala dinners where her glittering presence was an encouragement to donors. The publicity does attract support for relief efforts. But it is hard to imagine 93-year-old Robert Mugabe fulfilling a similar remit. Will he provide comfort in WHO field clinics in conflict zones? Would one of his suit jackets fetch a high price at auction? Would the presence of a man who is widely accused of human rights abuses encourage more $10,000-a-plate attendees at a gala ball? Somehow it just does not seem likely, which begs the question, what exactly is Mr Mugabe going to do in his new role? The World Health Organization has not made this at all clear.

"Speed limits for motorway roadworks could be raised in England under plans aimed at reducing congestion. Currently the normal speed for such stretches of road is 50mph (80km/h). But trials carried out by Highways England found drivers' heart rates were lower when they drove at 55mph (88km/h) and 60mph (96km/h) through roadworks. The government-owned company said the new limits could come into effect in some areas this year, but unions warn it would put motorway workers at risk. Learners can drive on motorways from 2018 Highways England recruited 36 participants for two trials and provided them with dash cams, watches with heart rate monitors, and GPS trackers to monitor their reactions to driving through the quicker speed limits. The tests took place at 60mph on the M5 between junction 4A (Bromsgrove) to junction 6 (Worcester), and at 55mph on the M3 in Surrey between junction 3 and 4A. The study found 60% of those who drove in the 60mph trial zone had a decreased average heart rate, while it was lower for only 56% of those on the 55mph journey. But trade union Unite, which represents road workers throughout the UK, said the proposed speed increases ignored the safety of those maintaining motorways, who ""work in already very dangerous conditions"". A spokesman said: ""Sadly, in recent years there have been several deaths of motorway workers and these changes will make their work even more dangerous. ""Already motorists frequently drive into coned-off areas. At increased speeds, it will make such potentially lethal accidents even more common."" The study suggested that motorists felt more relaxed travelling at higher speeds, partly because they had a greater ability to accelerate past heavy goods vehicles. Edmund King, president of the AA, said that most trucks have a speed limiter set at 56mph: ""And sometimes they're pretty reluctant to slow down so you get a lot of tail-gating of trucks driving very close to cars and then the cars are inclined to speed up."" While Mr King said increasing the speed limit could help reduce congestion, he said it had to be targeted at the longest stretches of road works where there were no workers. He said: ""When work is going on and it's in close proximity to the carriageways we should stick at lower speeds and sometimes it needs to be lower than 50mph, depending on the layout."" Jim O'Sullivan, chief executive of Highways England,told The Times,externalthat the 60mph limit was ""something that we want to introduce to as many roadworks as possible"". But Mr O'Sullivan said that lower speeds were likely to be maintained in areas with narrow lanes, contraflows or where workers are close to the road, due to safety reasons. Highways England has been testing different speed limits since September 2016 as part of a wider initiative to assess the benefits associated with increasing speed limits through roadworks. Those trials on a section of the M1 near Rotherham and on the A1 between Leeming to Barton examined the safety implications of the scheme as well as the journey-time benefits for drivers travelling through roadworks.

"The pair went missing in the arid desert park during extremely hot weather A California couple who went missing in July in the Joshua Tree National Park are believed to have died in a murder-suicide pact, police have said. Rachel Nguyen, 20 and Joseph Orbeso, 22, were first discovered on 15 October by a search and rescue party that included Mr Orbeso's father. Police said evidence at the scene suggested that Mr Orbeso shot Ms Nguyen before turning the gun on himself. It appeared they were low on food and without water, an official said. San Bernardino sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman told the BBC the couple was found under a tree and appeared to be embracing each other. She said Mr Orbeso and Ms Nguyen had positioned their clothing to cover their lower legs to protect themselves from the heat. Investigators found a handgun registered to Mr Orbeso at the scene, she added. ""The circumstances are really like no other search operation that we've been involved in,"" Ms Bachman said. ""But there is no evidence that leads [investigators] to believe that he was intending to harm her."" Mr Orbeso and Ms Nguyen were reported missing on 28 July after they failed to check out of their Airbnb accommodation in the Morongo Basin area. National Park Service rangers found their car near a trailhead, prompting search and rescue teams to spend more than 2,100 hours looking for the couple. According to Joshua Tree Search and Rescue, they were found in a ""a steep canyon"" north of the Maze Loop trail. The bodies were recovered a day after the discovery. The San Bernardino Sheriff's Department Morongo Basin stationsaid in a statement on Friday,externalthat homicide detectives were called to help ""due to suspicious circumstances and visible injuries"" to their bodies. The investigation is ongoing, they added. Rescuers have faced danger, as temperatures soar into triple digits fahrenheit Mr Orbeso's father said in an email to the Southern California News Group that he wants his son ""to be remembered as a kind, caring and thoughtful person"". ""The way he was found beside Rachel holding her as they were seeking shade under the brush says everything you need to know about him as a man and as a human being,""Mr Orbeso said,external. The week-long search had been suspended back in August after more than 10 search personnel were injured due to severe heat. The search was then ""scaled back to smaller teams on the weekends"", the sheriff said.

"Police said no motive had been established German police have arrested a man in Munich after four people were lightly injured by a knife attacker. Police said the suspect lashed out at five men and one woman around Rosenheimer Platz in the east of the city, but missed two of his targets. A police spokeswoman said the detained man strongly resembled descriptions given by witnesses at the scene. The suspect is said to have started attacking passers-by shortly after 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT). ""We have arrested a person who very strongly resembles the description by witnesses, but we cannot confirm that he is the attacker,"" Munich police spokesman Marcus da Gloria Martins said. Martins added that police had not been able to establish any motive for the attack. None of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries. Witness accounts described the suspect as a man in his 40s, unshaven, with grey trousers and a green tracksuit top and carrying a backpack and sleeping mat.

"The US-led coalition against so-called Islamic State (IS) says 98% of territory once claimed by the jihadist group across Iraq and Syria has been recaptured. Iraq's government announced in December 2017 that its war against IS was over, almost four years after the group first seized parts of the country. That month also saw Russia's President Vladimir Putin announce a partial withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria, after IS was left controlling only a few pockets of land. The capture of Raqqa by a US-backed alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters in October was seen as a major victory in the battle against IS. The city was the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" the group declared. A few months earlier, in July 2017, Iraqi government forces retook the second city of Mosul, which fell to IS in 2014 when militants routed the Iraqi army. At its peak, some 10 million people were living in territory under IS control. An intensive aerial bombardment by the US-led coalition helped secure victory in Raqqa for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which was formed in 2015 by the the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia and a number of smaller, Arab factions. Since early June, coalition planes have carried out almost 4,000 air strikes on the city. Estimates of the number of casualties vary. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 3,250 people had been killed, among them 1,130 civilians. Other groups say the total was higher. The UN estimates about 270,000 people fled their homes during the SDF offensive. The immense task of rebuilding the city may take years. Clearing operations are already under way to uncover any jihadist sleeper cells and remove landmines. Rebuilding Mosul is being seen as a major challenge for the Iraqi government. One Iraqi official estimated it would cost $1bn, others have put the figure far higher. Who cleans up after hurricanes, earthquakes and war? The top US commander in Iraq has also urged the government to ""reach out and reconcile with the Sunni population"" to prevent ""ISIS 2.0 from emerging"". The jihadists exploited the chaos and divisions within both Syria and Iraq. IS grew out of what was al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was formed by Sunni militants after the US-led invasion in 2003 and became a major force in the country's sectarian insurgency. In 2011, the group joined the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, where it found a safe haven and easy access to weapons. At the same time, it took advantage of the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, as well as widespread Sunni anger at the sectarian policies of the country's Shia-led government. In 2013, the group began seizing control of territory in Syria and changed its name to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis or Isil). The following year, Isis overran large swathes of northern and western Iraq, proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", and became known as ""Islamic State"". A subsequent advance into areas controlled by Iraq's Kurdish minority, and the killing or enslaving of thousands of members of the Yazidi religious group, prompted the US-led coalition to begin air strikes on IS positions in Iraq in August 2014. As IS is now being forced out of Iraq and Syria, another problem is the likely resurgence of hostilities between rival groups. In October 2017, Iraqi forces pushed Kurdish Peshmerga fighters back from land they took during the fight against IS around Kirkuk. Exact numbers of casualties from the conflict with IS are not available. The UN says at least 3,298 civilians were killed in acts of violence in Iraq in 2017, fewer than the 2016 total of 6,878 - although the true figure is likely to be higher as the organisation has been unable to verify some reports of casualties in the Mosul area. According to Iraq Body Count, the total number of civilian deaths in Iraq since 2014 stood at 68,260 up to the end of February 2018. The annual number of casualties has decreased slightly each year since 2014, from a high of 20,218 in that year to 13,187 in 2017. The UN no longer keeps track of casualty figures in Syria due to the inaccessibility of many areas and the conflicting reports from the various parties to the war there. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported in March 2018 that it had documented the deaths of more than 353,900 people, including 106,000 civilians, since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began 2011. But it noted that the figure did not include 56,900 people who were missing and presumed dead. It estimated a further 100,000 deaths had not been documented. The US-led coalition has conducted more than 13,300 air strikes against IS targets in Iraq since August 2014. Most attacks have been carried out by US aircraft, but those from Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the UK have also taken part. By the end of 2017, 74 countries were said to have joined the US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria. In Syria, the air campaign began in September 2014. Since then, more than 14,600 strikes have been carried out by coalition forces, which include Australia, Bahrain, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the UK. The number of strikes each month rose steadily in Iraq up to a peak in January 2016 and then began to fall as the number of strikes in Syria increased dramatically, reaching a high of just over 1,400 in August 2017. Russia is not part of the coalition, but its jets began air strikes against what it called ""terrorists"" in Syria in September 2015. There is little information from official sources about the Russian air strikes. TheInstitute for the Study of War,externalsaid evidence suggested Russian planes targeted deep into opposition-held territory, and helped Syrian government forces to retake control of the city of Aleppo in December 2016. However, Russia warned the US coalition that it would treat itsaircraft as targetsafter the US shot down a Syrian military plane during the assault on Raqqa. The incident led to a suspension of communications between the two sides aimed at avoiding clashes in the air. With the proclamation of a caliphate at the end of June 2014, IS signalled its intention to spread beyond Iraq and Syria. By August 2016, IS was reported to be operational in 18 countries across the world, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to evidence seen by the USNational Counterterrorism Center,external. It also found signs of what it called ""aspiring branches"" in Mali, Egypt, Somalia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines. Since 2016, IS has claimed attacks in a number of countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia, France, Belgium, Germany, the US, Finland and Bangladesh. In 2017, IS claimed to be behind at least two attacks in the UK. The proclamation of the caliphate triggered a surge in the number of foreign fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq to join IS. According to the head of the UK's intelligence service, MI5, more than 800 people have travelled from UK to join the conflict in Iraq and Syria - and 130 of them had died. Oil was once the biggest single source of revenue for IS. The group seized control of many oil fields in Syria and Iraq, and sold oil on the black market. But revenue has fallen sinceIS lost control of oil-producing areas,externalin northern Syrian and western Iraq, and US-led coalition and Russian air strikes began targeting oil infrastructure. Income from taxes and fees has also fallen as IS has lost control of major cities like Mosul and Raqqa. Money obtained by looting and fines initially increased, especially when IS seized Mosul in 2014, but has since declined. At one point, IS was reported to be so short of funds that it was imposing random fines for offences like driving on the wrong side of the road. According to a report byIHS Markit,external, territorial losses are the main factor contributing to IS's loss of revenue. It says the group's ability to compensate for financial losses by increasing the fiscal burden on the population it controls appears to have reached its limits. The struggle to stay rich More than 5.6 million Syrians have fled abroad to escape the fighting in Syria, according to the UN. Most have ended up in neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Almost one million Syrians applied for asylum in Europe between April 2011 and July 2017, according to UN figures. There are also estimated to be 6.1 million Syrians who have been displaced inside Syria and are living in camps or other makeshift accommodation. For the first time since the beginning of the crisis in Iraq in December 2013, the number of people returning to their area of origin in the country has surpassed the number of people displaced in the country. By the end of 2017, some 3.2 million people had returned home, while a 2.6 million remained displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration.

"Canadian Joshua Boyle and American Caitlan Coleman were rescued this month after being held captive for five years by a Taliban-linked insurgent group. But what were twoWestern backpackers doing in Afghanistan in the first place? ""Looking back, I think it was two years before we saw any proof they were alive,"" recalls Joshua Boyle's friend Alex Edwards. ""I had assumed that they were probably dead, and tried to make peace with that."" Joshua Boyle and Caitlan Coleman were kidnapped in Afghanistan in 2012 after venturing into one of the most hostile regions of the war-torn country. The last email from Boyle, sent to Coleman's parents on 8 October of that year, said they were in a part of Afghanistan he described as ""unsafe"". The two were held in captivity for five years, suffering violence and abuse. Boyle says one of the children they conceived during the ordeal was killed by their captors. Edwards says when he first heard his friend had travelled to Afghanistan with Coleman - who was seven months pregnant at the time - he couldn't understand how they had ""done something so appallingly dangerous"". Family and friends have described Boyle and Coleman as naive idealists - a couple with strong convictions and humanitarian inclinations. In interviews following their release, Boyle said he and Coleman travelled to Afghanistan to help people. He called himself a ""pilgrim"" on a mission. He told reporters he went to help ""the most neglected minority group in the world. Those ordinary villagers who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help"". What exactly the couple intended to do to help is a question that hasn't been answered. A French soldier secures a perimeter on a forward observing post in the Wardak province Coleman, 31, grew up in Stewartstown, a small Pennsylvania town about 100 miles west of Philadelphia. Boyle, 34, was raised in Smith Falls, near Canada's capital city Ottawa. The two met online, reportedly bonding over a shared love of Star Wars. They married in 2011. Friendsinterviewed in 2016 by Philadelphia magazine,externaldescribe Coleman as a devout Christian who loved travel and had a gentle sense of humour - ""big-hearted, relentlessly optimistic, adventurous, funny and flawed"". Boyle - a self-described ""pacifist Mennonite hippie child"" according to Edwards - has a more contentious past. He was briefly married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of former Guantanamo bay inmate Omar Khadr. The union pulled him publicly into the orbit of one of Canada's most notorious families. Joshua and Caitlan before their capture The Khadr family patriarch, who was killed in Pakistan in 2003, was an alleged close associate of Osama Bin Laden. Zaynab herself is well known for her outspoken views, refusing to condemn terror attacks like the London bombings of 2005 or downplaying 9/11. Omar Khadr, who was caught in Afghanistan at 15 by American forces, was held in Guantanamo for 10 years and charged with the murder of a US soldier. Critics accuse him of being a radicalised fighter at the time of his capture. But Omar's supporters considered him a child soldier and Boyle - a human rights advocate - took a deep interest in his case. His marriage to Zaynab Khadr ended in 2010. The Associated Press has reported that US officials don't believe Boyle's former ties to the Khadr family had anything to do with the kidnapping of him and his wife. Before leaving on their Central Asian adventure, Coleman had told friends they would only travel to the ""safe '-stans"" during their six-month trip. But at some point, that changed. The couple pictured before their kidnapping In 2012, a UK man met Joshua Boyle and Coleman in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Richard Cronin describes how Boyle - after a long night spent discussing historic explorers - convinced him to travel to Afghanistan. Boyle and Coleman had been backpacking in Russia and the former Soviet Republics of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Afghanistan was next on the list. ""I asked Josh where he wanted to go in Afghanistan and he replied 'all over'. ""He had also said it was safe provided you didn't go to a region where there were foreign troops and the Taliban, namely the south,"" Cronin wrote in a blog about the encounter. While in Afghanistan, Cronin learned that Boyle and Coleman had gone missing in the country. Cronin latertold a Toronto Star reporter,externalwho covered the couple's lengthy captivity: ""I hope Josh and his family get out safely. I have some questions I'd really like to ask them. I'm sure you do too"". The Pakistan-Afghanistan border In 2013, after months of anguished mystery, the Boyle and Coleman families learned what had happened to the vanished couple. They had been taken hostage by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network while travelling in the Wardak Province, a mountainous region outside Kabul. Who are the Taliban? A man believed to have ties to the Taliban emailed the Coleman family two videos of Boyle and their daughter, asking for the US and Canada to do more to free them from their captors. In the video - the first of four released to the families - they appear tired, dispirited, and dazed. Coleman had given birth to her first son in captivity. This video can not be played File video of Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlan Coleman while in captivity Boyle and Coleman's families made those first two videos public in 2014 after the release of US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had also been held as a Taliban captive, hoping the publicity would help their appeal for the couple's safe return. The last video released of the two came out just 10 months ago, shortly before Christmas. It showed Boyle and Coleman with two of their children. In that video, Coleman described their situation as a ""Kafkaesque nightmare"". The family was subject to mistreatment and violence during their captivity. In interviews, Boyle says the family was frequently shuffled between locations, often held in rooms not much bigger than a toilet stall. There were times Boyle and Coleman were separated and beaten. But Boyle has also said one of their biggest challenges was the daily tedium, the long hours with little to fill them. In a short email exchange with the BBC, Boyle described passing the time educating their two sons. ""We had always intended to home school our own offspring - we just hadn't foreseen it would be without books, paper or pen... but we made do with what we had, tore up old garbage to make solar systems, splinters of wood to learn multiplying, bottle caps became compasses, etc,"" he wrote. He told the Associated Press that they decided to have children in captivity because ""we're sitting as hostages with a lot of time on our hands. We always wanted as many as possible, and we didn't want to waste time. Cait's in her 30s, the clock is ticking."" An Afghan security force member keeps watch at the site of a suicide attack in Wardak province In the intervening years, Boyle and Coleman's family and friends expressed frustration at the apparent lack of interest from the US and Canadian officials, and the media and public's indifference to their plight. ""It doesn't get the attention it deserves, and I have no idea why,"" a friend toldPhiladelphia magazine,externalin a 2016 feature about Coleman. ""It's just messed up. She's a person. She has a family. She's not just this 'kidnapped American woman.'"" This video can not be played Caitlan Coleman's family makes an appeal for their daughter's return Edwards says he received mostly disinterest when he tried to get the Star Wars and Firefly fan communities - Boyle was an aficionado of both - to help raise awareness of their case. In retrospect, he feels it's clear why he couldn't rally people to their cause. ""People don't want to help with something unless they know it's the right thing to do, and there were just too many complicating factors in Josh and Caitlan's situation,"" he says. ""What were they doing in Afghanistan? What's the deal with the Khadr connection? I tried to answer those questions as best I could, but the fact that they even came up is a huge strike against people caring."" But Edwards says: ""The fact that no one seemed particularly concerned about two Canadian children being held captive by the Taliban is a shocking indictment of our society."" The couple were captured in Afghanistan's Wardak province and rescued near Kohat, Pakistan In 2015, a retired Special Forces officer testified before a US Senate committee about a plan to rescue to Boyle, Coleman and their children from captivity as part of a larger prisoner swap. The Green Beret's team had been tasked with trying to help bring soldier Bowe Bergdahl home. ""We also realised that there were civilian hostages in Pakistan that nobody was trying to free so they were added to our mission,"" Jason Amerine said, mentioning Boyle and Coleman by name in his testimony. The rescue plan collapsed, though Bergdahl was eventually released in 2014 in a controversial Taliban prisoner exchange. It seemed that Boyle and Coleman were slowly being forgotten. So their release after five years of captivity came as a surprise. On 12 October, Pakistani and US officials confirmed Pakistani troops rescued the family in a successful but risky mission - shooting out the tyres of the car where they were stuffed in the boot. Boyle, Coleman and their three children were safe and heading home. This video can not be played ""It was amazing"" - Boyle's parents relive the moment they heard of his release Aisha Ahmad, a University of Toronto political scientist who studies jihadist groups, suggests it was no coincidence the timing of the rescue came during a tense period between US and Pakistan. ""The reason the Pakistanis were so willing to pull the trigger is because they desperately needed to mend relations with the new Trump administration,"" she says. The family's release netted rare praise for Pakistan from Mr Trump who called it ""a sign that it [Pakistan] is honouring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region"". ""The Pakistani army and the intelligence community are very realistic in their calculations - they are strategists,"" says Ahmad.  ""They care about geopolitics, they play the long game."" On Thursday, CIA director Mike Pompeo told a Washington-based think tank Boyle and Coleman were held in Pakistan during their long captivity, contradicting earlier claims made by Pakistani officials. Joshua Boyle speaks to media at Toronto's Pearson airport After landing in Canada, Joshua Boyle struck out at his former captors. He says the ""criminal miscreants"" raped Coleman and killed a fourth child - a daughter - in a forced abortion. The Taliban have denied Coleman was assaulted and claim the child died due to a miscarriage. Boyle told the BBC about the one captor he got to know, a man from the West with whom he could ""ask esoteric questions on little-known points of Islamic law and history"". After the learning of the rape by some of the guards, the man defected to the so-called Islamic State ""try to find a truer jihad"" and promised ""to try and tell ISIS of the cruelties, acts of disbelief and hypocrisy of the Haqqani Network"". ""I offered him my fullest forgiveness, and Caitlan said she would forgive him all his minor sins against her, but she couldn't forgive what he'd done to the children in his blind exuberance for the group at the start,"" Boyle wrote. Joshua Boyle plays outdoors with his son near his family's home For now, Boyle, Coleman and their three children are adjusting to their newfound freedom in the suburban sanctuary of Boyle's parents' Ontario home. The children have the resilience of youth and attentive grandparents, and Boyle has said they're slowly adapting to their new circumstances, though the family continues to sleep together in one small room. ""It's not welcome to the western world, it's not welcome to Canada, it's welcome to life,"" he told NBC's Today programme. Coleman has not spoken publicly since her release and was admitted to hospital earlier this week with an undisclosed ailment. Boyle told journalists the couple are focusing on building a safe home for their children and that he remains committed ""to do the right thing no matter the cost"". ""In the final analysis, it is the intentions of our actions, not their consequences, on which we all shall eventually be judged."" .

"Sellafield reprocesses and stores nearly all of Britain's nuclear waste Bomb disposal experts were called to the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant after a routine audit of chemicals stored in a laboratory. Sellafield Ltd said it was ""not a radiological event"" but involved a small number of canisters of solvents which had been on the site since 1992. However, there were concerns they could become hazardous if exposed to oxygen. An area of the site was cordoned off for most of the day, and the canisters disposed of by controlled explosion. Sellafield said in a statement: ""These chemicals are used extensively in many industries and are well understood. ""Because this is happening on the Sellafield site we exercise extreme caution and leave nothing to chance."" It said a team from the army's Explosives Ordinance Disposal Team disposed of the chemicals by digging a trench, burying them using sandbags and detonating them in a controlled manner. The disposal took place in two batches, with the first transferred from the laboratory to another location on the site and successfully and safely detonated at around 14:15 BST. A second controlled explosion was then carried out at the same location shortly before 16:00 BST. The statement added: ""We have now removed the cordon from around the laboratory, and the site is working as it would be on any other Saturday.""

"Is the economy moving fast enough to bear a rate rise? It's been 10 years since the UK last saw interest rates rise. Back then, the iPhone had only just been unveiled, Twitter was a one-year old mystery and Instagram didn't even exist. Hard to imagine life without these things now, but interest rates of 5.75% and Gordon Brown as prime minister seem strangely alien. After that 0.25% rise, the world of monetary policy went into a tailspin, with central banks imposing a rapid series of interest rate cuts as it attempted to outrun the credit crunch. Finally, in March 2009 they hit a record low of 0.5% until being cut again to 0.25% in August 2016 in the aftermath of the shock Brexit vote. It will certainly be an unfamiliar feeling to see rates rise, although discussions about lifting them have rumbled during much of that almost nine-year period of record lows. Hold the phone: The last time rates went up the iPhone had just come out in the US Next month is hotly tipped to be the one that changes the direction of interest rates. Last month, Mark Carney dropped what was seen as his biggest hint yet that rates would be increased soon, possibly in November. Granted, the economic backdrop is difficult to decipher. This week saw inflation at a five-year high, weak retail sales figures on Thursday - but government borrowing figures on Friday way better than expected. And the underlying picture is of sluggish economic growth, persistently weak productivity, and wage rises that lag inflation and eat into earning power. On top of that, household debt is rising five times faster than earnings and is more than Â£200bn - a state of affairs that Bank of England governor Mark Carney has remarked on often. We ask two former rate-setters from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee whether now is the time to bite the bullet. ""First of all, I would try very hard not to give advice to the Monetary Policy Committee. When you're on it, you have so much more information to go on. But I might be tempted to join the 'Raise' group. ""I am concerned about the level of credit."" She believes the Brexit effect is one that is out of the Bank's control: ""You can cut the level of credit, you can't really do anything with monetary policy to offset the difficulties that are inevitable because of Brexit. ""We are going to go into a period of economic difficulty that will be worse if we have people with high borrowing."" But won't higher interest rates make life even worse for those with high debts, by simply making them harder to pay off? ""We have to try to keep the economy in reasonable balance. There was a failure to pay enough attention to what was going on with credit in households and small businesses in the run-up to the crisis. ""The debt position is precarious. Sooner or later, we are going to have to move to raise rates. If not, even more people will be taking on credit. We need to encourage savers and discourage borrowers."" She accepts there is a worry about higher inflation, while the tightness of the labour market - which should mean higher wages - getting tighter still if fewer people come to the UK to work from the European Union. She accepts the retail sales figure for September was weak, but points out that it does not capture the whole of what the consumer is doing, and that the GDP numbers are ""fairly feeble"". Her vote is to move rates higher now. ""In essence, in an ideal world, it would have been good if rates had been raised a year, or two, or three ago and were now at a higher level. ""That would have helped to prevent the build-up of consumer debt that Kate and so many of us are concerned about. ""However, at this stage, the horse has bolted. The debt has already built up now and I'm not sure the macro-economic conjuncture justifies a rise at this stage,"" Dr Wadhwani says. He accepts higher inflation, which is outstripping wages, is a worry, but says that will work itself out of the system: ""We all know that inflation is higher because of temporary factors relating to the pound and Brexit. Wage rises are benign and growth is pretty anaemic - and could get even weaker. ""It seems odd to be raising rates at a time when growth is likely to weaken further. It would be much better to hang on and wait for the uncertainty surrounding Brexit to lift."" He also sees Kate Barker's point on Brexit being none of the Bank of England's doing - and hard for it to counter: ""It's true that the bank has no responsibility to deal with Brexit per se - it's a political decision. ""You are, though, dealt a hand and you have to deal with it - Brexit appears to reduce demand more than it reduces supply, so as a bank, you have to keep your foot on the pedal [keep rates low] to stimulate the economy, and that's what it should do. ""No real policy mistake is going to be committed by not raising rates at this stage.""

"This video can not be played Some 450,000 people protested on Saturday, local police said The Spanish prime minister has outlined plans to remove Catalonia's leaders and take control of the separatist region. Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday, Mariano Rajoy stopped short of dissolving the region's parliament but put forward plans for elections. The measures must now be approved by Spain's Senate in the next few days. The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Carme Forcadell, called the measures a ""de facto coup d'etat"". ""It is an authoritarian coup inside a member state of the European Union,"" she said, adding that Mr Rajoy intended to ""put an end to  a democratically elected government"". Large crowds have gathered in Barcelona to protest against direct rule from Madrid. It comes almost three weeks after Catalonia held a disputed independence referendum. Spain's supreme court had declared the vote illegal and said it violated the constitution, which describes the country as indivisible. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has ignored pleas from the national government to abandon moves towards independence. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Cases for and against independence The crisis in 300 words Mr Rajoy said the the Catalan government's actions were ""contrary to the law and seeking confrontation"". He said it was ""not our wish, it was not our intention"" to impose direct rule. This will be via Article 155 of Spain's constitution, which allows it to impose direct rule in a crisis on any of the country's semi-autonomous regions. Mr Rajoy said the government would apply Spain's Article 155 Spanish law dictates that elections must be held within six months of Article 155 being triggered, but Mr Rajoy said it was imperative that the vote be held much sooner. Reports say that Spain's interior ministry is preparing take control of Catalonia's Mossos police force and remove its commander Josep LluÃ­s Trapero, who is already facing sedition charges. The government is also considering taking control of Catalonia's public broadcaster TV3, El PaÃ­s newspaperreported,external. As well as calling Mr Rajoy's actions a coup, SpeakerMs Forcadell,externalsaid they were not permitted under Article 155. ""We are committed to working tirelessly to represent what Catalans voted for,"" she said. Catalan Vice-PresidentOriol Junqueras,externalsaid Mr Rajoy and his allies had ""not just suspended autonomy. They have suspended democracy"". Barcelona MayorAda Colau,externalsaid it was a ""serious attack on the rights and freedoms of all, both here and elsewhere"" and called for demonstrations. The president of Barcelona football club,Josep Maria Bartomeu,external, said the club gave its ""absolute support for the democratic institutions of Catalonia chosen by its people"". But he called for any reaction to be ""civil and peaceful"" and said dialogue was the only way to a solution. Pro-independence Catalans took to the streets after PM Rajoy spoke Eduard Rivas Mateo,external, spokesman for the Catalan Socialist party - which supports the Spanish government's stance but also wants constitutional reform - said he could not accept a ""harsh application"" of Article 155. ButInÃ©s Arrimadas,external, head of the centrist Ciudadanos party in Catalonia, which is against independence, said holding fresh elections would ""restore goodwill and democracy"" in the region. Catalan leader Mr Puigdemont is due to speak at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT). Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Mariano Rajoy's use of Article 155 had been widely anticipated, but his announcement when it came still had a huge impact. The article has never been invoked before, so there was a certain amount of mystery surrounding its potential reach and meaning. Although Mr Rajoy insisted that Catalonia's self-government is not being suspended, many will disagree. The removal from office of Carles Puigdemont and all the members of his cabinet, to allow ministers in Madrid to take on their duties, amounts to a major reining in of Catalonia's devolved powers. The Spanish prime minister said that one of his aims is to restore peaceful co-existence to Catalonia with these measures. Many Catalans who want to remain in Spain will approve of this strident action. But those who want independence for their region are likely to see this as a provocation rather than a solution. Catalonia's regional government held a referendum on 1 October to ask residents of the region if they wanted to break away from Spain. Of the 43% of Catalans said to have taken part, 90% voted in favour of independence. But many anti-independence supporters boycotted the ballot, arguing it was not valid. Mr Puigdemont and other regional leaders then signed a declaration of independence, but immediately suspended it in order to allow for talks. He then defied two deadlines set by the national government to clarify Catalonia's position. This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis?

"Critics say health services have collapsed under Mr Mugabe's rule The choice of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe as a World Health Organization (WHO) goodwill ambassador has been criticised by several organisations including the British government. It described his selection as ""surprising and disappointing"" given his country's rights record, and warned it could overshadow the WHO's work. The opposition in Zimbabwe and campaign groups also criticised the move. The WHO head said he was ""rethinking his approach in light of WHO values"". Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had previously praised Zimbabwe for its commitment to public health. He said it was a country that ""places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all"". Profile: Robert Mugabe Africa's 'medical tourist' presidents Mr Mugabe's appointment as a ""goodwill ambassador"" to help tackle non-communicable diseases has attracted a chorus of criticism. Critics have long argued that Zimbabwe's health service is not meeting the needs of patients The British government said it was all the more surprising given US and EU sanctions against him. ""We have registered our concerns"" with the director general, a spokesman said. ""Although Mugabe will not have an executive role, his appointment risks overshadowing the work undertaken globally by the WHO on non-communicable diseases."" Zimbabwe's leader has been frequently taken to task over human rights abuses by the European Union and the US. Critics say Zimbabwe's health care system has collapsed, with staff often going without pay while medicines are in short supply. Dr Tedros, who is Ethiopian,is the first African to lead the WHO. He was elected in May with a mandate to tackle perceived politicisation in the organisation. US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it was an embarrassment to give the ambassador role to Mr Mugabe, because his ""utter mismanagement of the economy has devastated health services"". Critics of the president say that Zimbabwe's health care system is in a shambolic state HRW's Kenneth Roth said Mr Mugabe's appointment was a cause for concern because the president and some of his officials travel abroad for treatment. ""When you go to Zimbabwean hospitals, they lack the most basic necessities,"" he said. Zimbabwe's main MDC opposition party also denounced the WHO move. ""The Zimbabwe health delivery system is in a shambolic state, it is an insult,"" spokesman Obert Gutu told AFP. ""Mugabe trashed our health delivery system... he allowed our public hospitals to collapse."" Other groups who have criticised Mr Mugabe's appointment include the Wellcome Trust, the NCD Alliance, UN Watch, the World Heart Federation and Action Against Smoking. President Mugabe heard about his appointment while attending a conference held by the WHO, a UN agency, on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Montevideo, Uruguay. He told delegates his country had adopted several strategies to combat the challenges presented by such diseases,which the WHO says kill about 40 million people a year,externaland include cancers, respiratory diseases and diabetes. ""Zimbabwe has developed a national NCD policy, a palliative care policy, and has engaged United Nations agencies working in the country, to assist in the development of a cervical cancer prevention and control strategy,"" Mr Mugabe was reportedby the state-run Zimbabwe Herald newspaper,externalas saying. But the president admitted that Zimbabwe was similar to other developing countries in that it was ""hamstrung by a lack of adequate resources for executing programmes aimed at reducing NCDs and other health conditions afflicting the people"". Medicine is often in short supply at Zimbabwe's hospitals, critics say Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva The UN has a bit of thing for goodwill ambassadors, especially famous ones. Angelina Jolie, as ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency, was regularly pictured comforting displaced families in over-crowded camps. Swiss tennis star Roger Federer visits aid projects in Africa for Unicef and plays charity matches to raise money. Further back in time, film star and Unicef goodwill ambassador Audrey Hepburn visited disaster zones and graced gala dinners where her glittering presence was an encouragement to donors. The publicity does attract support for relief efforts. But it is hard to imagine 93-year-old Robert Mugabe fulfilling a similar remit. Will he provide comfort in WHO field clinics in conflict zones? Would one of his suit jackets fetch a high price at auction? Would the presence of a man who is widely accused of human rights abuses encourage more $10,000-a-plate attendees at a gala ball? Somehow it just does not seem likely, which begs the question, what exactly is Mr Mugabe going to do in his new role? The World Health Organization has not made this at all clear.

"This video can not be played Suspects covered their faces as they were taken for questioning Police in Brazil say they have arrested 108 people in the biggest operation ever against paedophiles in Latin America. Suspects were arrested in 24 states and the capital, Brasilia. Justice Minister Torquato Jardim said those detained were part of a ring that shared pornographic images of children through computers and mobile phones. The operation comes at the end of a six-month investigation, which involved US and European immigration officials. Investigators have found more than 150,000 files containing disturbing images. They were accessed through the dark web, a part of the internet not reached by most search engines. Among those arrested were retired policemen, civil servants and people in charge of football youth clubs. More than 1,000 officers were involved in the operation Mr Jardim said the paedophiles use sophisticated techniques to evade police investigations. ""They store their illegal, criminal photos in a computer of someone in another part of the country or even abroad,"" he said. ""And often the people storing the content are unaware,"" added Mr Jardim. The operation initially targeted suspects of sharing illegal paedophile material. But after seizing dozens of computers, mobile phones, CDs and hard drives, investigators found out that the criminal group was also producing pornographic material to distribute on the internet. The files contained disturbing images of babies and young children being abused. Some of the children and teenagers denounced their own parents or other relatives to officers taking part in the operation. It is not clear if the paedophile ring operated independently in Brazil or if it was connected with other criminal networks abroad.
