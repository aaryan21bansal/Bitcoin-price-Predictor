" Robert Paxton McCulloch was already a multi-millionaire by the time he turned 18. But inheriting part of his grandfather’s fortune in 1925 didn’t blunt his ambition or work ethic. Driven by a compulsion to invent, after graduating from Stanford University he started a company that created supercharged car engines. While he was still a young man McCulloch sold the business for $1m. It was the first chapter in a lucrative career that would take him from the Midwest to California, where he had successful ventures making chainsaws and boat engines. “He was a genius,” says his grandson Michael. “He was astute at building and invention; he designed engines - that was his forte. “He was a little on the eccentric side, but extremely nice. I only ever saw a very gentle person.” McCulloch married Barbara Ann Briggs, daughter of the co-founder of the engine company Briggs and Stratton McCulloch, who was known to his grandchildren as RP, never lost his temper and was fun to be around, Michael says. He was something of a character who kept odd hours, working late into the night and sleeping until noon. Later, he would order the same thing at the same branch of Marie Callender’s pie place; a distinctive sight in the outfit he wore almost every day. “It was a cream chino suit, a very thin black tie, a white shirt, and he had his trousers taken up three inches shorter. He would wear yellow socks, with white and brown saddle shoes,” says Michael. “When he passed away, I wanted a pair of those shoes because that was his trademark. I opened the closet and there were 40 pairs of shoes and 25 suits and nothing else.” Robert Paxton McCulloch was already a multi-millionaire by the time he turned 18.

Robert Jr was the eldest of the couple's four children Later, he would order the same thing at the same branch of Marie Callender’s pie place; a distinctive sight in the outfit he wore almost every day. “It was a cream chino suit, a very thin black tie, a white shirt, and he had his trousers taken up three inches shorter.

I opened the closet and there were 40 pairs of shoes and 25 suits and nothing else.” McCulloch was a man who fizzed with ideas and was often found tinkering at his holiday house in Palm Springs. It was a place of innovation, where the mundane became fascinating. Drawers did not hold typical domestic trappings - they slid open to reveal chilled cocktail glasses. Such quirks led to Life magazine dubbing the country club home a “push-button paradise” in 1956. The issue featured a number of McCulloch’s inventions “It was way, way before its time,” says Michael. “Everything was electronic. All the doors, all the drawers, everything opened by pushing buttons or by sliding a toggle. “There were features that would turn on the coffee [machine] or the bath or the steam room at whatever time you wanted. All the lighting was controlled by a master panel. No other house had that.” After a successful start in making racing engines, McCulloch branched out into boat engines McCulloch was constantly looking for ways to make life easier. The magazine’s front cover featured another of his creations - a human “Lazy Susan” that rotated with the sun to ensure an even tan. “He came up with a lot of ideas,” says Michael. “He created a jet pack, a two-person helicopter. He made a thing that was like a facelift [using] steam, which would tighten your skin. “It was just something he did for fun. He was a very smart, creative person that needed to keep inventing.” Lake Havasu was created after the completion of the Parker Dam in 1938, which held back the Colorado River It was this compulsion, coupled with good business acumen, that led to his next project. With nowhere to test his boat engines in land-locked eastern California, he hopped over the border into Arizona in search of water. The story goes that it was from the air that McCulloch spotted the ribbon of Havasu’s lake below, snaking through a parcel of land flanked by the Chemehuevi, Whipple and Mojave Mountains. “They noticed it was a really, really beautiful place,” says Michael.  “They took a look around, offered $76 an acre and started building. “He realised there was a huge opportunity there.” The Bridge House Estates committee of the City of London Common Council had known for some time London Bridge was sinking further into the River Thames with every passing rush hour. Horse-drawn carriages had long since made way for cars and double-decker buses and, over the years, the structure had been hammered deeper into the riverbed. The obvious solution to members in 1965 was to demolish it and start again; build a new bridge, for a new era of commuters. Former newspaper and PR man Ivan Luckin had other ideas. “He thought it was all very well knocking it down, but what about its future?”  says former councillor Archie Galloway. “That’s when Ivan made his move. He said to the committee, ‘we ought to sell it’. “A lot of eyebrows went up at that.” Luckin wanted to go a step further and advertise in the United States, where he felt certain someone would be interested in buying a well-known London landmark. “Someone sensibly asked what they might get for [the bridge] and Ivan is recorded as saying, ‘one million’,” says Archie. “And they said, ‘one million dollars?’ “Ivan said, ‘I’m talking about one million pounds.’ [Nearly three millions dollars at the time.] They sat up at that.” News of the sale was soon the subject of newspaper and TV reports trotting out the inevitable line that London Bridge “was falling down”. Luckin’s glossy 40-page brochure for prospective buyers promoted not only the structure itself, but the chance to own a slice of history - a bridge had crossed the Thames in this part of London since Roman times. The new bridge was opened in 1973 by the Queen It was this potential that inspired McCulloch and his business partner, Cornelius Vanderbilt “CV” Wood, who was known for designing Disneyland in California. Stories about how the pair got wind of the sale vary - according to Michael, they saw an advert on TV while on business in London. “They had been having a few drinks together and saw it and I think they probably looked at each other and thought, ‘we should take that apart, that will be our gimmick’.” Another version has Wood at a meeting about the sale of the RMS Queen Mary, at New York’s Plaza Hotel, where he supposedly asked, “anything else for sale?” Either way, Luckin’s perseverance paid off and when the ink dried on the contract of sale on 18 April 1968, he was a man vindicated - his outlandish idea matched only by an even more ludicrous one. “Ivan was immensely proud of it but never went around shouting it from the rooftops,” says Archie. “I think a lot of people thought he was a lunatic, but he was a man of single purpose. “I can’t believe anyone else would have thought of the idea.” When his parents announced they were moving to Lake Havasu City in February 1965, Rick Kingsbury was incredulous. It sounded to him the place barely existed - and he was right. “It wasn’t my idea to move here; no 13-year-old kid in his right mind would want to move to a godforsaken place like this at the time. “We had no electricity, no water, we didn’t have air conditioning. There was one phone, the post office was a closet at the liquor store and the mail went to a box 20 miles away. “Those first few months were like a big camping trip you were never going to go home from. “There was nothing here. I hated the place.” In 1965 there were about 20 homes and a trailer park For Joe Hunnicutt, the worst thing was the dizzying heat of summers inching towards 50C (122F). “I absolutely hated it. My parents took me out of Wyoming and they took me to hell. “We came in August and I stepped outside and I was like,‘are you kidding me?’ “I was eight and all I wanted to do was ride my bike. I couldn’t do that there. “My whole goal was to get out, but you’ve got to give it to them, the people that stuck it out in that godforsaken middle of nowhere.” Those who moved to Lake Havasu between 1964 and 1974 call themselves pioneers - a nod to their 19th Century forefathers who travelled westwards in wagons in search of a better life. But Rick wasn’t imbued with such spirit and it was a year before he saw the merits of living somewhere with one stop sign, two roads and 600 neighbours. The first 10 houses were built in 1964 by Alfred Anderson “I was a reluctant pioneer,” says Rick.“It was only during that second summer I realised what a paradise it was for a kid. “There was all this exploring in the desert, so there was this feeling of Tom Sawyer, of living in this wonderland. “We had this great big lake pretty much to ourselves and we were up to our necks in the cool water. “It was this huge playground and it was all ours.” By the end of 1965, the elementary school had acquired two new classes, and a grocery store had opened its doors. The real change, however, came in 1968, when news trickled back to this tiny desert “city” that its founder had made a bizarre purchase. In the beginning there was just one major crossroad “The whole economics of the place and the attitude of the town changed overnight,” says Rick. “It was like a rocket ship, it took off and went crazy. In the three years it took to build the bridge, the population tripled. “But there was almost a little regret for me. We were growing and I realised it was going to go away. “It was all going to change.” Visitors to Lake Havasu City might assume it existed only because its founder had embarked upon a curious plan to rebuild a piece of British history in the desert. In reality, McCulloch’s small community grew steadily in its fledgling years. The US census recorded that by 1970 the city had more than 4,000 residents - a substantial increase on the handful that called it home six years earlier. But even the engineer’s most faithful supporters struggled to share his vision back in 1964. Early West remembers how in the spring of that year, he and McCulloch had been drinking coffee outside the entrepreneur's new factory in Lake Havasu when, seemingly out of the blue, he said: “I see a city.” “I didn’t know what to say; there was nothing, just desert,” says Early. “I said, ‘I don’t see that city’. And Robert said, ‘I promise, you will’.” Adverts appeared in newspapers offering free trips to Lake Havasu City Lake Havasu’s growth was in part down to dynamic marketing of the American dream - the promise of a better (and sunnier) life. “RP started doing commercials and advertising in the Midwest where it was freezing,” says Michael. “He purchased a bunch of planes and started flying people out on free flights. “They were treated like kings. They were put up in a beautiful hotel for two or three days, had all their meals paid for and all they had to do was go on a tour for a couple of hours. “And it worked like a charm. They sold a lot of those homes that way.” Visitors to Lake Havasu City might assume it existed only because its founder had embarked upon a curious plan to rebuild a piece of British history in the desert.

On arrival, they were chauffeured to the Havasu Hotel, where a waterfall cascaded dramatically over its front door. “It was unbelievable,” says Evie Cistaro, who visited from Boston on the Thanksgiving weekend of 1972. “We stopped and picked up people in Pennsylvania and Chicago and when we arrived it was 75F (24C) and the sun was shining. “They wined us and dined us and showed us the land, and we bought it and signed. “It was a new beginning.” A salesman was assigned to each couple that stepped off the plane Joe Hunnicutt remembers hearing the sales pitch from his father, Ray, who sold lots for McCulloch. “They drove people around to buy property and I used to sit in the back of the Jeep with them,” he said. “I had that [pitch] memorised... some of it was true, some of it wasn’t.” Hundreds boarded the McCulloch-branded propeller planes on chilly runways in Chicago, Boston and New York.

I thought, ‘it’s an investment’. “But I remember people walking up and down the aisles [on the flight back] saying, ‘who wants to buy a pile of rocks?’ “And I thought, ‘they don't see beyond’.” Evie’s salesman brother, Jay Scavusso, found the Gunnarssons their home The Gunnarssons moved three years later into the only house on an undeveloped hill. “People used to say… ‘you live way up there?’,” says Brooklyn-born Betty. “You could look out for almost a mile. The boys had bikes and they would go out into the desert and [crumble crackers] to make trails so they didn’t get lost. “The experience opened up their eyes. It was a good life.” Before April 1968 few people knew where Lake Havasu City was, but news of the sale made international headlines and gave the tiny desert community a high profile. However, the purchase of London Bridge was also the source of much scorn. Many people assumed McCulloch had lost his mind - although others recognised there might be some cunning behind the bizarre scheme. “There were lots of articles that described RP as crazy,” says Michael. “Then that changed - to crazy like a fox. “People couldn’t conceptualise it… take this bridge in London and put it in the middle of the desert?” A rumour that McCulloch - a millionaire and successful businessman - had “bought the wrong bridge” probably didn’t help, although it was, of course, complete nonsense. McCulloch and Wood went to London to inspect their purchase “I know for a fact they knew exactly which bridge they were going to buy,” says Michael. “Do you think anyone in their right mind would look at Tower Bridge and think they could take it apart and bring it here? “But RP and CV felt that by allowing that rumour to perpetuate, it gave them continued publicity, so they let it go.” Before April 1968 few people knew where Lake Havasu City was - but news of the sale made international headlines and gave the tiny desert community a high profile.

She remembers how the McCulloch salesmen would point her out as a local curiosity to those fresh off the flights, and say “there’s the girl that comes by boat”. She watched as the bricks piled up on the side of the road slowly transformed into a bridge. “I thought it was pretty bizarre at the time,” she says. After all, there was no river in the city for the exported bridge to cross. “Most people build bridges to cross a river, McCulloch built a river under a bridge.” English expat Linda Binder felt similarly when she heard the bridge she had often walked across as a child was moving. “I saw in the papers McCulloch was buying London Bridge and I thought, ‘what are those crazy Yanks doing building a bridge on sand?’ “But I think he did an extraordinary job of bringing it over and having the foresight to bring it brick by brick and rebuild it with the city around it. “I mean, who does that?” Years later, the Londoner moved to Lake Havasu where she became an Arizona state senator and, for many years, the point of contact for British dignitaries visiting the new city. Her husband, Bill, recalls how his friend CV Wood had to get permission from the President of the United States to create a channel under London Bridge. US president Lyndon B. Johnson had to be persuaded by Wood to sign off on the channel “Woody told me the [plan] was to build the bridge on dry land and dredge it out, but they applied for a permit and got denied,” says Bill. Wood was told such permission could be only be granted by the highest authority in the land, so he used his connections to secure a 10-minute audience with Lyndon Johnson, only to be told by the president: “Sorry, you can’t set this precedent. You can’t move a river.” “Woody said the pressure was really on,” says Bill. “He was a Texas boy and so was Johnson, so he started talking with this Texan accent. “He said ‘by golly, the next time someone buys London Bridge and moves it to the US, well, you’ll have to move another damn river’. “Johnson looked at Woody and said, ‘sign it’ [to an aide about the necessary paperwork] and left the room.” Wood, right, was an instrumental part in McCulloch’s plan It wasn’t the only time Wood - who was married to Hollywood actress Joanne Dru - put his famed persuasiveness into action. He is also said to have taken less than two hours to convince 16 environmental agencies opposed to the bridge to get on board. “The reality is RP was an engineer, an entrepreneur,” says Michael. “But CV, he was a showman; he could sell ice to Eskimos. “That’s why they were so good together. They made a good pair.” The first stone arrived in Lake Havasu on 9 July 1968, its swift delivery in part because work had begun to take it down long before McCulloch had signed a cheque for $2.46m. Alan Saines numbered the pieces as they came off the bridge in London. “There was only me numbering them and there were hundreds. If we did 20 a week, we were lucky. “It wasn’t a case of smashing it; the [stones] had to be taken down carefully and stored carefully and all the time they were building the new bridge.” Alan Saines was 17 when he got his first job, taking down the bridge Alan Simpson worked on the design of the new bridge for engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. He said the old bridge came down in slices to make room for the new one. “The only way of doing it was to take down one side of the old bridge so there was just room for the new bridge, then move over to the other side, switch the traffic, then take down the rest of the bridge in the middle and tie [it] back together. “It was complicated. And it wasn’t until fairly late in the day that taking it all down carefully to ship halfway around the world became an additional requirement.” Dockers put the stones on to freighters bound for the US The stones were sent to Surrey Docks, where fellow Mott engineer Bernard Waterworth would consult a long-range telescopic photo of the bridge and direct some pieces on to freighters bound for Long Beach, California, via the Panama Canal. Others first went to Merrivale Quarry in Devon, where the faces were sliced off to cut down on shipping costs, before continuing their 5,000-plus mile journey. “It was an historic monument and you were aware it was unusual,” explains Bernard. “You don’t forget it - projects like that are few and far between.” About 10,600 stones arrived in Lake Havasu, making the final leg of the journey by road on flatbed trucks. Curious tourists would line the roads to watch them trundle into the storage compound, where the stones were unloaded and put in order, ready to be used by construction crews. The interior of the bridge was sold for $2.5m and made into counter-tops and headstones “We would see the trucks coming down the highway and we would sit and watch them go by,” says Norma Grzesiowski, who had just moved to nearby Desert Hills. ""We were thinking, ‘what are they doing? What are they building?’” The cornerstone was lowered by Sir Gilbert Inglefield as McCulloch and Wood looked on “We decided to steal some of the stones and the four of us were in my ’53 Chevy station wagon waiting with bolt-cutters to get in the yard,” remembers Rick Kingsbury. “But those things weighed three times as much as my car did! The ground was shaking as they went by on those eight-axle trucks. “We thought... ‘well that’s a bad idea’.” About 10,600 stones arrived in Lake Havasu on flatbed trucks.

The ground was shaking as they went by on those eight-axle trucks. “We thought... ‘well that’s a bad idea’.” The cornerstone was laid on 23 September 1968 in a ceremony attended by London’s lord mayor. Then work to resurrect the bridge began, starting with the arches, which were laid across the sand. The rebuild began by calculating the angle of the arches “You just saw the skeleton going up, and then they put the face on,” says Norma, who used to sit in a boat on the lake and watch. “The builders explained it was like putting together a puzzle. It was exciting, but it was surreal.” Construction workers had to build the bridge in the sweltering Arizona heat The rest was built around the framework in reinforced concrete. To avoid the sinking fate of its 133,000-tonne predecessor, it was made hollow and finished with a veneer of stone, making it 33,000 tonnes. “It almost felt like I was in a movie,” says former labourer Roy Martin, who helped winch the stones. “People were always coming up to us and asking questions, wanting to take pictures and wanting to know if we had any extra pieces they could take home as souvenirs.” The stones were manoeuvred in by hand and secured with pins, wire and concrete. The work was slow and laborious - crews had to force the 400-500lb pieces in one at a time. On a good day they’d get through 10; the worst was one. If a stone was too damaged to use, it had to be replaced, says Harvey Robertson, who laid steps on the south side of the bridge. But the local rock didn’t match that which had been blackened by a century of London pollution. “It was a lighter colour, so they had these kerosene burners making soot,” he recalls. “Then they painted it on there to make it look dark and weathered, so people wouldn’t know they weren’t the original stones.” The dredge swung across the channel, eating out a path for the water Once the bridge was up, the dunes were sucked out of the arches to make way for the president-approved channel. The land underneath the structure was dredged, allowing London Bridge to tower above a waterway for the first time since it had left Britain. “I remember thinking at the time McCulloch had more money than sense,” says Harvey. “But once I started working on it, I thought he was pretty much a genius.” On 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu’s London Bridge opened to great fanfare. The British were out in force, represented by a delegation from London accompanied by a troupe of red-jacketed horse-riders trotting through the desert. McCulloch, London's lord mayor Sir Peter Studd and Wood attended the dedication The  English Village offered a taste of home with its red phone box, double-decker bus and pub serving Yorkshire pudding and roast beef. But the jewel was the bridge, with the British and US flags flying down both sides. Riders on horseback made a strange sight against the desert backdrop “The whole place was just buzzing,” says Norma Grzesiowski. “They had a big tent down there on the bridge and lots of events and games going on. “I remember them releasing the birds and they had a big hot-air balloon with the British flag on. It was breathtaking - such an exciting thing to be part of.” There was a party atmosphere as the anticipation built According to a report in the Lake Havasu City Herald at the time, some 50,000 people lined the roads to watch the celebrations. The gala featured a float-filled parade and the dramatic release of 30,000 balloons and 3,000 birds, to a backdrop of “home at last” which had been scrawled across the sky. The dedication day festivities were an explosion of colour Bobbi Holmes performed in the opening ceremony - an experience, she jokes, that scarred her for life. “I was a member of the pom-pom girls and we did a dance. We were carrying these pom-poms and doing this routine and my arms felt so heavy. I thought, ‘I never want to be in a parade again’. “But it was really fun and people came from all over. The English Village reminded me of Disneyland, which I later realised was because CV was behind it. “It was pretty, sparkly, clean, with beautiful flowers. It was kind of magical.” On 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu’s London Bridge opened to great fanfare.

It was kind of magical.” “Everyone came out,” says Joni Echelberger, whose family had not long moved from Illinois. “My aunt and uncle got to have the $100 dinner in the big tent and I was so jealous because I wanted to be in there. “We were outside waiting and waiting and waiting for the fireworks and they wouldn’t go off until the celebration was done [so] they didn’t go off until midnight. “For such  a  small  community,  it  was  really a  big  deal.” A long red carpet led to the huge striped tent Joe Hunnicutt remembers a “crazy” day that was bursting with community pride. But he tells a different story about those birds, claiming McCulloch hadn’t been able to find doves as planned. Instead, he mainly settled for pigeons. “I remember standing there with my dad and he was wearing his blazer and tie, smoking a cigar, and he says, ‘You know, I think McCulloch is going to regret this particular decision.' “And since 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu City has been infested with pigeons. “They’re the joke and scourge of the town; you can’t get rid of them.” Six years later, McCulloch died from an accidental overdose of alcohol and pills. His death was keenly felt in the community he had built, where his legacy is remembered with a bronze statue and a road bearing his name. Early West, who worked for him for 40 years, describes him as a man who “thought number one about his employees” and remained down to earth. A statue of McCulloch and Wood stands at one end of the bridge “Bob was  a  rich  man,  but  he  was  pretty  common,” the 86-year-old says. “Ordinary people live on a certain level, and he didn’t get too much above that. “I never  noted  him  putting  himself  above  anyone  else.” Early West was convinced by McCulloch to move from the entrepreneur’s LA factory to Lake Havasu Fifty years on and people are still poking fun at McCulloch’s dream. At this year’s Academy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel made a jibe about Lake Havasu while encouraging Oscar winners to keep their acceptance speeches short. His gag actually caused a surge in interest in the resort - not that it really needed the help. According to the state tourist board, 3.65m people visited London Bridge in 2017 - making it Arizona’s third most popular attraction after the Grand Canyon and the Glen Canyon national parks. Thousands of tourists have pierced a map in the visitors’ centre with pins marking their home state McCulloch’s grandson Michael says people come because they’re ""curious"". It’s a word that sums up Lake Havasu perfectly. Driving in from Highway 95, the billboards scream “Visit the home of the London Bridge”. Before long, a flash of blue appears - not a desert mirage, but the waters of the Colorado River filling the city’s man-made lake up ahead. Then before you know it, the bridge appears, dominating a landscape peppered with fast food outlets, hotels and palm trees. It’s a surreal moment, even though you’ve been warned what to expect. For the 52,000 residents that call Lake Havasu City home, the bridge is just a part of everyday life, providing the only access to and from the marina and the homes perched on the first spit of land purchased by McCulloch back in 1958. And although the whole project cost about $12m, McCulloch is said to have recouped his costs before the last brick had even been laid in its new home. The English Village was recently refurbished after standing derelict for years Today, the resort thrives not just on tourism from the bridge, but from income from water sports enthusiasts and college kids on spring break. The calm lake and sunny weather have made the city a legitimate holiday destination - an outcome even its founder would probably not have predicted. That a sinking bridge in London would be the making of a city in Arizona is a testament to McCulloch. But that it became such a success is down to boldness, determination and belief - a reflection, perhaps, of the American spirit. Michael McCulloch says Lake Havasu was his grandfather's ""pride and joy"" “The bridge changed things immensely, I don’t know what the city would be like if it wasn’t here,” reflects Michael. “It was [supposed to be] a retirement resort but it’s turned into a sustainable economy and a lot of people are born here and have chosen not to leave. “I think RP would be amazed by that.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"Thuriya set sail from France at the start of July on the round-the-world race Rescuers from several nations are trying to reach a seriously injured Indian sailor who is taking part in the Golden Globe round-the-world race. Solo yachtsman Abhilash Tomy is stranded 3,200km (2,000 miles) off the coast of Western Australia. His yacht Thuriya had its mast broken during a severe storm in the Indian Ocean. He managed to send a message saying he has a severe back injury and is immobilised, unable to eat or drink. Race organisers said Tomy was ""incapacitated on his bunk inside his boat.... as far from help as you can possibly be"". A French fisheries patrol vessel is sailing towards him and could arrive by Monday. Two military planes, one from Australia and one from India, flew over the yacht on Sunday to inspect its condition, but crew were unable to establish contact with Tomy. ""He is injured inside the yacht so he can't communicate further,"" an Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman told AFP news agency. The 39-year-old Indian Navy commander, who became the first Indian to sail around the world in 2013, is communicating using a texting unit, after his satellite phone was broken. His boat, the Thuriya, is a replica of Robin Knox-Johnston's Suhaili, winner of the first Golden Globe Race in 1968. Abhilash Tomy has already sailed round the world once in 2013 On Saturday, he sent a message, saying: ""Extremely difficult to walk, Might need stretcher, can't walk, thanks safe inside the boat ... Sat phone down."" Tomy has a spare satellite phone in an emergency bag, but he is unable to reach it at present. An Irish race competitor, Gregor McGuckin, whose own yacht was damaged in the storm, has made repairs and is attempting to cover the 150km (90 miles) separating him from Tomy's position. Meanwhile,race organisers say a search and rescue plane is being sent to Reunion Island,externalto help the rescue. An Australian frigate with a helicopter on board is also en route, but could take at least four days to reach the area, organisers say. The Indian navy says it has also despatched two ships to join the rescue efforts, the PTI news agency reported. The approximate location of the Thuriya at 02:28 GMT on Saturday Friday's storm whipped up 70-knot winds and 14-metre (45ft) waves, which also knocked down the yacht of another competitor, Dutchman Mark Slats, twice. Most of the 11 competitors still in the race were further north and avoided the worst of the storm, organisers said. The Golden Globe race involves a single-handed circumnavigation of the globe - a distance of 30,000 miles -  without using modern technology, except for satellite communications,   Competitors started from France on 1 July; seven boats have so far withdrawn from the race.

"This video can not be played Dawn Butler: Employers have a ""duty of care"" to employees experiencing domestic abuse Employers would have to provide up to ten days paid leave for victims of domestic violence, under plans announced by Labour on Saturday. Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler unveiled the policy at the party's Women's Conference in Liverpool. The proposals aim to give victims time to leave abusive partners safely and seek support. Ms Butler said the policy would save lives and tackle the ""hidden killer"" of domestic abuse. Speaking ahead of the launch of Labour's annual conference on Sunday, Ms Butler told the conference employers had a ""duty of care"" to employees experiencing domestic abuse. ""This crucial time will allow women and men to leave their abusive partners safely - get the help, protection and support they need knowing their livelihood is secure. ""On average two women a week are murdered by their current or former abusive partner. These 10 days could literally help save the lives of those women."" Similar laws have already been introduced in the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, she added. 'Disaster averted' for women's refuges Domestic violence: 'I was told to sleep in the outhouse' Ms Butler also announced plans to set up a new department for Women and Equalities, as part of Labour's pledge to ""put equality centre stage"". ""So far we have seen seven different ministers for equality tagged on to four different departments and a budget that's nearly been halved,"" she told the conference. ""This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously. By establishing a Department for Women and Equalities, Labour will ensure equalities is the common thread running through its government"" The annual Labour conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - will start on Sunday, and close on Wednesday with a major speech by Mr Corbyn. The stage is set for fierce debates about Brexit and the future of the party at the Liverpool gathering. Lively debates -yes even divisions - are expected at this year's gathering. Labour's NEC meets tonight to hammer out new leadership rules that are likely to see the influence of MPs watered down in favour of more say for members and the unions. And tomorrow behind the scenes there will be wrangles over how to boil down 125 Brexit motions to just two or three - with some members wanting to push the leadership further than it wants to go in calling for a new referendum on the EU. But it's often the unanticipated divisions that can cause the bigger problem. Dawn Butler not only praised the 1980s Militant-led Liverpool council in her speech to the women's conference today - but she also suggested it was better to break the law than break the poor. Some in the party are furious that she has gifted the Conservatives a weapon of attack. Party policy is for councillors to set legal budgets - but Labour's opponents can now question its sincerity.

"A no-deal Brexit is ""no problem"", Nigel Farage has said at a rally of the Leave Means Leave campaign group. The former UKIP leader told an audience in Bolton the current government negotiations on Brexit could plausibly end in an agreement. But ""far from being a cliff edge"", the UK would prosper without one, he said. Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis told the rally the PM's plans were a ""weak compromise"" and the government had to deliver Brexit ""without dilution"". Hunt: Don't mistake politeness for weakness Brexit: What happens next? All you need to know about Brexit Mr Farage said the majority of the ""political class"" did not respect the Brexit vote and the ""endless negative narrative"" needed to be countered ""again"". ""They do not want to give us Brexit,"" he told the rally at the University of Bolton Stadium, the first in a number of Leave Means Leave events across the country. The MEP said of the EU: ""They are a bunch of gangsters. We will explain a free trade deal is possible, if that's what the gangsters in Brussels want. ""If they don't, that is fine, if they don't we will leave with no deal. No deal, no problem."" Theresa May's plan for Brexit - known as theChequers agreement,external- was rejected by EU leaders as unworkable at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday. Mrs May later said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"" and made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"". Kate Hoey (left) and David Davis (right) also addressed the rally Mr Farage criticised the Chequers proposals, saying they were ""dead"" and do not work for the EU or the UK. Mr Davis had been leading the UK negotiations to leave the EU butquit the cabinet in July,saying he did not ""believe"" in the Chequers plan. At-a-glance: The Chequers plan He told Saturday's rally: ""We have nothing to fear and that is the reason why we should only accept a clean and clear Brexit, not some fudge."" Mr Davis also said he viewed the EU's treatment of Mrs May ""with contempt"", adding: ""Bad manners and discourtesy are not the hallmarks of great men."" He continued: ""And if you think you can bully our country, all I can suggest is that you read some history books."" Labour MP Kate Hoey also spoke at the rally, saying: ""We don't need another vote - we just want to leave."" ""Our vote matters and we won't allow it to be stolen from us,"" she said. She also said Brussels had never negotiated Brexit in ""good faith"". ""They underestimate how strong we are when we are up against it,"" she added. It was a full house at the University of Bolton Stadium. An audience of more than 2,000 people squeezed into what was decked out like a ballroom. A stall selling Leave Means Leave baseball hats did excellent trade. In Bolton, 58% voted to leave the EU in June 2016 and, as they queued to get in, many told how passionate they were to secure the kind of Brexit they voted for. They said they felt the result of the referendum was not being taken seriously enough. The audience had come from around the country, some waved union flags; others wore them. The loudest of the applause was reserved for Nigel Farage who started by saying: ""I didn't think I'd have to do this again."" That got laughs. Earlier he took an open top bus into Bolton to speak to shoppers and market traders, the media in tow. It all felt a bit like going back to the referendum campaign.

"The bags will cost 5p and double as a compostable bag for food waste Compostable bags are to replace single-use plastic bags in more than half of Co-op stores, the supermarket has said. It says around 60 million plastic carriers will be replaced with the new bags, which will cost 5p and double as a compostable bag for food waste. Material is certified as compostable if it means it will break down within 12 weeks under specified conditions. The retailer said the move was a first step towards its plan to ""phase out any packaging which cannot be reused"". The compostable bags have been trialled in 22 stores in Greater Manchester since September and will now be introduced in more than 1,400 of Co-op's 2,500 stores. The plastic you can and cannot recycle Five ways to break up with plastic Why 12 is the magic number when it comes to composting The bags will initially be in Co-op stores in towns, cities and villages where the bags can be used in food waste collections. Co-op said it will be speaking with the local councils in the areas where bags cannot currently be used with a view to introducing the bags to more stores. Shops will continue to sell reusable bags for 10p as well as larger Â£1 bags, it added. Co-op said it wants to ""phase out any packaging which cannot be reused"" Its retail chief executive, Jo Whitfield, said: ""The first step to remove single-use plastic will be to launch compostable carrier bags in our stores. ""They are a simple but ingenious way to provide an environmentally friendly alternative to plastic shopping bags."" Co-op also pledged to make all its own-brand packaging become easy to recycle by 2023 and to use a minimum of 50% recycled plastic in bottles, pots, trays and punnets by 2021. Claire Shrewsbury from the sustainability campaign group Wrap said all major retailers had committedto making 100% of plastic packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.

"Fraudsters scammed nearly 49,000 older people across the UK in the past year, equivalent to almost six reports every hour, a BBC investigation has found. The total number of reports has nearly doubled in the past three years, 5 live Investigates has learned. But one expert said the true number of elderly victims was likely to be in the millions. Police said more victims were coming forward but admitted they were the ""tip of the iceberg"". Among those to have been repeatedly scammed is a farmer in his 80s from Norfolk, who has lost Â£450,000 over six years after fraudsters convinced him he had won Â£1.5m in a lottery. His daughter-in-law, who asked not to be named, said: ""They said all he had to do was send them an administration fee, it started small about Â£300 and then he should receive the money. ""But they didn't stop at that, obviously he didn't get his money and they kept ringing. ""It's gone out of all proportion since that initial contact."" Hidden 'shame' of elderly scam victims 'Vishing' scams net Â£1.2m in north-east of Scotland in three weeks Trading Standards teams 'struggling to visit' scam victims Police and trading standards officers in Norfolk have been involved in his case but his family believes he is now ""addicted"" to his pursuit of a big-money payout and is still trying to send money. ""I think the scammers are absolutely evil,"" she said. ""But they are also very clever in how they do it and they make it sound very plausible, so much so that it sucked him in and probably hundreds of other people."" The 5 live Investigates team asked Action Fraud, the UK police's cyber-crime reporting centre, for a breakdown of the five most common types of frauds affecting older people reported to them over the past three years. It revealed: in 2016-17 there were 40,487 frauds affecting people aged over 60 reported and 48,981 last year - equivalent to nearly six crimes every hour this was up from 25,659 reports in 2015-16 last year 1,140 victims were aged over 90 and 13 were over 100 But Prof Keith Brown, of Bournemouth University, an expert who studies scams, claimed these reports represented as few as 5% of the true total. ""It's hugely under-reported - we're talking about millions of victims,"" he said. ""If this were burglary or street crime there would be a huge outcry, but it's hidden behind closed doors. ""Over the next few years this will become the next big scandal like the dawning realisation of the scale of child abuse."" If you suspect you've been a victim of a scam you can visitthe Action Fraud website.,external Action Fraud can also be contacted by calling 0300 123 2040. During 2017-18 so-called advanced fee frauds, which include victims being told they have won a lottery but must pay a fee to receive the prize, were the most common scams, with almost 20,000 cases - including 370 victims aged over 90. Computer software service fraud, in which victims are told their computer has been compromised by a virus, was the second most common crime with more than 12,300 cases last year. Prof Brown warned fraud costs UK consumers an estimated Â£10bn a year in losses,up from an estimated Â£4-6bn annually in 2016.,external He added: ""We're getting better at blocking mail scams coming through the post and the call blocking technology is improving, so increasingly fraudsters will turn to targeting their victims online."" Lara Xenoudakis, temporary detective chief inspector with the City of London Police, said more victims may be aware they can turn to Action Fraud for help but admitted the cases they saw did not represent the scale of the problem. ""Fraud is still very under-reported, the figures are only the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""People are embarrassed to report, they feel ashamed to have become a victim... there's nothing to be embarrassed about. Fraudsters are so experienced now and so believable, it is very easy to become a victim and it could happen to anybody."" 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, 23 September at 11:00BST - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

Iran has summoned diplomats from the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark, accusing their countries of harbouring Iranian opposition groups, state news agency Irna reports. ""It is not acceptable that these groups are not listed as terrorist organizations by the European Union as long as they have not carried out a terrorist attack in Europe,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi. Reports say nearly half of those killed were members of the Revolutionary Guard, who are under Mr Khamenei's command. Mr Khamenei did not name the ""regional states"" that he believed were behind the attack. The attack targeted Revolutionary Guard troops However Iran has previously accused its regional rival, Saudi Arabia, of supporting separatist activity amongst Iran's Arab minority. Fars news agency said the attack started at 09:00 local time (06:30 BST), lasted about 10 minutes, and appeared to involve four gunmen. The attackers fired at civilians,externaland attempted to attack military officials on the podium, Fars reports. At least one child was injured in the attack Civilians including women and children, who were watching the military parade, were among those killed, Irna news agency said. The victims included a four-year-old girl and a military veteran in a wheelchair, a military spokesman said. Local journalist Behrad Ghasemi told AFP that firing continued for between 10 and 15 minutes and said at least one of the attackers was wearing a Revolutionary Guards uniform. ""First we thought it's part of the parade, but after about 10 seconds we realised it was a terrorist attack as bodyguards [of officials] started shooting,"" he said. ""Everything went haywire and soldiers started running. I saw a four-year old child get shot, and also a lady,"" he added. All four attackers were killed, state media said. Iran is marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980-88 war with Iraq with several military parades across the nation. By Siavash Mehdi-Ardalan, BBC Persian There have been two conflicting claims of responsibility: one from a low profile Arab militant group in Iran's Khuzestan region and one from IS. It makes some difference. The former would suggest a resurgence of separatist militancy after a seven-year lull. If it was IS, it would represent a failure by Iran's intelligence community to prevent a second major IS attack in its soil. Iran has not provided any evidence of foreign collusion but has vowed revenge. The Saudi reaction and more importantly the wording of the US administration's response may prove important as leaders of all three countries are set for a possible diplomatic clash at the UN General Assembly next week. There have been conflicting claims. A spokesman for the Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Khuzestan, said the group was behind the attack. The spokesman did not say whether the group had links to other countries. The 'beauty' and the horror of the Iran-Iraq war Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' IS's Amaq agency has also claimed it carried out the attack. However the group provided no evidence that it had been involved. IS has carried out a major attack in Iran before. In June last year,suicide bombers attacked parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, killing 18 people. Iranian government and military officials have pointed the finger at Gulf states, the US and Israel, with all of whom Iran has longstanding tensions. A Revolutionary Guards spokesman claimed the attackers were ""trained and organised by two Gulf countries"" and had ties to the US and Israel. The US and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of supporting Houthi rebels in the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting on the side of the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

""Everything went haywire and soldiers started running. I saw a four-year old child get shot, and also a lady,"" he added. All four attackers were killed, state media said. Iran is marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980-88 war with Iraq with several military parades across the nation. By Siavash Mehdi-Ardalan, BBC Persian There have been two conflicting claims of responsibility: one from a low profile Arab militant group in Iran's Khuzestan region and one from IS. It makes some difference. The former would suggest a resurgence of separatist militancy after a seven-year lull. If it was IS, it would represent a failure by Iran's intelligence community to prevent a second major IS attack in its soil. Iran has not provided any evidence of foreign collusion but has vowed revenge. The Saudi reaction and more importantly the wording of the US administration's response may prove important as leaders of all three countries are set for a possible diplomatic clash at the UN General Assembly next week. There have been conflicting claims. A spokesman for the Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Khuzestan, said the group was behind the attack. The spokesman did not say whether the group had links to other countries. The 'beauty' and the horror of the Iran-Iraq war Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' IS's Amaq agency has also claimed it carried out the attack. However the group provided no evidence that it had been involved. IS has carried out a major attack in Iran before. In June last year,suicide bombers attacked parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, killing 18 people. Iranian government and military officials have pointed the finger at Gulf states, the US and Israel, with all of whom Iran has longstanding tensions. A Revolutionary Guards spokesman claimed the attackers were ""trained and organised by two Gulf countries"" and had ties to the US and Israel. The US and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of supporting Houthi rebels in the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting on the side of the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will not overturn result of the referendum"" Theresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously. She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process? Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. She reiterated again her belief thather Chequers blueprint,externalwas the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browser The PM has also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Boris Johnson quit over the Chequers plan and has since criticised it relentlessly Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered but many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way. The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament. There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind an enhanced version of Canada's 2016 deal with the EU. The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it. Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached. Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges. Will the French president give Brexit the thumbs-up? Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible. Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority. Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning. But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped. A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal. However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November. An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline. So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019. Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority. The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union. The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election. Some Leave campaigners are bracing themselves for another referendum Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second EU referendum? Reality Check: Can the UK change its mind on Article 50? Court to rule on whether UK can halt Brexit It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next. Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. But how could this happen? Should Mrs May lose a vote on her deal, she could conceivably resign and her successor may use his or her new mandate to seek Commons approval for a vote on another referendum. Alternatively, MPs who back a so-called People's Vote - which include the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Plaid Cymru as well as a growing number of Labour MPs - could seek to table a backbench amendment to the legislation that has been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal. With most Tories, so far, publicly opposed to a referendum, any vote is likely to be extremely tight. Either way, Parliament would then need to pass enabling legislation, similar to the 2015 European Referendum Act, setting out the date of the poll, the question and the franchise, as well as other details. As it stands, if no deal has been agreed by 21 January 2019, ministers will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps. This could trigger the mother of parliamentary battles over Brexit. Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but unless Mrs May or her successor and the other 27 nations agree to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March, this cannot legally happen. Critics say there won't be enough time while there is also another stumbling block in that those who back a vote do not all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper. While the People's Vote campaign wants the option to remain, the Labour leadership has said it should be on the terms of the deal - in other words between leaving with Mrs May's deal or no deal. What Labour really wants is a general election so it can take over the negotiations. It is only after 29 March that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest.

"Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said Labour should be ready to back demands for a new Brexit vote Two significant shifts have happened on the eve of Labour conferenceâ¦ and they both involve the party's deputy leader. So far the party's deputy Tom Watson has stuck to the official line that a new referendum shouldn't be ""off the table"" - but that a general election is preferable. While not technically departing from that formulation, he is sounding far warmer to the idea of a new referendum now that a YouGov poll of Labour party members - commissioned by the People's Vote campaign - has suggested that 86% would back one. Hetold the Observer newspaper,externalthat while he would prefer Brexit to be debated in an election soon, the members' views must be respected. ""Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour party back to its members,"" he said. ""So if the people's party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it. That is what happens when you return the party to the members."" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson with leader Jeremy Corbyn at a post-Budget rally last year Mr Watson also suggested that if there were an early election then there would be pressure to make a referendum a manifesto commitment. His views are important because - like Jeremy Corbyn - he has a mandate from the membership. But the significance of another development should not be understated. At Saturday night's meeting, Labour's ruling National Executive Committee has decided to recommend the creation of an additional deputy leadership post. Labour 'must back members' on Brexit vote Brexit: What happens next? Labour backs paid leave for abuse victims Mr Watson supported the idea of being joined in the leadership team by a female deputy, as did many of the trade union members of the NEC. Jeremy Corbyn, as I understand it, wasn't in the meeting when the decision was taken but was at a party rally. But the timing of the election of the new deputy could be highly significant. If the full conference backs the creation of the new post, the NEC will draw up the timetable for the election. And if it is sooner rather than later, that raises the prospect of a candidate standing on a platform of a new EU referendum. If they get that mandate, the pressure on the existing leadership to change position could reach boiling point.

"Jeremy Corbyn is increasingly willing to challenge the government on Brexit, according to a BBC analysis of Prime Minister's Questions since the EU referendum. Since the turn of the year, two fifths of the Labour leader's questions have been about the United Kingdom's imminent departure from the European Union and Mr Corbyn now seems more determined to challenge the government consistently on this issue. Corbyn v May and the battle to go viral In the last 10 PMQs, Corbyn has chosen to address Brexit with 42 out of a possible 60 questions - exactly 70% of the time. Of the 14 that weren't about Brexit, six were about buses and another eight were about the NHS, although two of these followed on from a line of questioning about Theresa May's promise to pour a supposed ""Brexit dividend"" back into healthcare. Of course, there are different ways of classifying his questions - a question can be about more than one subject - but by my reckoning this has made Brexit the most common theme of Mr Corbyn's questions since he became leader. Despite this, Mr Corbyn has been criticised in the past for skirting the issue, when he has the opportunity to put the government on the spot. In total, since the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, he has asked 105 questions about Brexit. That equates to just over 27% of all the questions he has asked in that time. But they haven't come in one steady stream. Between 25 January and 22 November 2017, Mr Corbyn only referred to Brexit in one question, and that - on 25 October - was to list the lack of no-deal planning alongside a number of other examples of alleged government incompetence. The prime minister had no trouble evading the issue in her response. Mr Corbyn did respond to statements made to the House by the prime minister after key EU summits and after PMQs on 29 March 2017, the day Article 50 was triggered. But PMQs is an opportunity for the leader of the opposition to take the initiative and to drive the debate. Over those 10 months, he chose instead to speak about public sector pay cuts, the sweetheart deal for Surrey Council, Theresa May holding Donald Trump's hand, changes to National Insurance for the self-employed, zero hours contracts, universal credit, tax avoidance, school places, Grenfell Tower and the NHS. It was left to Emily Thornberry to probe the government on Brexit when she deputised for Mr Corbyn on 12 July 2017. The shadow foreign secretary grilled then deputy prime minister Damian Green with six straight questions about the government's no-deal planning. The picture has gradually changed since. As Labour has shifted towards a softer position on Brexit, Mr Corbyn has begun to ramp up the pressure in PMQs. There was a clutch of 12 questions at the end of 2017 and another dozen at the end of February, before he turned the heat up from May. Critics might complain about Mr Corbyn's execution, but they can no longer say that he is not talking about Brexit. All of which goes to prove the old adage: you wait for one Brexit question and then 42 come along all at once.

"Congressman Paul Gosar's brothers and sisters have backed his Democrat rival in a united stand against him Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar, a Republican from the party's most conservative wing, is standing for re-election in November. Fearing for the future, his siblings have thrown their weight behind their choice of candidate in a powerful new TV advert. The striking part? It's not their brother. Nope - six of Mr Gosar's siblings have spoken out to endorse his rival, Democrat David Brill. If that sounds brutal on paper, the execution is even more savage. To maximise its impact, the ad doesn't name the six speakers until the end - they're just presented as normal Arizona folks. It opens with ""Grace, rural physician"", declaring, ""Paul Gosar the congressman isn't doing anything to support rural America."" ""Paul's absolutely not working for his district,"" says ""David, lawyer"". ""If he actually cared about people in rural Arizona, I bet he'd be fighting for social security, for better access to healthcare,"" agrees ""Jennifer, medical interpreter"". ""He is not listening to you, and he does not have your best interests at heart,"" ""Tim"" agrees - before dropping the bombshell line: ""My name is Tim Gosar"". Allow Twitter content?

The Republican, who won his district with 71% of the vote in 2016, is still considered likely to keep the seat he has held since 2011. If there is a bright side for Mr Gosar, it's that he is one of 10 siblings. While seven have denounced him in public, two are keeping their silence so far - which might make Christmas fractionally less awkward. His mother has also vocally supported his leadership and politics,,externalleading him to quip: ""I guess I really am Mom's favourite"" Paul Gosar is far from the first US politician to be targeted by a critical advert, of course. So-called ""attack ads"", in which a candidate lambasts their opponent instead of stressing their own virtues, have been a recognised tactic since the 1960s. When Democrat Lyndon Johnson was running against Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election, one famous TV ad featureda young girl counting down as she pulled petals off a daisy,external, then cut to a nuclear explosion. Johnson's voice boomed over the footage: ""These are the stakes. To make a world in which all of God's children can live, or to go into the dark. We must either love each other, or we must die."" Mr Goldwater was never mentioned, but the message was clear - his more aggressive attitude to the Cold War would imperil the public and could lead to nuclear doom. Johnson was the only safe choice. The ad was considered controversial, but highly effective. Johnson won by a landslide. The Lyndon Johnson 'Daisy' ad was considered a milestone in advertising history Decades later, Hillary Clinton deployeda slightly subtler but clearly negative ad,externalagainst Barack Obama, her rival in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. It opened with shots of children fast asleep, and a voiceover saying, ""It's 3am and your children are safe and asleep. But there's a phone in the White House, and it's ringing. Something's happening in the world..."" The message urged voters to choose someone who ""already knows the world's leaders, knows the military"" and is ""tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world"" to pick up the phone. The implication: Obama lacks the experience to lead. The future president wasn't above making digs of his own, however. In June 2016, then presidential candidate Donald Trump dug up an old Obama radio advert criticising Mrs Clinton for making ""false attacks"" and shared it online. He tweeted: ""I rarely agree with President Obama - however he is 100% correct about Crooked Hillary Clinton. Great ad!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Duncan Hutchison and his hand-built boat A Scot attempting to row solo across the Atlantic in a hand-built wooden boat has been rescued off the coast of Land's End. Duncan Hutchison, from Lochinver in the Highlands, began his journey more than three months ago in New York. However, just before 01:00 he reported to the coastguard that he was in difficulties and said he was battling 8ft (2.5m) waves. He was picked up by a merchant tanker - which is heading back to New York. Mr Hutchison was rescued 863 miles from the coast. His 23ft (7m) boat, Sleipnir, is being towed by the tanker. He has raised more than Â£18,000 for the WaterAid charity. Duncan Hutchison started the crossing in May A post on Mr Hutchison's Facebook page said he had just reached his 100 days at sea. ""As always, thank you to everyone for your support - Day 101 will be an emotional one for Duncan - and us all,"" it said. ""The boat that rescued Duncan is bound for ............ New York!"" Solo rower reaches halfway point in handmade boat Rowers sets out from New York in handmade boat Another post said that despite coping well with the conditions, a crash of the rower's on-board electrics left him with a decreasing power supply. ""The failure of his secondary battery, was followed by his primary supply cutting out, leaving him dependent on the items he charged beforehand,"" it said. ""It's likely his GPS tracker and all navigation equipment is down. ""He will be devastated, especially with a technical problem rather than a physical or structural issue of the boat. ""Although he's totally dedicated to completing the challenge, today marked 100 days at sea. "" The post added: ""Calling this in was probably the toughest thing Duncan's ever had to do, but is testament to his selfless and professional approach throughout the journey."" Duncan's daughter Francy told BBC Scotland her father did the right thing. ""In terms of distance, if it was in a straight line he would have covered the distance between New York and Lochinver, so he will be very disappointed because he likes to see things to a finish,"" she said. ""I think in the back of his mind he'll know he has made a very responsible decision because he wouldn't want to cause any of the emergency services any trouble and had he left it any longer it could have become quite a situation."" HM Coastguard duty commander Mark Rodaway, said: 'He's been picked up safe and well. We'll continue to keep in touch with him via the tanker crew while they progress their passage back towards New York. ""This is a good example of how well the National Maritime Operations Centre and the Coastguard national network co-ordinates long-range rescue missions. We're grateful to the tanker for responding and rescuing this rower"". Early last month, Mr Hutchison reached the halfway point in his 3,000-mile (4,828 km) adventure. He was aiming to finish his journey in Lochinver on the west Highland coast. Mr Hutchison spent three years building his boat, which is named after an eight-legged horse from Norse mythology that could glide across the sea.

"Christine Blasey Ford says Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 15, and he was 17 The woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault has agreed to testify against him on Thursday. Lawyers for Professor Christine Blasey Ford said she had agreed to an open hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee to be questioned about the alleged attack at a party in 1982. The hearing will take place at 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on 27 September. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations. The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? The allegations, which emerged in the US media last week, have delayed his confirmation to the Supreme Court. Prof Ford had originally been granted a deadline of Friday to agree to testify. This was later extended to Saturday by Senator Chuck Grassley, the leading Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh became public last week, after it emerged Prof Ford had detailed the alleged assault in a confidential letter to the top Democratic senator on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, in July. As the judge neared confirmation, news about the letter leaked to US media. Ms Feinstein then confirmed she had passed it on to the FBI. After days of continued media speculation,Prof Ford went on record in a Washington Post article as the mystery accuser,external, detailing the alleged assault. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out She said Mr Kavanaugh had tried to drunkenly remove her clothing at a party, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth when she was 15 and he was 17. Since then, her lawyers have been in back-and-forth negotiations with the Judicial Committee, trying to agree on terms for her to testify. She had asked for a number of preconditions, including not testifying with Mr Kavanaugh in the room and the subpoenaing of his friend, Mark Judge, who she said had witnessed the alleged sexual assault. On Sunday, her legal team's statement said she would move forward with a hearing despite the Committee's ""refusal"" to subpoena Mr Judge. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have accused her and Democratic politicians of deliberately trying to delay and obstruct the judge's confirmation, and urged them to push forward the process. The feelings are strong on both sides - with both Prof Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and his wife receiving threats and rallies of support over the matter. This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: ""We believe her"" The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life. As Mr Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh must first be approved by the Senate before he can take his seat - but before that vote can happen, he has to be approved by the Judiciary Committee, where Prof Ford will now testify. Why is the US top court so important? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? The Senate is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats - so her testimony on the allegations could prove key.

"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would be ready to back another EU referendum, if party members want one. He said he would be ""bound"" by the outcome of a vote at the Labour Party conference - although he would prefer to have a general election. But Unite leader Len McCluskey said any referendum should not include the option of remaining in the EU. Meanwhile Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out a snap election this autumn, saying the idea was ""for the birds"". The Labour Party has never formally rejected the option of a further vote, but both Mr Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, have indicated they would prefer it to be resolved by a general election. Pressed on the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn, who has said he is not calling for another referendum, said ""our preference"" is for a general election that would then allow a Labour government to negotiate the UK's future relationship with Europe. He said: ""Let's see what comes out of conference. Obviously I'm bound by the democracy of our party."" Brexit is one of eight issues chosen for debate at the conference in a vote by delegates But he said it was ""conjecture"" to suggest any referendum backed at the conference would be on remaining or leaving the EU, adding: ""We don't know what it would be."" Brexit is among the eight issues to have been chosen in a ballot by Labour members and trade unions for debate in Liverpool. The others are Palestine, the economy, housing, schools, government contracts, in-work poverty and justice for the Windrush generation. Discussions are to take place on Sunday evening to decide the final text of each motion. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said much would depend on whether the Brexit motion clearly stated that Labour backed another referendum, or whether it would be more ambiguously worded so it did not tie the leadership's hands. Labour's Brexit poll policy 'could be a fudge' Brexit: What happens next? All you need to know about Brexit Brexit becomes Corbyn's PMQs focus Mr Corbyn also told the programme the UK ""could be"" close to a general election. Amid speculation that Labour could force a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May if Parliament rejects any Brexit deal, he said: ""We will be putting our case to Parliament and we will see what happens after that. We are absolutely ready for it."" He said Labour would be prepared to vote down any deal Mrs May came back with, if it did not meet a series of tests Labour has set out. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""Can you hear us Jeremy Corbyn?"" The party has made several policy announcements ahead of its annual conference - which begins in Liverpool on Sunday - including: Plans to require businesses employing more than 250 people to reserve one-third of seats on boards for representatives of their workforce to help rein in a ""reckless corporate culture"" A proposed new tax for the owners of second homes in England, based on the value of the property, with the money raised being used to tackle homelessness Plans to make employers provide up to10 days paid leave for victims of domestic violence However, campaigners are using use the conference to pile pressure on the Labour leadership to support a further referendum. Thousands of people marched through the centre of Liverpool, to a rally at the Pier Head, where the conference is taking place. Protesters waved EU and other flags and chanted anti-Brexit slogans and ""it's not a done deal"" as they walked from St George's Hall. The event was organised by the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger was among those who joined the march in support of Labour members who want the conference to debate supporting a second vote. Some sections of the crowd chanted directly at Mr Corbyn, saying: ""Hey Jeremy, take a note, for the many, People's Vote."" In a speech, Tottenham MP David Lammy asked: ""Are you listening Jeremy Corbyn?"" Highlighting that people from across the UK were present, he said: ""They are saying squarely to the leadership of the Labour Party: 'Listen to us, hear us, give us a People's Vote'. ""When we have that People's Vote, let us ensure that the option to remain in the EU is on the ballot paper."" But Unite leader Mr McCluskey told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics: ""The referendum shouldn't be on 'do we want to go back into the European Union?'"" This video can not be played Labour Conference: Can Jeremy Corbyn keep the party united? He added: ""The people have already decided on that. We very rarely have referendums in this country. The people have decided against my wishes and my union's wishes but they've decided... For us to now enter some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again I think would be wrong."" According to a YouGov survey of 1,054 Labour members, commissioned by the People's Vote campaign, 86% wanted a final, public say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations, against 8% who opposed it. But the Brexit supporting Labour MP Kate Hoey described calls for another vote as the ""last gasp"" of people who had never wanted to accept the result of the 2016 referendum. She said another referendum was likely to be bigger than the last and, if a bigger majority voted to leave, ""we're still in the same position"". On Saturday shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people calling for another referendum to take into account the ""real risk"" of stoking racial tensions and far-right populism. The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and Theresa May has been negotiating with other EU leaders on the UK's future relationship with the bloc. Talks hit a stumbling block at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday when EU leaders rejected Mrs May's plan for Brexit - known as theChequers agreement,external, and she warned them she wasready to walk awayrather than accept a ""bad deal"". In a statement on Sunday, the prime minister said ""many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step and seeking to exploit this moment for political gain"" by calling for another referendum and extending Article 50 to delay Brexit.

"Ginsburg was the second woman to sit on the Supreme Court The death of liberal judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the age of 87 has raised questions over the future direction of the US Supreme Court. Ginsburg, a prominent feminist and key liberal voice, served on the court for 27 years. Each of the nine judges - known as justices - serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. But with just six weeks until the 3 November presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee and former Vice-President Joe Biden, a Supreme Court vacancy adds another controversial turn to an already fiercely contested campaign. Vicious court fight could upend US election Who are the current justices? Meet the Supremes How has Trump's Supreme Court changed America? So what is the Supreme Court and who will pick Ginsburg's successor? The highest court in the US is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. It hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. Mourners have paid tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg Cases are usually brought to the court after they are appealed from a series of lower courts, although in time-sensitive cases, lawyers can petition for a hearing. The court's opinions can also create precedents, directing other judges to follow their interpretation in similar cases. In recent years, the court has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, allowed for President Donald Trump's travel ban to be put in place and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. While a majority of Supreme Court cases do not break on ideological lines, there are conservative and liberal wings and key cases have been decided by just one vote. Ginsburg herself voted for progressive issues in the court, including upholding key parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and legalising same-sex marriage. The supreme court justices pictured in 2018 Since his election in 2016, President Donald Trump has picked two new justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Before Ginsburg's death, the court was seen to have a 5-4 conservative majority, leading to what some have called the most conservative-leaning court in modern US history. However, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who was nominated by a Republican president, has sided with the four liberal justices on several rulings, including a case involving abortion. Supreme Court justices are appointed by the president - but in an election year, the key question is whether the decision should be made before or after the new presidential term begins. This video can not be played Trump and Biden react to Ginsburg death In 2016, Republicans in the Senate blocked the confirmation hearing for a justice nominated by Barack Obama, saying that no appointment should be made during an election year. President Trump nominated a conservative judge, Neil Gorsuch, to fill the vacancy within days of taking office in January 2017. President Trump is expected to name a conservative replacement for Ginsburg as soon as possible,White House sources told BBC partner CBS News,external. However, Ginsburg strongly disapproved of such a move. ""My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,"" she wrote in a statement to her granddaughter,according to National Public Radio,external. Joe Biden, who served as vice-president to Barack Obama, has also rejected the idea. ""Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg,"" he wrote on Twitter. US research suggests that the influence of the Supreme Court abroad has diminished over the past two decades, as court systems elsewhere in the world develop and US influence in general wanes. Fewer courts internationally cite US Supreme Court opinions, increasingly citing the European Court of Human Rights and other national supreme courts. In 2016 a Supreme Court decision on emissions from coal-fired power plants on US soil threatened the Paris Climate Agreement, but enough other countries ratified the treaty for it to come into force. Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, which affects Middle East countries designated as terror-prone, was cemented by the Supreme Court, with the outcome affecting millions internationally. And back in 2000, the Supreme Court decided the outcome of the presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore - a decision which more recent history shows still has a significant impact around the world.

"This video can not be played The moment gunmen open fire on an Iranian military parade Iranian leaders have accused US-backed Gulf states of being behind an attack on a military parade that killed 25 people, including a child. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""puppets of the US"" were trying to ""create insecurity"" in Iran. Gunmen opened fire at Revolutionary Guard troops and officials in the south-western city of Ahvaz. Earlier an anti-government Arab group, Ahvaz National Resistance, and Islamic State (IS) both claimed the attack. However neither group provided evidence to show they were involved. Earlier Foreign Minister Javad Zarif blamed ""terrorists paid by a foreign regime"", adding that ""Iran holds regional terror sponsors and their US masters accountable"". Allow Twitter content?

Iran has summoned diplomats from the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark, accusing their countries of harbouring Iranian opposition groups, state news agency Irna reports. ""It is not acceptable that these groups are not listed as terrorist organizations by the European Union as long as they have not carried out a terrorist attack in Europe,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi. Reports say nearly half of those killed were members of the Revolutionary Guard, who are under Mr Khamenei's command. Mr Khamenei did not name the ""regional states"" that he believed were behind the attack. The attack targeted Revolutionary Guard troops However Iran has previously accused its regional rival, Saudi Arabia, of supporting separatist activity amongst Iran's Arab minority. Fars news agency said the attack started at 09:00 local time (06:30 BST), lasted about 10 minutes, and appeared to involve four gunmen. The attackers fired at civilians,externaland attempted to attack military officials on the podium, Fars reports. At least one child was injured in the attack Civilians including women and children, who were watching the military parade, were among those killed, Irna news agency said. The victims included a four-year-old girl and a military veteran in a wheelchair, a military spokesman said. Local journalist Behrad Ghasemi told AFP that firing continued for between 10 and 15 minutes and said at least one of the attackers was wearing a Revolutionary Guards uniform. ""First we thought it's part of the parade, but after about 10 seconds we realised it was a terrorist attack as bodyguards [of officials] started shooting,"" he said. ""Everything went haywire and soldiers started running. I saw a four-year old child get shot, and also a lady,"" he added. All four attackers were killed, state media said. Iran is marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980-88 war with Iraq with several military parades across the nation. By Siavash Mehdi-Ardalan, BBC Persian There have been two conflicting claims of responsibility: one from a low profile Arab militant group in Iran's Khuzestan region and one from IS. It makes some difference. The former would suggest a resurgence of separatist militancy after a seven-year lull. If it was IS, it would represent a failure by Iran's intelligence community to prevent a second major IS attack in its soil. Iran has not provided any evidence of foreign collusion but has vowed revenge. The Saudi reaction and more importantly the wording of the US administration's response may prove important as leaders of all three countries are set for a possible diplomatic clash at the UN General Assembly next week. There have been conflicting claims. A spokesman for the Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Khuzestan, said the group was behind the attack. The spokesman did not say whether the group had links to other countries. The 'beauty' and the horror of the Iran-Iraq war Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' IS's Amaq agency has also claimed it carried out the attack. However the group provided no evidence that it had been involved. IS has carried out a major attack in Iran before. In June last year,suicide bombers attacked parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, killing 18 people. Iranian government and military officials have pointed the finger at Gulf states, the US and Israel, with all of whom Iran has longstanding tensions. A Revolutionary Guards spokesman claimed the attackers were ""trained and organised by two Gulf countries"" and had ties to the US and Israel. The US and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of supporting Houthi rebels in the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting on the side of the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

"This video can not be played 'The next thing I knew I was in the water' A man has been rescued from a ferry that capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania, two days after it overturned with the loss of at least 207 lives. The engineer, named locally as Alphonce Charahani, reportedly survived in an air pocket inside the MV Nyerere ferry, which capsized near Ukara island on its way from Bugorora on Thursday. He is said to be in a serious condition. It is thought the ship tipped when passengers moved over to one side. Divers resumed the search for survivors on Saturday after hearing knocking noises. The engineer had locked himself in a small room inside the ship, and the divers pulled him out of the vessel. It is thought the number of passengers far exceeded the ship's official capacity Bodies are still being taken out of the water, and reports on state broadcaster TBC cited the transport minister saying the death toll had risen to 207. On Friday, Tanzania's President John Magufuli said he had ordered the arrest of all those who managed the ferry, and declared four days of national mourning. Mr Magufuli reportedly said in a televised speech that ""negligence has cost us so many lives"", and said it seemed ""clear that the ferry was overloaded"". ""The arrests have already begun,"" he said. But the main opposition party, Chadema, criticised the government's response. ""We have often raised concerns about the poor condition of this ferry, but the government turned a deaf ear,"" the party's deputy secretary general John Mnyika told AFP. ""We have repeatedly denounced this negligence."" Local media say the ferry's official capacity was 100 people, but officials say the vessel was carrying more than twice that number when it capsized. It operates on a busy route, crossing eight times a day between the islands of Ukara and Ukwerewe, which are close to Tanzania's second-largest city of Mwanza. The ferry was said to have been particularly busy because it was market day in Bugorora, on Ukerewe island. The vessel was also carrying cargo, including bags of cement and maize, when it capsized around 50 metres from the shore. It is thought that many of the passengers would not have been able to swim. An official investigation will take place once rescue efforts to find survivors have ended. Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean.

"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged the EU not to mistake British politeness for weakness after Brexit negotiations reached an impasse. After rejecting the UK's proposals, Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, posted a provocative picture on Instagram featuring UK PM Theresa May""cherry-picking"" a cake. Mr Tusk has since said he admires Mrs May, and a compromise is possible. But Mr Hunt said Mr Tusk needed to avoid ""revving up"" the situation. He insisted it was time for people in the EU ""to step back from the abyss"" of a no-deal Brexit, to ""sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work"". In an interview with Ireland's RTE Radio, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had told him a treaty for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU was 87% agreed. This week, Mrs May tried to sell her proposals for the UK's future relationship with the EU at a summit in Salzburg, Austria. The plan - the so-calledChequers agreement- was agreed by the UK government in July. But EU leaders rejected a major part of her plan, saying the new economic partnership she had put forward would ""not work"" and risked ""undermining the single market"". Mrs May laterdelivered a televised statement in Downing Streetin which she said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"". She also made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"". Brexit: What happens next? All you need to know about Brexit What's behind Tusk's Instagram diplomacy? On Saturday, Mr Hunt said the UK was still waiting for a ""detailed response"" from the EU and criticised its approach to negotiations so far. ""What Theresa May is saying is 'don't mistake British politeness for weakness',"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""If you put us in a difficult corner, we will stand our ground - that is the kind of country we are."" In a reference to Mr Tusk's Instagram post and French President Emmanuel Macron's comment that Brexit campaigners were liars, Mr Hunt added: ""Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation."" Donald Tusk's Instagram post was his own idea, an EU source told the BBC Mr Hunt refused to rule out the prospect that the government could now seek a Canada-style free trade agreement - as many Conservative MPs want, rather than the more ambitious Chequers plan. Canada's deal with the EU, signed in 2016, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU - but without Canada paying for access to the single market. ""I am not dismissing anything,"" said Mr Hunt. ""We think these proposals are better than the Canada proposals because they work better on the Northern Irish border."" The land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, has been a stumbling block in negotiations. Both sides agree they do not want a return to a ""hard border"", such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras, but the wording is proving hard to agree on. The Irish foreign minsteralso expressed concernabout the role of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which is currently propping up Theresa May's Conservative government. The DUP has repeatedly said it would not accept any proposal that meant Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of the United Kingdom. In his RTE interview Simon Coveney said no one party should be allowed to veto proposals on the Northern Ireland border, and that negotiations were turning into a unionist versus nationalist issue. This video can not be played Is the EU punishing the UK? On Friday, Mr Tusk said Britain had known about the EU's reservations over the Chequers plan for weeks. He added that EU leaders at the summit had treated her proposals with ""all seriousness"" and said he was ""convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible"". French minister for European affairs Nathalie Loiseau said that, while France still believed a good Brexit deal was possible, it must also prepare for a no-deal outcome. Britain's vote to leave ""cannot lead to the EU going bust"", she said on France Info radio. ""That's the message we have tried to send for several months now to our British counterparts who may have thought we were going to say 'yes' to whatever deal they came up with,"" she said.

"Donald Tusk rejected Theresa May's Brexit proposals at an EU summit this week and posted an Instagram story shortly afterwards. ""A piece of cake, perhaps?,"" said the head of the European Council, alongside a picture of him and May at the summit in Austria. ""Sorry, no cherries."" This provocative post was Tusk's idea and is part of a wider strategy to appeal to young people via the app, an EU source has told the BBC. Here are five things to know about how Donald Tusk and other EU leaders use Instagram. EU must compromise or no deal, says minister ""He's the one coming up with these posts - he has a good sense of what works and what doesn't,"" says an EU source working with Tusk on social media. ""He's not the biggest social media geek but he likes it. ""He jokes and laughs and wants to show humour. This post was clearly something he was into - we produced the image [of cherries] and he said let's do it!"" The post combines the EU's favourite Brexit cliches. First, the idea that the UK wants to ""have its cake and eat it"". Second, that the UK is guilty of ""cherry-picking"" - keeping the bits of EU membership it likes and ditching the bits it doesn't. ""The cherry-picking one is something we have talked about a lot and finally we had a good pic from a good angle,"" says an EU source This video can not be played Brexit: The top five clichÃ©s Many Brexit supporters reacted angrily to Tusk's post on social media.

Conservative MP Charlie Elphickedescribed the post as ""extraordinarily disrespectful"",external. Pro-Europeans had mixed views, with onedescribing it as ""brilliant trolling"",externalby Mr Tusk, while another said it was""grim and not on, frankly"",external. A source close to Tusk said the message should not be taken too seriously. ""It was an innocent gesture. He is always expressing how sad he is about the U.K. leaving. ""We were taking the difficulty of the situation and giving it a soft touch."" Tusk's team did an in-house analysis of various social media platforms and ultimately decided to focus on Instagram, the BBC understands. They found that while Twitter is useful for communicating with journalists, not so many other people people use it regularly. However, Tusk did post this bombastic video on his Twitter account, showing his Autumn priorities in the style of an action film trailer. Allow Twitter content?

"Game of Thrones is one of Sky's most popular shows US cable giant Comcast has submitted the highest bid in the auction for broadcaster Sky, valuing the company at more than Â£30bn. Comcast beat Rupert Murdoch's Fox in a rare blind auction process set by the UK's Takeover Panel. The firm's chairman and chief executive said it was ""a great day for Comcast"". Sky has recommended its shareholders accept the bid, saying it was an ""excellent outcome"" and ""represents materially superior value"". The UK company's 23m subscribers and Premier League football rights make it one of Europe's most profitable TV companies. Comcast's bid,externalequated to Â£17.28 per share, beating Fox's of Â£15.67 per share. The battle for Sky: Why it matters What next for Murdoch after Sky deal? Fox had looked set to take over the 61% of Sky it does not already own until Comcast topped its bid. In July, Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but this was trumped by a Â£26bn bid from Comcast. The process has also been beset by regulatory issues amid concerns over media plurality and the degree of Mr Murdoch's influence over the UK media landscape. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: ""Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand, and accomplished management team. ""This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. ""We now encourage Sky shareholders to accept our offer, which we look forward to completing before the end of October 2018."" Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, said it was the ""beginning of the next exciting chapter for Sky"". He said: ""As part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe's leading direct to consumer media company."" In a statement, Fox said it was ""considering its options"" for the 39% shareholding it currently has in Sky. It added: ""We are proud to have played such a significant role in building the incredible value reflected today in Comcast's offer."" The future of Sky has been hanging in the balance for more than eight years. The process began when Mr Murdoch's News Corp company put forward a bid for full control of what was then BSkyB. That bid was scuppered by the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed Mr Murdoch's UK tabloid newspapers and tarnished the firm's reputation. The bid was revived in December 2016, by which time News Corp had been broken up, leaving 21st Century Fox as one of its successors. The process has been complicated byDisney's deal to buy most of Fox's assets, which is due to be completed next year if approved by international regulators. In the end this epic battle was settled by a very rare three round auction organised by the UK Takeover Panel. If the sealed bids had been very close, 21st Century Fox and its new owner Disney may have battled on.  But the Â£30.5bn tabled by Comcast was 10% more than Disney-backed Fox was offering and was described as a knockout blow by people close to the deal. Both companies wanted Sky and its 23 million subscribers to help them compete against new streaming competitors like Netflix and Amazon. The victory will be sweet revenge for Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast who lost out to Disney in a previous battle to buy 21st Century. In the end, Comcast perhaps needed it more urgently with their home market in the US dwindling. But the biggest cheers tonight will be from Sky shareholders - who have seen the value of the company driven up by two deep-pocketed rivals in the auction room. Comcast will pay them Â£17.28 a share - nearly double what they were worth a year ago. What next for Murdoch after Sky deal?

"Average petrol prices hit 130.6p a litre this week, and diesel rose to 134.6p Petrol prices could fall by as much as 3p a litre as a result of falling wholesale prices and a potential supermarket price war, the AA has said. The price of both petrol and diesel is currently at a four-year high, after 11 consecutive weekly price increases. Average petrol prices hit 130.6p a litre this week, while average diesel prices rose to 134.6p a litre. The AA said it was now a question of ""how quickly"" supermarket forecourts passed on lower costs to drivers. The motoring organisation - which offers advice to drivers - said falling wholesale costs had in the past triggered a forecourt price battle, with supermarkets jostling to offer drivers the cheapest prices. Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? Luke Bosdet, from the AA, said: ""Drivers were told earlier this month that there was 'no end in sight' to rising pump prices. ""Now, they should be looking for a Â£1.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs. ""The key question is to what extent and how quickly the fuel retailers decide to pass on the savings."" He said potential fuel savings had come from a drop in oil refining margins for wholesalers and a recent strengthening of the pound. The pound had been rising against the euro and the US dollar this month. However, itfell on Fridayafter Theresa May's assertion that a no-deal Brexit was better than ""a bad deal"".

"This video can not be played The moment gunmen open fire on an Iranian military parade Gunmen have opened fire on an Iranian military parade in the south-western city of Ahvaz, killing at least 25 people, including civilians, and injuring 60, state media say. The attackers shot from a park near the parade and were wearing military uniforms, reports say. An anti-government Arab group, Ahvaz National Resistance, and Islamic State (IS) have both claimed the attack. President Hassan Rouhani has vowed a ""harsh response"". ""The response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the smallest threat will be harsh, but those who sponsor the terrorists must be held accountable,"" he said in a statement. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif blamed ""terrorists paid by a foreign regime"", adding that ""Iran holds regional terror sponsors and their US masters accountable"". Iran has previously accused its regional rival, Saudi Arabia, of supporting separatist activity amongst Iran's Arab minority. Meanwhile, an Iranian military spokesman claimed the attackers were not from IS but ""were trained and organised by two Gulf countries"", and had ties to the US and Israel. Fars news agency said the attack started at 09:00 local time (06:30 BST), lasted about 10 minutes, and appeared to involve four gunmen. The attackers fired at civilians,externaland attempted to attack military officials on the podium, Fars reports. At least one child was injured in the attack Soldiers ducked for cover as shots were fired Nearly half of those killed were members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, reports say. A number of civilians, including women and children, who were watching the military parade, were also among those killed, Irna news agency said. However Irna said no journalist was among those killed, contradicting earlier reports. There were also conflicting reports about the four attackers, with state media saying all four had been killed after local deputy governor Ali Hosein Hoseinzadeh said two of the four had been arrested. Iran is marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980-88 war with Iraq with several military parades across the nation. By Siavash Mehdi-Ardalan, BBC Persian There have been two conflicting claims of responsibility: one from a low profile Arab militant group in Iran's Khuzestan region and one from IS. It makes some difference. The former would suggest a resurgence of separatist militancy after a seven-year lull. If it was IS, it would represent a failure by Iran's intelligence community to prevent a second major IS attack in its soil. Iran has not provided any evidence of foreign collusion but has vowed revenge. The Saudi reaction and more importantly the wording of the US administration's response may prove important as leaders of all three countries are set for a possible diplomatic clash at the UN General Assembly next week. There have been conflicting reports. A spokesman for the Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Khuzestan, said the group was behind the attack. The spokesman did not say whether the group had links to other countries. The 'beauty' and the horror of the Iran-Iraq war Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' IS's Amaq agency has also claimed it carried out the attack. However the group provided no evidence that it had been involved. IS has carried out a major attack in Iran before. In June last year,suicide bombers attacked parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, killing 18 people. Iranian government and military officials have pointed the finger at Gulf states, the US and Israel, with all of whom Iran has longstanding tensions. The US and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of supporting Houthi rebels in the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting on the side of the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

"Average petrol prices hit 130.6p a litre this week, and diesel rose to 134.6p Petrol prices could fall by as much as 3p a litre as a result of falling wholesale prices and a potential supermarket price war, the AA has said. The price of both petrol and diesel is currently at a four-year high, after 11 consecutive weekly price increases. Average petrol prices hit 130.6p a litre this week, while average diesel prices rose to 134.6p a litre. The AA said it was now a question of ""how quickly"" supermarket forecourts passed on lower costs to drivers. The motoring organisation - which offers advice to drivers - said falling wholesale costs had in the past triggered a forecourt price battle, with supermarkets jostling to offer drivers the cheapest prices. Fuel price calculator: How much do you pay? Luke Bosdet, from the AA, said: ""Drivers were told earlier this month that there was 'no end in sight' to rising pump prices. ""Now, they should be looking for a Â£1.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs. ""The key question is to what extent and how quickly the fuel retailers decide to pass on the savings."" He said potential fuel savings had come from a drop in oil refining margins for wholesalers and a recent strengthening of the pound. The pound had been rising against the euro and the US dollar this month. However, itfell on Fridayafter Theresa May's assertion that a no-deal Brexit was better than ""a bad deal"". The average price of petrol and diesel in the UK is currently at its highest since July 2014, following significant increases over the past two years. According to thegovernment's official statistics,external, average prices have increased by more than 30p a litre since January 2016. This year, petrol prices have gone up by 10p a litre, while diesel has increased by 11p. In May, prices went up by 6p a litre in one month - which the RAC said was thebiggest monthly increase for 18 years. Earlier this month, Chancellor Philip Hammond hinted that a freeze on fuel duty may end. He told MPs that previous analysis showing the benefits of continuing to freeze fuel duty against tax losses would ""have to be looked at again in the context of the economy today"".

"The Church of England has said it will not attempt to take on the loans of failed payday lender Wonga. Concerns were raised that the debts of thousands of borrowers could be passed to another high-interest lender after Wonga went into administration. MP Frank Field had urged the Archbishop of Canterbury to lead a group of ""good people"" to buy the loans. But the church said it had discussed the idea and decided it was ""not as well placed as others"" to buy them. Administrators were officially appointed last month to conduct an ""orderly wind-down"" of Wonga - a firm that was criticised for charging huge interest rates for its loans. Why Wonga has run into trouble Wonga: Will my debt be written off? Wonga: Where have all the borrowers gone? Following Wonga's collapse, ex-Labour MP Mr Field wrote to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby to express concern that borrowers could be ripped off if another payday lender bought the firm. He said Wonga's Â£400m loan book was likely to be sold at a ""knockdown"" rate, which risked the possibility of the ""exploitation of the poor"". Mr Field said buying it would protect 200,000 borrowers from having to make repayments to another lender at high commercial rates. Church commissioners - who manage the Church of England's investment fund - met to discuss the option this week. However, on Friday, the Church said: ""The church commissioners for England today also confirmed their non-participation in a potential buy-out of the UK loan book having concluded that they are not as well placed as others to take this forward."" It added that ""confidential approaches"" may now be made by parties from the charitable and finance sectors for the loans. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been a critic of firms like Wonga The Church of England has a Â£8.3bn investment fund, which it says it invests in an ""ethical and responsible way"". TheChurch holds investments,externalin firms including pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, the bank HSBC, supermarket Tesco, as well as tech firms Microsoft and Samsung. However, it has been criticised for some of its investments. Last week, theChurch said it was keeping its shares in Amazon- a day after the Archbishop Welby said the firm was ""leeching off the taxpayer"". The archbishop had questioned Amazon's tax record. In 2014, thecommissioners sold around Â£75,000 of shares in Wongaafter the archbishop pledged to ""put it out of business"". He had admitted to being ""embarrassed"" and ""irritated"" when details of the link emerged in 2013.

"Duncan Hutchison and his hand-built boat A Scot attempting to row solo across the Atlantic in a hand-built wooden boat has been rescued off the coast of Land's End. Duncan Hutchison, from Lochinver in the Highlands, began his journey more than three months ago in New York. However, just before 01:00 he reported to the coastguard that he was in difficulties and said he was battling 8ft (2.5m) waves. He was picked up by a merchant tanker - which is heading back to New York. Mr Hutchison was rescued 863 miles from the coast. His 23ft (7m) boat, Sleipnir, is being towed by the tanker. He has raised more than Â£18,000 for the WaterAid charity. Duncan Hutchison started the crossing in May A post on Mr Hutchison's Facebook page said he had just reached his 100 days at sea. ""As always, thank you to everyone for your support - Day 101 will be an emotional one for Duncan - and us all,"" it said. ""The boat that rescued Duncan is bound for ............ New York!"" Solo rower reaches halfway point in handmade boat Rowers sets out from New York in handmade boat Another post said that despite coping well with the conditions, a crash of the rower's on-board electrics left him with a decreasing power supply. ""The failure of his secondary battery, was followed by his primary supply cutting out, leaving him dependent on the items he charged beforehand,"" it said. ""It's likely his GPS tracker and all navigation equipment is down. ""He will be devastated, especially with a technical problem rather than a physical or structural issue of the boat. ""Although he's totally dedicated to completing the challenge, today marked 100 days at sea. "" The post added: ""Calling this in was probably the toughest thing Duncan's ever had to do, but is testament to his selfless and professional approach throughout the journey."" Duncan's daughter Francy told BBC Scotland her father did the right thing. ""In terms of distance, if it was in a straight line he would have covered the distance between New York and Lochinver, so he will be very disappointed because he likes to see things to a finish,"" she said. ""I think in the back of his mind he'll know he has made a very responsible decision because he wouldn't want to cause any of the emergency services any trouble and had he left it any longer it could have become quite a situation."" HM Coastguard duty commander Mark Rodaway, said: 'He's been picked up safe and well. We'll continue to keep in touch with him via the tanker crew while they progress their passage back towards New York. ""This is a good example of how well the National Maritime Operations Centre and the Coastguard national network co-ordinates long-range rescue missions. We're grateful to the tanker for responding and rescuing this rower"". Early last month, Mr Hutchison reached the halfway point in his 3,000-mile (4,828 km) adventure. He was aiming to finish his journey in Lochinver on the west Highland coast. Mr Hutchison spent three years building his boat, which is named after an eight-legged horse from Norse mythology that could glide across the sea.

"A no-deal Brexit is ""no problem"", Nigel Farage has said at a rally of the Leave Means Leave campaign group. The former UKIP leader told an audience in Bolton the current government negotiations on Brexit could plausibly end in an agreement. But ""far from being a cliff edge"", the UK would prosper without one, he said. Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis told the rally the PM's plans were a ""weak compromise"" and the government had to deliver Brexit ""without dilution"". Hunt: Don't mistake politeness for weakness Brexit: What happens next? All you need to know about Brexit Mr Farage said the majority of the ""political class"" did not respect the Brexit vote and the ""endless negative narrative"" needed to be countered ""again"". ""They do not want to give us Brexit,"" he told the rally at the University of Bolton Stadium, the first in a number of Leave Means Leave events across the country. The MEP said of the EU: ""They are a bunch of gangsters. We will explain a free trade deal is possible, if that's what the gangsters in Brussels want. ""If they don't, that is fine, if they don't we will leave with no deal. No deal, no problem."" Theresa May's plan for Brexit - known as theChequers agreement,external- was rejected by EU leaders as unworkable at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday. Mrs May later said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"" and made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"". Kate Hoey (left) and David Davis (right) also addressed the rally Mr Farage criticised the Chequers proposals, saying they were ""dead"" and do not work for the EU or the UK. Mr Davis had been leading the UK negotiations to leave the EU butquit the cabinet in July,saying he did not ""believe"" in the Chequers plan. At-a-glance: The Chequers plan He told Saturday's rally: ""We have nothing to fear and that is the reason why we should only accept a clean and clear Brexit, not some fudge."" Mr Davis also said he viewed the EU's treatment of Mrs May ""with contempt"", adding: ""Bad manners and discourtesy are not the hallmarks of great men."" He continued: ""And if you think you can bully our country, all I can suggest is that you read some history books."" Labour MP Kate Hoey also spoke at the rally, saying: ""We don't need another vote - we just want to leave."" ""Our vote matters and we won't allow it to be stolen from us,"" she said. She also said Brussels had never negotiated Brexit in ""good faith"". ""They underestimate how strong we are when we are up against it,"" she added. It was a full house at the University of Bolton Stadium. An audience of more than 2,000 people squeezed into what was decked out like a ballroom. A stall selling Leave Means Leave baseball hats did excellent trade. In Bolton, 58% voted to leave the EU in June 2016 and, as they queued to get in, many told how passionate they were to secure the kind of Brexit they voted for. They said they felt the result of the referendum was not being taken seriously enough. The audience had come from around the country, some waved union flags; others wore them. The loudest of the applause was reserved for Nigel Farage who started by saying: ""I didn't think I'd have to do this again."" That got laughs. Earlier he took an open top bus into Bolton to speak to shoppers and market traders, the media in tow. It all felt a bit like going back to the referendum campaign.

"De Vere House in Lavenham was used as the fictional birthplace of Harry Potter The 14th Century house used as the birthplace of Harry Potter remains on the market over a year after it was put up for sale. De Vere House in Lavenham, Suffolk, featured in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One, as the house where the young wizard's parents were killed by Lord Voldemort. It wasput on the market last summerfor almost Â£1m. Estate agent Carter Jonas said it was yet to find ""the buyer it deserves"". Caroline Edwards, a partner at the firm, said: ""Special houses like this always have to find the right buyer - indeed, a buyer who is prepared to be a custodian as much as a resident."" She said such a historic house appealed to the ""timber-framed purist"" but was ""not for the faint-hearted"", given the significance it carried. But she said: ""When you find the right buyer for a house like this, they tend to treasure them."" The Grade I-listed house boasts many period features including a massive timber frame and fireplaces The listed asking price is Â£950,000 De Vere House has a price tag of Â£950,000, which has been dropped from the original Â£995,000 asking price. It formed part of Godric's Hollow in the Harry Potter film, and was seen with a Christmas tree in the window, opposite a fictional graveyard. The house is among about 340 listed buildings in Lavenham, considered to be the best-preserved medieval village in England. Lavenham is famed as the best preserved medieval village in England with about 340 listed buildings De Vere House was previously known as Oxenford House and Oxford House New car park approved at Harry Potter site Harry Potter printers sold for Â£23.8m The house takes its name from the De Vere family and has previously been known as Oxenford House and Oxford House. In medieval times, the De Vere family was the second-richest family after the king and were responsible for creating much of Lavenham's medieval grandeur, the estate agent said. The house has retained its period features, including a massive timber frame, fireplaces, wall paintings and a rare stone spiral staircase with a carved brick handrail.

"This video can not be played 'The next thing I knew I was in the water' A man has been rescued from a ferry that capsized on Lake Victoria, Tanzania, two days after it overturned with the loss of at least 207 lives. The engineer, named locally as Alphonce Charahani, reportedly survived in an air pocket inside the MV Nyerere ferry, which capsized near Ukara island on its way from Bugorora on Thursday. He is said to be in a serious condition. It is thought the ship tipped when passengers moved over to one side. Divers resumed the search for survivors on Saturday after hearing knocking noises. The engineer had locked himself in a small room inside the ship, and the divers pulled him out of the vessel. It is thought the number of passengers far exceeded the ship's official capacity Bodies are still being taken out of the water, and reports on state broadcaster TBC cited the transport minister saying the death toll had risen to 207. On Friday, Tanzania's President John Magufuli said he had ordered the arrest of all those who managed the ferry, and declared four days of national mourning. Mr Magufuli reportedly said in a televised speech that ""negligence has cost us so many lives"", and said it seemed ""clear that the ferry was overloaded"". ""The arrests have already begun,"" he said. But the main opposition party, Chadema, criticised the government's response. ""We have often raised concerns about the poor condition of this ferry, but the government turned a deaf ear,"" the party's deputy secretary general John Mnyika told AFP. ""We have repeatedly denounced this negligence."" Local media say the ferry's official capacity was 100 people, but officials say the vessel was carrying more than twice that number when it capsized. It operates on a busy route, crossing eight times a day between the islands of Ukara and Ukwerewe, which are close to Tanzania's second-largest city of Mwanza. The ferry was said to have been particularly busy because it was market day in Bugorora, on Ukerewe island. The vessel was also carrying cargo, including bags of cement and maize, when it capsized around 50 metres from the shore. It is thought that many of the passengers would not have been able to swim. An official investigation will take place once rescue efforts to find survivors have ended. Tanzania has seen a number of nautical disasters, with overcrowding often playing a role. In 2012, at least 145 people died when a packed ferry sank while transporting people to the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean. The year before, almost 200 people died in another major incident off the coast of Zanzibar. Hundreds survived, some found clinging to mattresses and fridges. In 1996, more than 800 people died when the MV Bukoba capsized on Lake Victoria. It was one of the the worst ferry disasters of the last century.

"Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour's nationalisation plans would be cost-neutral The rail industry could be completely renationalised within five years if Labour wins the next election, the shadow chancellor has suggested. John McDonnell said he was looking at whether break clauses in contracts could allow rail franchises to be taken into public hands before they expired. He is planning to create a new unit in the Treasury to oversee the party's wider nationalisation plans. It would advise on issues such as possible compensation for shareholders. Mr McDonnell was asked about the party's nationalisation plans in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of Labour's annual conference in Liverpool. How could Labour's plans for greater public ownership work? Reality Check: What does nationalising the railways mean? Should the UK renationalise the railways? Labour conference 'women's equality' vow The party's 2017 manifesto included a pledge to bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expired. However, some franchises are set to continue for many years and the party has said it could use break clauses in contracts to take control sooner. There are currently 18 franchises in England, Scotland and Wales. With the odd exception, the shortest contracts run for seven years, although 10 years is more common. Northern Ireland's rail system has remained nationalised since 1948. The train operating companies are not responsible for track maintenance, which falls to publicly owned Network Rail. This video can not be played Is nationalisation the answer for Britain's railways? Asked whether it was possible all the franchises could be in public hands in the first term of a Labour government Mr McDonnell added: ""I think that's possible. That's why we're working through the detail now of how that can be done. ""And if you look at what's happened over time a number of these franchises have been handed back anyway."" His broader plan is for Labour to establish a Public Ownership Unit to develop legal and financial plans to bring private industries into the state sector, and set out a timetable for action. It would advise on how much compensation shareholders would receive and help decide which Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) should be nationalised. Labour is keen to present itself as ready for office in the event of an early general election. Mr McDonnell said: ""We will have new structures of government. ""I'll be ready on day one going into government to be able to bring forward the legislation, to implement the policy."" Mr McDonnell argued his plans were cost neutral because the cash generated by newly acquired private companies would cover the cost of financing the debt needed to buy them. There would be enough money left over, he said, to increase investment and reduce consumers' bills. But he declined to say how much extra borrowing would be required to purchase private assets. Shareholders in private companies would receive bonds - government debt - in return for their shares. The new Treasury unit would advise what level of compensation they were due, with the final decision made by Parliament. PFI-funded projects range from hospitals and waste facilities to army barracks PFI is a way of financing investment in public infrastructure using private capital. Private firms stump up the cost of building facilities - such as a hospital or school - and, in return, the state makes payments over a period of time - often about 25 years - for their use and management. The model has been attractive to governments of all political persuasions as it limits upfront capital expenditure and reduces risk while future payment obligations do not count towards the national debt. However, its value for money has long been questioned. As of March 2016there were 716 PFI projects, 686 of which were still operational,external. The others had either been cancelled or had reached the end of the contract period. The SNP government stopped new PFI contracts when it came to power in Scotland, replacing them with NPDs (non-profit distributing projects). Labour intends to take control of PFIs by nationalising Special Purpose Vehicles - the companies established to run them. Typically, investors would be compensated and Labour would follow legal advice, Mr McDonnell said. But he added: ""There might be some factors in relation to some operations of PFIs in particular that could be brought forward that says actually there is no compensatory arrangements needed here."" The party's annual conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - is due to begin in Liverpool on Sunday, withthe party pledgingto ""put equality centre stage"". It will close on Wednesday with a major speech by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is coming under pressure to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal - he has so far insisted he wants to see a general election instead. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) is due to meet later on Saturday, the day before the main conference begins, to discuss changes to leadership election rules.

"Social care workers are some of those most likely to be underpaid A record Â£15.6m worth of underpayment to UK workers has been discovered by the government in the past year. In total, 200,000 workers missed out on being paid at least the minimum wage rate - the highest number since the statutory rate was introduced in 1999. Social care, commercial warehousing and the gig economy were the sectors most likely to underpay staff, HMRC said. It had prioritised checking these areas alongside apprentices, migrant workers and employment agencies, it said. In total, the firms found to have underpaid workers were fined Â£14m as well as having to reimburse their staff. The Low Pay Commission chairman Bryan Sanderson said: ""All workers are entitled to be paid at least the minimum wage, so it is good to see increased focus on enforcement bearing fruit and securing more arrears for more workers."" The government said funding for enforcement was at record levels - rising to Â£26.3m in 2018/19 from Â£20m in 2016/17. Earlier this year,restaurant chains Wagamama and TGI Fridays were finedan undisclosed amount for failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. Lowest-paid 'can't afford basic needs' Wagamama fined for minimum wage failure The UK cities with the highest and lowest wages The National Living Wage (over 25s): Â£7.83 an hour 21-24 year old rate: Â£7.38 18-20: Â£5.90 16-17 Â£4.20 Apprentice rate: Â£3.70 Business minister Kelly Tolhurst urged firms to check that they were getting their workers' pay right. ""We are dedicated to stopping underpayment of the minimum wage. Employers must recognise their responsibilities and pay their workers the money they are entitled to,"" she said. She credited the rise in the number of underpaid workers discovered to ""a record government clampdown"". Tom Neil, of employment advice and conciliation service Acas, said firms which did not pay the national minimum wage were ""breaking the law"" and faced a maximum fine of Â£20,000 per worker. ""Failure to pay the national living wage could also result in a company director being banned for up to 15 years,"" he added. Research from the TUC union has previously suggested that the number of workers not paid the full minimum wage is about 250,000. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has estimated that as many as 362,000 people do not receive the headline rate of the minimum wage. However, that includes workers whose pay is below the minimum wage for legitimate reasons: for example, they may receive accommodation or other benefits as part of their pay. HMRC urged workers who believed they were not receiving the minimum wage to contact the Acas helpline on 0300 123 1100 in confidence or submit an online query through its complaints form.

It wasput on the market last summerfor almost Â£1m. Estate agent Carter Jonas said it was yet to find ""the buyer it deserves"". Caroline Edwards, a partner at the firm, said: ""Special houses like this always have to find the right buyer - indeed, a buyer who is prepared to be a custodian as much as a resident."" She said such a historic house appealed to the ""timber-framed purist"" but was ""not for the faint-hearted"", given the significance it carried. But she said: ""When you find the right buyer for a house like this, they tend to treasure them.""

It formed part of Godric's Hollow in the Harry Potter film, and was seen with a Christmas tree in the window, opposite a fictional graveyard. The house is among about 340 listed buildings in Lavenham, considered to be the best-preserved medieval village in England.

"Brett Kavanaugh denies the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford The woman who accuses US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault has been given extra time to decide whether she will testify against him at a confirmation hearing. Allegations from a university professor, Christine Blasey Ford, emerged in the US media last week. She gave details of an incident which she says happened at a party in 1982. Her lawyer has accused Republicans of trying to ""bully"" her with ""arbitrary"" and ""aggressive"" deadlines. The Friday deadline given by the Senate judiciary committee is now reported to have been switched to later on Saturday. The truth about false assault accusations Kavanaugh accuser 'faces death threats' Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? President Donald Trump attacked Prof Ford's credibility on Friday, saying if the attack had been ""as bad as she says"", she would have reported it to the authorities sooner. Judge Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations. Prof Ford insists she is ready to testify at the hearing, but negotiations over certain conditions she has set out, including it not taking place until next Thursday, have delayed proceedings. The committee originally granted her a deadline of 22:00 on Friday (02:00 GMT Saturday) to agree to revised terms - though it is not yet known what these are. But the professor's lawyer, Debra Katz, demanded another day to decide, saying: ""Its sole purpose is to bully Dr Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family."" In response, Senator Chuck Grassley - the lead Republican on the committee - said he had granted Prof Ford ""another extension"" -which, according to the New York Times, runs until 14:30 on Saturday (18:30 GMT),external.

The allegation against Judge Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's pick for the US top court, became public last week. It emerged Prof Ford had detailed the alleged assault in a confidential letter to the top Democratic senator on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, in July. As the judge neared confirmation, news about the letter leaked to US media. Ms Feinstein then confirmed she had passed it onto the FBI. After days of continued media speculation,Prof Ford went on record in a Washington Post article as the mystery accuser,external, detailing the alleged assault. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out She said Mr Kavanaugh tried to drunkenly remove her clothing at a party, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth when she was 15 and he was 17. Since then, her lawyers have been in a back-and-forth with the judicial committee, trying to agree on terms for her to testify. She had asked for a number of preconditions, including not testifying with Mr Kavanaugh in the room and the subpoenaing of his friend, Mark Judge, who she said witnessed the alleged attempted rape. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have accused her and Democratic politicians of deliberately trying to delay and obstruct the judge's confirmation, and urged them to push forward. The feelings are strong on both sides - with both Prof Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and his wife both receiving threats and rallies of support over the matter. This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: 'We believe her' The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life. As Mr Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh has to first be approved by the Senate before he can take his seat - but before that vote can happen, he has to be approved by the judiciary committee, where Prof Ford may testify. Why is the US top court so important? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? The Senate is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats - so any testimony she gives on the allegations could prove pivotal. Some have said there should not be a vote on his confirmation until Prof Ford has been heard. President Trump weighed in heavily on the allegations on social media on Friday. In a series of tweets, he questioned why law enforcement was not called at the time of the alleged assault, in 1982. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He also reiterated his full support for Judge Kavanaugh who he described as a ""fine man, with an impeccable reputation"". Mr Trump's controversial comments were criticised by Democratic politicians and some Republicans. Republican Senator Susan Collins said she was ""appalled"" by Mr Trump's tweet. ""We know that allegations of sexual assault - I'm not saying that's what happened in this case - but we know that allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist,"" she told reporters. Only 23% of rapes and sexual assaults are reported to the police,external, according to the Department of Justice's 2016 report. On Friday, the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport trended on Twitter, with thousands sharing personal stories of sexual harassment and assault. Patti Davis, the daughter of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in the Washington Post that she was raped 40 years ago,external. ""It doesn't surprise me that for more than 30 years, Christine Blasey Ford didn't talk about the assault she remembers,"" she wrote, adding: ""It's important to understand how memory works in a traumatic event.""

Anna Shapiro and her husband Alex Kingsparked a major incidentwhen they said they had become ill at a Prezzo restaurant in the city on Sunday. They were later discharged from hospital and police said one line of inquiry was that it had been a hoax. Ms Shapiro's lawyers said labelling it a hoax was ""media speculation"". On Tuesday, Ms Shapiro, 30, told the Sun newspaper that the Russian state had poisoned her and her husband in the restaurant. The paper reported that ""security sources"" suspected a ""rat poison attack"". Ms Shapiro - a model and Israeli citizen of Russian heritage - and Mr King were later discharged from Salisbury District Hospital after the pair tested negative for Novichok. A police source told the BBC they were looking into whether it had been a hoax. The pair have been interviewed by Wiltshire Police and no arrests have been made. Ms Shapiro's lawyers said: ""There has been some media speculation that our client may have participated in an elaborate hoax as regards her fear of her husband's poisoning. ""She was not involved in any hoax and... her fears were genuine, both as to the poisoning and her suspicion of foul play."" In 2006, Mr King carried out a ""prank"" on the Prince of Wales at a film premiere. He inserted himself into an official line-up of stars being greeted by Prince Charles and was later interviewed by the media about his deception. He claimed the had done itas part of a Â£100,000 bet with his employer,external- the convicted fraudster Edward Davenport. He also has a previous conviction for distributing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children. A major incident was declared in Salisbury on Sunday, after Ms Shapiro and Mr King said they had fallen ill Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliacollapsed in Salisburyin March after being exposed to Novichok. After weeks in hospital they were released but in June, two Amesbury residents fell ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent. Dawn Sturgess, 44,later died. The UK government has accused two Russian men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, of attempting to kill the Skripals. But in an interview on a Russian state-run news channel, they claimed to have been in Salisbury only as tourists. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning.

"European Council President Donald Tusk said he was ""convinced"" a compromise was possible. European Council President Donald Tusk has said a compromise with the UK over Brexit is ""still possible"", after Theresa May warned she was prepared to walk away from talks. In a statement, Mr Tusk said he was a ""true admirer"" of the PM. But he defended the EU's approach and said it was in fact Mrs May who had been ""tough"" and ""uncompromising"". Mrs Mayon Friday demandedmore respect from Brussels after EU leaders rejected a major part of her Brexit plan. She had tried to sell her blueprint, which was agreed by ministers at Chequers, to EU countries at a summit in Salzburg, Austria, this week. But the EU said the new economic partnership she had put forward ""will not work"" and risked ""undermining the single market"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - but the two sides are trying to reach a deal by November so it can be ratified in time. Brexit: What happens next? All you need to know about Brexit What's behind Tusk's Instagram diplomacy? Mr Tusk issued a statement on Friday evening, hours after Mrs May delivered her own speech in Downing Street in which she said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"". Mr Tusk said EU leaders at the summit had treated her proposals with ""all seriousness"" and said they were a ""step in the right direction"". Britain had known about the EU's reservations over the Chequers plan for weeks, he added. Mr Tusk said: ""While understanding the logic of the negotiations, I remain convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible. ""I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May."" Mrs May's statement dominates many of Saturday's front pages. The Express calls her speech her ""finest hour"" and says she was right to demand respect from the EU and the Daily Mail says Mrs May ""confronted the arrogance of the EU elite with unyielding, level-headed reason"" and describes the EU's behaviour in Salzburg as ""shabby"". The Sun describes it as Mrs May's ""Brexit fightback"" while the i draws a comparison to Margaret Thatcher with a headline that reads: ""May tells EU: I'm not for turning"". But the Daily Telegraph says the prime minister is facing a showdown with her cabinet next week when ministers will call for a ""Plan B"" alternative to the Chequers proposals. Read more: 'Furious' May 'is not for turning' Italian MEP Roberto Gualtieri, who sits on the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group, also expressed optimism that a solution will be reached. He told BBC Newsnight: ""I think that no deal is not an option. We are sure that the rationality will prevail."" In her televised statement on Friday, Mrs May said talks had reached an ""impasse"" and could only be unblocked with ""serious engagement"" from the EU side. ""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect,"" she said. ""The UK expects the same, a good relationship at the end of this process depends on it. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will not overturn result of the referendum"" ""At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals."" The pound's fall against the dollar and the eurodeepened following Mrs May's statement. Some Brexiteer MPs praised her for her comments. Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the ""strong and forthright"" speech but said she should abandon her Chequers plan and come forward with a Canada-style free trade agreement. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen - who previously called for a no-confidence vote on Mrs May - said she needed to ""chuck"" the Chequers plan. ""I think it could be a very, very rough ride for the prime minister when she finally realises how unpopular her Chequers proposals are, not only within the EU, but within the membership of the Conservative Party out in the constituencies,"" Mr Bridgen told BBC Newsnight. ""It' s a grim time really. In her speech on Friday, the PM said both sides were still ""a long way apart"" on two big issues: the post-Brexit economic relationship between the UK and EU, and the ""backstop"" for the Irish border, if there is a delay in implementing that relationship. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard border - physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but cannot agree on how. Please upgrade your browser The two options being offered by the EU for the long-term relationship - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, Mrs May said. Mrs May says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP, who Mrs May relies on for a Commons majority in key votes, said the prime minister was ""right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister's negotiating strategy ""has been a disaster"" and said ""political games from both the EU and our government need to end"" to avoid a no-deal scenario. Labour wants to see the UK join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, but remain outside of the single market.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will never agree to it - it would mean breaking up our country."" She didn't budge. And she was never going to. Afterher embarrassment yesterdayat the hands of EU leaders, with restive backbenchers at her back, Theresa May was never going to use this highly unusual appearance in Downing Street and dramatically reverse out of her position. Simply, to back down less than 24 hours later would have looked weak. And the prime minister has invested huge amounts of time, effort, and political capital into her Chequers plan. Ministers never believed that it would be the precise form of the final agreement. May: EU must respect UK in Brexit talks But Number 10 believed that in good faith, they had put something credible on the table for discussion. She has already lost two cabinet ministers over the compromise, and endured weeks of attacks from different wings of her party. So one, albeit, highly embarrassing diplomatic bust-up was not going to force her to back down. Her anger was visible though today, explaining again why she believes the two familiar post-Brexit trade options, Norway and Canada, cannot, and will not work for the UK. And she called for respect from the EU: ""Throughout this process I have treated the EU with nothing but respect, the UK expects the same"". A stern tone, strong words. And in going further on citizens' rights too, perhaps Mrs May has sought to take the high ground, in contrast to what some in the UK are seeing as the EU's poor behaviour yesterday. But while there is no remote sign from the PM today that she is about to compromise, forces in the EU and in her own party are intent on forcing her to do so. Her problem is that they want to push her in different directions. Rhetoric doesn't change the fact that few of the players involved outside Number 10 believe that the suggestions the prime minister has put forward can be the ones that ultimately will win the day.

"Average petrol prices hit 130.6p a litre this week, and diesel rose to 134.6p Petrol prices could fall by as much as 3p a litre as a result of falling wholesale prices and a potential supermarket price war, the AA has said. The price of both petrol and diesel is currently at a four-year high, after 11 consecutive weekly price increases. Average petrol prices hit 130.6p a litre this week, while average diesel prices rose to 134.6p a litre.

"Rod Rosenstein: ""There is no basis to invoke the 25th amendment"" US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has denied a report that he discussed invoking a constitutional clause to oust President Donald Trump. America's second most senior law official said the allegation was ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"". The New York Times, citing anonymous sources,external, also said Mr Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording Mr Trump to expose chaos in the White House. But a source told the BBC that the comment was sarcastic. Mr Rosenstein is reported to have made the remarks after Mr Trump fired the FBI director last year. James Comey had been overseeing his law enforcement agency's investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Trump referred to the ""Russia thing"" when asked why he was removed. Mr Trump told a rally in Missouri on Friday evening that there was a ""lingering stench"" about what was being exposed at the US Justice Department. He said he would get rid of it just as his administration ""had gotten rid of bad people at the FBI"". This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? The New York Times reported that Mr Rosenstein had discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th amendment of the US constitution, which provides for the removal of a president if he is deemed unfit for office. It also says he suggested secretly recording Mr Trump to expose White House turmoil and dysfunction. The suggestions came during meetings and conversations in May 2017 with Department of Justice and FBI officials, the paper said. It cited several unnamed sources who were briefed on the events. According to US media, the source of the allegations are memos created by former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe, who was fired by Mr Trump in March this year. Mr Trump and Mr Rosenstein speak at an immigration event in May Mr McCabe's lawyer, Michael Bromwich, said his client ""has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos"". Mr Bromwich said the memos had been submitted to the special counsel who is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice, and that another copy had remained with the FBI. The deputy attorney general issued a statement saying: ""The New York Times's story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. ""I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. ""But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th amendment."" From left: Mr Rosenstein, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Mr McCabe A justice department press officer told the BBC that Mr Rosenstein's comment about secretly recording the president was a joke. The statement was attributed to ""a source who was in the room"" and was said to remember the exchange in question. ""The statement was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the president,"" the unnamed source said. The spokesperson did not immediately reply to an emailed question asking if the 25th amendment was discussed during that meeting. In other US media, there was scepticism that the US deputy attorney general would earnestly propose ousting the president. Activating the relevant section of the 25th amendment would require a majority of Mr Trump's cabinet, the vice-president and majorities in Congress, which is currently controlled by the president's party. The Washington Post also reported,externalthat Mr Rosenstein's remark about surreptitious recordings was not serious. The newspaper said the deputy attorney general had been responding to Andrew McCabe's suggestion that the justice department investigate the president. According to the Post, Mr Rosenstein replied sarcastically: ""What do you want to do, Andy, wire the president?"" The newspaper also said that someone who was present at the meeting denied the 25th amendment had ever come up. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump has spent a lot of time disparaging ""fake news"" reports from the ""failing"" New York Times largely based on anonymous sources. It will be interesting to see how he responds to an article that seemingly confirms his suspicions that members of his own administration are out to get him. Or maybe they're not. It all depends on whether you believe sources who talked to people who were in the room when Rod Rosenstein reportedly entertained notions of secretly taping the president or organising a constitutional manoeuvre to remove Mr Trump from office. On some level, it doesn't matter if the reports are true. They alter events and perceptions either way. Mr Rosenstein has been on thin ice with the president for so long his feet probably have frostbite. The New York Times story could be the ominous crack that presages a plunge into the cold abyss. Given Mr Rosenstein's position overseeing Robert Mueller and the Russia probe, any move against him by the president would be fraught with political peril. The president has vowed that he won't make a decision about Jeff Sessions until after the mid-term elections in November. Would that reluctance extend to the attorney general's second in command? 9 May 2017- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submits a memo to the attorney general regarding FBI boss James Comey's investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified documents. President Trump fires Mr Comey, and Andrew McCabe becomes acting director of the FBI. 11 May 2017- Mr Rosenstein denies that he threatened to quit after being described as a key influence in Mr Comey's firing. The New York Times says Mr McCabe's memos from around this time note that Mr Rosenstein was upset and wished Mr Comey was still at the FBI. 16 May 2017- Mr Rosenstein met Mr McCabe and other senior officials to explain his role in Mr Comey's firing. He reportedly said he was frustrated with Mr Trump, suggested wearing a ""wire"" to secretly record the president during White House visits, and discussed invoking the 25th amendment to oust Mr Trump for being ""unfit"" for office, the New York Times reported on Friday. 17 May 2017- Mr Rosenstein appoints Robert Mueller as special counsel, tasked with overseeing the Russia investigation. 17 March 2018- Mr McCabe is fired by Mr Trump a day before his planned 18 March retirement. He had stepped down from his FBI role amid relentless criticism from Mr Trump. 30 May 2018- US media report that Mr McCabe handed over a confidential memo on Mr Comey's firing - which reportedly details his conversation with Mr Rosenstein - to the special counsel. 26 July 2018- After the justice department rejects a request to release Mr McCabe's memos, conservatives in the House of Representatives file articles of impeachment in an effort to oust Mr Rosenstein, accusing him of stonewalling their requests for information, which he denies.

"The US has shown concern about Hezbollah financial operations in South America Police in Brazil have arrested a man accused by the United States of being one of the main financial operators of the Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will not overturn result of the referendum"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said the EU must treat the UK with more ""respect"" in Brexit negotiations. In a statement at Downing Street she said for EU leaders to reject her plan with no alternative at this ""late stage of negotiations"" was ""not acceptable"". She said talks had reached an ""impasse"" and could only be unblocked with ""serious engagement"" from the EU side. European Council President Donald Tusk said a ""compromise"" was possible but the UK proposals had to be ""reworked"". The pound's fall against the dollar and the eurodeepened following Mrs May's statement. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Brexit: What happens next? Tusk: May's plan won't work What's behind Tusk's Instagram diplomacy? All you need to know about Brexit The two sides are trying to reach a deal by November so it can be ratified in time. They want to avoid a hard border - physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but cannot agree on how. Mrs May says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border. She tried to sell the plan directly to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg, Austria, this week. European press sympathy for Mrs May Court to rule on whether UK can halt Brexit Pound falls after Brexit statement Mixed Northern Ireland response to statement Speaking afterwards, Mr Tusk said that while there were some ""positive elements"" in Mrs May's proposals, EU leaders had agreed that ""the suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market"". In response to Mrs May's latest statement, he said the UK's stance at the summit ""was surprisingly tough and, in fact, uncompromising"" but that he remained ""convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible"". On Friday, the prime minister said: ""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same, a good relationship at the end of this process depends on it. ""At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals."" This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We will never agree to it - it would mean breaking up our country."" A stern tone, strong words. But while there is no remote sign from the PM today that she is about to compromise, forces in the EU and in her own party are intent on forcing her to do so. Her problem is that they want to push her in different directions. Rhetoric doesn't change the fact that few of the players involved outside Number 10 believe that the suggestions the prime minister has put forward can be the ones that ultimately will win the day. Read Laura's blog She said the two sides were still ""a long way apart"" on two big issues: the post-Brexit economic relationship between the UK and EU, and the ""backstop"" for the Irish border, if there is a delay in implementing that relationship. The two options being offered by the EU for the long-term relationship - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, she added. The first would ""make a mockery of the referendum"" she said, while the second would mean Northern Ireland would be ""permanently separated economically from the rest of the UK by a border down the Irish Sea."" Mrs May said no UK prime minister would ever agree to that: ""If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake."" The prime minister attempted to reassure EU citizens living in the UK that, in the event no deal can be reached ""your rights will be protected"". She said ""no-one wants a good deal more than me"", adding: ""But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country."" The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said EU diplomats did not consider that their officials working on Brexit negotiations had been disrespectful. They said they had listened to the UK position and are offering a unique partnership post-Brexit, but will not agree to anything that would harm the EU. She added that the prime minister's statement was being viewed in Brussels as a ""tubthumper"" designed to bolster her political position at home. Mr Tusk followed up his remarks on Thursday by posting a photograph on Instagram of Mrs May and himself looking at cakes with the caption: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" The EU has argued that the UK cannot ""cherry-pick"" elements from its rulebook. That was criticised by some Conservatives, including Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith who described it as ""quite insulting"". Mr Tusk's team says the Instagram presence is aimed at reaching out to a younger audience. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister's negotiating strategy ""has been a disaster"" and said ""political games from both the EU and our government need to end"" to avoid a no-deal scenario. ""The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU. From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain,"" he said. Labour wants to see the UK join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, but remain outside of the single market. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP, who Mrs May relies on for a Commons majority in key votes, said the prime minister was ""right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union"". She added that the UK would ""not countenance any new regulatory or customs barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the ""strong and forthright"" speech from the prime minister but said she should abandon her Chequers plan and come forward with a Canada-style free trade agreement. ""This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU's proposal."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that while the EU position had been ""bluntly expressed"" it was not new - it was just that the prime minister ""hasn't been listening"".

"Congratulations to Wolf Alice on winning this year's Mercury Prize. The London four-piece band picked up the Â£25,000 winners' cheque for their 2017 album, Visions of A Life, which will be familiar to their fans and pop music aficionados (it reached No 2 in the charts) but probably less so to others. Any which way, it is well worth a listen. The Mercury Prize judges have chosen an album that is adventurous in regards to the band's own sonic development but not exactly avant-garde in terms of pop music. Joff Oddie, Ellie Rowsell, Theo Ellis and Joel Amey of Wolf Alice celebrating their award Wolf Alice are purveyors of classic indie pop but with the added twist of being refreshingly willing to test their musical boundaries. Visions of A Life is like one of those Robert Rauschenberg collages that are constructed out of bits and pieces he'd picked up along the way. It seems to be all over the place at first: a mixtape from a band that hasn't made up its mind as to who or what it is. But then, gradually, it resolves into a coherent design with a heart and soul. Visions of A Life is like a Robert Rauschenberg collage (Black Market 1961) It opens with Heavenward, a grungy track about death in which lead singer Ellie Rowsell channels a young Thom Yorke. It is followed by the shouty Yuk Foo, in which the band make an unconvincing stab at being punks. The third track, Beautifully Unconventional, is different again: a catchy tune that harks back to the late-70s, early-80s scene and the likes of Siouxsie and the Banshees. The Mercury Prize judges described the album as ""an exuberant tapestry of swirling pop, grunge and indie guitar rock"". Wolf Alice's Visions Of A Life album cover Fair enough, not much to argue with there. Except, there's a word missing. As you make your way through the album, and listen to track after track, each and every one making you think, ""That's a bit like such-and-such artistâ¦,"" you start to wonder what is distinctive about Wolf Alice? What is their sound? It's not immediately obvious. There's a heaviness and speed that they create around their songs, which gives them a brooding storminess upon which Rowsell's ethereal voice rises and falls on a sea of driving guitars and pulsating baselines. There are tracks, such as Don't Delete the Kisses and St. Purple & Green, where the combination of rock, pop, and lyrical poetry come together to create a genuinely soulful, gothic landscape. This is their sound. But without that missing word, which isâ¦ Folk. It is how the band started out with Ellie Rowsell and Joff Oddie playing clubs and bars around north London as an acoustic duo with a Laura Marling-type vibe. They expanded to become a four piece with the intention of being faster and noisier, which they have done, but the folkiness remains, albeit buried deep within an indie wall of sound. Folk is the grit in the Wolf Alice oyster - it agitates and irritates and rubs up against the band's indie rock public image, but ultimately leads to the creation of some beautifully formed musical pearls. Ellie Rowsell from Wolf Alice performing Don't Delete The Kisses at the Mercury Prize Visions of A Life is the band's second studio album. Their first, My Love is Cool, was very good, and that - as we know - often leads to a tricky second. Not so in this case. Visions of A Life is better, from its eight-minute long title track to the hauntingly melancholic After The Zero Hour. The band's experimentation necessarily means not every idea hits the bullseye, but Wolf Alice have established themselves as artists of rare quality who have already made their mark. My guess is the third album will be better still, with more surprises, more avenues explored, which will lead to an even more ""exuberant tapestry of swirling pop, grunge and indie guitar rock"". And folk.

"Emily Stevenson said she designed the dress to apply pressure to Walkers to change their packaging A marine biology student who wore a home-made graduation gown made out of crisp packets has used her ceremony to highlight the effects of pollution. Emily Stevenson, 21, created the protest outfit to ""send a message to Walkers"" which she said should do more to reduce its non-recyclable packaging. Campaigners 38 Degrees claim Walkers makes 7,000 crisp packets per minute. The firm has said the packaging for all of its products would be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025. Currently itscrisp packets are made from a type of metallised plastic. More on this story and other Devon and Cornwall news Ms Stevenson said she was ""not a fashion person at all"" and the dress took her ""at least 20 hours"" to stitch together using needle and thread. It took the graduate more than 20 hours to create her protest dress She wore the creation to her graduation ceremony at Plymouth University on Monday after becoming inspired by the ""ancient crisp packets"" that she found littered on the beach.

"Comedian Gary Meikle is bemused by the world's eyebrow obsession A comedian's video rant about his daughter's eyebrows has gone viral. When Gary Meikle complained about 23-year-old Ainsley's obsession with having ""bangin"" brows, he had no idea so many people would share his pain. More than fifteen million views and thousands of comments and shares later, he has become an unofficial anti-brow ambassador. But the Glaswegian funnyman still doesn't know what microblading or an Instagram brow is. It all started in early September when Gary took to his car to film a vlog about his daughter's current preoccupation. Gary and his daughter Ainsley who is delighted her eyebrows have become a viral hit In the film, he complains: ""I've got a 23-year-old daughter who still lives at home and the hardest part of that, without a shadow of a doubt, is constantly having to remind and reassure her that her eyebrows are bangin'. ""What's happening ladies? When did eyebrows become the most important part of a woman's body? ""Now it's constantly: 'Do you like my eyebrows Dad, do you like my eyebrows?'"" His rant struck a chord and the number of views started rising. Beauty influencer Thuy Le shows off what has been dubbed Instagram eyebrows to her one million followers People could relate to his predicament. Gary toldBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme: ""I just got into the car and went on a little rant. ""What women don't realise is that men don't notice them. The only ones we acknowledge are the very small percentage that look bad. About 99% of time we don't notice them [eyebrows]. ""My daughter drives me mad. It's constant.  I just agree with her but I am not seeing anything different. ""Men don't actually care about your eyebrows."" The three-minute video exploded on Facebook and was then shared on a nationwide social media account racking up millions of views. Gary moans in the clip: ""She'll post them on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat. They look the exact same! They look the exact same as they did before you had them done!"" Gary is a stand-up comedian and his daughter is often the source of his best material. As a single dad, he ends up sharing all his parenting struggles with his audience.He even used Ainsley's periods as comedy content. He said he ends up knowing far too much.

"Eirian Hill suffered serious burns in an accident - which made dad Craig rethink his priorities ""Her dress just went up like it was dipped in paraffin."" It was the horrific moment that two-year-old Eirian fell into a fire - and changed the way her father Craig Hill thought about his own life for good. The dad-of-three from Cardiff gave up his job as a teacher and started a carpentry business out of his garage, so he could spend more time with his family. The move has just won him a Â£50,000 investment on TV's Dragons' Den. ""I became very aware I was spending less and less time with my own children,"" explained Mr Hill, 39. ""I was putting a lot of time and effort into teaching, staying behind and doing clubs, with other people's children."" Then came the accident. This video can not be played Daughter's fire fall led dad to Dragon's Den win Eirian was prone to drop fits - a precursor to epilepsy where she would fall to the ground. On this occasion, she was standing by the fireplace in the family home. ""She lost consciousness. I saw her eyes glaze over and she fell backwards,"" said Mr Hill. ""I saw my daughter but I also saw six-foot flames."" Eirian was rushed to hospital for treatment and has had to have repeated skin grafts to treat her burns. ""My priorities changed,"" said Eirian's father, who sustained burns himself as he ripped his daughter's flaming clothes from her back. Child's cerebral palsy book to help others understand her life Vinyl records, music and Dragons' Den As time went on and Eirian's wounds healed, Mr Hill became more and more disillusioned with his job. Then over one summer holiday he did some decking woodwork for a neighbour, which prompted another person to ask him to do work for them. A business was born. Craig Hill with one of his outdoor kitchens, which he says are built to last He decided to leave teaching, saying: ""When I started the carpentry, it was like someone pressed the reset switch. ""Looking back, I was suffering anxiety and depression but when I was working and on the job, my worries went to the back of my mind."" Cooking helped chef Carluccio with depression battle Mr Hill took a course and initially took up domestic carpentry but got fed up with just working to make money. ""I'd spent 13 years being a teacher and helping children to develop. I ended up doing a mud kitchen for a friend who had told me that her school was looking to develop the outdoor space but there was no funding available and no resources affordable. ""She told me they enjoyed this indoor kitchen and something similar outside would be beneficial. ""I did a bit of research online and built these mud kitchens which help develop fine and gross motor skills; there's numeracy skills involved in it. ""With a construction background we ensure everything we make is really robust and built to last."" He said his company, Landscapes for Learning, worked with schools to make sure the products they produced were ""meaningful and purposeful and will benefit the children within the school"". The kitchens tap into a growing trend for outdoor education TheDragon's Denconnection came after a middle of the night application to the entrepreneurial BBC programme, which got an immediate response and a screen test for Mr Hill. ""The next thing you know, I'm standing in front of five people being filmed for a television programme and they seemed to like what they heard. I was really grateful for that,"" he said. The experience was ""properly scary"". ""I was trying to get them to invest in an ethos, my vision if you like. ""Sandpits have been around for hundreds of years; I wasn't doing anything new, but my take on it, my version of it and linking it to the curriculum was ahead of just trying to sell them something."" He said as well as lots of communication about the business following Dragon's Den, the company had also been contacted by people suffering depression who had been prompted by his story to talk to someone about their own issues. Wrexham schoolgirl stars in Chinese version of Robot Wars The radio 'saved my little girl's life' Dragon Peter Jones, who backed the company for a 30% stake for his Â£50,000 investment, said: ""Getting children outside to continue their learning is vital and is rightly being emphasised in the curriculum. ""I know my own children would have loved Craig's products when they were younger and I recognised that, as well as his passion and determination, immediately. ""I want to help Craig make this type of learning accessible for everyone because ultimately if our children benefit, so do we all.""
