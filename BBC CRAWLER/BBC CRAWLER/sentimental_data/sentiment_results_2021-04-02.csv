"Seven people have died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, the medicines regulator has confirmed to the BBC. In total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated by 24 March had these clots. It is still not clear if they are just a coincidence or a genuine side effect of the vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the benefits continue to outweigh any risk. The World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency have echoed this conclusion. A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said: ""Patient safety remains the company's highest priority."" However, concern has led to other countries including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada to restrict the vaccine's use only to older people. Thedata released by the MHRA on Friday,externalshowed 22 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) which is a type of blood clot in the brain. These were accompanied by low levels of platelets, which help form blood clots, in the body. The MHRA also found other clotting problems alongside low platelet levels in eight people. Now the MHRA has confirmed, in an email to the BBC, that ""sadly seven have died"". Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, said: ""The benefitsâ¦ in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so."" Investigations are under way to determine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is causing the very rare blood clots. Earlier this week the European Medicines Agency said it was ""not proven, but is possible"". AstraZeneca: Is there a blood clot risk? When will I get my Covid jab? What you need to know about vaccine safety Two issues are raising suspicions. The first is the unusual nature of the clots which, including low levels of platelets and rare antibodies in the blood that have been linked to other clotting disorders. ""This raises the possibility that the vaccine could be a causal factor in these rare and unusual cases of CVST, though we don't know this yet, so more research is urgently needed,"" said Prof David Werring, from the UCL Institute of Neurology. The other issue is the difference between the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. There have been two cases of CVSTs after Pfizer in the UK, out of more than 10 million vaccinated, but these did not have the low platelet levels. However, there remains uncertainty around how common these clots normally are. Estimates range from two cases per million people every year to nearly 16 in every million in normal times and the coronavirus has been linked to abnormal clotting, which may be making these clots more common. Germany has reported 31 CVSTs and nine deaths out of the 2.7 million people vaccinated there, with most cases in young or middle-aged women. Similar data on who has been affected in the UK has not been published in the UK, but a wider mix of people are thought to have been affected. All medicines, from vaccines to paracetamol, have the potential to cause severe side effects. The seasonal flu jab has around a one-in-a-million chance of causing the nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. So, the real question is: Are the risks worth the benefits? Even if the vaccine was the cause, and this is still not proven, the numbers suggest around one death in every 2.5 million people vaccinated. However, this has to be weighed against the known threat posed by coronavirus. If 2.5 million 60-year-old people caught coronavirus then around 50,000 would die. If they were all 40-year-olds then around 2,500 would die. This balance of risk and benefit will continue to be assessed as more safety data comes in and as the vaccine programme moves into younger people, who are at lower risk of dying from Covid-19. One scientist has told the BBC that evidence is growing that the blood clot events are ""causally related"", although he stressed that the benefits of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine still far outweighed the risks of not getting the jab. Prof Paul Hunter, a medical microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is not uncommon to get clusters of rare events purely by chance. ""But, once you find that cluster in one population and it then crops up in another - such as previously in the German and now in the English - then I think the chances of that being a random association is very, very low. ""Clearly more work needs to be done, but I think the evidence is shifting more towards it being causally related at the moment."" However, public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, of the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Breakfast the cases were ""rare events"" and stressed there was no event ""at the moment of a causal link - that the vaccine would be directly causing these outcomes"". She urged the public to continue coming forward for a jab, and added: ""Covid itself increases the risk of blood clots quite significantly and it's possible that that may be part of the explanation why we're seeing this.""

"Russia has been conducting military manoeuvres in Crimea Russia has warned Nato against sending any troops to help Ukraine, amid reports of a large Russian military build-up on its borders. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would take ""additional measures"" if Nato were to make such a move. Sporadic, low-level clashes continue in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists. US forces in Europe are now on higher alert, citing ""escalations of Russian aggression"" in the area. A Nato official told Reuters news agency that Russia was undermining efforts to reduce tensions in eastern Ukraine and Nato ambassadors had met on Thursday to discuss the situation. ""Allies share their concerns about Russia's recent large-scale military activities in and around Ukraine,"" the official said. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky joined the criticism, saying ""military exercises and possible provocations along the border are traditional Russian games"". In a phone call with Mr Zelensky on Friday, US President Joe Biden ""affirmed the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea"", the White House said in a statement. Will a deal with Russia bring peace to Ukraine? Meanwhile, Mr Peskov accused Ukrainian forces of staging ""provocations"" on the frontline in eastern Ukraine, where a fragile ceasefire is violated daily. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the BBC that there had been a build-up of Russian military at the northern border between Ukraine and Russia, along the eastern border and ""also in the illegally occupied Crimea"". ""So from three directions we observed a military build-up of the Russian federation,"" he said, adding: ""Ukraine is not looking for any escalation - we do not need war."" In the worst flare-up in recent months, four Ukrainian soldiers died in separatist shelling on 26 March near Shuma, a village in the Donetsk region. There have been only low-level incidents since then. Last month Russia conducted military exercises in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in March 2014. The rebels in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine also rely on Russian help. Western governments say Russia has deployed regular troops there, along with heavy weapons. That is denied by the Kremlin, which says Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels, who seized a swathe of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April 2014. Unverified video on Twitter in recent days purports to show Russian tanks, artillery and armoured vehicles heading to the Ukrainian border. Ukraine's army commander Gen Ruslan Khomchak says Russia has deployed 28 battalion tactical groups near Ukraine's eastern border and in Crimea, which would amount to 20,000-25,000 troops. Russian officials have not confirmed that, nor given any precise figures. According to Gen Khomchak, Russia also has nearly 3,000 officers and military instructors in the rebel units in eastern Ukraine. ""The Russian Federation moves its armed forces within its territory at its discretion,"" Kremlin spokesman Mr Peskov said. He added that ""it should not worry anyone and does not pose a threat to anyone"". The Russian military has confirmed that an airborne assault brigade - about 4,000 troops - is being redeployed to Crimea from Volgograd in southern Russia this year. Since 2014 Russia has considerably beefed up its military presence in Crimea, including its key Sevastopol naval base.

"This video can not be played Watch: Rescue efforts after the train derailment At least 50 people have been killed and dozens more injured after a train carrying nearly 500 crashed and then derailed in a tunnel in Taiwan. The eight-carriage train reportedly hit a construction vehicle that had slipped onto the tracks at the tunnel's mouth. Rescuers combed badly damaged carriages inside the tunnel to find survivors, some of whom smashed windows to flee. The train, from the capital Taipei to Taitung, was carrying people travelling for a long-weekend annual holiday. Many people may have been standing because the train was so full. The 408 train is one of the fastest deployed on a network that is generally considered safe. It can reach speeds of 130km/h (80mph). Friday's crash is Taiwan's worst rail disaster in decades. President Tsai Ing-wen has sent her condolences to the families of the victims and ordered an investigation. Some passengers exited on to the roof to escape The latest reports from the National Fire Agency say 494 people were on the train, with 50 dead and 66 injured and taken to hospital. The crash took place at about 09:00 local time (01:00 GMT). Some people at the back of the train were able to walk away unscathed, while 100 were rescued from the first four carriages. Many of the dead, injured and trapped were in four crumpled carriages inside the tunnel. ""It felt like there was a sudden violent jolt and I found myself falling to the floor,"" one female survivor told Taiwan's UDN.  ""We broke the window to climb to the roof of the train to get out."" Another rescued woman said: ""My whole body fell to the floor. I hit my head and it started bleeding."" A 50-year-old survivor told Apple Daily she saw many people trapped under their seats and when she walked out of her carriage she saw bodies everywhere. Pictures showed people in less affected carriages walking along train tracks with their belongings Local media reports say the train driver is among the dead. Images show a large, yellow flatbed truck lying at the side of the tracks. A construction project has been under way near the north end of the tunnel. It is not known how the vehicle slipped down the embankment. Other pictures showed people walking along the tracks with their belongings as they were evacuated from less badly affected carriages. Other survivors were being carried away on stretchers with their necks in braces. This image appears to show the yellow flat-bed truck at the side of the tracks Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang visited the crash site on Friday afternoon. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter: ""I offer my sincere condolences to all those affected by this morning's rail accident in Taiwan."" Analysis by BBC's Cindy Sui in Taiwan Taiwan has an impressive transportation network, including more than 1,000km of railway tracks. The trains transport more than 200 million passengers each year. Accidents are rare, but this latest derailment  - if it was indeed caused by a construction vehicle parked on a nearby slope sliding onto the tracks - would add to a number of recent incidents that have been blamed on negligence and/or human error. They include: a train derailment in 2018 caused by a faulty speed alert systemand a driver busy talking to the command centre who failed to slow down before entering a curve - 18 people died a number of deadly fires inside factories that have housed unsafe dormitories for workers a bridge collapse in 2019 caused by lack of maintenance, which killed four migrant fishermen in a boat a chemical explosion in 2014 caused by neglect of underground pipelines - 32 people died This latest accident once again raises questions about whether Taiwan is placing enough importance on safety and preventing accidents. Many of those on the train are believed to have been travelling to celebrate the Tomb Sweeping festival - a time when people pay their respects to the dead by visiting the graves of family members, sprucing them up and making offerings to their spirits. The island's worst crash in recent history was in 1991, when 30 passengers were killed and 112 injured after two trains collided.

"Idles' latest album Ultra Mono topped the UK chart Bands including Idles and Lanterns on the Lake have said they will not work with a north-east England promotions company due to claims of sexual harassment made against it by staff. SSD Concerts called the claims made against them online ""malicious"", but said they were taking them ""seriously"". Northumbria Police told the BBC that no reports had been submitted to them. However officers did arrest and caution a man for hacking into the company's social media account earlier this week. The largely anonymous allegations, which also include the use of ""offensive"" language, staff being made to feel ""uncomfortable"" and ""underpaying"" workers, were shared via the business reviews section of the jobs website Glassdoor. SSD Concerts, which describes itself as ""one of the UK's largest independent live event promoters"" was the driving force behind last summer's Virgin Money Unity Arena - billed as the world's first socially distanced music festival. It saw the likes of The Libertines and local star Sam Fender perform in Gosforth Park in Newcastle. On Thursday evening, Idles, who scored a number one with their recent album Ultra Mono and were previously listed for the Mercury Prize,posted,external: ""In light of the recent allegations against SSD Concerts, we would like to make it clear that they will no longer be promoting our show at Newcastle City Hall on 2 February 2022."" Idles: 'We're in class war and poor are losing' The Bristol band then directed fans to online resources where they can get help regarding sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace. Fellow Mercury listees Lanterns on the Lake added they were similarly unwilling to perform in their home city as long as their gig was promoted by SSD Concerts. They noted how they had now opted to move their gig to the Boiler Shop - a Newcastle venue which has also since cut its ties with the firm. Allow Twitter content?

""I suppose the most disappointing part of this is that there has been no real acknowledgement by SSD of the pain, stress and discomfort they have caused some of their own employees or any indication of what they plan to do to put things right,"" they wrote. In a statement released online on Thursday, SSD Concerts boss Steve Davis said: ""We take what we have seen very seriously, but it seems 'trial by social media' means you are guilty until proven innocent."" ""The safety of our staff, the agents, the artists and the audiences that attend our shows is paramount,"" he added. Sam Fender performed at the SSD Concerts-promoted outdoor Virgin Money Unity Arena last summer ""Bullying, harassment and equal opportunities policies are in place, a process that started long before the recent postings and allegations on social media.

It's now around 16:40 local time in Washington DC, and dozens of police and National Guard troops are out patrolling the streets and investigating the scene of the attack. In the aftermath of the 6 January riot, hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to the US Capitol. There are estimated to be around 2,300 still there, and the plan had been to bring that number down in the next few weeks. It's unclear how today's attack will change security plans for the Capitol building and the capital city. The US Capitol Police has released the name of the officer killed in today's attack. A statement from acting police chief Yogananda Pittman reads: âIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the passing of Officer William 'Billy' Evans this afternoon from injuries he sustained following an attack at the North Barricade by a lone assailant."" It goes on to say the officer was a member of the Capitol police force for 18 years. ""Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers,"" the statement says. According to CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, the suspect is 25-year-old Noah R Greene. According to officers involved in the case, he has recent ties to Virginia, the state that borders Washington DC to the south. Officers say that no prior information about him has been found on any police databases, and that he does not appear to have any ties to the military. Officers on the streets around DC assembled an impromptu funeral procession for the officer who died in today's attack. Hunter Walker, a reporter for Yahoo, captured the moment on camera when a Secret Service officer saluted the motorcade. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Footage shows an increased security presence around the Capitol building, where the US Congress sits, and a number of police cars surrounding the area. This video can not be played US Capitol: Suspect in custody after 'ramming car' into officers Today's attack comes less than three months after the 6 January riots in
which a Capitol Police officer was killed. Brian Sicknick, 42, was injured while âphysically engaging
with protestersâ and later died in hospital. Sicknick lay
in honour in the Capitol Rotunda in January - a rare distinction reserved for
those who are not government or military officials. Earlier this
month,two men were charged with using bear spray on Sicknick, although it is not clear if
he died from the bear spray. Sicknick ""wanted
to be a police officer his entire life"", his brother, Ken, said
in a statement. ""Brian
is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,"" he added. The blue sedan that was rammed into the Capitol Hill checkpoint is still on scene. Officers are combing through the crash site, looking for evidence. Surrounding them are thousands of armed police officers and National Guard troops. A large perimeter has been established around the crime scene, making it harder for journalists to get a better view of the car. Capitol
Police have shared updated information surrounding the officerâs death. The investigation continues. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Attacks on the seat of US government are a rarity, but not without precedent. Before the 6 January riot this year, a 2013 incident ended with a fatal car chase. A former dental hygienist from the state of Connecticut was shot after trying to breach the White House, leading officers on a high-speed chase to the Capitol through the heart of downtown Washington DC. Miriam Carey was said to have been suffering mental illness, and was under the belief President Barack Obama had been stalking her. Her young child was in the backseat when an officer shot her as she attempted to drive at police. The shocking footage of the deadly car chase was caught on video by an Arabic- language news channel that happened to be filming on Capitol Hill at the time.

Much of the reaction online has been sympathy and condolences for the US Capitol Police department, which lost an officer in today's attack. The 6 January attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob ended in the death of five people, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. In the aftermath of the riot, officers shared stories of the ""medieval battles"" they had endured as they clashed for hours in the hallways of power. ""We were battling, you know, tooth and nail for our lives,"" said one Washington DC police officer on Capitol Hill that day.

Marco Rubio of Florida called the attack ""tragic and cowardly"". âThe brave men and women of the United States Capitol Police put their lives on the line every day to protect the heart of our democracy,"" said Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""We are hoping and praying for the recovery of those injured in the line of duty."" President Biden is at Camp David and has been made aware of the situation, the White House press secretary said. The attack at the US Capitol today took the life of one member of the US Capitol Police. The officer will not be identified until next of kin is informed. This is the second Capitol police officer to die on duty this year. Officer Brian Sicknick was beaten with flagpoles and other objects by pro-Trump rioters at the Capitol on 6 January. The death today is also only the fourth time a Capitol officer has died defending the Hill. Previously, two were killed in 1998 in an isolated incident. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Foyle College moved to a new state of the art campus in the city's Waterside in 2018 A Londonderry grammar school has asked former pupils to help pay an outstanding debt of Â£821,000 to the Department of Education (DE). A letter, which has been seen by BBC News NI, was sent to former pupils of Foyle College last month. The school - which has 850 pupils -moved to a new state of the art campus in the city's Waterside in 2018. The DE said it would continue to work with Foyle College ""to secure repayment of funds related to their move"". The letter to former pupils said that the school ""owes DE Â£821,000 in relation to our share of the cost of the new school"". It said that DE had offered to defer repayment of the money, but that could involve terms and conditions that would threaten the school's voluntary grammar school status. However, the chair of Foyle College's governors said he was confident the money would be repaid. Voluntary grammar schools are funded directly by DE but then have independence to manage their own budget. The budgets of controlled schools, by contrast, are managed and overseen by the Education Authority (EA). In 2013, Bloomfield Collegiate inBelfast became the first grammar school in Northern Ireland to give up its voluntary status due to a financial deficit. The Foyle College letter was first revealed by the Derry News newspaper and then obtained by BBC News NI. It said that when the school moved to its new campus it had decided to build additional facilities ""beyond what public funding could provide"". Those facilities cost the school an additional Â£2.4m, and it still needs to find Â£821,000 of that money to repay DE. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle's News at One programme, the chair of Foyle College's board of governors Gavin Killeen denied that the school had ""overspent"". ""The Department of Education that fund capital builds such as this are very restrictive in the type of facilities that the school can build - the classroom size, the number of classrooms, the size of your assembly hall, the size of your sports hall, the amount of playing fields that you would have,"" he said. ""The board of governors quite a while ago decided that we're not going to move very often - you're going to do it once every two or three generations. ""We wanted to make sure that we were moving to the best possible school that we possibly could have and the board of governors were very happy to enhance the budget that the department had already agreed to fund that. ""We were able to add extra playing facilities, extra rugby pitches, extra hockey pitches - we have a sports hall that's able to accommodate five badminton courts."" A drones eye view of Foyle College Mr Killeen said that some former pupils had previously donated ""very significant"" contributions towards the school building, which was ""second to none"". ""We have raised well in excess of over Â£1m already,"" he said. ""You don't know exactly what you have until everything is finalised so it's only really over the last eight months that we know the final position."" But Mr Killeen admitted that the school's status as a voluntary grammar could be at risk if it could not repay the outstanding Â£821,000 to DE. ""It we weren't able to repay the department our future like any other business or any other organisation would come into question,"" he said. ""But we're very confident that we will repay the money."" He also said the local community had also been able to benefit from the additional facilities the school had decided to build.

"Parties have reportedly been held at halls of residence, including University Hall in Penylan, Cardiff Security has been beefed-up at Cardiff University to tackle students holding parties breaking Covid laws, it has been claimed. A letter to Unison members expressed concern at ""parties and mass gatherings"" held at halls of residence. ""These gatherings and parties are unlawful and put staff and students' health at risk,"" it said. The university said a small minority were not observing the rules and there had been parties at some of its sites. It added that breaches were investigated by university security ""often working alongside South Wales Police"". Undercurrent coronavirus regulationslarge groups of people are banned from meeting inside and only six people from two households can meet outside. The Unison letter, sent in an email and seen by BBC Wales, said the parties and gatherings were taking place predominantly at two halls, Talybont and University Hall. ""We recognise how frustrated many of the students are, however, we fully support the university in their efforts to stop this dangerous and unlawful behaviour,"" said the email. It said security from the firm Showsec had been drafted in to help on nights when they were needed. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Cardiff University testing system 'fatally flawed', ex-boss claims University 'threw out students' belongings' It said Showsec was being used as a ""temporary measure"" and would only be used on ""evening/nights where there are issues"". The email said four new security guards had been employed by the university. ""There are lots of Covid-specific measures that are required at present in order that the safety of all staff and students is prioritised and the trade unions are fully supportive of every measure that increases safety."" Talybont halls of residence in Gabalfa was also mentioned in a letter from union Unison The student experience has been very different for those studying in 2020 and 2021 so far, with campuses closed, lectures cancelled, and nights out banned for much of the year. Universities in Wales had agreed a staggered start of the new term after the Christmas break, but many students continue to learn online. NUS Wales president, Becky Ricketts, urged students to ""stick to the rules"". ""As with any part of society, there will always be a small number of people who break rules, but we can't scapegoat students and young people, the majority of whom are behaving responsibly,"" she said. ""The plan to lift measures in Wales announced earlier this week means that by doing the right thing for a little longer, students will soon be able to do more with more people. ""Universities have procedures in place to deal with misconduct and these are appropriate to be able to deal with any rule breaches. ""I'd encourage universities to continue to communicate the latest rules with their students and avoid the over-policing of our campuses."" Cardiff University said it took students' health and safety seriously. A spokesman said using extra private security was not new and had been in place since the start of the academic year ""especially in response to an increase in non-residents trying to access them"". He said: ""The vast majority of our students are observing Covid-19 rules and we are extremely grateful to them for doing so. ""However, like other universities, a small minority are not observing the rules and we have seen parties and other gatherings in communal spaces at some of our sites, including University Hall and Talybont. University disciplinary action has been threatened for those breaking Covid rules ""Such incidents are contrary to current Covid-19 restrictions, are not acceptable and we have a duty to act."" Breaches are investigated by university security ""often working alongside South Wales Police"". The spokesman said: ""They have resulted in fixed penalty notices and acceptable behaviour contracts and, in some cases, may result in university disciplinary action.""

On 1 April, thousands of customers of the delivery platform across France got confirmation emails for orders worth more than â¬450 (Â£380; $530). Many took to social media to express anger at the stunt. Late on Thursday, Deliveroo informed its customers via Twitter and email that it had not been serious. ""We confirm that it was an April Fool's joke,"" the clarification read. ""You can enjoy the evening by ordering the pizza of your choice."" But few customers were amused.

which a Capitol Police officer was killed. Brian Sicknick, 42, was injured while âphysically engaging
with protestersâ and later died in hospital. Sicknick lay
in honour in the Capitol Rotunda in January - a rare distinction reserved for
those who are not government or military officials. Earlier this
month,two men were charged with using bear spray on Sicknick, although it is not clear if
he died from the bear spray. Sicknick ""wanted
to be a police officer his entire life"", his brother, Ken, said
in a statement. ""Brian
is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,"" he added. The blue sedan that was rammed into the Capitol Hill checkpoint is still on scene. Officers are combing through the crash site, looking for evidence. Surrounding them are thousands of armed police officers and National Guard troops. A large perimeter has been established around the crime scene, making it harder for journalists to get a better view of the car. Capitol
Police have shared updated information surrounding the officerâs death. The investigation continues. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Attacks on the seat of US government are a rarity, but not without precedent. Before the 6 January riot this year, a 2013 incident ended with a fatal car chase. A former dental hygienist from the state of Connecticut was shot after trying to breach the White House, leading officers on a high-speed chase to the Capitol through the heart of downtown Washington DC. Miriam Carey was said to have been suffering mental illness, and was under the belief President Barack Obama had been stalking her. Her young child was in the backseat when an officer shot her as she attempted to drive at police. The shocking footage of the deadly car chase was caught on video by an Arabic- language news channel that happened to be filming on Capitol Hill at the time.

In the aftermath of the riot, officers shared stories of the ""medieval battles"" they had endured as they clashed for hours in the hallways of power. ""We were battling, you know, tooth and nail for our lives,"" said one Washington DC police officer on Capitol Hill that day.

It's now around 16:40 local time in Washington DC, and dozens of police and National Guard troops are out patrolling the streets and investigating the scene of the attack. In the aftermath of the 6 January riot, hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to the US Capitol. There are estimated to be around 2,300 still there, and the plan had been to bring that number down in the next few weeks. It's unclear how today's attack will change security plans for the Capitol building and the capital city. The US Capitol Police has released the name of the officer killed in today's attack. A statement from acting police chief Yogananda Pittman reads: âIt is with profound sadness that I share the news of the passing of Officer William 'Billy' Evans this afternoon from injuries he sustained following an attack at the North Barricade by a lone assailant."" It goes on to say the officer was a member of the Capitol police force for 18 years. ""Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers,"" the statement says. According to CBS News, the BBC's partner in the US, the suspect is 25-year-old Noah R Greene. According to officers involved in the case, he has recent ties to Virginia, the state that borders Washington DC to the south. Officers say that no prior information about him has been found on any police databases, and that he does not appear to have any ties to the military. Officers on the streets around DC assembled an impromptu funeral procession for the officer who died in today's attack. Hunter Walker, a reporter for Yahoo, captured the moment on camera when a Secret Service officer saluted the motorcade. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

which a Capitol Police officer was killed. Brian Sicknick, 42, was injured while âphysically engaging
with protestersâ and later died in hospital. Sicknick lay
in honour in the Capitol Rotunda in January - a rare distinction reserved for
those who are not government or military officials. Earlier this
month,two men were charged with using bear spray on Sicknick, although it is not clear if
he died from the bear spray. Sicknick ""wanted
to be a police officer his entire life"", his brother, Ken, said
in a statement. ""Brian
is a hero and that is what we would like people to remember,"" he added. The blue sedan that was rammed into the Capitol Hill checkpoint is still on scene. Officers are combing through the crash site, looking for evidence. Surrounding them are thousands of armed police officers and National Guard troops. A large perimeter has been established around the crime scene, making it harder for journalists to get a better view of the car. Capitol

Attacks on the seat of US government are a rarity, but not without precedent. Before the 6 January riot this year, a 2013 incident ended with a fatal car chase. A former dental hygienist from the state of Connecticut was shot after trying to breach the White House, leading officers on a high-speed chase to the Capitol through the heart of downtown Washington DC. Miriam Carey was said to have been suffering mental illness, and was under the belief President Barack Obama had been stalking her. Her young child was in the backseat when an officer shot her as she attempted to drive at police. The shocking footage of the deadly car chase was caught on video by an Arabic- language news channel that happened to be filming on Capitol Hill at the time. Read more US police launch inquiry after deadly car chase The security lockdown has lifted, but you wouldn't have guessed it based on the number of camouflaged National Guard troops that continue to fan out across Capitol Hill.

"32 games across Championship, League One and League Two Hogan penalty in stoppage time gives Birmingham big win over Swansea Championship leaders Norwich draw at Preston, second-placed Watford beat Sheff Wed Play-off contenders Barnsley and Reading share points Bottom side Wycombe beat Blackburn, fellow strugglers Rotherham and Coventry beaten League One: Top three Hull, Peterborough and Sunderland all score late to win League Two: Leaders Cambridge beat promotion rivals Morecambe Jay Freeman FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea And so an absolutely mammoth Good Friday draws to a close and in some fashion! Birmingham bag a dramatic late penalty to give themselves hope of remaining in the Championship for another season. Tomorrow, the second tier action continues as Huddersfield take on Brentford and we'll be here bringing you all the action from 12:15 BST. For now, thank you for joining us. FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea A third defeat in a row means Swansea will probably have to settle for a play-off place. They're nine points behind Watford in second. FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea Birmingham are now six points clear of the drop zone. Massive win for Lee Bowyer's men. FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea Can you imagine what that finale would have been like if fans were in the ground?! What a finish. Birmingham 1-0 Swansea A huge three points for Birmingham who pull off a cracker of a win against Swansea. Scott Hogan's penalty, after Lukas Jutkiewicz missed from the spot earlier on, seals it for the hosts. Birmingham 1-0 Swansea Now, I know this isn't about me, but did I get my crystal ball out (which, as I say, I carry at all times) and wish for a dramatic late goal OR DID I NOT?! No need to thank me, everyone. When I want goals, I make it so. Scott Hogan Huge! Scott Hoganfires it from the spot right into the corner and there's nothing Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman can do this time. Birmingham might just have sealed an absolutely massive three points in their battle for Championship survival. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea ANOTHER Birmingham penalty! Yan Dhanda appears to catch Ivan Sunjic and the hosts have another chance to win it! Three minutes given, by the way. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Another Birmingham change. Rekeem Harper, the West Bromwich Albion loanee, is sent on in place of Gary Gardner for the final few minutes. Not long left now. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Righto, I've whipped out my crystal ball (which I keep with me at all times) and I've told the powers that be that we want a dramatic late goal. Meanwhile, as I get all Mystic Meg on this game, Jamal Lowe comes off for Swansea and is replaced by Wayne Routledge. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham last kept a clean sheet at home back in November against Millwall. They have around five minutes left to hold on for what could be a valuable point come the end-of-season run-in. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Another Birmingham change. Scott Hogan and Sam Cosgrove come on for Jonathan Leko and Lukas Jutkiewicz. Just under 10 minutes remain. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Jamal Lowe has been in the mix for Swansea time after time tonight and he's just won a corner for the visitors. Matt Grimes whips it in towards the far post and Birmingham win a free-kick. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda's looked very lively for Swansea since his come on and he's had several attacks upfield which has kept the Birmingham defence busy. Still no goals in this one, though. Also, to go back to the Get Involved post a few minutes ago, apparently we live in a world where 'chippy' isn't the given term for a fish and chip shop. What else would you call it? The Saturated Fat Emporium? Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Oof! Cracking save from Birmingham goalkeeper Neil Etheridge who dives to his left to keep out Yan Dhanda's free-kick. That was a sensational strike from the Swansea man and he's thwarted by the ex-Cardiff keeper. #bbcefl Roger:Just when did people start with chippy? Growing up, never heard that word. Matt Evans:I live in Orlando, FL now; can't find a good Chippy to save my life.
Jay, your update hits home.  (Or hits the Chippy sized gap left in it, anyway). For those of you who missed my tea updates earlier... I wasn't allowed anything from the 'Chippy' and had to go for the healthy option instead. As you may have guessed, it's pretty uneventful at St Andrew's. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea In years to come, I feel like this past 20 minutes of football will be the reason I give for why I no longer tolerate the sport. Less than 20 minutes remain for these two sides to prove future me wrong! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda replaces Korey Smith for Swansea who make their first change of the match so far. Fingers crossed there's a bit more action as a result of these substitutions! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham make their second change of the evening as Jon Toral comes on in place of Alen Halilovic. That's a straight swap in midfield for the hosts by the looks of things. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Referee Tony Harrington blows for a foul on halfway as Birmingham break upfield and the hosts get the chance to pressure Swansea now by putting a long ball towards the box. The end result is that Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman collects the ball with ease. Not much in the way of entertainment in the second half so far, but I said that in the first half and look what happened there! Could do with another penalty to get things going again. Â© 2025 BBC.

Still no goals in this one, though. Also, to go back to the Get Involved post a few minutes ago, apparently we live in a world where 'chippy' isn't the given term for a fish and chip shop. What else would you call it? The Saturated Fat Emporium? Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Oof! Cracking save from Birmingham goalkeeper Neil Etheridge who dives to his left to keep out Yan Dhanda's free-kick. That was a sensational strike from the Swansea man and he's thwarted by the ex-Cardiff keeper. #bbcefl Roger:Just when did people start with chippy? Growing up, never heard that word. Matt Evans:I live in Orlando, FL now; can't find a good Chippy to save my life.
Jay, your update hits home.  (Or hits the Chippy sized gap left in it, anyway). For those of you who missed my tea updates earlier... I wasn't allowed anything from the 'Chippy' and had to go for the healthy option instead. As you may have guessed, it's pretty uneventful at St Andrew's. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea In years to come, I feel like this past 20 minutes of football will be the reason I give for why I no longer tolerate the sport. Less than 20 minutes remain for these two sides to prove future me wrong! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda replaces Korey Smith for Swansea who make their first change of the match so far. Fingers crossed there's a bit more action as a result of these substitutions! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham make their second change of the evening as Jon Toral comes on in place of Alen Halilovic. That's a straight swap in midfield for the hosts by the looks of things. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Referee Tony Harrington blows for a foul on halfway as Birmingham break upfield and the hosts get the chance to pressure Swansea now by putting a long ball towards the box. The end result is that Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman collects the ball with ease. Not much in the way of entertainment in the second half so far, but I said that in the first half and look what happened there! Could do with another penalty to get things going again. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sachin Tendulkar said he was experiencing mild symptoms after testing positive for Covid-19 Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, has been admitted to hospital. Tendulkar tweeted on Friday that he decided to go to a hospital in Mumbai ""as a matter of abundant precaution under medical advice"". The former captain, who is loved by millions, added that he was hoping to be back home in a few days. Several Indian cities, including Mumbai, have seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks. Tendulkar, 47, shared the news at a time when India is staring at what experts have called a ""deadlier second wave"". India reported 81,466 news cases and 469 deaths on Thursday - the highest daily spike since December. The country's Covid caseload had dropped sharply in January when it was reporting less than 15,000 cases daily. But cases began to spike again in March, largely driven by poor test-and-trace and lax safety protocols. Many of the new cases were reported in the western state of Maharashtra, where Tendulkar lives in the city of Mumbai. Since the pandemic began, India has confirmed more than 12.2 million cases and over 163,000 deaths. It has the third-highest number of infections in the world after the United States and Brazil - however, its number of deaths per capita is far lower. India has registered 118 deaths per million, compared to 1,487 in Brazil and 1,668 in the US. India launched its vaccination drive in January and so far more than 65 million doses have been administered. But experts say the pace needs to further pick up to halt the spread. Some have also attributed the uptick in numbers to a highly contagious variants of the coronavirus, but the government has denied this. Delhi orders Covid-19 tests at airports How many people has India vaccinated? What are the risks of India's new Covid-19 variant? The surge in cases comes during what some experts have calleda ""delicate phase"" of the pandemicfor India. States are now reintroducing restrictions to stem the spread of the virus. In his tweet, Tendulkar thanked his fans for their wishes and prayers. His fans and many of his former teammates have responded with prayers for his recovery. Allow Twitter content?

Nicknamed the Master Blaster, Tendulkar retired from cricket in 2013 but continues to be one of the most popular public figures in India. He recently took part in the Road Safety World Series Challenge, a veterans' tournament in the central Indian city of Raipur. He made his international debut aged 16 in November 1989, setting off an illustrious 24-year career that earned him global recognition. This video can not be played Sachin Tendulkar's career in 60 seconds In that time, he amassed a record 15,921 Test-match runs, the highest number by any batsman in cricket history. In 2012, Tendulkar became the only batsman ever to reach 100 international centuries. One of his most memorable Test centuries was an unbeaten 103 that inspired India's victory over England in December 2008, and came shortly after terror attacks hit his home city of Mumbai.

Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments around the world today. Teacher Karen Thorp wanted to find a way to thank NHS workers who saved her life when she spent six weeks in hospital with coronavirus last year, so she is buying more than 300 of them an Easter egg. The 52-year-old, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, says she wanted to ""celebrate"" her recovery, so raised Â£800 for staff at Watford Hospital as they ""deserve it"". In all 326 chocolate treats will be enjoyed by health workers and Â£521.50 is being donated toRAISE,external, a charity for hospitals in Hemel Hempstead, St Albans and Watford. Research shows some animals can catch the virus From the start of the pandemic, experts have shared their concerns about the impact of coronavirus on animals. And while scientists say there is currently no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. On Wednesday, Russia announced it has registered what it says is the world's first animal-specific jab. But are these really necessary?Here's what we know so far. Bahrain is to allow more than 100 prisoners to serve the remainder of their sentences out of prison, as protesters and rights groups voiced fears over Covid-19 spreading in jails, AFP reports. A total of 126 prisoners will serve the remainder of their sentences in an ""alternative"" or non-custodial setting, the public prosecution said in a statement. The released convicts will be monitored electronically. Officials said last week three people at the Jaw prison were infected with the virus. It said they had been isolated and were in a stable condition. But the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy says there have been dozens of infections among prisoners. ""If Bahrain's government is serious about tackling this outbreak, they should be fully transparent rather than undermining the seriousness of the situation at hand,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of BIRD, said in a statement last week. Nabeel Rajab, one of Bahrain's most prominent rights activists who was freed from jail last year, welcomed the government's decision. ""May it be a good omen,"" he tweeted. These graphs show the number of new coronavirus cases are levelling off in the UK and the death rate remains low. Meanwhile the UK's vaccination programme continues at speed. The Netherlands is halting AstraZeneca vaccines for under-60s after new reports of rare blood clots following vaccination, Dutch health authorities have said. ""The immediate cause for the decision are reports of cases of extensive thrombosis in combination with low platelet counts after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" the GGD public health service says. Nurses who were recruited from the Philippines due to a nursing shortage say they have ""no regrets"" after 20 years in north Wales. About 100 nurses came in 2001 and took up positions across the three main hospitals. The recruitment was seen at the time as a temporary measure and the nurses were given two-year contracts - but many stayed and built their lives in Wales. Joanne Canlas was 27 when she arrived as part of a cohort of 50 to take up a position at Wrexham Maelor hospital.

Republic with 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine. Sebastian Kurz's office it called a
display of solidarity after Austria felt the European Union had not done enough to assist its neighbour. EU ambassadors agreed on Thursday to change the bloc's vaccine distribution system for 10
million BioNTech-Pfizer doses due to be delivered in the second
quarter. This was in order to help countries that needed it more. Of those 10 million doses, 2.85 million so-called
""solidarity vaccines"" will be shared between Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia. Austria says it is ""incomprehensible"" the Czech Republic - which has been hit hard by the pandemic - was not given
more doses. ""We will... support the Czech Republic bilaterally with
30,000 doses of vaccine and believe it is very positive that we
have also heard that other European countries are prepared to do
the same,"" a statement by Kurz's office says. ""We do not want to accept that one of our neighbouring
countries is left behind,"" it adds. Staff at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea will go on strike for four days next week because of concerns over Covid cases among workers. The office has seen more than 500 cases since September andworkers voted to take industrial action last month. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union says its members will strike for four days from 6 April. The UK government has warned DVLA services will be affected and has been approached for further comment. PCS says it had been in ""intensive talks"" with the DVLA to try and address its members' health and safety concerns and avoid strike action, but will now be ""asking over 3,300 of our members in Swansea to go on strike to protect workers' safety"". We've got the full story here. Dybala insisted that the gathering ""wasn't a party"" Juventus players Paulo Dybala, Weston McKennie and Arthur Melo have been dropped for tomorrow's local derby with Torino after breaking Covid-19 rules by attending a dinner party, coach Andrea Pirlo says. The three stars were reported to have been fined by police who were called by neighbours to the party at McKennie's Turin home on Wednesday night. ""The three players concerned have not been selected, they will return to work at a later time, we'll see about when,"" Pirlo tells reporters ahead of the Serie A clash. ""It shouldn't happen, both because of what's going on in the world and what's happening with the team,"" he adds. Dybala has since apologised, but says he had simply ""stayed out for dinner"" and insisted the gathering ""wasn't a party"". Defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Merih Demiral will also be unavailable for the Italian champions after testing positive for the virus.

Susie ForrestScotland health producer, BBC Scotland The critical care unit at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow has seen more Covid-19 patients than any other in Scotland. Jen Dolan and the other specialist nurses have held the hands of many of them and they are still doing it. ""There is no feeling in the world like holding somebody's hand when their family can't be with them and their heart beats its last beat,"" she says. While the staff have got used to treating the virus the volume of patients has been ""like a tidal wave"", according to senior charge nurse Amanda Allan. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small says: ""I think people are coping, but we're not dealing with it. ""We're dealing with things completely differently, and I think the psychological impact will be massive."" Read more from Queen Elizabeth University Hospital's front-line staffhere. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There has been an outbreak in the Chinese border city of Ruili Life has
largely returned to normal in China, although an outbreak in the city of Ruili,
which borders Myanmar, has thrown hundreds of thousands of people back into
lockdown this week. China has been
strict about implementing lockdown measures as soon as a single case is
identified. Consequently, schools and all but essential businesses have closed
in the city, which has a population of about 210,000. Mass testing is being
carried out throughout Ruili, and today has been extended to border counties
and cities. So far,
16 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 have been reported since Wednesday, and
roughly three times as many asymptomatic cases. Despite this
latest outbreak, within the next couple of weeks China is set to surpass the US
and become the country that has carried out the most vaccinations in the
world. So far, 126
million vaccine doses have been administered in China. The countryâs national Global Times newspaper says the country now has
capacity to carry out 10 million vaccine doses daily. This means, in theory, it could inoculate a billion people within 100 days. China is accelerating its vaccination programme as it has aims to vaccine 40% of its 1.4bn population by the end of June â that equates to it carrying out 560 million vaccinations. To date, it has largely prioritised vaccinating people in the 18-59
years of age category, but as of today, it has expanded its vaccination drive
to begin targeting people over the age of 60 Sheffield Wednesday manager Darren Moore is missing the Owls' trip to Watford this afternoonafter testing positive for Covid-19. The club has confirmed he is not at the match as he is isolating. Assistant Jamie Smith is leading Wednesday, who are six points adrift of safety in the  Championship, in Moore's absence - and they are currently 1-0 down. Germany has suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for under-60s, after the German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot out of 2.7 million people who had received the jab. The European Medicines Agency and the UK's regulatory body, MHRA, have said there is no indication the vaccine is linked to blood clots. Despite this, Angela Merkel has insisted Germany will still offer every adult a vaccine by the end of the summer. Jenny Hill went to see how the vaccine was made. This video can not be played Covid 19: Inside the BioNTech vaccine factory in Germany The US economy saw a surge in hiring in March as vaccination spreads, officials loosened restrictions and people pushed to return to their pre-pandemic activities. Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by reopenings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the pandemic. The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020. The US has approved trillions in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) package last month, to shield households and businesses from the disruption. Read more here.

Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There has been an outbreak in the Chinese border city of Ruili Life has
largely returned to normal in China, although an outbreak in the city of Ruili,
which borders Myanmar, has thrown hundreds of thousands of people back into
lockdown this week. China has been
strict about implementing lockdown measures as soon as a single case is
identified. Consequently, schools and all but essential businesses have closed
in the city, which has a population of about 210,000. Mass testing is being
carried out throughout Ruili, and today has been extended to border counties
and cities. So far,
16 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 have been reported since Wednesday, and
roughly three times as many asymptomatic cases. Despite this
latest outbreak, within the next couple of weeks China is set to surpass the US
and become the country that has carried out the most vaccinations in the
world. So far, 126
million vaccine doses have been administered in China. The countryâs national Global Times newspaper says the country now has
capacity to carry out 10 million vaccine doses daily. This means, in theory, it could inoculate a billion people within 100 days. China is accelerating its vaccination programme as it has aims to vaccine 40% of its 1.4bn population by the end of June â that equates to it carrying out 560 million vaccinations. To date, it has largely prioritised vaccinating people in the 18-59
years of age category, but as of today, it has expanded its vaccination drive
to begin targeting people over the age of 60 Sheffield Wednesday manager Darren Moore is missing the Owls' trip to Watford this afternoonafter testing positive for Covid-19.

Assistant Jamie Smith is leading Wednesday, who are six points adrift of safety in the  Championship, in Moore's absence - and they are currently 1-0 down. Germany has suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for under-60s, after the German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot out of 2.7 million people who had received the jab. The European Medicines Agency and the UK's regulatory body, MHRA, have said there is no indication the vaccine is linked to blood clots. Despite this, Angela Merkel has insisted Germany will still offer every adult a vaccine by the end of the summer. Jenny Hill went to see how the vaccine was made. This video can not be played Covid 19: Inside the BioNTech vaccine factory in Germany The US economy saw a surge in hiring in March as vaccination spreads, officials loosened restrictions and people pushed to return to their pre-pandemic activities. Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by reopenings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the pandemic. The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020. The US has approved trillions in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) package last month, to shield households and businesses from the disruption. Read more here.

"A risk document from the hospital said its roofing was a risk to patient's lives A hospital roof held up by props poses a ""direct risk to the life and safety of patients"", board papers said. Despite the 131 supports at Norfolk's Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH), the ""potential of catastrophic failure of the roof"" remains,the papers revealed,external. The government said the hospital had been given ""over Â£20m to directly address the most immediate issues"". In a letter, leaked to the BBC, its deputy chief executive says ""more than short-term fixes are needed"". Laura Skaife-Knight wrote to tell governors that the hospital trust was doing ""all it can"" to secure funding for a new hospital in King's Lynn. The letter details the measures that have been taken to support the ageing roof, and says that since January, a further 50 props have been put up in 16 different areas. There are 131 props in use across the hospital, including in areas such as critical care and maternity It said the latest problems caused by the roofing had closed the hospital's critical care unit, though Ms Skaife-Knight wrote that it would soon reopen following a two-week closure for repairs. The hospital trust was recently awarded Â£20.6m by the government to ""fund the short-term fixes and improvements needed as surveys identify failings with the roof planks and rapid deterioration of the hospital's estate"", said the letter. Ms Skaife-Knight said that would ""improve safety in the years to come ""but would not ""replace the roof planks or extend the life of the hospital beyond 2030"". The trust has bid for Â£165m over three years to help improve the safety of the hospital estate in the short-term. That included Â£45m in year one, towards which the Â£20.6m was awarded. It would cost Â£554m over the next 10 years to make repairs to the existing hospital building, said its chief executive However, Ms Skaife-Knight wrote that the trust had developed ""a strong case"" for a new hospital. She said living with the risk at the current hospital would cost Â£554m over 10 years, while a new building would cost around Â£679m but come with additional benefits to meet ""modern healthcare requirements"". Queen Elizabeth Hospital was not selected as one of 40 hospitals included in aÂ£3.7bn building package announced by the government in October last year. Ms Skaife-Knight told governors: ""We know that there will be funding to build a further eight new or part-new hospitals by 2030 and that these will be announced in autumn 2021. ""QEH is doing all it can to position the trust to be one of these further eight hospitals."" How is the plan for 48 hospitals going? Hospital 'needs Â£1.1bn to realise rebuild plans' Government plans billions for hospital projects A risk register within the board meeting agenda reads: ""There is a direct risk of life and safety to patients, visitors and staff of the trust due to the potential of catastrophic failure of the roof structure due to structural deficiencies."" It said this was because the pre-cast concrete construction of the building was 40 years old, despite only being built to last 25 years, and rated the risk as ""very high/extreme"". The Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised ""the need to invest in improving health infrastructure across the country, including where trusts have identified significant issues"", and cited the money awarded to the QEH already. A spokesman said criteria for the further eight schemes to be included in the New Hospitals Programme would be announced shortly. A spokeswoman for the hospital said: ""We have a team permanently on site to systematically check and manage our buildings and to act on any work that might be needed, and we are treating patients safely, as normal."" She added that ""a major incident"" has not been declared and it has received ""investment to support us with the maintenance of our estate, and we have an ongoing programme of estates work underway including monitoring and safety checking of the roof"".

"BBC journalist Jennifer Meierhans, left, and friend Lucy Burn discovered the problem pricing when they happened to buy the same coat from different stores Online retailer Boohoo is investigating why the same items of clothing were sold for higher prices across a number of its fashion labels. The BBC discovered that Dorothy Perkins and Coast, which are both owned by Boohoo, sold exactly the same coat but it cost Â£34 more at Coast. There are price disparities across a range of Boohoo brands, which also include Oasis and Warehouse. Boohoo said the ""miscommunication was not intentional"". ""All Boohoo group brands work independently, and so this miscommunication was not intentional as teams are not privy to what's being bought and sold across the other group brands,"" a spokeswoman for Boohoo said. ""Our internal investigation continues and we will be re-pricing all the crossover stock to be aligned."" The price disparity was revealed after reporter Jennifer Meierhans bought a coat from Coast - as a friend happened to buy the exact same coat from Dorothy Perkins. The care label in the coat sold by Coast appears to have had the branding cut off The Dorothy Perkins branding appeared to have been cut from the care label in the coat sold by Coast. Boohoo said the coat was first sold by Coast and has now been re-priced at Â£17 on both brands' websites. Catherine Erdly, founder of The Resilient Retail Club consultancy, and a former senior merchandiser at Coast, said: ""If all Boohoo are going to do is buy the same stuff and slap different prices on it then it's destroying that brand's identity."" She said that while each brand will have its own ""architecture"" for setting prices, it is likely Coast and Dorothy Perkins had benefited from some kind of trading ""opportunity"", where a supplier had stock and both companies needed coats. ""But if they're going to do things like that, they didn't do it in a clever way,"" Ms Erdly said. ""The customer will sense that it's just trying to get as much as possible out of them."" She added: ""There's no way a Coast garment could have sold at Â£17 without losing money, a garment made for the Coast brand would cost more than that to make."" There are a number of instances where the same item of clothing is priced differently across Boohoo's brands. A long ""luxe"" padded coat in the colour mushroom was originally sold forÂ£89 at Oasis,externalandÂ£65 at Dorothy Perkins,external. The same coat in khaki was in the sale forÂ£30 in Warehouse,externalandÂ£66.75 in Coast,externaluntil the BBC brought the matter to Boohoo's attention. They are now both priced at Â£18. Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at consumer watchdog Which?, said loyal customers of these brands will be ""shocked and disappointed to see these stark price differences between seemingly identical items of clothing"". She said: ""People choose brands and stay loyal by expecting quality to match the prices they pay. ""Brands that offer a first-class customer experience and can be trusted are the ones that come out on top in our retailer surveys. This practice from Boohoo could risk undermining trust with customers."" Boohoo operates a number of different brands after buying up businesses when their owners fell into administration. Boohoobought Coast's online business in 2019along with sister brand Karen Millen. While in February, it acquired Dorothy Perkins, together with Wallis and Burton, from failed retail group Arcadia for Â£25.2m Boohoo said: ""Stock of the item in question was purchased and live on site by Coast prior to The Boohoo Group's acquisition of the Dorothy Perkins brand.""

Teacher Karen Thorp wanted to find a way to thank NHS workers who saved her life when she spent six weeks in hospital with coronavirus last year, so she is buying more than 300 of them an Easter egg. The 52-year-old, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, says she wanted to ""celebrate"" her recovery, so raised Â£800 for staff at Watford Hospital as they ""deserve it"".

Research shows some animals can catch the virus From the start of the pandemic, experts have shared their concerns about the impact of coronavirus on animals. And while scientists say there is currently no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. On Wednesday, Russia announced it has registered what it says is the world's first animal-specific jab. But are these really necessary?Here's what we know so far. Bahrain is to allow more than 100 prisoners to serve the remainder of their sentences out of prison, as protesters and rights groups voiced fears over Covid-19 spreading in jails, AFP reports. A total of 126 prisoners will serve the remainder of their sentences in an ""alternative"" or non-custodial setting, the public prosecution said in a statement. The released convicts will be monitored electronically. Officials said last week three people at the Jaw prison were infected with the virus. It said they had been isolated and were in a stable condition. But the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy says there have been dozens of infections among prisoners. ""If Bahrain's government is serious about tackling this outbreak, they should be fully transparent rather than undermining the seriousness of the situation at hand,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of BIRD, said in a statement last week. Nabeel Rajab, one of Bahrain's most prominent rights activists who was freed from jail last year, welcomed the government's decision. ""May it be a good omen,"" he tweeted. These graphs show the number of new coronavirus cases are levelling off in the UK and the death rate remains low. Meanwhile the UK's vaccination programme continues at speed. The Netherlands is halting AstraZeneca vaccines for under-60s after new reports of rare blood clots following vaccination, Dutch health authorities have said. ""The immediate cause for the decision are reports of cases of extensive thrombosis in combination with low platelet counts after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" the GGD public health service says. Nurses who were recruited from the Philippines due to a nursing shortage say they have ""no regrets"" after 20 years in north Wales. About 100 nurses came in 2001 and took up positions across the three main hospitals. The recruitment was seen at the time as a temporary measure and the nurses were given two-year contracts - but many stayed and built their lives in Wales.

Republic with 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine. Sebastian Kurz's office it called a
display of solidarity after Austria felt the European Union had not done enough to assist its neighbour. EU ambassadors agreed on Thursday to change the bloc's vaccine distribution system for 10
million BioNTech-Pfizer doses due to be delivered in the second
quarter. This was in order to help countries that needed it more. Of those 10 million doses, 2.85 million so-called
""solidarity vaccines"" will be shared between Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia. Austria says it is ""incomprehensible"" the Czech Republic - which has been hit hard by the pandemic - was not given
more doses. ""We will... support the Czech Republic bilaterally with
30,000 doses of vaccine and believe it is very positive that we
have also heard that other European countries are prepared to do
the same,"" a statement by Kurz's office says. ""We do not want to accept that one of our neighbouring
countries is left behind,"" it adds. Staff at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea will go on strike for four days next week because of concerns over Covid cases among workers.

largely returned to normal in China, although an outbreak in the city of Ruili,
which borders Myanmar, has thrown hundreds of thousands of people back into
lockdown this week. China has been
strict about implementing lockdown measures as soon as a single case is
identified. Consequently, schools and all but essential businesses have closed
in the city, which has a population of about 210,000. Mass testing is being
carried out throughout Ruili, and today has been extended to border counties
and cities. So far,
16 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 have been reported since Wednesday, and
roughly three times as many asymptomatic cases. Despite this
latest outbreak, within the next couple of weeks China is set to surpass the US
and become the country that has carried out the most vaccinations in the
world. So far, 126
million vaccine doses have been administered in China. The countryâs national Global Times newspaper says the country now has
capacity to carry out 10 million vaccine doses daily. This means, in theory, it could inoculate a billion people within 100 days. China is accelerating its vaccination programme as it has aims to vaccine 40% of its 1.4bn population by the end of June â that equates to it carrying out 560 million vaccinations. To date, it has largely prioritised vaccinating people in the 18-59

Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by reopenings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the pandemic. The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020. The US has approved trillions in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) package last month, to shield households and businesses from the disruption. Read more here.

"The link between gaming loot boxes and problem gambling has been ""robustly verified"", according to a new report. The report, carried out by researchers at the universities of Plymouth and Wolverhampton, found that loot boxes ""are structurally and psychologically akin to gambling"". It also found that large numbers of children are opening loot boxes. The UK government is already considering whether gambling laws should cover such loot boxes. The upcoming Gambling Act review is set to look at the question, with the UK'sHouse of Lords already having weighed in to say that loot boxes should be firmly regulatedas ""games of chance"". Loot boxes are a video game feature involving a sealed mystery ""box"" - sometimes earned through playing the game and sometimes paid for with real money - which can be opened for a random collection of in-game items such as weapons or cosmetic costumes. The new research,external, commissioned by the GambleAware charity, compiles existing research to examine the strength of links between the in-game random prizes and gambling behaviour. It found: Of the 93% of children who play video games, up to 40% opened loot boxes About 5% of gamers generate half the entire revenue from the boxes Twelve out of 13 studies on the topic have established ""unambiguous"" connections to problem gambling behaviour Young men are the most likely to use loot boxes - with young age and lower education correlating with increased uses The report said that many games use a ""psychological nudge"" to encourage people to buy loot boxes - such as the fear of missing out on limited-time items or special deals. ""Many gamers do ascribe discrete financial values to loot box contents - based on purchase or resale price - suggesting that many loot boxes meet existing criteria for gambling regulation,"" the authors wrote. The big spenders - the crucial 5% for the industry - can spend more than Â£70 or $100 a month on the boxes, the report said. But those are not necessarily wealthy people who earn lots of money. ""Our research therefore demonstrates that games developers, unwittingly or not, appear to be generating outsized loot box profits from at-risk individuals (these are likely to include both people with gambling problems or problematic patterns of video gaming) - but not from wealthy gamers,"" it concluded. 'The kids emptied our bank account playing Fifa' Loot boxes: I blew my parents' savings EA: 'Loot boxes aren't gambling' Among the authors' recommendations were that any regulation has extremely precise definitions to avoid any possible workarounds; that loot boxes are included in game labelling and age ratings; that the odds of winning items be clearly shown including the average cost of enough boxes to obtain a rare item; establishing spending limits; and more.

"Kenya, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines are being added to England's travel ban ""red list"" It means travellers from those countries will be banned from entering England from 9 April The coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, in England is between 0.8 and 1, latest figures show Last week the whole of the UK had an estimated R figure of between 0.7 and 0.9 Another 52 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have been recorded in the UK More than 70 MPs have launched a campaign opposing Covid passports in England, amid reports of pilots to test how they would work The Netherlands is halting AstraZeneca vaccines for under-60s after new reports of rare blood clots following vaccination Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, has been admitted to hospital The stay at home rule which has been in place in Scotland for more than three months has been lifted West End theatres and Glastonbury Festival are among those getting a share of Â£400m emergency government culture funding Edited by James Clarke That's all from the live page for today but we'll be back again tomorrow. Today's coronavirus news has been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, George Wright, Jennifer Meierhans and James Clarke. Police forces across England have called for people to obey coronavirus restrictions over the bank holiday weekend We are going to be bringing our live page updates to a close soon so here's a recap on what's been happening in the UK:  Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has been admitted to hospital We're close to winding up the live page for the day, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments around the world today. Teacher Karen Thorp wanted to find a way to thank NHS workers who saved her life when she spent six weeks in hospital with coronavirus last year, so she is buying more than 300 of them an Easter egg. The 52-year-old, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, says she wanted to ""celebrate"" her recovery, so raised Â£800 for staff at Watford Hospital as they ""deserve it"". In all 326 chocolate treats will be enjoyed by health workers and Â£521.50 is being donated toRAISE,external, a charity for hospitals in Hemel Hempstead, St Albans and Watford. Research shows some animals can catch the virus From the start of the pandemic, experts have shared their concerns about the impact of coronavirus on animals. And while scientists say there is currently no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. On Wednesday, Russia announced it has registered what it says is the world's first animal-specific jab. But are these really necessary?Here's what we know so far. Bahrain is to allow more than 100 prisoners to serve the remainder of their sentences out of prison, as protesters and rights groups voiced fears over Covid-19 spreading in jails, AFP reports. A total of 126 prisoners will serve the remainder of their sentences in an ""alternative"" or non-custodial setting, the public prosecution said in a statement. The released convicts will be monitored electronically. Officials said last week three people at the Jaw prison were infected with the virus. It said they had been isolated and were in a stable condition. But the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy says there have been dozens of infections among prisoners. ""If Bahrain's government is serious about tackling this outbreak, they should be fully transparent rather than undermining the seriousness of the situation at hand,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of BIRD, said in a statement last week. Nabeel Rajab, one of Bahrain's most prominent rights activists who was freed from jail last year, welcomed the government's decision. ""May it be a good omen,"" he tweeted. These graphs show the number of new coronavirus cases are levelling off in the UK and the death rate remains low. Meanwhile the UK's vaccination programme continues at speed. The Netherlands is halting AstraZeneca vaccines for under-60s after new reports of rare blood clots following vaccination, Dutch health authorities have said. ""The immediate cause for the decision are reports of cases of extensive thrombosis in combination with low platelet counts after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" the GGD public health service says. Nurses who were recruited from the Philippines due to a nursing shortage say they have ""no regrets"" after 20 years in north Wales. About 100 nurses came in 2001 and took up positions across the three main hospitals. The recruitment was seen at the time as a temporary measure and the nurses were given two-year contracts - but many stayed and built their lives in Wales. Joanne Canlas was 27 when she arrived as part of a cohort of 50 to take up a position at Wrexham Maelor hospital. This video can not be played Philippine nurses 'became part of the NHS family' in Wales Sebastian Kurz The Austrian Chancellor has said his country will provide the Czech
Republic with 30,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine. Sebastian Kurz's office it called a
display of solidarity after Austria felt the European Union had not done enough to assist its neighbour. EU ambassadors agreed on Thursday to change the bloc's vaccine distribution system for 10
million BioNTech-Pfizer doses due to be delivered in the second
quarter. This was in order to help countries that needed it more. Of those 10 million doses, 2.85 million so-called
""solidarity vaccines"" will be shared between Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia. Austria says it is ""incomprehensible"" the Czech Republic - which has been hit hard by the pandemic - was not given
more doses. ""We will... support the Czech Republic bilaterally with
30,000 doses of vaccine and believe it is very positive that we
have also heard that other European countries are prepared to do
the same,"" a statement by Kurz's office says. ""We do not want to accept that one of our neighbouring
countries is left behind,"" it adds. Staff at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea will go on strike for four days next week because of concerns over Covid cases among workers. The office has seen more than 500 cases since September andworkers voted to take industrial action last month. The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union says its members will strike for four days from 6 April. The UK government has warned DVLA services will be affected and has been approached for further comment. PCS says it had been in ""intensive talks"" with the DVLA to try and address its members' health and safety concerns and avoid strike action, but will now be ""asking over 3,300 of our members in Swansea to go on strike to protect workers' safety"". We've got the full story here. Dybala insisted that the gathering ""wasn't a party"" Juventus players Paulo Dybala, Weston McKennie and Arthur Melo have been dropped for tomorrow's local derby with Torino after breaking Covid-19 rules by attending a dinner party, coach Andrea Pirlo says. The three stars were reported to have been fined by police who were called by neighbours to the party at McKennie's Turin home on Wednesday night. ""The three players concerned have not been selected, they will return to work at a later time, we'll see about when,"" Pirlo tells reporters ahead of the Serie A clash. ""It shouldn't happen, both because of what's going on in the world and what's happening with the team,"" he adds. Dybala has since apologised, but says he had simply ""stayed out for dinner"" and insisted the gathering ""wasn't a party"". Defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Merih Demiral will also be unavailable for the Italian champions after testing positive for the virus. A total of 31,301,267 people have received their first coronavirus vaccination in the UK,according to government figures,external, an increase of 153,823 since yesterday's figures. And 4,948,635 people have received their second dose - up by 435,177 since 24 hours ago. Find out when you will get the vaccine. As with the figures for cases and deaths, today's statistics are so far only for England, Northern Ireland and Scotland - there is no data reported for Wales yet. The UK has recorded a further 52 coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24 hours,government figures show.,external It brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 126,816. There were also 3,402 new infections reported. But today's statistics are so far only for England, Northern Ireland and Scotland - there is no data reported for Wales yet. Susie ForrestScotland health producer, BBC Scotland The critical care unit at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow has seen more Covid-19 patients than any other in Scotland. Jen Dolan and the other specialist nurses have held the hands of many of them and they are still doing it. ""There is no feeling in the world like holding somebody's hand when their family can't be with them and their heart beats its last beat,"" she says. While the staff have got used to treating the virus the volume of patients has been ""like a tidal wave"", according to senior charge nurse Amanda Allan. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small says: ""I think people are coping, but we're not dealing with it. ""We're dealing with things completely differently, and I think the psychological impact will be massive."" Read more from Queen Elizabeth University Hospital's front-line staffhere. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There has been an outbreak in the Chinese border city of Ruili Life has
largely returned to normal in China, although an outbreak in the city of Ruili,
which borders Myanmar, has thrown hundreds of thousands of people back into
lockdown this week. China has been
strict about implementing lockdown measures as soon as a single case is
identified. Consequently, schools and all but essential businesses have closed
in the city, which has a population of about 210,000. Mass testing is being
carried out throughout Ruili, and today has been extended to border counties
and cities. So far,
16 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 have been reported since Wednesday, and
roughly three times as many asymptomatic cases. Despite this
latest outbreak, within the next couple of weeks China is set to surpass the US
and become the country that has carried out the most vaccinations in the
world. So far, 126
million vaccine doses have been administered in China. The countryâs national Global Times newspaper says the country now has
capacity to carry out 10 million vaccine doses daily. This means, in theory, it could inoculate a billion people within 100 days. China is accelerating its vaccination programme as it has aims to vaccine 40% of its 1.4bn population by the end of June â that equates to it carrying out 560 million vaccinations. To date, it has largely prioritised vaccinating people in the 18-59
years of age category, but as of today, it has expanded its vaccination drive
to begin targeting people over the age of 60 Sheffield Wednesday manager Darren Moore is missing the Owls' trip to Watford this afternoonafter testing positive for Covid-19. The club has confirmed he is not at the match as he is isolating.

FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea A third defeat in a row means Swansea will probably have to settle for a play-off place. They're nine points behind Watford in second. FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea Birmingham are now six points clear of the drop zone. Massive win for Lee Bowyer's men. FT: Birmingham 1-0 Swansea Can you imagine what that finale would have been like if fans were in the ground?! What a finish. Birmingham 1-0 Swansea A huge three points for Birmingham who pull off a cracker of a win against Swansea. Scott Hogan's penalty, after Lukas Jutkiewicz missed from the spot earlier on, seals it for the hosts. Birmingham 1-0 Swansea Now, I know this isn't about me, but did I get my crystal ball out (which, as I say, I carry at all times) and wish for a dramatic late goal OR DID I NOT?! No need to thank me, everyone. When I want goals, I make it so. Scott Hogan Huge! Scott Hoganfires it from the spot right into the corner and there's nothing Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman can do this time. Birmingham might just have sealed an absolutely massive three points in their battle for Championship survival. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea ANOTHER Birmingham penalty! Yan Dhanda appears to catch Ivan Sunjic and the hosts have another chance to win it! Three minutes given, by the way. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Another Birmingham change. Rekeem Harper, the West Bromwich Albion loanee, is sent on in place of Gary Gardner for the final few minutes. Not long left now. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Righto, I've whipped out my crystal ball (which I keep with me at all times) and I've told the powers that be that we want a dramatic late goal. Meanwhile, as I get all Mystic Meg on this game, Jamal Lowe comes off for Swansea and is replaced by Wayne Routledge. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham last kept a clean sheet at home back in November against Millwall. They have around five minutes left to hold on for what could be a valuable point come the end-of-season run-in. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Another Birmingham change. Scott Hogan and Sam Cosgrove come on for Jonathan Leko and Lukas Jutkiewicz. Just under 10 minutes remain. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Jamal Lowe has been in the mix for Swansea time after time tonight and he's just won a corner for the visitors. Matt Grimes whips it in towards the far post and Birmingham win a free-kick. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda's looked very lively for Swansea since his come on and he's had several attacks upfield which has kept the Birmingham defence busy. Still no goals in this one, though. Also, to go back to the Get Involved post a few minutes ago, apparently we live in a world where 'chippy' isn't the given term for a fish and chip shop. What else would you call it? The Saturated Fat Emporium? Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Oof! Cracking save from Birmingham goalkeeper Neil Etheridge who dives to his left to keep out Yan Dhanda's free-kick. That was a sensational strike from the Swansea man and he's thwarted by the ex-Cardiff keeper. #bbcefl Roger:Just when did people start with chippy? Growing up, never heard that word. Matt Evans:I live in Orlando, FL now; can't find a good Chippy to save my life.
Jay, your update hits home.  (Or hits the Chippy sized gap left in it, anyway). For those of you who missed my tea updates earlier... I wasn't allowed anything from the 'Chippy' and had to go for the healthy option instead. As you may have guessed, it's pretty uneventful at St Andrew's. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea In years to come, I feel like this past 20 minutes of football will be the reason I give for why I no longer tolerate the sport. Less than 20 minutes remain for these two sides to prove future me wrong! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda replaces Korey Smith for Swansea who make their first change of the match so far. Fingers crossed there's a bit more action as a result of these substitutions! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham make their second change of the evening as Jon Toral comes on in place of Alen Halilovic. That's a straight swap in midfield for the hosts by the looks of things. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Referee Tony Harrington blows for a foul on halfway as Birmingham break upfield and the hosts get the chance to pressure Swansea now by putting a long ball towards the box. The end result is that Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman collects the ball with ease. Not much in the way of entertainment in the second half so far, but I said that in the first half and look what happened there! Could do with another penalty to get things going again. Â© 2025 BBC.

Rekeem Harper, the West Bromwich Albion loanee, is sent on in place of Gary Gardner for the final few minutes. Not long left now. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Righto, I've whipped out my crystal ball (which I keep with me at all times) and I've told the powers that be that we want a dramatic late goal. Meanwhile, as I get all Mystic Meg on this game, Jamal Lowe comes off for Swansea and is replaced by Wayne Routledge. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham last kept a clean sheet at home back in November against Millwall. They have around five minutes left to hold on for what could be a valuable point come the end-of-season run-in. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Another Birmingham change. Scott Hogan and Sam Cosgrove come on for Jonathan Leko and Lukas Jutkiewicz. Just under 10 minutes remain. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Jamal Lowe has been in the mix for Swansea time after time tonight and he's just won a corner for the visitors. Matt Grimes whips it in towards the far post and Birmingham win a free-kick. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda's looked very lively for Swansea since his come on and he's had several attacks upfield which has kept the Birmingham defence busy. Still no goals in this one, though. Also, to go back to the Get Involved post a few minutes ago, apparently we live in a world where 'chippy' isn't the given term for a fish and chip shop. What else would you call it? The Saturated Fat Emporium? Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Oof! Cracking save from Birmingham goalkeeper Neil Etheridge who dives to his left to keep out Yan Dhanda's free-kick. That was a sensational strike from the Swansea man and he's thwarted by the ex-Cardiff keeper. #bbcefl Roger:Just when did people start with chippy? Growing up, never heard that word. Matt Evans:I live in Orlando, FL now; can't find a good Chippy to save my life.
Jay, your update hits home.  (Or hits the Chippy sized gap left in it, anyway). For those of you who missed my tea updates earlier... I wasn't allowed anything from the 'Chippy' and had to go for the healthy option instead. As you may have guessed, it's pretty uneventful at St Andrew's. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea In years to come, I feel like this past 20 minutes of football will be the reason I give for why I no longer tolerate the sport. Less than 20 minutes remain for these two sides to prove future me wrong! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Yan Dhanda replaces Korey Smith for Swansea who make their first change of the match so far. Fingers crossed there's a bit more action as a result of these substitutions! Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Birmingham make their second change of the evening as Jon Toral comes on in place of Alen Halilovic. That's a straight swap in midfield for the hosts by the looks of things. Birmingham 0-0 Swansea Referee Tony Harrington blows for a foul on halfway as Birmingham break upfield and the hosts get the chance to pressure Swansea now by putting a long ball towards the box. The end result is that Swansea keeper Freddie Woodman collects the ball with ease. Not much in the way of entertainment in the second half so far, but I said that in the first half and look what happened there! Could do with another penalty to get things going again. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The link between gaming loot boxes and problem gambling has been ""robustly verified"", according to a new report. The report, carried out by researchers at the universities of Plymouth and Wolverhampton, found that loot boxes ""are structurally and psychologically akin to gambling"". It also found that large numbers of children are opening loot boxes. The UK government is already considering whether gambling laws should cover such loot boxes. The upcoming Gambling Act review is set to look at the question, with the UK'sHouse of Lords already having weighed in to say that loot boxes should be firmly regulatedas ""games of chance"". Loot boxes are a video game feature involving a sealed mystery ""box"" - sometimes earned through playing the game and sometimes paid for with real money - which can be opened for a random collection of in-game items such as weapons or cosmetic costumes. The new research,external, commissioned by the GambleAware charity, compiles existing research to examine the strength of links between the in-game random prizes and gambling behaviour. It found: Of the 93% of children who play video games, up to 40% opened loot boxes About 5% of gamers generate half the entire revenue from the boxes Twelve out of 13 studies on the topic have established ""unambiguous"" connections to problem gambling behaviour Young men are the most likely to use loot boxes - with young age and lower education correlating with increased uses The report said that many games use a ""psychological nudge"" to encourage people to buy loot boxes - such as the fear of missing out on limited-time items or special deals. ""Many gamers do ascribe discrete financial values to loot box contents - based on purchase or resale price - suggesting that many loot boxes meet existing criteria for gambling regulation,"" the authors wrote. The big spenders - the crucial 5% for the industry - can spend more than Â£70 or $100 a month on the boxes, the report said. But those are not necessarily wealthy people who earn lots of money. ""Our research therefore demonstrates that games developers, unwittingly or not, appear to be generating outsized loot box profits from at-risk individuals (these are likely to include both people with gambling problems or problematic patterns of video gaming) - but not from wealthy gamers,"" it concluded. 'The kids emptied our bank account playing Fifa' Loot boxes: I blew my parents' savings EA: 'Loot boxes aren't gambling' Among the authors' recommendations were that any regulation has extremely precise definitions to avoid any possible workarounds; that loot boxes are included in game labelling and age ratings; that the odds of winning items be clearly shown including the average cost of enough boxes to obtain a rare item; establishing spending limits; and more. Dr James Close, one of the report's authors from the University of Plymouth, said the study had established the link between loot boxes and ""problem gambling behaviours"". ""We have also demonstrated that at-risk individuals, such as problem gamblers, gamers, and young people, make disproportionate contributions to loot box revenues,"" he added. GambleAware's chief Zoe Osmond said the charity was ""increasingly concerned that gambling is now part of everyday life for children and young people"". ""It is now for politicians to review this research, as well as the evidence of other organisations, and decide what legislative and regulatory changes are needed to address these concerns,"" she said. A spokesman for Ukie, the national games industry body, said that game companies had ""already taken action"" on the issue. ""Probability disclosure has already been introduced to the major game platforms; a new paid random item descriptor was added to the PEGI age rating system to inform players of their presence in games; settings and tools on all major game devices - and in a number of leading games - already allow players to manage, limit or turn off spend,"" he said.

"Amy-Claire Davies said she and other shielders in Wales feel anxious about going outside People who have been shielding could become ""prisoners in their homes"" due to a loss of confidence after months indoors, an expert has said. Dr Deborah Morgan,a leading specialist on loneliness,external, said a ""national strategy"" was needed to help people reintegrate into their communities. The Welsh government said on Wednesday that138,500 people shielding in Wales would no longer need to. However, they have been advised to limit their contact and work from home. Amy-Claire Davies, 26, has been shielding with her parents in Swansea since the start of the pandemic. Medically, she is extremely vulnerable. She is living with a life-limiting condition which means she suffers multiple agonising spasms. Who has been shielding and why? Shielding woman's Covid jab 'feels like Christmas' 'I've only left my home five times this year' She feels anxious about going outside, a fear she said was shared by other young people like her living with life-limiting conditions. She said: ""I think I'd struggle going anywhere that was particularly crowded, I would get quite anxious about that, because it's been ingrained as a survival instinct over the past year and I haven't been in a crowded space for the past year. It would be quite overwhelming. ""A lot of the young people I know are at a real risk of struggling to go back out into the world in the way that we were before."" That concern is shared by experts who think some people might never leave their homes again unless they get help. Dr Deborah Morgan said young people are ""just too fearful to go back out again"" Dr Morgan, from the Centre for Innovative Ageing at Swansea University, said without the right support they might find a return to the outside world too daunting. She said: ""When we talk to younger people, as well as older people, about this experience that's just the way they're feeling, they're just too fearful to go back out again. ""These are people who have been very active in social groups and have been part of their communities but they're now really fearful of going back out there. ""We have an economic strategy about how we're going to recover from this, and I really think we need a strategy for the social aspect of this, not just the economic."" Work is already ongoing to introduce some of the most vulnerable groups to life in a world with face masks, social distancing and contactless payment. The Get There Together project is a Wales-wide NHS project designed to show people with dementia what the world looks like now. A series of films and written resources have been produced in English and Welsh showing how shops, libraries and public transport has adapted since the start of the pandemic. Dr Natalie Elliott said the pandemic has had a huge impact on people living with dementia Dr Natalie Elliott is the allied health professional lead for dementia at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and is leading the project. ""The feedback we were getting from people with dementia is that they were very fearful of going back out into the community,"" she said. ""One of the ideas we had was would it be useful to create resources, video clips walking people through visits to places in their communities showing what it is like and what safety measures are there to support people and this allows people to rehearse at home, perhaps with the support of a family member or carer to go through and prepare to feel ready to go out."" The Welsh government said: ""Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have worked tirelessly alongside the voluntary and third sector to co-ordinate support to a wide range of vulnerable groups. They will continue to play an important role in supporting the most vulnerable in our communities. ""During the pandemic we have introduced a number of new initiatives to support vulnerable people, including a national telephone befriending service for older people and the Looking Out For Each Other Safely campaign, which provides advice about how to stay in contact to prevent feelings of loneliness or isolation.""

"The last remaining fragment of intact peat mire in the South-West Leading garden retailers are still failing to stop the sale of peat in compost despite pressure from the government and campaigners. The Wildlife Trusts said only one of 20 retailers contacted said it would eliminate peat from its shelves this year. The restoration of peatlands is a key part of the government's strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change. Highly absorbent, it also helps with flood prevention. However, one peat producer told the BBC that since lockdown there had been a surge in interest in gardening. Demand for peat was ""unprecedented"" and there was currently no viable alternative. About 10 years ago, the UK government drew up a voluntary agreement for retailers to phase out sales of peat. Peatlands are a carbon ""sink"", which means they soak up carbon dioxide helping combat human-driven climate change. UK peat emissions could cancel forest benefits 'Restore UK bogs' to tackle climate change Warming world 'devastating' for frozen peatlands According to the Wildlife Trusts' survey, many retailers offer peat-free composts, but only two have set a date for ending peat sales. Travis Perkins plans to go 100% peat-free this year. Wickes intends to phase out peat by 2025. B&Q, Hillier and the Blue Diamond group of garden centres said they were committed to phasing out peat, but gave no date. Asda, Lidl and others have set themselves targets to reduce sales, but not yet to end them. When peatland is drained and dug up, it emits rather than soak up carbon. Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: ""Our survey shows that most retailers' approach to the voluntary ban on peat sales has been woeful - even though the industry has been aware of the problem for decades. ""The time for voluntary agreements is over - the sale of peat must end now. Countless promises have been broken and targets missed, with the result that precious peatland habitats are still being unnecessarily destroyed in the name of gardening. ""Only one leading retailer - Travis Perkins - is planning to eliminate peat from its shelves by 2021, whilst growers like Hillier demonstrate that you can produce compost and grow high-quality plants without peat. These retailers are to be congratulated, but we now need government to make the rest follow their lead. The time for delay and excuses is over."" Suppliers say they are doing what they can to meet rising demand. Ben Malin is director of Godwin's Peat, a company based on the Somerset levels. It provides around 120,000 cubic metres of growing material a year to garden centres, DIY outlets and professional growers across the south of England and the Midlands. Mr Malin said some 40% of this is peat. The government's policy is to restore peatlands Mr Malin said: ""We've seen an absolute step-change in gardening over the last 12 months. We've had an unprecedented demand for raw material, and peat is a very important part of the supply chain. ""We've been moving towards peat reduction and aiming to be peat-free at a pace that the industry could move at; but this sudden increase in demand has made it absolutely clear to most people in the industry that at the moment it's simply not possible to phase out the use of peat and meet the demand in the marketplace."" He said that a significant amount of wood chip, which is one alternative, goes towards the biomass industry, which is subsidised. This pushes up prices. Another option is coir, which is made from coconut husks. However it has a very long and unreliable supply chain. James Barnes, chairman of the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), said the industry fully supported alternatives to peat. He commented: ""Manufacturers now produce more peat-free and peat-reduced growing media than ever, which are stocked and sold by retailers, but an immediate ban on peat use is unrealistic - access to the amount and quality of alternative materials needed is not yet in place."" He said the HTA had come together with other industry groups to propose a way forward with work to be published soon, including ""meaningful and realistic peat removal targets"" and said the organisation wanted to work with government, organisations and the supply chain to deliver viable, responsibly sourced alternatives"". Dr Rebekka Artz is an expert in peatland ecosystems at the James Hutton Institute. She said that between two and three million cubic metres of peat - around 8,000 hectares - was used for horticulture in the UK each year. A sizeable part of this goes to amateur gardeners. She said the volume could be likened to the size of the London O2 building. Even more was imported from the Baltic states or from the Republic of Ireland, thereby ""offshoring our emissions."" She believes it is crucial a way is found to protect the peatlands these amounts are sourced from. ""Only 3% of our land area on the planet is covered in peatlands but they are the largest carbon store that we have. They have grown very slowly since the last Ice Age, and only accumulate about a millimetre every decade. It's a very slow-growing resource and it's very easy to lose it."" According to the HTA, the figure is around 2m cubic metres in total which amounts to 0.04% of peatlands that is extracted for horticulture in the UK. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) recently committed to going completely ""peat-free"" by 2025 and is calling on gardeners across the UK to do the same. Bord Na Mona, Ireland's partial state company which was set up to develop peatlands for the Irish economy, also announced that it's formally ending all peat harvesting on its land.

"Parties have reportedly been held at halls of residence, including University Hall in Penylan, Cardiff Security has been beefed-up at Cardiff University to tackle students holding parties breaking Covid laws, it has been claimed. A letter to Unison members expressed concern at ""parties and mass gatherings"" held at halls of residence. ""These gatherings and parties are unlawful and put staff and students' health at risk,"" it said. The university said a small minority were not observing the rules and there had been parties at some of its sites. It added that breaches were investigated by university security ""often working alongside South Wales Police"". Undercurrent coronavirus regulationslarge groups of people are banned from meeting inside and only six people from two households can meet outside. The Unison letter, sent in an email and seen by BBC Wales, said the parties and gatherings were taking place predominantly at two halls, Talybont and University Hall. ""We recognise how frustrated many of the students are, however, we fully support the university in their efforts to stop this dangerous and unlawful behaviour,"" said the email. It said security from the firm Showsec had been drafted in to help on nights when they were needed. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Cardiff University testing system 'fatally flawed', ex-boss claims University 'threw out students' belongings' It said Showsec was being used as a ""temporary measure"" and would only be used on ""evening/nights where there are issues"". The email said four new security guards had been employed by the university. ""There are lots of Covid-specific measures that are required at present in order that the safety of all staff and students is prioritised and the trade unions are fully supportive of every measure that increases safety."" Talybont halls of residence in Gabalfa was also mentioned in a letter from union Unison The student experience has been very different for those studying in 2020 and 2021 so far, with campuses closed, lectures cancelled, and nights out banned for much of the year. Universities in Wales had agreed a staggered start of the new term after the Christmas break, but many students continue to learn online. NUS Wales president, Becky Ricketts, urged students to ""stick to the rules"". ""As with any part of society, there will always be a small number of people who break rules, but we can't scapegoat students and young people, the majority of whom are behaving responsibly,"" she said. ""The plan to lift measures in Wales announced earlier this week means that by doing the right thing for a little longer, students will soon be able to do more with more people. ""Universities have procedures in place to deal with misconduct and these are appropriate to be able to deal with any rule breaches. ""I'd encourage universities to continue to communicate the latest rules with their students and avoid the over-policing of our campuses."" Cardiff University said it took students' health and safety seriously. A spokesman said using extra private security was not new and had been in place since the start of the academic year ""especially in response to an increase in non-residents trying to access them"". He said: ""The vast majority of our students are observing Covid-19 rules and we are extremely grateful to them for doing so. ""However, like other universities, a small minority are not observing the rules and we have seen parties and other gatherings in communal spaces at some of our sites, including University Hall and Talybont.

Dr Rebekka Artz is an expert in peatland ecosystems at the James Hutton Institute. She said that between two and three million cubic metres of peat - around 8,000 hectares - was used for horticulture in the UK each year. A sizeable part of this goes to amateur gardeners. She said the volume could be likened to the size of the London O2 building. Even more was imported from the Baltic states or from the Republic of Ireland, thereby ""offshoring our emissions."" She believes it is crucial a way is found to protect the peatlands these amounts are sourced from. ""Only 3% of our land area on the planet is covered in peatlands but they are the largest carbon store that we have. They have grown very slowly since the last Ice Age, and only accumulate about a millimetre every decade. It's a very slow-growing resource and it's very easy to lose it."" According to the HTA, the figure is around 2m cubic metres in total which amounts to 0.04% of peatlands that is extracted for horticulture in the UK. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) recently committed to going completely ""peat-free"" by 2025 and is calling on gardeners across the UK to do the same. Bord Na Mona, Ireland's partial state company which was set up to develop peatlands for the Irish economy, also announced that it's formally ending all peat harvesting on its land.

"Sachin Tendulkar said he was experiencing mild symptoms after testing positive for Covid-19 Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, has been admitted to hospital. Tendulkar tweeted on Friday that he decided to go to a hospital in Mumbai ""as a matter of abundant precaution under medical advice"". The former captain, who is loved by millions, added that he was hoping to be back home in a few days. Several Indian cities, including Mumbai, have seen a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks. Tendulkar, 47, shared the news at a time when India is staring at what experts have called a ""deadlier second wave"". India reported 81,466 news cases and 469 deaths on Thursday - the highest daily spike since December. The country's Covid caseload had dropped sharply in January when it was reporting less than 15,000 cases daily. But cases began to spike again in March, largely driven by poor test-and-trace and lax safety protocols. Many of the new cases were reported in the western state of Maharashtra, where Tendulkar lives in the city of Mumbai. Since the pandemic began, India has confirmed more than 12.2 million cases and over 163,000 deaths. It has the third-highest number of infections in the world after the United States and Brazil - however, its number of deaths per capita is far lower. India has registered 118 deaths per million, compared to 1,487 in Brazil and 1,668 in the US. India launched its vaccination drive in January and so far more than 65 million doses have been administered. But experts say the pace needs to further pick up to halt the spread. Some have also attributed the uptick in numbers to a highly contagious variants of the coronavirus, but the government has denied this. Delhi orders Covid-19 tests at airports How many people has India vaccinated? What are the risks of India's new Covid-19 variant? The surge in cases comes during what some experts have calleda ""delicate phase"" of the pandemicfor India. States are now reintroducing restrictions to stem the spread of the virus. In his tweet, Tendulkar thanked his fans for their wishes and prayers. His fans and many of his former teammates have responded with prayers for his recovery. Allow Twitter content?

Nicknamed the Master Blaster, Tendulkar retired from cricket in 2013 but continues to be one of the most popular public figures in India. He recently took part in the Road Safety World Series Challenge, a veterans' tournament in the central Indian city of Raipur. He made his international debut aged 16 in November 1989, setting off an illustrious 24-year career that earned him global recognition. This video can not be played Sachin Tendulkar's career in 60 seconds In that time, he amassed a record 15,921 Test-match runs, the highest number by any batsman in cricket history. In 2012, Tendulkar became the only batsman ever to reach 100 international centuries. One of his most memorable Test centuries was an unbeaten 103 that inspired India's victory over England in December 2008, and came shortly after terror attacks hit his home city of Mumbai.

Here's a round-up of some of the biggest coronavirus developments around the world today. Teacher Karen Thorp wanted to find a way to thank NHS workers who saved her life when she spent six weeks in hospital with coronavirus last year, so she is buying more than 300 of them an Easter egg. The 52-year-old, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, says she wanted to ""celebrate"" her recovery, so raised Â£800 for staff at Watford Hospital as they ""deserve it"".

Research shows some animals can catch the virus From the start of the pandemic, experts have shared their concerns about the impact of coronavirus on animals. And while scientists say there is currently no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. On Wednesday, Russia announced it has registered what it says is the world's first animal-specific jab. But are these really necessary?Here's what we know so far. Bahrain is to allow more than 100 prisoners to serve the remainder of their sentences out of prison, as protesters and rights groups voiced fears over Covid-19 spreading in jails, AFP reports. A total of 126 prisoners will serve the remainder of their sentences in an ""alternative"" or non-custodial setting, the public prosecution said in a statement. The released convicts will be monitored electronically. Officials said last week three people at the Jaw prison were infected with the virus. It said they had been isolated and were in a stable condition. But the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy says there have been dozens of infections among prisoners. ""If Bahrain's government is serious about tackling this outbreak, they should be fully transparent rather than undermining the seriousness of the situation at hand,"" Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of BIRD, said in a statement last week. Nabeel Rajab, one of Bahrain's most prominent rights activists who was freed from jail last year, welcomed the government's decision. ""May it be a good omen,"" he tweeted. These graphs show the number of new coronavirus cases are levelling off in the UK and the death rate remains low. Meanwhile the UK's vaccination programme continues at speed. The Netherlands is halting AstraZeneca vaccines for under-60s after new reports of rare blood clots following vaccination, Dutch health authorities have said. ""The immediate cause for the decision are reports of cases of extensive thrombosis in combination with low platelet counts after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine,"" the GGD public health service says. Nurses who were recruited from the Philippines due to a nursing shortage say they have ""no regrets"" after 20 years in north Wales. About 100 nurses came in 2001 and took up positions across the three main hospitals. The recruitment was seen at the time as a temporary measure and the nurses were given two-year contracts - but many stayed and built their lives in Wales.

million BioNTech-Pfizer doses due to be delivered in the second
quarter. This was in order to help countries that needed it more. Of those 10 million doses, 2.85 million so-called
""solidarity vaccines"" will be shared between Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia. Austria says it is ""incomprehensible"" the Czech Republic - which has been hit hard by the pandemic - was not given
more doses. ""We will... support the Czech Republic bilaterally with
30,000 doses of vaccine and believe it is very positive that we
have also heard that other European countries are prepared to do
the same,"" a statement by Kurz's office says. ""We do not want to accept that one of our neighbouring
countries is left behind,"" it adds. Staff at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea will go on strike for four days next week because of concerns over Covid cases among workers.

Susie ForrestScotland health producer, BBC Scotland The critical care unit at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow has seen more Covid-19 patients than any other in Scotland. Jen Dolan and the other specialist nurses have held the hands of many of them and they are still doing it. ""There is no feeling in the world like holding somebody's hand when their family can't be with them and their heart beats its last beat,"" she says. While the staff have got used to treating the virus the volume of patients has been ""like a tidal wave"", according to senior charge nurse Amanda Allan. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small says: ""I think people are coping, but we're not dealing with it.

Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There has been an outbreak in the Chinese border city of Ruili Life has
largely returned to normal in China, although an outbreak in the city of Ruili,
which borders Myanmar, has thrown hundreds of thousands of people back into
lockdown this week. China has been
strict about implementing lockdown measures as soon as a single case is
identified. Consequently, schools and all but essential businesses have closed
in the city, which has a population of about 210,000. Mass testing is being
carried out throughout Ruili, and today has been extended to border counties
and cities. So far,
16 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 have been reported since Wednesday, and
roughly three times as many asymptomatic cases. Despite this
latest outbreak, within the next couple of weeks China is set to surpass the US
and become the country that has carried out the most vaccinations in the
world. So far, 126
million vaccine doses have been administered in China. The countryâs national Global Times newspaper says the country now has
capacity to carry out 10 million vaccine doses daily. This means, in theory, it could inoculate a billion people within 100 days. China is accelerating its vaccination programme as it has aims to vaccine 40% of its 1.4bn population by the end of June â that equates to it carrying out 560 million vaccinations. To date, it has largely prioritised vaccinating people in the 18-59
years of age category, but as of today, it has expanded its vaccination drive
to begin targeting people over the age of 60 Sheffield Wednesday manager Darren Moore is missing the Owls' trip to Watford this afternoonafter testing positive for Covid-19.

Assistant Jamie Smith is leading Wednesday, who are six points adrift of safety in the  Championship, in Moore's absence - and they are currently 1-0 down. Germany has suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for under-60s, after the German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot out of 2.7 million people who had received the jab. The European Medicines Agency and the UK's regulatory body, MHRA, have said there is no indication the vaccine is linked to blood clots. Despite this, Angela Merkel has insisted Germany will still offer every adult a vaccine by the end of the summer. Jenny Hill went to see how the vaccine was made. This video can not be played Covid 19: Inside the BioNTech vaccine factory in Germany The US economy saw a surge in hiring in March as vaccination spreads, officials loosened restrictions and people pushed to return to their pre-pandemic activities. Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by reopenings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the pandemic. The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020. The US has approved trillions in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) package last month, to shield households and businesses from the disruption. Read more here.

""There is no feeling in the world like holding somebody's hand when their family can't be with them and their heart beats its last beat,"" she says. While the staff have got used to treating the virus the volume of patients has been ""like a tidal wave"", according to senior charge nurse Amanda Allan. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small says: ""I think people are coping, but we're not dealing with it. ""We're dealing with things completely differently, and I think the psychological impact will be massive."" Read more from Queen Elizabeth University Hospital's front-line staffhere. Intensive care charge nurse Emma Small Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There has been an outbreak in the Chinese border city of Ruili Life has
largely returned to normal in China, although an outbreak in the city of Ruili,
which borders Myanmar, has thrown hundreds of thousands of people back into
lockdown this week. China has been
strict about implementing lockdown measures as soon as a single case is
identified. Consequently, schools and all but essential businesses have closed
in the city, which has a population of about 210,000. Mass testing is being
carried out throughout Ruili, and today has been extended to border counties
and cities. So far,
16 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 have been reported since Wednesday, and
roughly three times as many asymptomatic cases. Despite this
latest outbreak, within the next couple of weeks China is set to surpass the US
and become the country that has carried out the most vaccinations in the
world. So far, 126
million vaccine doses have been administered in China. The countryâs national Global Times newspaper says the country now has
capacity to carry out 10 million vaccine doses daily. This means, in theory, it could inoculate a billion people within 100 days. China is accelerating its vaccination programme as it has aims to vaccine 40% of its 1.4bn population by the end of June â that equates to it carrying out 560 million vaccinations. To date, it has largely prioritised vaccinating people in the 18-59
years of age category, but as of today, it has expanded its vaccination drive
to begin targeting people over the age of 60 Sheffield Wednesday manager Darren Moore is missing the Owls' trip to Watford this afternoonafter testing positive for Covid-19. The club has confirmed he is not at the match as he is isolating. Assistant Jamie Smith is leading Wednesday, who are six points adrift of safety in the  Championship, in Moore's absence - and they are currently 1-0 down. Germany has suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for under-60s, after the German medicines regulator found 31 cases of a type of rare blood clot out of 2.7 million people who had received the jab. The European Medicines Agency and the UK's regulatory body, MHRA, have said there is no indication the vaccine is linked to blood clots. Despite this, Angela Merkel has insisted Germany will still offer every adult a vaccine by the end of the summer. Jenny Hill went to see how the vaccine was made.

Employers added more than 900,000 jobs driven by reopenings at restaurants, bars, construction sites and schools. The gains were the biggest since August and helped lower the unemployment rate to 6% from 6.2% in February. However, overall employment remains far lower than before the pandemic. The US lost more than 20 million jobs last spring as the virus led to widespread lockdowns. It has regained more than half, but the number of jobs is still more than 8 million down from February 2020. The US has approved trillions in recovery aid, including a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) package last month, to shield households and businesses from the disruption. Read more here.

"This video can not be played Watch: Rescue efforts after the train derailment At least 50 people have been killed and dozens more injured after a train carrying nearly 500 crashed and then derailed in a tunnel in Taiwan. The eight-carriage train reportedly hit a construction vehicle that had slipped onto the tracks at the tunnel's mouth. Rescuers combed badly damaged carriages inside the tunnel to find survivors, some of whom smashed windows to flee. The train, from the capital Taipei to Taitung, was carrying people travelling for a long-weekend annual holiday. Many people may have been standing because the train was so full. The 408 train is one of the fastest deployed on a network that is generally considered safe. It can reach speeds of 130km/h (80mph). Friday's crash is Taiwan's worst rail disaster in decades. President Tsai Ing-wen has sent her condolences to the families of the victims and ordered an investigation. Some passengers exited on to the roof to escape The latest reports from the National Fire Agency say 494 people were on the train, with 50 dead and 66 injured and taken to hospital. The crash took place at about 09:00 local time (01:00 GMT). Some people at the back of the train were able to walk away unscathed, while 100 were rescued from the first four carriages. Many of the dead, injured and trapped were in four crumpled carriages inside the tunnel. ""It felt like there was a sudden violent jolt and I found myself falling to the floor,"" one female survivor told Taiwan's UDN.  ""We broke the window to climb to the roof of the train to get out."" Another rescued woman said: ""My whole body fell to the floor. I hit my head and it started bleeding."" A 50-year-old survivor told Apple Daily she saw many people trapped under their seats and when she walked out of her carriage she saw bodies everywhere. Pictures showed people in less affected carriages walking along train tracks with their belongings Local media reports say the train driver is among the dead. Images show a large, yellow flatbed truck lying at the side of the tracks. A construction project has been under way near the north end of the tunnel. It is not known how the vehicle slipped down the embankment. Other pictures showed people walking along the tracks with their belongings as they were evacuated from less badly affected carriages. Other survivors were being carried away on stretchers with their necks in braces. This image appears to show the yellow flat-bed truck at the side of the tracks Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang visited the crash site on Friday afternoon. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter: ""I offer my sincere condolences to all those affected by this morning's rail accident in Taiwan."" Analysis by BBC's Cindy Sui in Taiwan Taiwan has an impressive transportation network, including more than 1,000km of railway tracks. The trains transport more than 200 million passengers each year. Accidents are rare, but this latest derailment  - if it was indeed caused by a construction vehicle parked on a nearby slope sliding onto the tracks - would add to a number of recent incidents that have been blamed on negligence and/or human error. They include: a train derailment in 2018 caused by a faulty speed alert systemand a driver busy talking to the command centre who failed to slow down before entering a curve - 18 people died a number of deadly fires inside factories that have housed unsafe dormitories for workers a bridge collapse in 2019 caused by lack of maintenance, which killed four migrant fishermen in a boat a chemical explosion in 2014 caused by neglect of underground pipelines - 32 people died This latest accident once again raises questions about whether Taiwan is placing enough importance on safety and preventing accidents. Many of those on the train are believed to have been travelling to celebrate the Tomb Sweeping festival - a time when people pay their respects to the dead by visiting the graves of family members, sprucing them up and making offerings to their spirits. The island's worst crash in recent history was in 1991, when 30 passengers were killed and 112 injured after two trains collided.

"Amy-Claire Davies said she and other shielders in Wales feel anxious about going outside People who have been shielding could become ""prisoners in their homes"" due to a loss of confidence after months indoors, an expert has said. Dr Deborah Morgan,a leading specialist on loneliness,external, said a ""national strategy"" was needed to help people reintegrate into their communities. The Welsh government said on Wednesday that138,500 people shielding in Wales would no longer need to. However, they have been advised to limit their contact and work from home. Amy-Claire Davies, 26, has been shielding with her parents in Swansea since the start of the pandemic. Medically, she is extremely vulnerable. She is living with a life-limiting condition which means she suffers multiple agonising spasms. Who has been shielding and why? Shielding woman's Covid jab 'feels like Christmas' 'I've only left my home five times this year' She feels anxious about going outside, a fear she said was shared by other young people like her living with life-limiting conditions. She said: ""I think I'd struggle going anywhere that was particularly crowded, I would get quite anxious about that, because it's been ingrained as a survival instinct over the past year and I haven't been in a crowded space for the past year. It would be quite overwhelming. ""A lot of the young people I know are at a real risk of struggling to go back out into the world in the way that we were before."" That concern is shared by experts who think some people might never leave their homes again unless they get help. Dr Deborah Morgan said young people are ""just too fearful to go back out again"" Dr Morgan, from the Centre for Innovative Ageing at Swansea University, said without the right support they might find a return to the outside world too daunting. She said: ""When we talk to younger people, as well as older people, about this experience that's just the way they're feeling, they're just too fearful to go back out again. ""These are people who have been very active in social groups and have been part of their communities but they're now really fearful of going back out there. ""We have an economic strategy about how we're going to recover from this, and I really think we need a strategy for the social aspect of this, not just the economic."" Work is already ongoing to introduce some of the most vulnerable groups to life in a world with face masks, social distancing and contactless payment. The Get There Together project is a Wales-wide NHS project designed to show people with dementia what the world looks like now. A series of films and written resources have been produced in English and Welsh showing how shops, libraries and public transport has adapted since the start of the pandemic. Dr Natalie Elliott said the pandemic has had a huge impact on people living with dementia Dr Natalie Elliott is the allied health professional lead for dementia at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and is leading the project. ""The feedback we were getting from people with dementia is that they were very fearful of going back out into the community,"" she said. ""One of the ideas we had was would it be useful to create resources, video clips walking people through visits to places in their communities showing what it is like and what safety measures are there to support people and this allows people to rehearse at home, perhaps with the support of a family member or carer to go through and prepare to feel ready to go out."" The Welsh government said: ""Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have worked tirelessly alongside the voluntary and third sector to co-ordinate support to a wide range of vulnerable groups. They will continue to play an important role in supporting the most vulnerable in our communities. ""During the pandemic we have introduced a number of new initiatives to support vulnerable people, including a national telephone befriending service for older people and the Looking Out For Each Other Safely campaign, which provides advice about how to stay in contact to prevent feelings of loneliness or isolation.""

"Chief Constable Simon Byrne faces questions at meeting of Northern Ireland Policing Board It comes after Public Prosecution Service announced no prosecutions of anyone who attended Bobby Storey's funeral The funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - when Covid restrictions were in place First Minister Arlene Foster called for chief constable to resign in wake of the decision - he has rejected that Earlier, Stormont Assembly was recalled from Easter break and MLAs passed motion censuring Sinn FÃ©in ministers Sinn FÃ©in was accused in assembly of showing arrogance and privilege; deputy first minister apologised for ""the hurt caused"" Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine Police Service of Northern Ireland's role in funeral Emily McGarvey, Stewart Robson, Chris Andrews, Edited by Fiona Murray and Iain McDowell That's all from us for today - thank you for following our live coverage of the Stormont Assembly and the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Have a nice evening! BBC News NI There's plenty still to come from the BBC News NI team this evening. In about half-an-hour Coronavirus Catch-up will be coming live from Belfast's SSE Arena - Northern Ireland's new mass Covid-19 vaccination centre. Presenter Jordan Kenny will be joined by senior GP Dr Alan Stout to bring you the latest developments and the answers to your Covid-related questions. Watch Coronavirus Catch-up live at 19:00 BST. Tune in on the BBC News NI website, the BBC iPlayer and the BBC News NI Facebook page. BBC News NI Sinn FÃ©in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. MLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions. First Minister Arlene Foster said the wake and funeral procession were clear acts of ""premeditated breaches of the Covid regulations"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who was one of the Sinn FÃ©in politicians who attended the funeral - apologised ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many families who have lost a loved one"". Read more:Sinn FÃ©in accused of 'arrogance and self entitlement' BBC News NI PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne has expressed surprise at the conclusion by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in relation to their attendance at Bobby Storey's funeral. Mr Byrne said he recognised that the policing of the former IRA intelligence chief's funeral last June had caused outrage and damaged confidence in the PSNI. He added: ""The PPS draw their conclusions but this is what we're wrestling with now."" Read more:Police chief 'surprised' by PPS funeral decision DUP MLA Trevor Clarke says he feels ""sorry for the rank and file officers out on the street on a daily basis"" as a result of the Bobby Storey funeral row. He probes the senior officers about a paragraph in the PPS report which he says states that a Sinn FÃ©in organiser told police that stewards would be in place outside Mr Storey's home to encourage social distancing, with police not needed in attendance. Mr Clarke asks whether that ""assurance"" would guarantee no prosecutions if another similar-sized funeral was to take place again? It was estimated that 400 people would be outside the home and ACC Alan Alan Todd says there were people there ""who shouldn't have been there"". ""It wasn't a deal, it wasn't an arrangement,"" he adds. ""We merely sought to understand what was happening so we could understand how we could respond to that."" Mr Todd says it would have taken time to make ""an informed approach"" in sending officers to the scene with crowds dispersing after a short period of time. The Policing Board meeting draws to a close. âI do not understand how people did not get what 'stay at
home' meant,"" says the SDLP's Delores Kelly. She asks whether the Sinn FÃ©in funeral organisation plan included numbers of how
many people would attend the funeral. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says that based upon a risk assessment provided by organisers that number was 30. About 2,000 people turned up to watch the funeral cortege. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the PSNI is ""trying to make sense"" of how its ""legitimate engagement"" in relation to the funeral, which he compares to police planning for events such as bonfires, has ""put us in this situation"". He says police needed to get an understanding of how the funeral would play out in terms of Covid regulations as well as ""public safety"". ""That was not a deliberate attempt to give any community or any individuals a free pass at the regulations."" Mr Byrne continues: ""We are here to enforce and uphold the law. ""We went into this endeavour with an assumption that the independent investigator Mark Webster would follow the evidence and present his findings to the PPS, which is what he did, with a recommendation for prosecution. ""We find ourselves where we do but we are surprised at the outcome."" The Bobby Storey funeral was ""an epic failure"" and has moved Northern Ireland into a system of ""two-tier justice"", says the DUP's Joanne Bunting. She asks the senior PSNI officers why the force did not ask if the funeral organisers were asking people to stay away from the event. ""It was our job to explain what we saw as the regulations and encourage people to comply with them,"" says ACC Alan Todd. ""We were making various assessments of what the likelihood of that compliance was but I didn't and I didn't want my team to get into something that could be portrayed for what it wasn't."" He says the PSNI's approach was to have consistent with engagement with the organisers. Ms Bunting, an MLA for East Belfast, also asks if stewards and organisers of the funeral were assigned to a proscribed organisation. Mr Todd says he ""did not get into"" investigating individuals, claiming it was not his job to do so. Sinn FÃ©in MLA SeÃ¡n Lynch wants to know whether the PSNI can rescind finesissued to people involved in Black Lives Matter protestsin Northern Ireland last year. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the force has received legal advice which states that it cannot cancel the fines. He tells the board: ""Because the fines have gone into the court after the penalty notices were issued it would be a matter for individuals to either contest the allegation which they face or for the PPS if they thought a ticket had been issued inappropriately to withdraw it."" ""I know there's differing opinions flying around in relation to this,"" he says. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd says a ""plan"" was sent to the PSNI by the funeral organisers, detailing the logistics of the day, which officers then looked at. ""It wasn't the basis for negotiation,"" he says. The senior officer says he knew it was ""always going to be a challenging funeral"" with thousands of people expected to attend. ""We set our mind to what the tactical options were in respect of that,"" he says, ""which was evidence gathering."" Simon Byrne says that following Bobby Storey's death there were a ""fast-time dialogue"" between the PSNI and Sinn FÃ©in representatives regarding the arrangements for the funeral. Describing it as a ""series of short interactions"", Mr Byrne says he ""could have described that better"" during an interview on BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. Responding to a question from UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt, the chief constable says ""the sense of horse-trading was probably what you heard from the word negotiation - I wasn't trying to imply that"". ""I was trying to describe there was a fast-time dialogue just to understand what the funeral arrangements were so the commanders involved in that could make their risk assessments and prepare their plans and contingencies for that operation."" Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the PSNI ""went into this endeavour with an intent to police the funeral in a sensitive but proportionate way, recognising there were risks"". ""We went into this operation to gather evidence, which is what we did, in case there were breaches because there was always that very real prospect,"" he told the policing board. ""No one's pretending, to a certain degree if you like, we didn't see this coming."" ""We are where we are now and obviously the PPS are reviewing their decision and who knows where they may conclude, and we have to wait [for] that too, but certainly speaking for myself and for the gold commander, if we had anticipated this is where we would have ended up we may have taken an entirely different approach."" John Blair of Alliance is up next. The South Antrim MLA asks Mr Byrne if he will commit to a review of the PSNI engagement processes, which he hopes would be conducted in a way that ""would identify any issues that are causing problems, and remove any future problems"". Simon Byrne says he welcomes the engagement of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) as an ""independent body to come in and help us get an objective understanding of just what went on"". ""Regardless of what HMIC find in a few weeks, what reflection we're able to do ourselves, clearly there are a number of issues at the heart of this,"" the chief constable says. ""Firstly, everyone would have empathy with people who were unable to bury their loved ones in ways that we would traditionally expect. ""We have recognised from the outset, actually, how difficult policing funerals may have been."" First to pose a question this afternoon is DUP MLA Mervyn Storey. He begins by listing a number of events during the pandemic where believes the PSNI took a different approach to policing. They include Black Lives Matter protests. He says: ""While
my party leader has stated publicly what she believes should be the situation in regards
to your position, will you take the opportunity to apologise to those many hundreds of
families who were not afforded the privilege of police acquiescence or police
assistance in the spirit of the letter of the law?  PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne says he recognises that ""events surrounding the policing of this funeral have caused outrage and have damaged confidence in policing"". ""I am listening, but I am confident that my officers have acted with good intent and integrity, managing what was always going to be a sensitive policing operation,"" he told the policing board. In his opening remarks, Mr Byrne said he wanted to ""place on record"" his ""clear and unequivocal understanding about the sympathy we have for the hurt, concern and anger felt by so many people who complied with the health protection regulations over the last year"". Before taking questions, the chief constable stated: ""The PPS themselves, not withstanding some of the public and political concern, found no evidence that deals were done in the run-up to this funeral."" Today's public meeting opens. All attendees are appearing via video link including Stormont MLAs. The Chief Constable Simon Byrne is up first. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor We've had some heated and passionate exchanges in the chamber, not least from those MLAs who've lost loved ones and friends during the pandemic and were unable to attend their funerals. They had pointed remarks for both Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Conor Murphy, both of whom attended Bobby Storey's funeral last year. Even before the debate started, Sinn FÃ©in MLA and Speaker Alex Maskey was challenged for his impartiality, and that set the tone. Ms O'Neill was challenged several times across the chamber floor to apologise for her attendance at the funeral. She didn't do that, but she did say sorry for the hurt caused. This is a non-binding debate which means there will be a vote in the chamber, but there will be no effect on Sinn FÃ©in because this simply registers other MLAs' anger at what happened. In the absence of a court case, it's another chance for MLAs to deliver their verdicts. Ironically, ministers are likely tochange the laws around funerals again with a recommendation to increase the numbers who can attend to 35. It is easy to forget we are still plotting our pathway out of lockdown. Those are the big decisions, for some, which will be made later. No further deaths related to Covid-19 were reported on Thursday by the department of health, meaning its total remains at 2,115. There were 107 more positive cases of the virus identified, bringing the overall tally during the pandemic to 117,396. There are 17 patients being treated in intensive care, with 112 inpatients and nine requiring ventilation. The department statistics show there are five active outbreaks registered at NI care homes. To sum up today's proceedings in the chamber: Sinn FÃ©in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. MLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions. The funeral in June 2020 attracted 2,000 mourners at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians were examined, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy. In the assembly today, the deputy first minister apologised ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many families who have lost a loved one"". Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.
