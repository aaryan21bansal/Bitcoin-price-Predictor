"The futuristic looking Core is controlled via a smartphone app Security firms have launched routers at CES that can stop smart household gadgets being hijacked by hackers. Symantec, BitDefender and Intel unveiled devices that scrutinise data as it flows across home networks. The companies say routers with built-in defences will be essential as homes are filled with net-connected gadgets. The routers also come with parental control features that help manage how much time children spend online and what they see. ""You will have to buy a security solution for your internet-of-things,"" said Alex Balan, chief security researcher at BitDefender. The ""internet of things"" refers to the growing collection of smart gadgets that can be controlled via the net. ""Pretty soon everything will be connected one way or another and managed by a smartphone app,"" said Mr Balan. ""You won't be able to avoid it."" But that interconnectivity and ease of use comes at a cost, he said, adding that the end of 2016 had seen a surge in attacks that compromised net-connected CCTV cameras, televisions and media servers. BitDefender unveiled a new version of its Box router while Arris revealed that it was adding Intel's security software to its devices The poor security on these gadgets led to them being enrolled in massive networks by hackers who use them to carry out overwhelming attacks. One network, called Mirai, staged some of the biggest net attacks ever seen. The problem has got so serious that the US Federal Trade Commission has kicked offa competition to create tools,externalthat consumers can add to their home network that can protect IoT devices from attack. Cash rewards of $25,000 (Â£20,000) will be given to the best entrants. ""Security for these devices has to start at the network level,"" said Gareth Lockwood from Symantec. ""There's no other way to do it."" As the entry and exit point for home networks, routers were the best place to put a security system that can watch for malicious traffic coming in and cut off hackers trying to access insecure kit. The show floors of the CES tech expo are packed with new internet-connected products for the home While current home routers do have security systems, most are pretty basic, said Mr Lockwood, and none is ready for the explosion of smart devices predicted to be in use soon. ""If we look forward four to five years from now we expect to see between 20 to 30 billion devices in homes,"" he said. ""There'll be tens of devices per household."" Car-makers choose virtual assistants Ford sticks to self-driving cars by 2021 pledge Strap turns your finger into a phone Jeans tickle users to keep them on track Read all our CES coverage atbbc.co.uk/ces2017,external The three companies launching secure routers at CES are taking slightly different approaches to solving the IoT headache though one common feature they share is a smartphone-based management system. Symantec launched theNorton Core,externalthat is intended to replace the router supplied by an ISP. In the US, the Core will cost $279 BitDefender unveiledthe second version of its Box gadget,externalwhich sits alongside a home router and polices traffic as it flows across a network. The Box currently costs $129 Intel Security has signed a deal with hardware firm Arris to include its security software in a specially-made line of home protection routers. Intel has yet to release prices for these products All three will face competition from established devices such as the Cujo smart firewall and the Home Halo and Eero products as well as from Asus which has teamed up with Trend Micro to put security software on its routers. Net-connected cameras are helping attackers in large-scale attacks The devices launched at CES will only initially be available in the US but will reach other regions later in 2017. Typically, buying one of the secure routers includes a subscription to a firm's standard security software that runs on desktops, laptops and tablets. All three also include net access control systems that let parents decide for how long different gadgets can be used and which sites youngsters can visit. Some, such as the Norton Core, have an internet pause button that cuts off access for everyone in a household. Laptop has not one but three screens Does anyone need a smart kitchen bin?

"This video can not be played FA Cup: Millwall 3-0 AFC Bournemouth highlights Premier League sides Bournemouth, Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion were knocked out of the FA Cup by lower league opposition in the third round. A much-changed Bournemouth were beaten 3-0 by League One Millwall, while Stoke lost 2-0 at home to Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers. West Brom lost 2-1 at home to Championship promotion hopefuls Derby. Everton were beaten by Leicester and Hull knocked out Swansea in two all-Premier League ties. Two non-league sides will be in Monday's fourth-round draw after securing replays. National League leaders Lincoln City came close to causing an FA Cup upset as two goals from former Derby striker Theo Robinson saw them 2-1 up at Ipswich before Tom Lawrence equalised late on. Lincoln's league rivals Sutton also earned a replay as they draw 0-0 at home to League One AFC Wimbledon. FA Cup holders Manchester United beat Reading 4-0 in the early game to progress, while 2013-15 and 2014-15 winners Arsenal came from behind towin 2-1 at Prestonin the late game. They were joined in the fourth round by Premier League champions Leicester, who won 2-1 at Everton thanks to an Ahmed Musa double. Watch all of the latest FA Cup highlights and reaction here Football Daily podcast: Rooney equals record and FA Cup round-up New Hull City head coach Marco Silva watched his side beat Swansea 2-0, a result which meant defeat for Swans boss Paul Clement in his first official match in charge. Watford avoided an upset by overcoming Championship side Burton Albion 2-0. Brentford came out on top of Saturday's highest-scoring game as the Championship outfit beat non-league Eastleigh 5-1. This video can not be played Highlights: Hull 2-0 Swansea A number of games featuring Premier League sides had low attendances as the top-tier clubs entered the competition. A crowd of 6,608 watched Hull City versus Swansea at the KCOM Stadium, with 210 supporters making the trip from Wales. At Norwich, who average 26,000 in the Championship, just over 12,000 watched the draw with Premier League side Southampton. And Sunderland, usually watched by more than 40,000 fans at the Stadium of Light, drew a crowd of just 17,632 for the 0-0 draw against Burnley. However, non-league fans eager to witness an FA Cup upset travelled in big numbers to games. Seventh-tier Stourbridge went into the third round as the lowest-ranked side left in competition and took more than 2,000 supporters to Wycombe, where an Adebayo Akinfenwa late winner sent the League Two side through. ""The FA Cup win will make a difference,"" said Stourbridge manager Gary Hackett. ""Financially, it will put the club in a very strong position, and I think people will remember this day for a long, long time - albeit in defeat."" Eastleigh, meanwhile, had more than 1,500 supporters at Brentford - just 500 fewer than the National League side averages for home games. This video can not be played FA Cup heartbreak for non-league Stourbridge The draw for the FA Cup fourth round takes place on Monday, 9 January at 19:10 GMT.

"League One Millwall beat Bournemouth 3-0 Derby knock out Premier League West Brom Championship Wolves win 2-0 at Stoke Non-league Lincoln draw 2-2 at Championship Ipswich Jonathan Jurejko, Gary Rose, Shamoon Hafez and Tom Rostance And that is all from us here this afternoon. Why not join Mike Henson for the rest ofPreston 1-1 Arsenal here? Go on. Sutton 0-0 AFC Wimbledon Sutton United boss Paul Doswell told BBC Radio London. âWe created good chances and restricted them to very little overall. People are telling me that we were the better side, but that doesnât count for a lot as we havenât gone through yet. But we have to feel very proud or ourselves. âNine times out of 10, especially at their place, Wimbledon are the better side and they are going to beat us. âBut we matched them today, that is the magic of the FA Cup. We have to produce an upset now. We went from having decent enough chance, 50-50 maybe, now down to shorter percentage. âBut still it is a chance and in life you can take your chances. âIâm trying to be realistic. We will need aÂ  bit of luck on the night."" Wycombe 2-1 Stourbridge Stourbridge manager Gary Hackett told BBC WM 95.6: âAt the end, I was emotional. When you've been at a club for so long and you see that amazing support, it was a bit emotional. There's nothing wrong with that, I don't think. âI didn't expect it (to be asked to address the supporters at full-time) and sometimes you don't know what you're saying in circumstances like that, but I wanted to say a big thank you from everybody connected with the football club for the support we've had today. âOf course it (the cup run) will make a difference. Financially, it will put the club in a very strong position, and I think people will remember this day for a long, long time - albeit in defeat.â Brentford 5-1 Eastleigh Eastleigh manager Martin Allen told Radio Solent: ""There was a worry at half-time that the players would back off, show fear and they certainly didnât do that. âI thought we took the game to Brentford in the second half, kept a clean sheet in the second half and I wanted the players in the second half to go out and do their families proud, and they certainly did that."" (On return to his former club Brentford) âIt was very emotional for me, I had to do all I could not to shed a couple of tears as I walked across that pitch, but it was an amazing moment and probably one of the highlights of my career to get that sort of reception from all those people, it was a magical moment for me personally.â West Brom 1-2 Derby Derby midfielder Tom Ince, speaking to BBC Radio Derby about his match-winning free-kick:""It's about time I got one in. I practise free-kicks a lot in training, and it's nice to do it on a match day.Â ""The free-kick was in an awkward position where I couldn't really put it into the box for a cross. The goalkeeper had three in the wall, and he left a lot of space to his left, so I thought that if I was able to get it up and over the wall and on target, then I'd give myself a chance. As soon as it went over the wall, the keeper didn't move - and I think he knew straight away that was in.Â ""It was a fantastic performance all round. It's always a big test when you come to a Premier League side, especially when you're away from home - but I thought we played ever so well."" Ipswich 2-2 Lincoln Lincoln boss Danny Cowley:""My players were heroic for me today, absolutely heroic. ""There was a tinge of disappointment at the end, but the overriding emotion in the dressing room is one of pride. ""We went toe-to-toe with a good, experienced Championship side and gave a very good account of ourselves. We spoke all week that a success for us would have been getting a standing ovation at the end. ""We wanted to give our supporters something to remember and for a National League club to have 5,000 supporters away from home says everything about them. If we can be half as good as our supporters, we will be a very good team.""Â Preston 1-0 Arsenal You can catch up with the latest from Deepdale here.Â Watford 2-0 Burton Albion Watford Watford Head Coach Walter Mazzarri:""I was very happy with the new faces. (Brandon) Mason made his full debut andÂ managed to do very well. It is something important for the long-term future of the club. ""It is a good win for a team not doing very well with results. This today will help with confidence for Premier League. ""It is very important to win, especially for our fans. We wanted to give them this satisfaction and hopefully we can do the same next week againstÂ Middlesbrough."" West Brom 1-2 Derby West Bromwich Albion West Brom manager Tony Pulis, speaking to BBC WM:""I'm really proud of the players. They've worked so hard. We battered them. We needed a break and we didn't get a break. Â ""The two goals they scored are disappointing from our point of view. We should have dealt with the first one - we stepped away from their player.Â Â ""With the second one, we'll have to talk about the wall. I've been in to see Jon [Moss, the referee], and he's marked out 13 paces for that free-kick. With others in the game, he's marked out 10 paces. Those are the breaks you need to get through in cup football."" Millwall 3-0 Bournemouth Unconfirmed at this stage but there are reports that defender Nathan Ake is going to return to Chelsea from his loan spell at Bournemouth - where has has impressed.Â Paul Cox not a fan of 'going digital' there.Â Barrow 0-2 Rochdale Barrow manager Paul Cox:""We were on the verge of making history in this competition but it's over, it's chip paper, and I've told the players it is now all about how we react from today's defeat in terms of our mind-set and approach. ""There has to be a sense of pride that we've got as far as we have and while I'd love for us to have been more clinical in front of goal, realistically I don't think we were good enough to win the game today."" Hull 2-0 Swansea Swansea City Swansea manager Paul Clement:""I wouldnât say we need an influx because there are good players in this squad already. ""But we are looking to do something, and we have got to make sure the players we bring in are better than what we have got. âWe are also working hard on the training field to get my ideas across as quickly as possible. Thatâs an area where we can help improve the team, as well as bringing in new signings.â Â  Steven Naismith's injury-time header secures a replay for Championship side Norwich City against Southampton in the FA Cup third round. Â Shock of the day? League One Millwall produce an FA Cup third-round shock as they claim a deserved 3-0 victory over Premier League side Bournemouth. Â Bolton 0-0 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: ""We're still in the hat. Bolton gave us a real good game. I want us to get better - I wouldn't say I was satisfied with what I saw. ""We haven't kept a clean sheet for a while at this club, so we've got that. And we'll take Bolton back to our place later this month. ""For me we should have had enough to beat Bolton, if I'm honest. If we were clinical we would have."" Stoke 0-2 Wolves Stoke City Stoke manager Mark Hughes: ""We lost the game on the first half, the strength of the XI we put out should have been capable of getting a result this afternoon.

"Dean Ogle said Tony Iommi's song was a ""wonderful gift"" for the cathedral Black Sabbath founder Tony Iommi has swapped his heavy metal roots for an ecclesiastical project by writing and producing a piece of choral music. The five-minute acoustic arrangement for Birmingham Cathedral was a huge departure for the musician once accused of being a Satanist. The 68-year-old said the song, How Good It Is, was to give something back to the city he hails from. He said the track was ""just a little bit different to Sabbath"". The project was born out of his friendship with the Dean of Birmingham, the Very Reverend Catherine Ogle, which developed when he was battling cancer in 2012. The lyrics for the piece were inspired by Psalm 133 which talks about people living together in unity which ""is what Birmingham is all about"", Dean Ogle said. Tony Iommi (l), Ozzy Osbourne (centre) and Geezer Butler (r) formed their first band in 1968 ""Tony and I were introduced by a mutual friend and we discussed a possible music collaboration sometime in the future,"" she said. ""Then, when Tony was unwell, we got to know one another better when I began to pray for him and kept in touch with Tony and his wife about his health. ""This is a most wonderful gift Tony offered to the cathedral."" Iommi, whose band's front-man is well-known hell-raiser Ozzy Osbourne, said the group, whose reputation is for being pioneers in heavy metal, have previously done instrumental work with orchestras which was something he enjoyed. ""This is a completely new piece of music and I'm really pleased with it."" As for their famed links with the occult,Iommi admitted in a BBC interview in 2013that the group had ""dabbled"" in their younger days, but felt it was really an image invented by their record label when a picture of an upside down cross was used on their first album. Tony Iommi plays his guitar with the choir ""People used to think we were Satanists but we weren't,"" he said. ""The songs were the opposite and all about the dangers of Black Magic and Satanism. ""The closest we came was Black Magic chocolates."" The new song was played to the public in the cathedral on Thursday which garnered a ""beautiful"" reaction, Dean Ogle said. ""We're so pleased with what people have been saying. ""We're particularly touched by Tony's fans who have got in touch to say how much they like it - some are quite surprised but 'beautiful' is a word that keeps coming up. ""Who knows if there will be more collaborations?"" Black Sabbath star in glass box stunt Sabbath guitarist fights cancer Black Sabbath star made professor The occult, drugs and music - Iommi.

"This video can not be played George Boden has had his jaw rebuilt thanks to a 3D printer after a horrific bike accident A man who lost part of his face in a cycling accident has had his jaw rebuilt with the help of a 3D printer. George Boden, from High Easter, near Chelmsford, Essex, was riding his bike in 2011 when he crashed face-first. Surgeons took bone from his shoulder and a titanium plate to make a new jaw, but he was left with no bottom teeth and a mouth the size of a walnut. But 3D printed models were used to plan more surgery to refine his jaw and create new teeth. Mr Boden said: ""I was out for a training spin, looked at my watch and the next minute I'd slammed into a piece of machinery around the corner. ""It's not a good idea to hit something with your chin at 30mph [48kmph], which is exactly what I did. It ripped the whole of my jaw off."" Maxillofacial surgeon Iain Hutchison rebuilt Mr Boden's face with the help of the 3D printout Doctors covered his rebuilt jaw with a skin flap, but then decided to input his CT scan into a 3D printer to produce a more finely detailed model of his jaw. His surgeon Iain Hutchison said: ""We use it to plan the operation. We use it to design exactly what we are going to take."" The model was also used to make bespoke teeth implants to perfectly fit his new jaw, while another device was also printed to stretch his mouth. Mr Boden said the technology gave him hope when he most needed it. ""I've found two things,"" he said. ""First of all if you know you are going to get a solution you can keep going and secondly, red wine helps enormously."" 3D printed heart saves girl's life.

"The shop's owner said Sainsbury's thought his sign looked like their own supermarket signs A shopkeeper removed the sign outside his store after supermarket giant Sainsbury's said it looked too much like theirs, he has claimed. Singhbury's Local in Aylesbury put its orange sign up last year. Co-owner Inderjit Singh Nagpal said Sainsbury's objected, but he said ""Singh"" was his middle name, ""bury"" referred to Aylesbury and the colour orange was important to Sikhs. Sainsbury's said it contacted the shop after its customers raised ""concerns"". The sign was erected early last year but removed from the shop front in October. A spokeswoman for the supermarket said: ""There were no legal proceedings around this but we did contact the owners after customers raised their concerns with us."" More news from Buckinghamshire Initially Mr Nagpal told the BBC it had been taken downbecause of water damage,external. However, he has now said it was because Sainsbury's contacted him. There is currently no sign above the Weedon Road store He said although he was prepared to change the colour of the sign, he would not change the name because he could justify it. Mr Nagpal said he hoped his legal representatives and Sainsbury's would reach a decision next week.

They end the day top of the Premiership table. Exeter, on the other hand, won't look favourably on the number 13, should Saracens have been reduced to 13 men? Once again the talk of the day will be the new laws surrounding the high tackle. Thanks for joining us this afternoon as we brought you four nail-biting games. Enjoy your evening and we'll be back with you tomorrow! Wasps v Leicester (Sunday, 15:00 GMT) That is another drama-packed day of Premiership action out of the way, but there is still more to come this weekend. Leicester Tigers, in their first game since director of rugby Richard Cockerill was sacked, travel to the Ricoh Arena to face a Wasps side looking to make an immediate return to the top of the table. You can follow all the action here on the BBC website from 14:30 GMT. FT: Harlequins 29-26 Sale To finish off the entertaining afternoon reads from the Premiership, here is the report from Harlequins' triumph over a Sale Sharks side that suffer a ninth straight defeat in all competitions. Harlequins hold on after a second-half comeback from Sale to register their seventh Premiership win of the season. FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Saracens defence and forwards coachÂ Alex SandersonÂ speaking about Brad Barritt's tackle to BT Sport: Â Â ""The citing officer is hanging around the changing rooms like the grim reaper so I can only expect repercussions."" FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Exeter head coach Rob Baxter on BT Sport: ""You've got to give a great deal of credit to Saracens, they went to 14 men early. ""But their forwards played well and took control of the game"" ""We got out of the traps, had good intensity and gave ourselves an opportunity. But after the red card, we didn't take the game by the scruff of the neck. ""In that second half there was a game there for us to take more out of and we didn't."" FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Saracens player and man-of-the-match Richard Wigglesworth speaking on BT Sport: ""We've come up against a top Exeter team and played most of the game with 14 men but we dig deep and came away worth two points. ""We defended well in the first half, had we gone more than seven points behind it would've been tough for us. ""We're not a fan of the new laws, we understand why they are there though. If we're not careful though we will make the game worse, not better."" FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Fourteen-man Saracens show incredible fortitude as they draw with Exeter after having Richard Barrington sent off after 10 minutes. Saracens have Richard Barrington sent off but battle to an impressive draw with Exeter to go top of the Premiership. FT: Northampton 32-26 Bristol Northampton Saints emerge victorious in a terrific Premiership game against a resurgent, bottom-of-the-table Bristol. Northampton Saints emerge victorious from a terrific Premiership game against a resurgent, bottom-of-the-table Bristol. FT: Gloucester 55-19 Worcester Gloucester enjoy a big win over over relegation-threatened Worcester Warriors in the Premiership, scoring seven tries at Kingsholm. Gloucester enjoy a big win over Worcester Warriors in the Premiership, scoring seven tries at Kingsholm. Saracens 13-13 Exeter And in the end, Richard Wigglesworth says we'll take the draw. That will feel like a win for Saracens who played 70 minutes with 14 men and fought back from 10-0 to take a share of the spoils. They move back to the top of the Premiership table, above Wasps, play tomorrow against Leicester. Saracens 13-13 Exeter But Saracens have turned the ball over and it will be fascinating to see how they play out this final 30 seconds. Will they be happy with the draw? Saracens 13-13 Exeter We've got a minute left on the clock here at Allianz Park and Exeter are in possession on the half-way line. They'll be desperate to get themselves into a drop-goal position you'd imagine... Harlequins 29-26 Sale It's all over at The Stoop and it's a win for Harlequins. Denny Solomona did his best to bring Sale back into the game with two tries, but Sharks will have to make do with a losing bonus point. Harlequins 29-26 Sale It's that man again. Brilliant thinking from TJ Ioane to do the crossfield kick, andDenny Solomonagoes in unopposed for his second try of the game. Will Addison misses the conversion, though, and Harlequins remain three points ahead. One minute to play at The Stoop. Northampton 32-26 Bristol It is all over in a riveting affair at Franklin's Gardens. Northampton prevail, but that losing bonus point for Bristol is enough to lift them to within one point of Worcester at the bottom of the table. For a side that lost 10 on the spin to start their league campaign, Bristol are looking a resurgent force after pushing Saints today. Northampton 32-26 Bristol There is a break in play just two minutes from the end as Jason Woodward receives treatment on a head injury. He is out cold. Eventually, however, he comes around and manages to walk off. Saracens 13-13 Exeter A man down for all but 10 minutes of this match but Saracens have not rolled over.Â Took a while to work out who dotted that one down but it's gone toTiti Lamositelefrom the line-out drive.

"FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Chiefs Sarries down to 14 after Barrington red card FT: Gloucester 55-19 Worcester Warriors FT: Harlequins 29-26 Sale Sharks FT: Northampton Saints 32-26 Bristol Louise Gwilliam and Andrew Aloia The number 13 is often said to be unlucky, but for Saracens, who came back to earn a 13-13 draw with Exeter Chiefs, that will remain a myth. They end the day top of the Premiership table. Exeter, on the other hand, won't look favourably on the number 13, should Saracens have been reduced to 13 men? Once again the talk of the day will be the new laws surrounding the high tackle. Thanks for joining us this afternoon as we brought you four nail-biting games. Enjoy your evening and we'll be back with you tomorrow! Wasps v Leicester (Sunday, 15:00 GMT) That is another drama-packed day of Premiership action out of the way, but there is still more to come this weekend. Leicester Tigers, in their first game since director of rugby Richard Cockerill was sacked, travel to the Ricoh Arena to face a Wasps side looking to make an immediate return to the top of the table. You can follow all the action here on the BBC website from 14:30 GMT. FT: Harlequins 29-26 Sale To finish off the entertaining afternoon reads from the Premiership, here is the report from Harlequins' triumph over a Sale Sharks side that suffer a ninth straight defeat in all competitions. Harlequins hold on after a second-half comeback from Sale to register their seventh Premiership win of the season. FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Saracens defence and forwards coachÂ Alex SandersonÂ speaking about Brad Barritt's tackle to BT Sport: Â Â ""The citing officer is hanging around the changing rooms like the grim reaper so I can only expect repercussions."" FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Exeter head coach Rob Baxter on BT Sport: ""You've got to give a great deal of credit to Saracens, they went to 14 men early. ""But their forwards played well and took control of the game"" ""We got out of the traps, had good intensity and gave ourselves an opportunity. But after the red card, we didn't take the game by the scruff of the neck. ""In that second half there was a game there for us to take more out of and we didn't."" FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Saracens player and man-of-the-match Richard Wigglesworth speaking on BT Sport: ""We've come up against a top Exeter team and played most of the game with 14 men but we dig deep and came away worth two points. ""We defended well in the first half, had we gone more than seven points behind it would've been tough for us. ""We're not a fan of the new laws, we understand why they are there though. If we're not careful though we will make the game worse, not better."" FT: Saracens 13-13 Exeter Fourteen-man Saracens show incredible fortitude as they draw with Exeter after having Richard Barrington sent off after 10 minutes. Saracens have Richard Barrington sent off but battle to an impressive draw with Exeter to go top of the Premiership. FT: Northampton 32-26 Bristol Northampton Saints emerge victorious in a terrific Premiership game against a resurgent, bottom-of-the-table Bristol. Northampton Saints emerge victorious from a terrific Premiership game against a resurgent, bottom-of-the-table Bristol. FT: Gloucester 55-19 Worcester Gloucester enjoy a big win over over relegation-threatened Worcester Warriors in the Premiership, scoring seven tries at Kingsholm. Gloucester enjoy a big win over Worcester Warriors in the Premiership, scoring seven tries at Kingsholm. Saracens 13-13 Exeter And in the end, Richard Wigglesworth says we'll take the draw. That will feel like a win for Saracens who played 70 minutes with 14 men and fought back from 10-0 to take a share of the spoils. They move back to the top of the Premiership table, above Wasps, play tomorrow against Leicester. Saracens 13-13 Exeter But Saracens have turned the ball over and it will be fascinating to see how they play out this final 30 seconds. Will they be happy with the draw? Saracens 13-13 Exeter We've got a minute left on the clock here at Allianz Park and Exeter are in possession on the half-way line. They'll be desperate to get themselves into a drop-goal position you'd imagine... Harlequins 29-26 Sale It's all over at The Stoop and it's a win for Harlequins. Denny Solomona did his best to bring Sale back into the game with two tries, but Sharks will have to make do with a losing bonus point. Harlequins 29-26 Sale It's that man again. Brilliant thinking from TJ Ioane to do the crossfield kick, andDenny Solomonagoes in unopposed for his second try of the game. Will Addison misses the conversion, though, and Harlequins remain three points ahead. One minute to play at The Stoop. Northampton 32-26 Bristol It is all over in a riveting affair at Franklin's Gardens. Northampton prevail, but that losing bonus point for Bristol is enough to lift them to within one point of Worcester at the bottom of the table. For a side that lost 10 on the spin to start their league campaign, Bristol are looking a resurgent force after pushing Saints today. Northampton 32-26 Bristol There is a break in play just two minutes from the end as Jason Woodward receives treatment on a head injury. He is out cold. Eventually, however, he comes around and manages to walk off. Saracens 13-13 Exeter A man down for all but 10 minutes of this match but Saracens have not rolled over.Â Took a while to work out who dotted that one down but it's gone toTiti Lamositelefrom the line-out drive. Alex Lozowski slots his conversion and Sarries have levelled the scores. Gloucester 55-19 Worcester And it is over at Kingholm in what has been a try bonanza! Gloucester do it easy against Worcester. Saracens 6-13 Exeter And from the drive Saracens win yet another penalty as their forwards power towards the line. Exeter are pinged for collapsing the maul and the decision once more is for the corner. Seven minutes left to play... Saracens 6-13 Exeter Exactly what Exeter wouldn't have wanted. They concede the penalty just inside their own half to give Saracens a chance, but the champions ignore the shot at goal and go for the corner.

I just wonder if this game comes at the wrong time for Barrow, who had not lost for 23 games since August untilthey were battered by Gatesheadon New Year's Eve, but maybe they had one eye on this tie. There will be a fantastic atmosphere because the game is a 4,400 sell-out - Barrow's biggest crowd in 27 years - to see them try to get to the fourth round for the first time in their 116-year history. It will not be easy for them, because Rochdale are going well at the top end of League One so even a draw would be a fantastic result for the National League side. That would also mean Barrow earn more money from the replay, something I like to see the little clubs get out of the FA Cup.

I just wonder if this game comes at the wrong time for Barrow, who had not lost for 23 games since August untilthey were battered by Gatesheadon New Year's Eve, but maybe they had one eye on this tie. There will be a fantastic atmosphere because the game is a 4,400 sell-out - Barrow's biggest crowd in 27 years - to see them try to get to the fourth round for the first time in their 116-year history. It will not be easy for them, because Rochdale are going well at the top end of League One so even a draw would be a fantastic result for the National League side. That would also mean Barrow earn more money from the replay, something I like to see the little clubs get out of the FA Cup. This video can not be played FA Cup: Curzon Ashton 3-4 AFC Wimbledon highlights SuttonandAFC Wimbledonare only five miles apart and, as well as it being a derby, Sutton play on a 3G pitch which will be a bit different for the League One side too. But, having seen them in their amazing comebackto beat Curzon Ashton in round two,I am backing Wimbledon. They have got some very quick attackers and I think they will have too much for Sutton.

"International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced a review of the girl band's funding last month A group described as Ethiopia's version of the Spice Girls receives front page billing in the Daily Mail - not for its latest chart-topping single, but for adecision to pull the plug on its funding from Britain's foreign aid budget,external. The paper says the move by ministers is a victory for its campaign to highlight waste in the foreign aid budget at a time when social care is in crisis. Last month, it reported that the five-piece band, Yegna, had been given a Â£5.2m grant as part of a three year programme aimed at empowering women in Ethiopia. The paper has the headline: ""Aid: NOW they're listening"". A number of papers lead with the pressures facing the health service in England.The Guardian highlights the warning by the British Red Cross that the NHS is facing a ""humanitarian crisis"",externalas hospitals and ambulance services struggle to keep up with rising demands. The headline inthe i,externalis: ""No room at A&E"".  It says overflowing casualty departments shut their doors to patients more than 140 times last month, a 68% rise on the same period the previous year. The Daily Telegraph says NHS hospitals have been accused oftrying to ""spin their way out"" of the growing winter crisis,externalafter a leaked memo revealed that managers were being instructed to play down the scale of the problem. The paper has seen an NHS memo telling health officials the ""most important thing"" is to avoid language such as ""black alert"" - the phrase used to denote the most serious level of emergency. Several leader writers and commentators take time to reflect on the Brexit negotiations ahead following the resignation of Britain's ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers. Sir Ivan resigned from his post on Tuesday The Guardian,externalsays the new ambassador Sir Tim Barrow faces the daunting task of stopping a tumble towards a disorderly exit. Where once the choice seemed to be between hard and soft Brexit, the new worry is of a ""train crash"" Brexit - a scenario in which incompatible negotiating demands from Downing Street and the other 27 countries results in Britain walking away without a deal. The Sun urges Britain to enter the negotiations,externalwithout fearing what it calls the consequences of EU pig-headedness and be prepared to walk away rather than sign a bad deal in haste. The Telegraph,externalacknowledges the talks will be a painstaking, detailed task.In the Mail's view,external, however, Britain has an extremely strong hand as Europe's best market. The Express vents its anger at the Scottish First Minister,external, Nicola Sturgeon, for suggesting that a soft Brexit could remove the prospect of Scottish independence for the time being.  It says a Brexit without winning back control of our borders, laws, taxes and trading relationships would be a ""fake"" Brexit. The Financial Times,externalsays Theresa May has had a difficult start to the New Year, with the resignation of Sir Ivan and tensions in government over her management style. The Prime Minister gets a mixed review from Saturday's newspapers The threat by the Conservative Party donor, Sir Andrew Cook, to withdraw financial support if Mrs May pulls Britain out of the EU's single market, is the main story forthe Times,external. The paper says sections of the business world are pressing ministers to pursue a ""soft Brexit"", allowing Britain to have access to the single market in return for some form of payment and a compromise over free movement. The Mail takes aim at the Economist,externalfor what it calls a sneering hatchet-job in this week's issue, in which it accused the Prime Minister of indecision and muddle.  The newspaper urges her to ignore the carping and get on with the job. With a 17 point lead in the polls, it says, she has the country firmly on her side, and the prize is huge. That prize,the Telegraph agrees,external, is going down in history as one of our great prime ministers if she can pull off a successful Brexit and begin to rebuild the UK's domestic institutions. The Guardian pays tribute to Michelle Obama,external, following her final speech yesterday as America's First Lady before President Obama leaves office. It describes her as the most inspirational First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. Like Mrs Roosevelt, she has proved to be not an old-fashioned helpmeet nor an ornament, but a powerful advocate of equality in her own right, the paper says. It recalls that Mrs Obama was born into a black working-class family that encouraged and expected her to excel, amid the deep racism of 1960s Chicago.  Those experiences, it says, have given her both a deep sense of what is wrong with America and of what people are capable of achieving. The Express leads with research suggesting that an hour's snooze after lunch is good for your health,external.  American scientists believe it can prevent your brain from ageing and help you perform better in memory tests. Siestas are good for you, but they cannot be any longer than 60 minutes, according to researchers They examined 3,000 adults over the age of 65 and found that those who slept in the afternoon were better able to solve simple maths problems and memorise words - and those who didn't, performed badly. But the paper warns that the nap has to be for 60 minutes.  A longer or shorter siesta won't have the same effect. Finally, forget about camping, or glamping.The Times,externalreports that more and more people are choosing to spend their weekend breaks ""champing"" - camping in churches. Apparently, the trend grew four-fold last year and the Churches Conservation Trust, which runs the scheme, is raising the number of churches taking part from seven to 12. The experience is basic, the paper warns, with no central heating, no showers, and no curtains. But prices start from Â£19 a night. A spokeswoman tells the paper: ""We didn't want people to see our churches as museum pieces.  Instead, we wanted them to be living, vibrant places.""

"The erroneously-delivered envelope had a picture of kittens on it A woman who has received a mysterious thank you letter for the third year in a row is trying to unite it with the intended receivers. Jessica Wren, 46, from Camden, in London, found the hand-written letter on her doorstep earlier this week. It is decorated with dolphin stickers and a cut-out image of kittens, addressed inside to Alex, Irene and Anya, signed by a child called Tabby. Psychologist Mrs Wren said she is keen to get the letter to the right people. ""There's no surname for these people or for the girl who is writing these letters, but this time she has gone to the trouble of decorating the paper with finger painting too, so I really want it to reach the people it's meant for,"" Mrs Wren said. Tabby writes: ""To Alex, Irene and Anya, Happy New Year! ""Thank you very much for the lovely Frozen nightdress you gave me for Christmas - it's my first ever nightdress as I usually wear Pyjamas and I Love it! ""Lots of love from Tabby xxx"" Mrs Wren, who has lived in the same house in Mansfield Road for 10 years, has no idea who Alex, Irene or Anya might be and without a surname Google searches have turned nothing up. She has resorted to posting a message on Facebook with the help of her children Eliza, 17 and Tash, 15. Mrs Wren said: ""It could be a godparent or maybe a relation and the sad thing is the receiver has no idea the child is writing to them, because they have the wrong address.""

"Donald Trump and US spies have disagreed openly on hacking during the US election It is not unprecedented for political leaders to fall-out with spies. But a row has never before played out so publicly - with rival pronouncements over Twitter and in front of Congress. Two competing forces are clashing. First, the intelligence community's credibility, which has been called into question by President-elect Donald Trump. And second, the legitimacy of Mr Trump's presidency, called into question by the intelligence community's conclusion that the Kremlin sought to support his election. Neither side is likely to back off and both may come out damaged. Relations between political leaders and intelligence officials have always had their ups and downs. In the late 1970s, after a series of Congressional committees raised fears of the CIA having got out of control, President Carter brought in a new director, Stansfield Turner, who cleared out the agency of many of its staff leading to much unhappiness. CIA Director James Woolsey did not so much have a bad relationship as no relationship at all with Bill Clinton, to the extent that when a small aircraft crashed on the White House lawn, the joke was that it was Mr Woolsey trying to get a meeting with the president. Under George W Bush, there was real tension, especially in the aftermath of the intelligence community's failure over Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and on briefings about the future of Iraq. President Bush appointed Republican Congressman Porter Goss to try and align the agency more closely with the White House. But the result was a disastrous falling out between Mr Goss's senior staff and top officials at the CIA. Goss only lasted a year. What Trump's tweets tell us Is Russia behind election hack? Trump backs Julian Assange over hacking claim 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Does Trump need a daily CIA briefing? It is a precedent that incoming CIA Director - another Republic Congressman, Mike Pompeo - will only be too aware of as he prepares to take the helm. One thing that has been notable is that since his nomination he has offered very little public comment. On the whole, those close to the CIA have suggested officials there are less worried by his nomination than that of other officials likeincoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. He is reported to have a degree of animosity towards the CIA and the Directorate of National Intelligence (which plays an over-arching role) after his stint running the Defence Intelligence Agency. This video can not be played CIA director John Brennan tells the BBC what global threats Donald Trump will face as US president There are reports that the Trump team may also push through reforms of the intelligence community - which might be seen by some insiders as a veiled threat. This could aim to reduce the role of Director of National Intelligence and could also push the CIA towards a different operational stance. The CIA has just undergone a major re-organisation under John Brennan. In an  interview in November, Mr Brennan told me he would be highlighting to his successor the importance of modernisation and also ensuring the most diverse possible workforce. He also confessed that while he was hopeful he would get the chance to advise the incoming team on how to best employ the range of covert capabilities that the CIA has its disposal - which include drone strikes - he did not know how far the new team would take that advice on board. Staff at the agencies will be wondering what policies they will be expected to carry out. Donald Trump talked of a return to waterboarding during the campaign. The legacy of the use of such techniques during the Bush years continues to be highly sensitive within the agency with battles in the Obama administration over how far to distance itself from the agency's past. The NSA, which has also undergone a bruising internal reform process, may also be worried. After the trauma of the Snowden revelations and the subsequent emphasis on not being a 'rogue agency', and on compliance, there may now be concerns over whether a new president may deploy its powerful capabilities in a way which might, if it became public, be highly controversial. The CIA under President Barack Obama has tried to distance itself from its less salubrious past The intelligence community has historically gone through cycles in which first a president pushes for controversial covert action, be it assassination plots, domestic intelligence collection or waterboarding. But then after it is revealed, there is a swing of the pendulum the other way by a new administration, often leaving officers feeling exposed for past actions. They may be wondering whether the pendulum is about to swing again. But in the Trump era they also may be wondering whether something different is about to happen. When weapons of mass destruction were not found in Iraq, spies and politicians in London and Washington engaged in an uneasy truce. Both sides realised they had been complicit in the presentation of intelligence to the public which proved wrong and that if they turned on each other in a blame game, it would be bloody, vicious and self-destructive. Mr Trump plays by different rules to previous US leaders But in this current stand-off, the situation is different, not least because we are at a moment of transition and the current intelligence officials are on their way out and may feel they have little to lose by speaking out. Donald Trump also plays by different rules. But the result is that if a public spat continues and even escalates, both the intelligence community and the incoming political leadership could emerge damaged.

"Ulas Arik, centre, buried his father on New Year's Day, hours after the attack Just 12 hours had passed, but for Ulas Arik it was beginning to sink in. His father Ayhan, a driver, had taken foreign tourists to Istanbul's Reina nightclub to see in the New Year. As the party continued inside, Ayhan waited at the door, drinking tea with a policeman. When the gunman struck, Ayhan was shot in the head. He died instantly. In the biting wind of New Year's Day, we stood in an Istanbul mosque watching Ulas and his family bid farewell to his father. The young boy, perhaps 14 years old, stood beside the coffin, which was draped in a Turkish flag. And he wept. He touched the flag - the red that once symbolised the blood of martyrs fighting for Turkey. Then he slumped onto the coffin, broken-hearted. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen was one of the first journalists allowed into the nightclub site Standing there among the journalists and mourners, I reflected on how often this scene had been repeated in the past year, on how many funerals I'd watched as terror has gripped Turkey, and about how we, as journalists, intrude upon personal grief. Our route here is now a tragically well-worn path: the morgue, the homes of relatives, the funeral. And yet each time it hits hard. There was something particularly emotional about watching Ulas at the funeral that day and meeting those who had witnessed the massacre in the Reina nightclub. Like Tuvana Tugsavul, who worked there and who ran into the bathroom to escape the attack. Her eyes ringed with fatigue, she told me how the power was suddenly cut and she thought the gunman would blow himself up. ""I sent messages to my friends saying 'this is the endâ¦ I love youâ¦ goodbye.'"" Tuvana survived the attack, hiding in one of the club's bathrooms And then there was the poignancy of the words of Sezen Arseven, whose partner Mustafa was killed: ""I lost my other half"", she wrote, ""my partner, my love"". All this grief adds up to a national trauma. Twenty-eight attacks in a year and a half have killed more than 500 people. After each one, the government says ""Turkey will defeat terrorism"". Politicians must say such things, but the words lose meaning when the attacks keep happening. There is a certain defiance here: after the twin bombings at Besiktas football stadium in Istanbul last month, crowds gathered at the site for days, one woman telling me ""the terrorists want us to stay inside, not to go out and enjoy ourselves - but then they would win"". Turkey nightclub shooting: The victims Partygoers describe Istanbul massacre Istanbul's glamorous Reina nightclub In pictures: Istanbul after club attack But there is also, of course, deepening fear: that a city to which Arab tourists came to enjoy themselves on New Year's Eve was consumed by horror; police and soldiers wonder if they'll be blown up on patrol; that Turkey has gone from being a stable corner of the Middle East to yet another troubled hotspot. One friend tells me she wouldn't take the metro in Istanbul anymore, another that he would avoid public gatherings and concerts. Three years ago, Istanbul topped lists of the world's must-visit cities. Now tourism is plummeting and businesses are closing down. No matter that this is a huge country and the likelihood of an attack on its golden beaches is minimal - tourism works through image, and Turkey's has been blackened. If only this nation could come together in times of tragedy, it might help ease the pain. But Turkey is torn by anger and division. The damage seen a a local cafe after a 5 January car bomb in Izmir, which killed two people In the run-up to the Reina attack, Islamist newspapers condemned Christmas and New Year celebrations as an affront to Muslim values, some showing a Santa Claus figure being punched. Daring to criticise the government's policies is like poking a wasps' nest, unleashing vitriol on social media the likes of which I've never seen. Supporters of President Erdogan insist the west has abandoned Turkey to fight terrorism alone; pro-government newspapers churn out conspiracy theories that the CIA is behind the attacks. One front page superimposed Barack Obama's face onto that of the nightclub killer. A famous fashion designer and outspoken critic of the government was deported from northern Cyprus this week for tweets deemed to insult Turkey. As he landed in Turkey, he was set upon by an organised mob on the runway, who had conveniently been informed of his flight details through a state news agency report. He has now been arrested while the thugs roam free. Gloom has descended onto this beautiful and fascinating country - and nobody knows how or when it will lift. People do still go about their daily lives. But when my phone beeps with an alert, I always wonder if it's another attack. There is a lovely Turkish expression that is normally used to mean ""get well soon"". But these days it is on everyone's lips, urging their country to get through this time:geÃ§miÅ olsun- ""may it pass"".

Financially, it will put the club in a very strong position, and I think people will remember this day for a long, long time - albeit in defeat.â Brentford 5-1 Eastleigh Eastleigh manager Martin Allen told Radio Solent: ""There was a worry at half-time that the players would back off, show fear and they certainly didnât do that. âI thought we took the game to Brentford in the second half, kept a clean sheet in the second half and I wanted the players in the second half to go out and do their families proud, and they certainly did that."" (On return to his former club Brentford) âIt was very emotional for me, I had to do all I could not to shed a couple of tears as I walked across that pitch, but it was an amazing moment and probably one of the highlights of my career to get that sort of reception from all those people, it was a magical moment for me personally.â West Brom 1-2 Derby Derby midfielder Tom Ince, speaking to BBC Radio Derby about his match-winning free-kick:""It's about time I got one in. I practise free-kicks a lot in training, and it's nice to do it on a match day.Â ""The free-kick was in an awkward position where I couldn't really put it into the box for a cross. The goalkeeper had three in the wall, and he left a lot of space to his left, so I thought that if I was able to get it up and over the wall and on target, then I'd give myself a chance. As soon as it went over the wall, the keeper didn't move - and I think he knew straight away that was in.Â ""It was a fantastic performance all round. It's always a big test when you come to a Premier League side, especially when you're away from home - but I thought we played ever so well."" Ipswich 2-2 Lincoln Lincoln boss Danny Cowley:""My players were heroic for me today, absolutely heroic. ""There was a tinge of disappointment at the end, but the overriding emotion in the dressing room is one of pride. ""We went toe-to-toe with a good, experienced Championship side and gave a very good account of ourselves. We spoke all week that a success for us would have been getting a standing ovation at the end. ""We wanted to give our supporters something to remember and for a National League club to have 5,000 supporters away from home says everything about them. If we can be half as good as our supporters, we will be a very good team.""Â Preston 1-0 Arsenal You can catch up with the latest from Deepdale here.Â Watford 2-0 Burton Albion Watford Watford Head Coach Walter Mazzarri:""I was very happy with the new faces. (Brandon) Mason made his full debut andÂ managed to do very well. It is something important for the long-term future of the club. ""It is a good win for a team not doing very well with results. This today will help with confidence for Premier League. ""It is very important to win, especially for our fans. We wanted to give them this satisfaction and hopefully we can do the same next week againstÂ Middlesbrough."" West Brom 1-2 Derby West Bromwich Albion West Brom manager Tony Pulis, speaking to BBC WM:""I'm really proud of the players. They've worked so hard. We battered them. We needed a break and we didn't get a break. Â ""The two goals they scored are disappointing from our point of view. We should have dealt with the first one - we stepped away from their player.Â Â ""With the second one, we'll have to talk about the wall. I've been in to see Jon [Moss, the referee], and he's marked out 13 paces for that free-kick. With others in the game, he's marked out 10 paces. Those are the breaks you need to get through in cup football."" Millwall 3-0 Bournemouth Unconfirmed at this stage but there are reports that defender Nathan Ake is going to return to Chelsea from his loan spell at Bournemouth - where has has impressed.Â Paul Cox not a fan of 'going digital' there.Â Barrow 0-2 Rochdale Barrow manager Paul Cox:""We were on the verge of making history in this competition but it's over, it's chip paper, and I've told the players it is now all about how we react from today's defeat in terms of our mind-set and approach. ""There has to be a sense of pride that we've got as far as we have and while I'd love for us to have been more clinical in front of goal, realistically I don't think we were good enough to win the game today."" Hull 2-0 Swansea Swansea City Swansea manager Paul Clement:""I wouldnât say we need an influx because there are good players in this squad already. ""But we are looking to do something, and we have got to make sure the players we bring in are better than what we have got. âWe are also working hard on the training field to get my ideas across as quickly as possible. Thatâs an area where we can help improve the team, as well as bringing in new signings.â Â  Steven Naismith's injury-time header secures a replay for Championship side Norwich City against Southampton in the FA Cup third round.

Â Bolton 0-0 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: ""We're still in the hat. Bolton gave us a real good game. I want us to get better - I wouldn't say I was satisfied with what I saw. ""We haven't kept a clean sheet for a while at this club, so we've got that. And we'll take Bolton back to our place later this month. ""For me we should have had enough to beat Bolton, if I'm honest. If we were clinical we would have."" Stoke 0-2 Wolves Stoke City Stoke manager Mark Hughes: ""We lost the game on the first half, the strength of the XI we put out should have been capable of getting a result this afternoon. ""We wanted a cup run, sadly that's not the case and that's disappointing. We need to pick up and get our act together next week now.""

"Mohamed Maouche says he and his wife, Khadidja, were the first ambassadors of the revolution One day in late 1958, at the height of the Algerian war of independence, an Algerian couple in their early twenties hopped into a fast car, put on some music and set off on honeymoon from the French capital Paris. Mohamed and Khadidja Maouche spent the next 48 hours on a whirlwind tour. In a MG convertible - painted British racing green - they drove west to Le Havre, then south to Rennes and Bordeaux, east to Nimes, before heading back up north to Troyes and Reims. Mohamed was a footballer and had a letter from his club, Stade de Reims, stating that he was authorised to be on leave so that he could celebrate his marriage. Mohamed and Khadidja were newlyweds - but their honeymoon was an elaborate disguise. Khadidja secretly recruited Algerian players in France for the liberation movement In fact, they were on a covert operation for the independence movement Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN), which four years earlier had started a fight against French rule in Algeria. Their secret mission was to persuade Algerian-born footballers to secretly abandon their top-flight French clubs to play for a team set up by FLN. Khadidja's role was pivotal. She worked with a collective of Paris-based Algerian lawyers who defended FLN activists and at 20 years old, was the FLN's youngest liaison officer in France. ""I was in charge of contacting the players, either before or during the games,"" Khadidja says. ""No-one knew I was married to Maouche. They would just be told a FLN activist wanted to speak to them. I would talk to them individually to say: ""It's an order, that's it,"" and they all agreed."" The Algerian couple toured France in this MG convertible as they recruited players for the FLN Mohamed and Khadidja's enterprise was risky. Both had already served time in prison and were under surveillance by the French intelligence services. Khadidja was also on the target list of La Main Rouge, a shadowy group sponsored by the French state to eliminate FLN members and supporters. But Mohamed remembers those days of danger and the ""crazy"" story of the car with affection. ""We had to be sure of ourselves. If you weren't sure of yourself there was no point in going on such missions because, in the worst case scenario, this could cost you dearly. So we were very relaxed."" They drove for 48 hours, practically non-stop, and music was a constant companion. Mohammed Maouche left French club Stade de Reims and joined the FLN team in 1960 ""I loved music so much because it was also a good way to pass the time,"" Mohamed says. ""There was this one song we used to play. It was by Richard Anthony and it was about a little MG. It was extraordinary. With hair flying in the wind in the open-top car. Oh, we were so young,"" he giggles. After recruiting the players, Khadidja and Mohamed instructed them to slip over the border to Switzerland. Khadidja was told by the FLN man in charge in Geneva to go to a supermarket called Mi-Gros to collect forged travel documents. As she shopped, she was approached and greeted by a man. ""He kissed me and while he was kissing me he said ""open your bag!"" In went 15 passports, which allowed Khadidja, Mohamed and the footballers to go to Italy and catch a ferry to Tunisia - where the FLN was based. There, they joined nine other footballers - three of whom were part of the French 1958 World Cup squad and whose defection earlier in the year struck a real blow to the French establishment. Mohamed also played for Algeria's oldest football club, Constantine The FLN team was ready to kick off and over the next four years until independence in 1962, the players went on tours to countries including Iraq, Vietnam and Hungary to highlight the Algerian struggle for independence. They played attacking, entertaining and winning football before huge crowds of up to 80,000. ""We were the first ambassadors of the revolution and the Algerian people,"" Mohamed believes. ""Because most people did not know that there was a real war in Algeria. We spoke to people after the match and the next day there were interviews and that's how they discovered Algeria. We were true ambassadors."" Le onze de l'independence, as the FLN team was also known, proved to be a powerful way of winning hearts and minds. Seeing a team of eleven in white shorts and green shirts on the football pitch made an imagined Algeria real. Mohamed Maouche finally joined the FLN team in 1960 and recalls his first match against Libya, which they won 11-0. ""It was really extraordinary because we lined up and the flags go upâ¦ and when I saw our flag, the national emblem in the airâ¦ with its star and crescent, my heart was racing and I had goosebumps and we all said 'Vive l'Algerie'.""

"It is as if the campaign is still going on. Two weeks away from his inauguration, Donald Trump seems to prefer the role of ""candidate"" -  flaying his opponents and aiming arrows at the federal government from the enemy camp. It is almost as if he does not want to accept fully that he is the new chief executive who will be dealing with official Washington from the moment he drives back from the Capitol as the president on 20 January. And his weapon of choice, forged for him like a legendary warrior's sword in the furnace of the new technology, is Twitter. No president-elect has battled like this. Most of them go to ground, secluded with the staff who will take over the West Wing, and make their plans. Dream their dreams, you might say. They have followed the golden rule: do not give too much away, because it will make life more difficult when the inauguration is over and the business of power begins. Trump Tweetwatch: 'I'm a big fan' of intelligence agencies Trump Tweetwatch: N Korea nuclear plans 'won't happen' The Trump Twitter account is not just a break with that pattern, but a challenge to the very idea. His New Year tweet (one of them, I should say) wished love to everyone ""including my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do"". Mr Trump wished love to everyone via Twitter at the turn of the year The implication, of course, is that he does know what he is going to do. The trouble with his Twitter account is that it makes you wonder. More than 34,000 tweets to nearly 19 million followers (many ""enemies"" among them, no doubt) and a narrative that has become a kind of stream of consciousness. They read like the unfiltered, disconnected thoughts of someone for whom patience is an ugly word. You always have to say something, even if you say the opposite the next day. On Twitter, who cares? Yet, the messages are powerful. One contemptuous tweet about the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives winding down the Office of Congressional Ethics led them tobeat a humiliating retreatand cancel the plan. Mr Trump's choice as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the other day: ""Whatever he tweets, he is going to drive the news."" And, bizarre though it may seem, the South Korean government is poring over them. The JoongAng Daily reported that a Twitter-watching position had been set up in the foreign ministry in Seoul ""because we don't yet have an insight into his foreign policies"". What insight will they get from tweets which have criticised the Central Intelligence Agency, praised Julian Assange - the Whistleblower of WikiLeaks and a bete noire to most Republicans - and praised President Putin, who gets more friendly treatment than all Democrats and some Republicans at home? And remarkably the tweets take aim at the entire intelligence community in Washington. What precisely are the South Koreans meant to make of that? Not too much, you may think, because who can tell how this mercurial candidate is going to be moulded into a president? We still do not know and what his Twitter account tells us - colourfully, astonishingly, sometimes hilariously - is that he is refusing to let us know. Far from revealing what a Trump presidency is going to be like - as he says his tweets do - they have the effect of enveloping him in a thick fog. Yes we know he will ""make America great again"", cut immigration, build his wall, cut taxes, be Israel's greatest ally and so on. But how he is going to build a White House team on foreign affairs and security, conduct relations with Capitol Hill, deal with allies in Nato and the rolling chaos in the Middle East, we have very little idea. And when the first crisis arrives - as it will before long - will he be able to find the calm that he needs? Where it all began: Trump's Twitter page in April 2009 No president-elect in modern times has said so much and revealed so little. We know how Mr Trump feels about almost everything, but about priorities, his approach to the compromises of power, the way he will deal with the bureaucracy - in practice we know very little. A week or two before election day in November, one of his close associates told me that, if he won, Mr Trump had agreed that in office he would relinquish control of that Twitter account, because it would be inappropriate in the White House. The satirists' loss, certainly. But, if it happens, a step into reality, at last. Some day he has to stop being the candidate and playing that game, even though he enjoys it so much. So the first great test for the Trump White House team is surely getting his finger off that keyboard. Trump Tweetwatch: N Korea nuclear plans 'won't happen' How might China respond to Trump tweets?

"Overcrowding is a serious problem A spate of violence in Brazil's prisons has cast a spotlight on a system which appears to be near a state of collapse. Almost 100 inmates lost their lives in the first week of January alone - brutally murdered, the guards apparently unable to stop the bloodshed. But how has it come to this? A crackdown on violent and drug-related offences in recent years has seen Brazil's prison population soar since the turn of the century. The prison in Roraima state where 33 inmates were killed on 6 January held 1,400 inmates when a deadly riot started. That is double its capacity. Overcrowding makes it hard for prison authorities to keep rival factions separate. It also raises tensions inside the cells, with inmates competing for limited resources such as mattresses and food. In the relatively wealthy state of Sao Paulo, a single guard oversees 300 to 400 prisoners in some prisons, Camila Dias, a sociologist at the Federal University of ABC in Sao Paulo and expert on Brazil's prison system, told Reuters. That means it is relatively easy for prisoners - and gangs - to take control of the facilities. As a result, ""when the prisoners want to have an uprising, they have an uprising,"" Ms Dias said. Drugs gang 'kills 33 inmates' in Brazilian jail Brazil sets out security overhaul after deadly riot Brazil prison riot kills at least 56 Killings are already common within the walls of Brazil's prisons - 372 inmates lost their lives in this way in 2016, according to Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper - but this recent surge has been linked to the breakdown in a two-decade truce of sorts between the country's two most powerful gangs. A lack of guards means prisoners can take control, experts say. Pictured: A riot in 2014 Up until recently, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) drug gang and Rio de Janeiro's Red Command had a working relationship, supposedly to ensure the flow of marijuana, cocaine and guns over Brazil's porous borders and into its cities. But recently they have fallen out - although the exact reasons why remain unclear. And following the government crackdown on criminal gangs, there are thousands of members of both gangs locked up inside Brazilian prisons. Rafael Alcadipani, a public security expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank in Sao Paulo, told Reuters it means any feud between the two sides on the streets will almost certainly spill over into the largely ""self-regulated"" jails. ""We see that as soon as we have a gang war, these killings are inevitably going to happen because the state has no control over the prisons,"" he said. Many Brazilian prisons are underfunded. The army patrols outside a prison in northern Brazil where more than 30 inmates died Following the deadly riots in Amazonas, state governor Jose Melo asked the federal government for equipment such as scanners, electronic tags and devices which block mobile phone signals inside prisons. His request illustrates the lack of basic equipment in prisons which house large numbers of prisoners. He also said that the state police force was struggling to cope and requested that federal forces be sent. Poorly-trained and badly-paid prison guards often face inmates who not only outnumber them but who also feel they have little to lose as they face long sentences already. Following the 1 January riot, which left 56 inmates dead in a prison in Manaus, the Brazilian government announced a plan to modernise the prison system. But with Brazil going through its worst recession in two decades and a 20-year cap on public spending in place, it is hard to see how the government plans to fund it.

"A fridge with personality was launched at CES this year Virtual assistants are everywhere at CES this year - but one speaks louder than the rest. Amazon's Alexa has popped up in a bewildering list of devices including fridges, cars and robots. Manufacturers are clearly interested in making their appliances voice-operable, and many see Alexa as a great way to do this. But having Alexa also allows the appliances to gain capabilities, such as streaming music and turning smart lights on and off. How did Alexa come out on top and how will it benefit Amazon? The firm was quick to notice the potential of voice control following the rise of smartphone apps that could interact with appliances, answers tech analyst Dinesh Kithany at IHS Technology. ""Alexa's rivals haven't been promoted quite as well,"" he told the BBC, though he noted companies adopting the assistant must think of genuinely useful ways to integrate it into their products. Alexa made its debut on Amazon's Echo speakers Manufacturers are able to design new ""skills"" for the assistant - meaning the AI is not limited to what Amazon has built in. Alexa can, with a quick bit of programming, be adapted to lock car doors or tell you when your washing machine's cycle will finish. Perhaps this is how Amazon has cornered so much of the market - by explicitly designing a flexible AI that allows companies to implement it as they see fit. Over the last seven years, the world has witnessed the rapid proliferation of Google's Android operating system - now in more smartphones than any other OS by far, as well as many TVs, watches and computers. Part of this meteoric rise is down to the fact that Google gives Android away for free to device manufacturers - just like Amazon is doing with Alexa. Despite the search giant having a long history ofvoice recognition research,external, it has only just started promoting its own Google Assistant to third parties. That gives Amazon first-mover advantage. Who would have thought an online retailer would be leading the virtual assistant revolution? While a glance around CES's show floors suggests Alexa is poised to dominate, it's worth remembering that this is a US trade show. Amazon is not quite as global a company as Google or Microsoft - the online retailer doesn't have a website for countries in Scandinavia, the Middle East or Africa, for example. And not all implementations of Alexa make the assistant easy to access,notes Lauren Goode at news site The Verge,external. She tested headphones by OnVocal that make the aide accessible - via a tiny button that needs to be pressed to activate it. ""You'd kind of think that walking around while wearing these is just as good as having an Echo strapped to your body. It's not,"" she wrote. This video can not be played Rory Cellan-Jones meets the Alexa-powered robot Lynx She's the star of CES even though her creator isn't exhibiting on the show floor. Amazon's Alexa was the first voice assistant to turn up in a compelling consumer product, the Echo speaker, rather than just on a smartphone. Although Google Home has now joined the fray it's clear who's in the lead. Across CES, you can hear Amazon's creation at work. Who'd have thought a few years back that an online retailer with a patchy record when it comes to hardware devices would be the single most influential player at a consumer electronics event? In the past, it has been Apple and Google who've been able to dominate CES without even turning up - now Amazon is looking like the tech industry's thought leader. Nvidia has chosen to integrate Google Assistant with its new streaming box While Alexa may be popular, it certainly has rivals. Nvidia announced at CES that itsmedia streaming device, Shield,external, would feature Google Assistant - allowing users to display photos on their TV screens via voice command, for example. It can also connect with the Nest smart thermostat and adjust the temperature - or turn on smart home devices. Microsoft's Cortana will, of course, be available in Windows 10 devices -a wide array of which were launched this week,external. But curiously, despite publishing a teaser video fora Harman Kardon speaker featuring Cortanalast month, the product failed to materialise. Harman Kardon told the BBC that the device was ""not ready for display"". A Harman Kardon speaker featuring Cortana, though teased in December, was not at CES The battle of the AIs doesn't even end there. In October, Samsung acquiredfledgling AI Viv,externaland is expected to launch it with the firm's Galaxy S8 smartphone later in 2017. It is worth noting that the South Korean tech giant has also agreedto buy Harman Kardon,external. Will Viv nudge out Cortana in future Harman Kardon speakers and one day give Alexa a run for its money? It's anyone's guess at this point. And there was an interesting announcement from Mattel's Nabi brand, which makes child-friendly tech. Its new Aristotle speaker incorporates Alexa and will soon feature Cortana, too. Parents can even set it so that children speaking to the device must say ""please"" when uttering a command. It should be no surprise that more than one branded virtual assistant can be accessible via a single device - they are summoned from the cloud, after all. In the future, other appliances might allow users to call on the virtual assistant of their choice by name for specific tasks. Not just one digital butler, but a whole staff. Apple's Siri is not to be forgotten. It can be used to interact with several smart home devices unveiled at CES - including a smart smoke detector by Netatmo andChamberlain garage door openers,external. This video can not be played Even more voice-activated assistants are entering the market - Olly the robot develops a different personality to suit each of its users Voice control is ""the way of the future"", said tech analyst Adam Simon from Context. ""It has really galvanised the smart home market,"" he said. ""At last we've got something bringing it together."" One downside cited by some is the potential for a greater proliferation of microphones and AIs to erode privacy - particularly in intimate settings such as the bedroom. But Mr Simon told the BBC that consumers would decide whether or not to tolerate this. ""My own inclination is that people will accept that this is a necessary evil,"" he said.

"LeEco sounds French to some - but the firm is a home-grown Chinese venture China's disregard for intellectual property, and a turn-a-blind-eye culture when it comes to blatant counterfeiting, is notorious - the butt of many jokes. And itâs been fair. In China they don't just counterfeit devices, they counterfeit entire shops - a knock-off Apple store was closed down in 2015. Instances like this play into the Westâs view of China as the worldâs shameless imitator. A place where great ideas from the US and Europe go off to be assembled as cheaply as possible. It's time to update that view. At CES, the US's biggest trade show, Chinese companies could be found competing not only on price, but on fantastic ideas and design. As China's consumers have matured - and by that I mean, got a lot richer - so too has its technology industry. Like many a British popstar, China is intent on breaking America. But the question is whether Chinese firms can earn greater trust from Western consumers. 'Sounds French' Occupying a sizable booth in CES's North Hall is LeEco. It's pronounced ""Luh"" and ""eco"" as in ecosystem. On display here is a concept Tesla-like sportscar, some Smart bikes with Google's Android software built in, and a 12in (30cm) TV. The point: they do a lot. Chinese billionaire Jia Yueting, chief executive of LeEco, has been at CES this year LeEco was for a while known as the Netflix of China, a company that streamed content and eventually started making its own original material. Now it's branching out quickly into hardware - and started selling devices in the US at the tail end of last year. ""People assume LeEcoâ¦ they think it sounds French,â says Kenny Mathers, from LeEco's marketing team. "" 'Le' in mandarin means 'joyful',"" he added. ""Our name means joyful ecosystem. When consumers get to pick up our products theyâre delighted with build quality and design."" Sounding French is a good thing for a Chinese company, Mathers acknowledged, as it removes a trust barrier for people used to words like Apple rather than, say, Xiaomi. That said, Iâve heard at least five different pronunciations of LeEco this week. Looking around the booth I spotted what looked very much like a GoPro camera, and I put it to Mathers that even here we're still seeing a disregard for Western intellectual property. ""I wouldnât say that,"" he said. ""I would say that thereâs a lot of innovation in our products. We've had a huge number of innovations in our phone line - we were the first company to remove the audio jack."" LeEco showed off an Android-powered road bike He is of course referencing Appleâs controversial decision to remove the headphone socket from its latest iPhone - though Iâm not sure thatâs been a particularly popular move by either company. LeEco won't be drawn on reports of its money woes - back in China itâs reported that Haosheng Electronics, one of LeEcoâs suppliers, is taking legal action over unpaid bills. LeEco has denied reports it has failed to meet its financial obligations. 'Poor country' According to the latest figures from research firm Gartner, sitting third in the global smartphone sales race - behind Samsung and Apple - is Huawei. Already the biggest supplier of telecoms infrastructure in Europe, Huawei was one of the early entrants into Western markets - though in the US it was coy. The company made Google's Nexus 6P, released in 2015, but until now hadn't undertaken any serious attempts at pushing its own brand. Huawei unveiled its Mate 9 phablet at the Las Vegas tech show The new Mate 9, a so-called phablet, is the company's first high-end device to be launched in the US. One stand-out feature is a built-in voice assistant. Curiously, while the company makes its own AI assistant, it has opted to integrate Amazonâs Alexa into this device instead. I wondered if it was because US users might not trust a Chinese firm with such broad data gathering. But Richard Yu, Huawei's chief executive (for the consumer side of things), gave a simpler explanation. ""Amazon Alexa is the best in this country,â he told me. ""We want to bring to the consumer the best services. In the China market we have our own - we have no intention to do this [in the US] in the short term."" Momentum shift Last year, Huawei had an unexpected gift: Samsungâs devices kept on catching on fire. ""Their problem has given Huawei more opportunity to be in the market,"" Mr Yu said, though he felt the Mate 9 would have given Samsungâs Galaxy Note 7 a run for its money even without the problems. He said China deserved its reputation as an imitator in years past, but was quickly shaking off that image. ""Chinese vendors are getting stronger and stronger on innovation. ""It's not like 10, 20 years ago where many in China would learn [from the West]. There is more original innovation from China now. One Chinese telecoms firm, ZTE, impressed CES crowds with a spot of American basketball - on stilts ""Thirty years ago China was a very poor country. Like North Korea. Very poor. Nothing. ""Within 30 years everywhere in China is changing, growing. In Huawei we have huge investment in innovation."" This year he said he expected the company to spend $10bn (Â£8.1bn) on research and development - roughly in line with Apple. But spend isn't everything. No amount of money can buy a Steve Jobs or a Jony Ive. And the cultural boundaries are proving both frustrating and fascinating - what is a massive hit in China can fall desperately flat elsewhere. But while American firms have struggled to make headway in China, Chinese firms are accelerating into the West. With high specifications and low prices, you shouldn't bet against them.

"It is as if the campaign is still going on. Two weeks away from his inauguration, Donald Trump seems to prefer the role of ""candidate"" -  flaying his opponents and aiming arrows at the federal government from the enemy camp. It is almost as if he does not want to accept fully that he is the new chief executive who will be dealing with official Washington from the moment he drives back from the Capitol as the president on 20 January. And his weapon of choice, forged for him like a legendary warrior's sword in the furnace of the new technology, is Twitter. No president-elect has battled like this. Most of them go to ground, secluded with the staff who will take over the West Wing, and make their plans. Dream their dreams, you might say. They have followed the golden rule: do not give too much away, because it will make life more difficult when the inauguration is over and the business of power begins. Trump Tweetwatch: 'I'm a big fan' of intelligence agencies Trump Tweetwatch: N Korea nuclear plans 'won't happen' The Trump Twitter account is not just a break with that pattern, but a challenge to the very idea. His New Year tweet (one of them, I should say) wished love to everyone ""including my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do"". Mr Trump wished love to everyone via Twitter at the turn of the year The implication, of course, is that he does know what he is going to do. The trouble with his Twitter account is that it makes you wonder. More than 34,000 tweets to nearly 19 million followers (many ""enemies"" among them, no doubt) and a narrative that has become a kind of stream of consciousness. They read like the unfiltered, disconnected thoughts of someone for whom patience is an ugly word. You always have to say something, even if you say the opposite the next day. On Twitter, who cares? Yet, the messages are powerful. One contemptuous tweet about the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives winding down the Office of Congressional Ethics led them tobeat a humiliating retreatand cancel the plan. Mr Trump's choice as White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the other day: ""Whatever he tweets, he is going to drive the news."" And, bizarre though it may seem, the South Korean government is poring over them. The JoongAng Daily reported that a Twitter-watching position had been set up in the foreign ministry in Seoul ""because we don't yet have an insight into his foreign policies"". What insight will they get from tweets which have criticised the Central Intelligence Agency, praised Julian Assange - the Whistleblower of WikiLeaks and a bete noire to most Republicans - and praised President Putin, who gets more friendly treatment than all Democrats and some Republicans at home? And remarkably the tweets take aim at the entire intelligence community in Washington. What precisely are the South Koreans meant to make of that? Not too much, you may think, because who can tell how this mercurial candidate is going to be moulded into a president? We still do not know and what his Twitter account tells us - colourfully, astonishingly, sometimes hilariously - is that he is refusing to let us know. Far from revealing what a Trump presidency is going to be like - as he says his tweets do - they have the effect of enveloping him in a thick fog. Yes we know he will ""make America great again"", cut immigration, build his wall, cut taxes, be Israel's greatest ally and so on. But how he is going to build a White House team on foreign affairs and security, conduct relations with Capitol Hill, deal with allies in Nato and the rolling chaos in the Middle East, we have very little idea. And when the first crisis arrives - as it will before long - will he be able to find the calm that he needs? Where it all began: Trump's Twitter page in April 2009 No president-elect in modern times has said so much and revealed so little. We know how Mr Trump feels about almost everything, but about priorities, his approach to the compromises of power, the way he will deal with the bureaucracy - in practice we know very little. A week or two before election day in November, one of his close associates told me that, if he won, Mr Trump had agreed that in office he would relinquish control of that Twitter account, because it would be inappropriate in the White House. The satirists' loss, certainly. But, if it happens, a step into reality, at last. Some day he has to stop being the candidate and playing that game, even though he enjoys it so much. So the first great test for the Trump White House team is surely getting his finger off that keyboard. Trump Tweetwatch: N Korea nuclear plans 'won't happen' How might China respond to Trump tweets?

"Tower Hamlets - which includes Canary Wharf - is the most productive part of the UK Productivity, or more precisely the lack of productivity, is one of the great puzzles of the British economy at the moment. Productivity growth since the credit crunch has been dreadful and that matters, because unless we make more and work more efficiently we cannot pay ourselves more. In an attempt to understand what is going wrong, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is bringing all its productivity statistics together and conducting new research. It throws up some interesting details and possible explanations about what is going wrong. Output per hour worked increased by 0.4% in the three months to September last year, that is an improvement but according to (ONS) economist Richard Heys: ""It is still weak compared to that experienced in the recent past."" Part of the reason for low productivity lies in Britain's regions. While London and south-eastern England have productivity well above the national average and equal to the levels seen in rival economies like France and Germany, the rest of the country lags behind. Tower Hamlets, which includes the financial district of Canary Wharf, is the most productive part of the country, a huge 79% more productive than average. Powys in central Wales is the least productive and, overall, Wales and Northern Ireland have productivity levels 19% below the national average. The only towns in the country that have above average productivity are London, Aberdeen (centre of the off-shore oil industry) and Bristol (a high tech and aviation industry hub). The Bristol area is one of the most productive in the country The least productive city is Sheffield, once home to a huge steel industry but now lagging well behind; Sheffield is 19% less productive than the national average. This part of the productivity puzzle is perhaps the best understood. The most productive industry is finance and that is concentrated in London, while many regions suffer from poor infrastructure and communications and have never recovered from the loss of major parts of their economy in previous decades: mining, heavy engineering, ship building and many more. Perhaps more interesting, is new research by the ONS into the efficiency of family-owned and run manufacturing firms. That found well-structured management practices were better among larger businesses, multinationals and family-owned businesses that were not managed by members of the owning families. To put it bluntly the management of family-run firms (which make up more than half of all manufacturing companies) is awful. Even a small improvement in management would see a huge boost in productivity in such businesses. At first sight this might seem strange, but there is a fairly obvious explanation. What are the odds that the best-qualified and most competent person in the world to run a business just happens to be the son or daughter of the current boss? As one economist has put it, this is like selecting the children of previous gold medallists to be members of the country's next Olympic team, rather than picking the best athletes. There is also the issue of how such companies will attract top staff if they know nepotism means they will never make it to the top, which helps explain why the handling of promotions was one of the issues most associated with productivity. Solving the productivity gap in the UK will not be an easy job, certainly better regional policies would help, but just convincing family- run firms to appoint competent outsiders to run their business would also have a huge effect.

"Ben opted to have surgery At the age of 10, Ben Moore took a brave decision. He chose to have the lower part of his right leg amputated and was fitted with an artificial limb. Ben was born with a condition known as fibular hemimelia - giving him a foot with only three toes and a leg that failed to develop. It left him struggling to walk and frequently in pain. Ben was fitted with an artificial leg after his amputation - which he says was fine for walking around school, but which did not match his sporting ambitions. Frustratingly for a boy already keen on sport in primary school, he could not keep up with his friends. However, his prosthetist Clare Johnson recommended him to become one of the first children to be fitted with a false leg designed specifically for sport by the NHS - and now his sights are set on competing at a future Paralympics. Ben, now 13, says: ""It has turned out really well. All my PE teachers like it that I've got a prosthetic leg and that I'm still doing sport. They say I have a lot of grit and zest!"" He was fitted with his new blade just before Christmas and switches between that and his other prosthetic leg depending on what he is doing. Ben says his blade means he can now compete on the sportsfield ""Ben has been empowered by his blade,"" says Clare. ""We hope it will give him a level playing field so he can compete with his peers and participate in more sports with a lighter prosthetic."" Clare adds that although she was able to make an attachment for Ben's disordered right leg as he was growing up, it was not possible to include the sort of components that could give him a spring in his step. After three weeks practising with the blade, Ben returned to Clare's treatment room at Brighton General Hospital and tried jogging, running and playing indoor tennis. He has also just taken on his able-bodied cousin in a straight race and won. ""The blade feels good,"" says Ben. ""The spring of it is the bit that makes me go faster."" ""I wanted the blade to do more running, so I didn't have to stick with cricket and stuff like that to do with upper body. I wanted to do more things with my lower body, run faster and get a bit more speed in football."" Ben's blade is made from plastic, carbon fibre and steel with a silicone liner around the stump The blade stores energy from each step like a spring, releasing it as he runs forward Britain's Jonnie Peacock won Paralympic gold in 2012 and 2016 wearing a similar blade on his right leg There are about 1,500 children in England who have lost all or part of a limb and 1,100 of them either lack a leg or have one which does not work properly. It is the first time the NHS has fitted some of them - in Brighton, North Cumbria and Luton - with false legs especially designed for sport. Ben is one of ""several hundred"" children who will receive sports prostheses each year While Ben has his blade, a child from Cumbria has been given a water limb called a ""swim fin"" which will make swimming with friends possible. The Â£1.5m programme is intended to help what the NHS says will be ""several hundred"" children each year. The cost of a blade, together with the follow-up training and assessment, is estimated at around Â£1,000, but it could be several times that amount in the private sector. Clare says that by preserving the health of the children who get prostheses, the scheme could actually save money. She says it also supports the health service's campaign to encourage healthy lifestyles among children. ""I don't like the idea that there are a lot of obese children and couch potatoes. I like to think that I have given (Ben) the blade and that he will show to other children that if he can do it, then everyone can do it.  Sport is for everyone, not just a small elite."" Kathleen Moore says her son is a fighter Ben's mother Kathleen is proud of her son's determination to play different sports, which have also included touch rugby. ""He's been up against it,"" she says, ""but despite everything he fought back and he's a little fighter to this day. Now he's got the blade, the sky's the limit."" Don't bet against seeing Ben competing for Great Britain in a future Games.

"Hoteliers have had a difficult Christmas period and hope for more wintry weather Snow is finally falling across the Alps, after one of the driest Decembers on record. In the Swiss Alps, the last time so little snow fell over the Christmas period was in 1864, according to measurements taken by the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research. For mountain resorts that do up to a third of their business over Christmas and New Year, this is a worry. While this December's glorious winter sunshine certainly showed off the Alps in all their splendour, many tourists arrive expecting to be able to ski. Christoph Marty, a snow climatologist with the institute, understands why hoteliers have been gazing anxiously at the sky. ""It definitely affects business,"" he says. A post-Christmas survey of ski resorts and lift operators by Swiss newspaper Tagesanzeiger showed that 56% of them expected to make losses in December. There has been little snow for the snow-grooming machines to work with The last three years have been a ""row of Decembers without snow"", says Mr Marty. While it may be too early to confirm a pattern, even the possibility that snow will not fall until after the festive season is a concern. Snow bikes race through the Alps Scottish centres hope for snow Trapped skiers rescued in Italian Alps So most resorts across the Alps are turning to artificial snow. Snow cannons have been used for many years to patch up vulnerable sections of a slope, but in the last decade their use has increased dramatically. Fifty percent of Swiss slopes can now be snowed artificially. In neighbouring Austria the figure is 70%. It is, as Christoph Marty points out, an expensive business. ""We need a lot of water for artificial snow, and there is a lot of consumption of power,"" he says. ""This is one reason why lift tickets are not cheap."" Switzerland's ski resorts have realised they cannot just rely on snow cannons Environmentalists have been watching the increased use of artificial snow with concern. Swiss group Pro Natura says the creation of reservoirs, simply to provide water for snow cannons, is damaging to the mountain landscape, while the energy required to power all the cannons over a season would be enough to fuel a small town. There is one big challenge to the nightly army of snow cannons: they cannot be used unless the temperature is below freezing. That means resorts, even if no natural snow falls, must have cold weather in November to get their slopes ready for Christmas. For the lower resorts, and the cross-country ski runs in the valleys, this is problematic, and so some have turned to a new method: snow farming. This involves creating tonnes of snow during the coldest months of January and February. Snow cannons are parked next to rivers in the valleys, water is pumped out of them and turned into vast mounds of snow, which is then buried in sawdust and stored, over the summer, until it is needed the following season. Mounds of ""farmed snow"" have appeared beside some of the Swiss ski slopes ""Up to 30% of it melts,"" says Christoph Marty. Nevertheless, more and more resorts, determined to guarantee snow in December, are turning to farming. It has, this season, made for some odd pictures: ribbons of snow on the ski slopes winding their way down through green fields. The sport of skiing developed, of course, out of the natural winter conditions in the mountains. But that was before winter package holidays: the first skiers, over a century ago, did not expect guaranteed snow from November to April. Today the winter sports business is worth billions, and many mountain communities depend on it. Creating the right conditions for skiing is no longer a matter for the weather gods, it is a high-tech industry. For anyone who still believes the snow beneath their skis simply fell from the skies, the truth is far more complicated than that. The scenery in the Swiss Alps may be stunning this winter, but the valleys are hoping for far more snow Mountain ski centres hope for snow Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Watch: Timelapse shows rapid spread of Palisades wildfire How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"Can you imagine telling an Oscar-winning actress that her face was sagging? It sounds like the stuff of a peculiar dream. But that's precisely what London-based facialist Su-Man Hsu did. And the actress? None other than Juliette Binoche, star of films such as Chocolat, The English Patient and The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Su-Man describes the French actress's arrival for her appointment for a facial treatment like this: ""She came... and I said, 'What's happened to you? Stagnating body, sagging, sagging.'"" Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Ms Binoche didn't speak to Su-Man for the whole of the session. ""I thought, 'OK then, it's got to be something I said, I'll just move on and forget about it,'"" Su-Man recalls. But the story doesn't end there. A year later her phone rang and on the other end was Juliette Binoche, in London for work, asking Su-Man to come and see her. Glowing - but Juliette Binoche and Su-Man Hsu had a sticky start to their relationship Su-Man recalls that Ms Binoche reminded her of what she'd said and quite how badly it had gone down. ""I said, 'Why did you call me then?' She said because she tried it in France, she tried everywhere and no-one [was] like me. And from then on we became best friends, we're still in contact with each other and I became her facialist."" It was a turning point for Su-Man. She says that on the strength of Ms Binoche's recommendations her business took off. Other celebrity fans include the actresses Anne Hathaway and Freida Pinto. It's a good story to dine out on, but actually it's just one stop on a journey where, in Su-Man's words, ""everything's just emerged. A beautiful accident."" Su-Man's parents didn't speak to her for almost two weeks when she said she wanted to pursue a career as a dancer Su-Man was born in Taiwan and lived in a tiny village until she was 14, in what she describes as a mud hut. ""Outside's raining, inside's raining, and you need to put all the pots and pans [out], otherwise you'd just slip away. And in the summer you sometimes see little baby mice fall from the ceiling,"" she says. They had four neighbours and after that there was nothing between them and the next village except rice fields. The family had no car but would use a cart drawn by oxen to get around. Su-Man was the youngest of 10 siblings and her illiterate parents struggled to support the family. On days when there was no rice to eat, everyone - including the animals - would eat porridge. Or, she says, they would shoot the swallows living in the roof with a slingshot, and then barbecue them. Su-Man's route away from her parents' smallholding was to become a dancer - despite her mother and father's opposition to it as a career. She worked in Germany, where she met her British-Pakistani husband, and then in Brussels. Su-Man was the rehearsal director for Akram Khan's dancers at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012 When the couple came to live in the UK, Su-Man performed her final dance in the King and I at the London Palladium, and then embarked on her second career looking after people's faces. She didn't, however, say farewell to dancing completely. One of the highlights was still to come - she was rehearsal director for dancer Akram Khan's ensemble at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. Listen to Su-Man Hsuin this edition of Outlook on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories Su-Man was already well-versed in Shiatsu massage techniques, having used them to help her recuperate after an accident at the age of 20. So when she came to set up Su-Man Skincare she developed treatments that combined massage with her own serums and toning products. To start with she made those in her kitchen and tried them out on herself and her clients. When clients began to ask her whether they could buy the products, she took the plunge and ordered 5,000 jars (the minimum order) to sell them in. Su-Man explains that her technique combines nature and science and is a mix of Eastern skincare, based on prevention of problems, and Western science, which corrects them. If you spend just five minutes extra on your face, she promises, it will repay you by looking younger and happier. The power of touch: Su-Man Hsu at work With this belief in natural methods for skincare, she has no time for customers who go down the artificial route offered by Botox. Her message to those who are tempted is unequivocal: ""You go there, don't come back to me."" And with a dancer's view of the world, she adds: ""The body is designed to be moved, it's not designed to sit there like a wall. If you can't see your expression when you speak, it's almost like you wipe out your history. ""You don't want people to know who you are, what's your future, where you come from. That saddens me."" Although Su-Man's business includes Hollywood stars amongst its clientele, she is keen to stress her belief in not forgetting how and where you started. Her products, she says, are rooted in her background. She takes her cue from the way her mother looked after them as children, using whatever was to hand. Su-Man has travelled a long way from her first home, but says it's crucial to remember your roots ""We used rice water on our face, and used flour mixed with egg, things like that, as a mask, or even hair shampoo. We would collect roots from the mountain and we would chop it and put it in the water to wash our body. ""We used the leftover green tea to splash on our face to soothe it because we were exposed to such intense sun, and discarded water melon, rubbing our face, exfoliating, all that stuff."" And just to make sure that she keeps all that in mind, almost every day while she meditates Su-Man listens to a track which plays her the sounds of her village at night.

"Set in an animated Manila, 'Saving Sally' has been billed as a teenage love story It's a tale of unrequited teenage love terrorised by giant animated monsters in the chaotic streets of Metro Manila. Saving Sally,externaltells the story of Marty, a young aspiring Philippines comic book artist, played by Enzo Marcos. He falls in love with his best friend Sally, a gadget inventor - portrayed by Filipina actress Rhian Ramos - who is also the centre of Marty's universe. The story quickly unfolds with stunning cartoons which tell the story of Marty's lonely world. A Manila-state of mind, in Marty's world Like every love story, there are numerous complications and challenges for the hero. Namely defending the love of his life from a beastly rival and her difficult parents, who take the form of monsters because to Marty, that is simply what they are. ""Sadly, Marty also has the innate ability to do nothing about everything despite his vivid fantasies of defending Sally from the big bad world,"" described the film's director Avid Liongoren. Marty often dreams of defending Sally from the evils of her world While it has been described as a ""typical teen movie about love, monsters and gadgets"", the film also touches on serious issues prevalent in Philippine society. Filipina star's drug dealer role wins at Cannes Philippines revenge drama wins at Venice 'AlDub': The most popular show you have never heard of ""On the surface, it's a fun and straightforward love story, with good laughs and visual gags that reference Filipino as well as Western pop culture,"" said screenwriter Charlene Sawit-Esguerra , who wrote and conceptualised the film. ""But it also touches on darker themes like physical abuse and escapism."" Saving Sally's darker themes are mixed in with the teenage love story After an arduous 10-year journey and a series of setbacks, the team's efforts paid off. Saving Sally gained an entry into the 2016 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF). The annual festival serves as an outlet to better promote local talent in the Pinoy film industry. But the MMFF sadly still could not save Sally. The humble film was not widely shown in local cinemas. The Philippine skyline takes centre stage in this film, which features stunning artwork Its creators said the answer could lie in the nature of the domestic cinema industry. Largely unregulated, Philippine cinemas have built a notorious reputation for favouring commercial successes movies like Hollywood blockbusters and ""manufactured"" romance dramas. ""They pick the films that they think people will watch. So it is more of a perception that since ours is a small, non-studio film, no-one would want to watch it,"" explained Mr Liongoren. Ms Sawit-Esguerra  said ""demand"" was often a deciding factor before a film could be considered for screening. ""Theatre owners here think that local audiences will only watch films starring big-names and A-list stars, produced by major studios. Saving Sally has neither,"" she said. ""Because of this, many cinemas don't want to take the risk and would rather see how audiences responds to our movie first."" Saving Sally earned a festival entry but was not widely screened in cinemas To film critic Oggs Cruz, another problem with the film lay in its animation, the very thing that its makers fought so hard to create. ""While most Filipinos enjoy animated films, the animated aspect in Saving Sally doesn't favour its commercial ability,"" he told BBC News. ""It is an adjunct of the main characters and I don't think it has any effect in its marketability. Sadly it won't entice children or adults."" ""A lot of Filipinos are proud of their heritage but ironically, they would rather watch the latest Star Wars movie than support local film festival entries. ""It's a losing situation for the film makers whose work will get pulled out for more commercially viable movies that will earn more money."" The show's creators turned to the power of social media and launched an online campaign to save Sally, calling on audiences to contact theatre owners demanding they screen the film. ""Let your voices be heard. Please help us make noise and reach out,"" reada Facebook post,externalon the movie's official page which drew close to 50,000 reactions and was shared more than 10,000 times. Thousands of curious Facebook users and fans began to show their support for the film by leaving comments and writing posts using the hashtags#ShowSavingSally,externaland#ImSavingSally,external. The film's stunning visuals bring Manila's chaotic streets to life ""It was worth the wait and our money. Great storytelling and amazing animation - good job,"" gushed Dicay Galvez from Makati city who shared his joy in finally being able to catch the film. ""I cannot imagine the love and passion that went into this film, it may be a typical love story but the entirety of the movie itself is a work of art,"" wrote Ace Antipolo in anInstagram post,external. ""Big movie companies in the Philippines just don't put this kind of effort anymore but the efforts of a small group of people who worked for 10 years just to complete this beautiful masterpiece will be cherished forever."" ""I guess business is business but I just don't understand why some cinemas saved spots for other movies over Saving Sally. Please show it in Bacolod,"" said Fraire Acupan. Given its animation-meets-real life component which plays out heavily, and its slacker hero, Saving Sally has drawn comparisons with popular 2010 geek sleeper hitScott Pilgrim vs. the World,external. But will Sally see a similar indie cult following to that which Scott Pilgrim enjoyed? Its makers said the public response ""has been incredible"" and fan demand played a crucial role in boosting the film. Saving Sally was shown on around 50 screens to begin with, but was expected to close at 86 screens. ""Theatres have relented to the barrage of messages from Filipino youngsters wanting to see our film,"" said Mr Liongoren. Ms Sawit-Esguerra said: ""Saving Sally surpassed what it was expected to earn, according toIndustry experts,external. It also made it to the top four of the festival films based on how it did at the Philippine box office."" She also added that they have received offers for a North American release but that has not yet been finalised. ""We've also been invited to film festivals in Portugal, Spain and Belgium,"" she said.
