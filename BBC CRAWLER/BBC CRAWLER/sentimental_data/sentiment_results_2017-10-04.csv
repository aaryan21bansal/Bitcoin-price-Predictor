"This video can not be played Five things that went wrong with May's speech Theresa May had to battle losing her voice and being interrupted on stage by a comedian as she sought to reassert her Conservative leadership. Mrs May, who at one point was handed a throat sweet by the chancellor, did make it to the end of a speech in which she vowed to ""renew the British dream"". She announced plans for more council houses and a cap on energy prices. But they were overshadowed by the problems she had delivering the set-piece speech in Manchester. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the annual conference ""was meant to be about restoring Theresa May's authority - it may prove instead to have been further undermined"". Rolling text and video reaction to Theresa May speech May revives promise to cap energy prices May unveils Â£2bn council homes plan Could May have fixed her croaky voice? Security review after PM pranked Mrs May was interrupted early on in her speech by comedian Simon Brodkin - also known as Lee Nelson - who managed to make it to the podium to hand her a P45, a redundancy notice, saying to her that ""Boris asked me to give you this"". After he was removed and she got encouraging cheers from the audience she joked that the only P45 she wanted to give out was to Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played A prankster interrupted the prime minister during her speech But she struggled to finish the speech because of a croaky voice, having to stop several times to drink water. Sources close to the prime minister have said that the PM had caught the ""conference cold"", and that her many interviews and meetings this week have taken their toll on her voice. They say the prankster who interrupted her speech has been arrested for a breach of the peace and there will be a thorough investigation of security. To add to her woes, some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop. By the end it read: ""Building a country that works or everyon."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg on PM's speech In normal political times, it is probably the case that what one minister described as a ""tragedy"" today would have led to a prime minister being forced out or quitting. But these aren't normal times. Allies of Theresa May say today she has shown her resilience and determination in spades, demonstrating exactly why she deserves to stay in the job. A senior colleague of hers told me she importantly did manage to put forward a coherent vision and talked about her personal beliefs. More than that, for those who want her gone there are three obstacles. Read more from the BBC's political editor Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said of the prime minister's performance: ""If ever there was a metaphor for battling through adversity, that was it."" In the speech itself, Mrs May delivered a call for a ""modern, compassionate Britain"" and focused on her personal commitment to social justice and fairness. She also apologised to activists in Manchester for an election campaign that had been ""too scripted, too presidential"". And she said the ""British dream"" that ""life should be better for the next generation"" was out of reach for too many people, something she vowed to dedicate her premiership to fixing. Mrs May began her speech by outlining the reasons why she joined the Conservative Party more than 40 years ago, stressing that the things that have made her most proud in politics have not been the positions she has held, but ""knowing that I made a difference - helped those who cannot be heard"". She announced that there would be an independent review of the Mental Health Act, to tackle injustice, and would press for justice to be done for the families of those killed and injured in the Grenfell Tower tragedy. ""That's what I'm in this for,"" she said. Turning to Brexit, Mrs May said she was ""confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe"". She also reassured European citizens living in the UK that ""you are welcome here"" and urged negotiators to reach agreement on this policy ""because we want you to stay"". The prankster turned to Boris Johnson after interrupting the speech Even the sign was against her A big hug from husband Philip at the end of the speech Mrs May said it had ""always been a great sadness for Philip and me that we were never blessed with children"", but she said this did not stop her wanting to help young people on to the housing ladder. Hailing plans to ""reignite home ownership"" in Britain, she said the government plans to invest an additional Â£2bn in affordable housing, taking the total budget up to almost Â£9bn. If ministers made the land available and gave young people the skills to build the houses, she challenged house builders to ensure they ""build the homes our country needs"". Simon Brodkin is an English comedian more commonly known by his TV character name Lee Nelson. Handing the prime minister a P45 was far from his first. His most famous interruption came at Glastonbury in 2015 when he ran onstage as Kanye West was performing. He pulled a similar stunt on The X Factor in 2014, running onstage as the Stereo Kicks were playing. He also threw US dollar bills over former Fifa president Sepp Blatter during the football organisation's bidding scandal. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the focus on council housing underlines Mrs May's readiness to intervene and use the public sector to build houses in a way not seen since the 1950s. Mrs May announced that the government will next week publish draft legislation to impose a cap on energy prices. Downing Street says it will apply to all standard variable rates. This video can not be played Amber Rudd says the government is 'carefully' looking at the stunt during PM's conference speech Having seen her Commons majority vanish after June's general election and facing calls to sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over his interventions on Brexit, Mrs May attempted to use the conference to unite the party behind her ""mission"" to transform Britain. She said it would not be easy, but ""it has never been my style to hide from a challenge, to shrink from a task, to retreat in the face of difficulty, to give up and turn away."" ""And it is when tested the most that we reach deep within ourselves and find that our capacity to rise to the challenge before us may well be limitless."" The disruptions to the speech dominated discussion afterwards, but for Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying that there had been Â£15bn of pledges made by the end of the speech showing ""the Tory magical money tree returns"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called it ""the speech of a brave prime minister struggling on, while her disloyal Cabinet colleagues openly plot against her"".

"Prime Minister Trudeau attends the opening of the National Holocaust Monument A plaque has been removed from Canada's Holocaust memorial because it neglected to mention Jewish people. PM Justin Trudeau opened the National Holocaust Monument last week in the capital Ottawa. The plaque commemorated the ""millions of men, women and children murdered"" but did not specifically mention Jewish people or anti-Semitism. About six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, the largest group to be persecuted by the Nazis. The omission was seized upon by MPs and senators of the opposition Conservative Party on Tuesday. ""If we are going to stamp out hatred toward Jews, it is important to get history right,"" said MP David Sweet. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Heritage Minister Melanie Joly assured parliament that the plaque had been removed, and would be replaced with one that reflects ""the horrors experienced by the Jewish people"". The omission on the plaque appears to have been an oversight - during the opening on 27 September both anti-Semitism and the effects of the Holocaust on the Jewish people were mentioned. ""Today we reaffirm our unshakeable commitment to fight anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination in all its forms, and we pay tribute to those who experienced the worst of humanity. We can honour them by fighting hatred with love, and seeking always to see ourselves in each other,"" Mr Trudeau said at the unveiling. Until then, Canada had been the only Allied power to not have a national Holocaust memorial. Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump was admonished for failing to use the word Jew on Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Comedian Simon Brodkin - also known as his TV persona Lee Nelson - handed the sheet of paper to Theresa May in the middle of her speech. He was arrested by Greater Manchester Police to prevent a breach of the peace, but later released. The force said he had ""legitimate accreditation"" to attend the event.

He held piece of paper up to Mrs May, which she took amid a sea of photographers. He allegedly told her that the P45 was from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, before giving her cabinet colleague a thumbs up. Brodkin was then led out of the conference hall to angry shouts from party members. The paper, a faked P45, was later discovered on the floor of the hall.

"US police have said the woman, a former casino employee, was living with Paddock in Nevada The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who shot dead 58 people on Sunday has said she had no idea what her ""kind, caring, quiet"" partner was planning. Marilou Danley's comments came hours before police suggested Stephen Paddock had been living ""a secret life"". They said he may have been planning to escape instead of shooting himself dead, but did not give further details. It is not yet known why he opened fire on an open-air concert, committing the worst shooting in modern US history. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference that: Police had found more explosives in Paddock's car at the hotel, along with about 1,600 rounds of ammunition Paddock had been gambling just hours before he began shooting He had booked into an apartment at the high-rise Ogden in downtown Las Vegas a week earlier during a different open-air festival where acts including Muse, Lorde and Blink-182 were due to play But he said Paddock's motivations and whether there were any possible accomplices remained a mystery. The FBI's Aaron Rouse said so far no link to terrorism had been found but they would continue to ""look at all avenues"" without ""closing any doors"" because it was ""an ongoing investigation"". ""We don't understand it yet,"" Sheriff Lombardo told reporters, but questioned whether he could have accomplished his plan by himself. ""You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" he said. Ms Danley, who spoke to the FBI on Wednesday, expressed shock at the ""horrible unspeakable acts of violence"" Paddock had committed. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes Paddock ""never said anything to me or took any action"" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer. Ms Danley added: ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together."" What do we know about Marilou Danley? Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas US authorities named Ms Danley a ""person of interest"" in their investigation and said they had made contact with her shortly after the shooting. Ms Danley voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI, just over two weeks after Paddock had surprised her with a ""cheap ticket"" to enable her to visit her family. While there, he wired her $100,000 (Â£75,400), explaining it was to buy a house. ""I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,"" she said. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone."" Her sister earlier told Australian outlet7News,externalthat Ms Danley ""was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning"". Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. What does Las Vegas want Trump to do? Who are the victims? 'Pandemonium' on the Strip US President Donald Trump, who visited the city on Wednesday, said ""America is truly a nation in mourning"" in the wake of the mass killings. Hundreds of people were injured in the attack. President Trump praised the emergency services who battled to save as many as they could, despite the danger to themselves. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse ""When the worst of humanity strikes - and strike it did - the best of humanity responds,"" he said as he applauded injured officers. ""In the depths of horror, we will always find hope in the men and women who risk their lives for ours,"" he added. Mr Trump said he was in the ""company of heroes"" after visiting the first responders. ""Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night,"" he said. ""Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage."" The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate.

"Carles Puigdemont (left) criticised Spain's King Felipe in his address Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has attacked Spain's King Felipe VI for ""deliberately ignoring millions of Catalans"", after a disputed vote was held on independence. He accused the king of adopting the Spanish government's position. King Felipe made a TV address on Tuesday night, calling Sunday's vote illegal and undemocratic. Mr Puigdemont has already indicated that independence could be declared next week. ""This moment calls for mediation,"" he said in a televised statement late on Wednesday. He claimed that the king had rejected a moderating role granted to him by the Spanish constitution. In response, the Spanish government in Madrid said it would not accept ""blackmail"" from the Catalan leader. Mr Puigdemont must return to the path of law before any negotiation could take place, itsaid in a statement (in Spanish).,external His criticism of the king showed that he was ""out of touch with reality,"" it added. Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? Mr Puigdemont told the BBC on Tuesday that he would declare independence ""at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". The Catalan government has said there will be an extraordinary meeting of parliament on Monday to discuss the outcome of the disputed referendum. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Catalan officials say more than 2.2 million people voted on Sunday and that nearly 90% of them backed independence. The turnout has been estimated at 42% but final results have not been given. There have been a number of reports of irregularities, partly because voters were allowed to cast ballots anywhere to avoid police measures aimed at halting the vote. In some areas far more votes were cast than the number of residents. In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mr Puigdemont did not give any further details of a possible declaration of independence. Switching to Spanish from Catalan, he thanked Spanish citizens who had sent their ""solidarity"" to Catalonia. Nearly 900 people - according to Catalan authorities - were hurt as police violently tried to enforce a Spanish court order suspending the vote, which the government had declared illegal. Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Thirty-three police officers were also injured, local medical officials said. Shocked by what they had seen, hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined street protests on Tuesday. A general strike was also called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"". Q&A: Do Catalans really want independence? Why Catalan emotions are running high How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Girona It was a rare public attack on the Spanish monarch but King Felipe himself, symbol of national unity, seldom addresses the country on TV, and President Puigdemont had to respond. At a bar in the Catalan leader's home region, they clapped respectfully afterwards, happy with their leader and his call for mediation, and then they joked about the Game of Thrones TV series. ""We need a king like Jon Snow who tries to keep his lands together and is with the people,"" said one woman, laughing. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, by common agreement, was the Night King, wishing eternal winter on Catalonia. ""I want a Spain that cares for all its cultures,"" she added more seriously.

"Sgt Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers An Army sergeant tried to kill his wife by removing parts of her parachute, causing her to spin thousands of feet to the ground, a court has heard. Emile Cilliers, 37, is accused of two counts of attempted murder of Victoria Cilliers who survived the jump on 5 April 2015. Winchester Crown Court heard Ms Cilliers suffered multiple injuries. Mr Cilliers, who denies all charges, wanted to leave his wife for a lover he had met on Tinder, prosecutors said. It is also claimed that just days before the jump, on 29 March 2015, the defendant tried to kill Ms Cilliers, 40, by deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home while he stayed away. Police evidence showed the kitchen cupboard where the gas leak occurred (large arrow) Prosecutor Michael Bowes QC said that on the night of the gas leak Mr Cilliers had left his wife at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, to stay at his Army barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire. He said the following morning Ms Cilliers contacted her husband complaining of a gas smell coming from a kitchen cupboard next to the oven. She noticed dried blood on the fitting which was later found to be a full DNA match to her husband, the court was told. The jury was told the Royal Army Physical Training Corps sergeant lied to his lover, Stefanie Glover, that he was leaving his wife because she was having an affair and he was not the father of one of their children. Mr Bowes QC said Mr Cilliers was also having an affair with his ex-wife Carly Cilliers. He told the court the defendant had debts of Â£22,000 and believed he would receive a Â£120,000 life insurance payout on his wife's death. Emile Cilliers made up lies about his wife having an affair, the court heard Mr Bowes QC said Ms Cilliers was a highly experienced parachutist and instructor but when she jumped out of the plane 4,000ft (1,200m) above Netheravon Airfield in Wiltshire ""both her main parachute and her reserve parachute failed"". ""Those attending at the scene expected to find her dead, although she was badly injured, almost miraculously she survived the fall. ""Those at the scene immediately realised that something was seriously wrong with her reserve parachute, two vital pieces of equipment which fasten the parachute harness were missing,"" he said. Police picture of the gas pipe which Sgt Cilliers allegedly tampered with The day before the failed jump the couple had visited Netheravon together, the court heard. While there Mr Cilliers collected a hire parachute for his wife and took it into the men's toilets at the base, where he is alleged to have tampered with it. Mr Bowes QC said: ""It's heavy, it's bulky, there is absolutely no reason to take it in there at all. ""The weather was so poor that afternoon that Victoria couldn't jump, the cloud base was too low."" The court heard that Mr Cilliers then arranged to keep the equipment overnight in his wife's locker, a move that was against normal procedure.

"A former GCHQ boss has admitted assaulting a female dinner guest during a ""sexualised"" Truth or Dare-style party game. Brian Lord OBE, the ex-deputy director for intelligence and cyber operations at the Cheltenham spy base, denied sexually assaulting the woman by putting his hand on her knee. Prosecutors instead proceeded with a charge of assault, which Lord admitted. He was ordered to pay the woman Â£100 compensation and Â£200 costs. The judge in the case also gave him a conditional discharge. The court heard Lord, 56, who now works in the private sector, and his partner, Natasha Marshall, attended a colleague's dinner party in Churchdown, near Gloucester, on 26 November 2016. Prosecutor Robert Duvall said: ""During some party games the defendant placed his hand on the lady's knee. ""It was not momentary. ""It was there for a significant time and caused her embarrassment and awkwardness."" Mr Duvall said the woman had not felt able to express her concern but when Lord's partner left the table, she followed her to the kitchen. He said Lord was ""apologetic and left without question"" when the issue was raised. ""He was emphatic that his actions, however unwise, were not sexual in nature."" Rosemary Collins, defending, said everybody at the party had been drinking and Lord accepted he had put his hand on the woman's knee for ""two to three minutes"". She said: ""This was during the course of party games. ""They were sexualised party games such as 'Did you ever...?', 'Have you ever...?' that sort of thing. ""He intended no disrespect to her at all and accepts it was something that was stupid, done in drink. ""He thought he was getting on rather well with the complainant."" She added: ""He has never been in trouble before. ""He is a family man, it is such a shame that it has come to this."" Judge Michael Cullum told Lord: ""Your behaviour crossed the line to criminal behaviour, as a result of which you have lost your good name and your good character which, I know, you will have held dear.""

"Clean Bandit have squeezed the intros in their hits Great song intros, where a tune builds up before the vocal kicks in, are becoming an endangered species as fickle music fans skip tracks if they don't get immediate gratification. That's the view of the man who co-produced two Clean Bandit number ones this year, and it's backed up by stats. The average intro time has dropped from more than 20 seconds to five seconds since the mid-1980s, research has found. Producer Mark Ralph said it is because the rise of streaming services means it's now much easier to move on to the next song if you're not instantly hooked. ""Attention spans have now decreased and that is potentially down to the ease with which you can chop and change between pieces of music if you're bored,"" he told BBC News. ""If you imagine trying to do that with one piece of vinyl, if you get bored in the first 10 seconds, to take it off the turntable, find another record, put it on and start again is quite a long-winded process. ""Nowadays, if you're sitting on Spotify and get bored within 10 seconds, you just flick a button and you're on to the next thing. I think you have to grab peoples' attention much more quickly."" Sam Smith's voice arrives almost immediately in Too Good At Goodbyes Ralph worked on Clean Bandit's smash Rockabye, in which Sean Paul's vocal began after just a second; and Symphony, a number one in April, in which the vocal appeared after a whole seven seconds. Three of this year's other UK number ones have had intros that lasted just a second or two before the vocals kicked in - DJ Khaled and Rihanna's Wild Thoughts; Artists for Grenfell's charity version of Bridge Over Troubled Water; and the current chart-topper, Sam Smith's Too Good At Goodbyes. Feels, the mega-hit created by Calvin Harris, Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry and Big Sean, goes for 30 seconds before the main vocal arrives - but even that intro is punctuated by cries of ""hey!"", ""oh yeah!"" and ""ha!"". In researchpublished earlier this year,external, Ohio State University doctoral student Hubert Leveille Gauvin found that intro lengths had dropped by 78% between 1986 and 2015. Katy Perry can't keep quiet during the Feels intro ""That's insane, but it makes sense,"" Gauvin said. ""The voice is one of the most attention-grabbing things there is in music. ""It's survival of the fittest - songs that manage to grab and sustain listeners' attention get played and others get skipped. There's always another song. ""If people can skip so easily and at no cost, you have to do something to grab their attention."" There's another reason musicians want to grab fans' attention. If a tune is played for less than 30 seconds on Spotify, it doesn't count as a play and they don't get paid. Those are factors that songwriters and producers are aware of when crafting their future hits, Mark Ralph says. ""I think they're talking about it a lot because obviously it's in their interests to be as successful as they possibly can, and they want to have their tracks streamed as many times and played on the radio as many times as they can.""

"This video can not be played 'Nothing quite like it' - Laura Kuenssberg on PM's speech What now? The conference has packed up. The prime minister is home. No one will forget her speech. And there are MPs who believe that today's surreal events ought to mark the beginning of the end. There is a group of them ramping up their discussions about persuading her to go. One minister said the situation is ""brutal"" but the events will hasten her departure because it is ""like the moment when the vet tells you it is more cruel to keep the labrador alive"". Politics is certainly cruel, and clearly the prime minister was the victim of some appallingly bad luck. PM struggles through interrupted speech May revives promise to cap energy prices Another former minister told me that after the election and Grenfell it would only have taken one more event to trigger her exit and this ""was the event"". In normal political times, it is probably the case that what one minister described as a ""tragedy"" today would have led to a prime minister being forced out or quitting. But these aren't normal times. Allies of Theresa May say today she has shown her resilience and determination in spades, demonstrating exactly why she deserves to stay in the job. A senior colleague of hers told me she importantly did manage to put forward a coherent vision and talked about her personal beliefs. More than that, for those who want her gone there are three obstacles. First, with Brexit negotiations under way, any change of leader could be destabilising at a time when the UK needs to look strong. Second, Tory MPs don't agree on who a natural successor is, and a leadership election could open a Pandora's Box with untold consequences. And third, many Tory MPs are terrified of a general election. Doing anything that could precipitate a national contest means their jobs are at risk. But in the next few days the balance between the desire to end the torment on display today and preserve stability will be endlessly discussed by Tory MPs. And in these volatile times few would predict what they will conclude.

"Rebecca Bredow refused to comply with her ex-husband's wishes to have their child immunised A mother in the US state of Michigan has been sentenced to seven days in jail after she refused a judge's order to have her son vaccinated. Rebecca Bredow would not let her nine-year-old be immunised after initially agreeing with the father to do so. Her ex-husband has now been awarded temporary primary custody in order to get the boy the jab. Michigan parents are legally allowed to skip or delay their children's vaccinations due to personal beliefs. But Bredow fell foul of the law because she reneged on agreements with her former spouse dating back to November 2016 to have the boy immunised. The mother-of-two was sentenced on Wednesday for contempt of court after flouting a court order last week to have her son vaccinated. She and her ex-husband decided at the time of their child's birth that they would space out and delay jabs for their son. The couple separated in 2008, according to ABC News, but they shared parental custody and the father still wanted the boy vaccinated. This video can not be played The US island with some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country What's behind the 'anti-vax' movement? Oakland County Court Judge Karen McDonald said that even though Bredow was the child's primary caregiver: ""Dad gets a say."" Bredow, from the Detroit suburb of Ferndale, said in court on Wednesday: ""I am an educated vaccine-choice mother."" She argued that to immunise her son ""goes against my beliefs"". ""I would rather sit behind bars standing up for what I believe in, than giving in to something I strongly don't believe in,"" Bredow added. Anti-vaccination advocates - whose claims have been widely debunked by the medical community - fear the procedure exposes children to harm, and could be the cause of autism. Child immunisation rates in Michigan are among the worst in the nation, ranking 43rd among the 50 US states,according to Mlive,external. Barbara Loe Fisher, president of the vaccine-sceptic National Vaccine Information Center, told the BBC this is not the first time a parent has been jailed for refusing to vaccinate a child. The federal government does not legislate child immunisation, only issuing recommendations while leaving requirements to states or local school districts. If a parent does not comply with a school's vaccination guidelines, the child is not permitted to attend school and the parent can be jailed for the pupil's truancy. For that reason, many anti-vaccine parents choose to home-school their children, Mrs Fisher told the BBC.

"This video can not be played In October, Rex Tillerson responded to a report he called Mr Trump 'a moron' US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has denied rumours of a rift with Donald Trump, amid media reports he had called the president a ""moron"". ""I'm not going to deal with petty stuff like that,"" he said, without denying the alleged remark. Mr Tillerson called a news conference after an NBC report said he had considered resigning earlier this year. He said his commitment to Mr Trump's White House was as strong as ever, and he would stay on as long as needed. NBC had alleged, citing White House sources, that Mr Tillerson had to be talked out of resigning in July. It said he had been advised by Vice-President Mike Pence ""on ways to ease tensions"" with the president,the report added,external- something which Mr Tillerson denies. ""The vice president has never had to persuade me to stay as secretary of state, because I have never considered leaving this post,"" he said. ""I'm new to Washington, I have learned there are some who try to sow dissension to advance their own agenda by tearing others apart in an effort to undermine President Trump's own agenda. I do not and I will not operate that way."" Just before Mr Tillerson spoke, Donald Trump took aim at their report, tweeting: ""NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!"" Speaking in Las Vegas later, where he was visiting victims of the mass shooting, Mr Trump said he it was a ""totally phony story... made up by NBC"" and he had ""total confidence in Rex."" State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also later refuted the ""moron"" remarks, even though the secretary himself had not. ""The secretary did not use that type of language to speak about the president of the United States,"" she said. ""He does not use that language to speak about anyone."" She added that Mr Tillerson was a ""tough old bird"" and daring those who want him to resign: ""go ahead and keep pushing - because that will only strengthen his resolve."" Allow Twitter content?

When asked if the president had instructed him to make a statement, Mr Tillerson said he had not spoken to Mr Trump since the allegations surfaced. The vice president also issued a statement denying any discussion took place concerning the secretary of state's departure. CNN, however, said it had confirmed the ""moron"" remark with its own source.A CNN White house reporter tweeted,externalthat Mr Trump ""was aware that Tillerson had referred to him as 'a moron' this summer."" But the president followed up with his own tweet, saying NBC's story had been ""totally refuted"" and that ""they should issue an apology to America"". By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter It's a bit unusual for cabinet secretary to hold an impromptu press conference to effectively renew his vows of loyalty to the president, but this is no ordinary presidency. The well-sourced NBC story about a Tillerson-Trump rift clearly touched a nerve and prompted a multi-pronged administration response. The secretary of state said most of the right things, praising the president as smart and strong and denying he had to be talked out of resigning. He didn't, however, directly deny that he had referred to the president as a ""moron"". Instead he professed an aw-shucks naivety about how Washington works - one belied by his decades of experience at the top of a multibillion-dollar corporation in the cut-throat global energy business. Mr Trump insists the NBC story had been ""fully refuted"", but even if the details are adamantly denied by the White House, the reality is Mr Tillerson and the president frequently move in different directions on foreign policy. Mr Tillerson may be fine with this. He says he's ""just getting started"". As long as it continues, however, questions will swirl about whether he can effectively serve as the top US diplomat - and when he might head for the exit. On Sunday, Mr Trump tweeted that he had told his secretary of state that he was wasting his time attempting to negotiate with North Korea, just hours after Mr Tillerson had said the US was in contact with Pyongyang. ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Mr Trump publicly declared, in a move some pundits felt undermined the secretary's work. Trump calls N Korea talks waste of time As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson is one of the most senior US officials. He is fourth in line for the presidency, after the vice president and leaders of the House and Senate.

"The prime minister has promised to invest an additional Â£2bn in affordable housing. The Conservative Party says that will fund the building of an additional 25,000 new homes for social rent, expected to be mainly council housing, over two years from 2019. Let's put that into perspective. In 2010-11, 39,570 additional homes were made available for social rent in England, either through being built or bought. In 2015-16 there were only 6,800 extra homes. That's been concerning campaigners, because those on the lowest incomes are affected by the availability of houses for social rent. This graph shows how the government's priorities have been shifting away from building homes for the cheapest social rents towards building those available for the more expensive ""affordable"" rents. Wednesday's announcement signals a change in the policy of recent years and is expected to be targeted at areas such as London and the South East, where market rates are significantly higher. What does the government mean when it talks about ""affordable"" housing? It includes social rent, affordable rent, affordable homes to buy and shared ownership. Social rents are typically between 30% and 40% of market rents in a local area. They are set by national government guidance and increases have historically been linked to inflation. But government policy has meant they have actually been falling by 1% a year since 2016. Affordable rents are defined as being about 80% of market rents and so can increase by a lot more than inflation, depending on the market Affordable homes to buy are less easily defined, but mortgage payments should be above social rent levels and below market rate. This is a broad range Shared ownership lets buyers pay a smaller deposit in order to own a share of a home. Rent is then paid on the remaining share of the property The rapid fall in houses being built or acquired for social rent has meant the total number of extra homes categorised as ""affordable"" has been on a downward trend, from 61,090 in 2010-11 to 32,630 in 2015-16. The spike in 2014-15 was the culmination of a four-year programme of house-building that saw a big rise in homes being completed. The rise was driven by a surge in homes for affordable rent being built. Prime Minister struggles through conference speech Video: Prankster hands May a P45 In response to the prime minister's announcement, the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) said: ""As we have been saying for some time, social rents, which are significantly cheaper than market rents, are the only truly affordable option for many people on lower incomes, so the recognition that we need more of these homes is a vital step forward."" According to the CIH, only 20% of the government's current housing budget goes on affordable homes. The main focus of government policy has been on private housing schemes with the remaining budget being spent on projects such as the Help to Buy scheme. Reality Check: Has Help to Buy helped first-time buyers? Reality Check: Are councils stopped from borrowing to build houses? Unlike in the private sector, both social and affordable rented properties are allocated on the basis of need. Some affordable housing is built through government funding and some is built by private house builders as part of a planning agreement with councils. In 2015, the Conservatives promised to build a million more homes of all types by 2020 - the equivalent of 200,000 per year - but they have fallen behind on this. There were 168,350 homes built in the year to March 2016. In May this year, the Conservatives promised a ""new generation"" of council houses, a proportion of which would have to be sold privately after 10-15 years. The tenants would be given the first opportunity to purchase their homes, under the Right to Buy scheme, and the proceeds would go towards building more social housing.

"Mohammed spends his days playing computer games and looking after his granddad. He's only 14, but he hasn't been to school since December. The idea was to home school him - but things didn't quite work out like that, reports the BBC's Sue Mitchell. He lives in a spotlessly clean Bradford semi-detached house, with pale wood flooring and deep, comfortable sofas. His mother works part time as a nursery nurse and his father is a taxi driver. His mum admits she is totally out of her depth. She says she agreed to try to educate Mohammed herself at the suggestion of his school, after he was excluded for bad behaviour. She wanted to keep him out of the only alternative, a pupil referral unit. Mohammed wasn't opposed to the idea at first. ""I thought it would be good because I wouldn't mix in with bad children,"" he says. But it was harder than he expected. ""My mum isn't a proper teacher, she just helps nursery kids. She's not a teacher for maths, science and English. I couldn't learn from her."" His dad, who works long hours, tells him that he is squandering his life opportunities. ""He says: 'You've just ruined your chances' - that I could have had a good education and done my GCSEs and had a good life, but now I've wasted that,"" Mohammed says. Many families say home schooling works well for them. But Mohammed is one of a growing number of children who find themselves falling out of the state education system, according to Richard Watts, the chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People's Board. He says it's increasingly common to hear of schools ""effectively putting a lot of pressure on parents to home educate their kids to get them off their rolls, particularly when exam time comes around"". Mohammed was only 13 when he was excluded from school for setting off fireworks in the corridor with other boys. ""We went to a meeting, but they said there's no way of him coming back to the school,"" says his mum. Mohammed had already been in trouble with the school authorities for fighting. ""At school he thought they ganged up on him and called him names, trying to provoke him. Mohammed is really quiet, but if he hasn't done nothing he'll be upset by it,"" his mother says. ""When Mohammed first settled into secondary education he was good. I think it's that he finds it hard to settle down and so much depends on his friendship group."" By year nine it became clear that he would no longer have a place in mainstream education. It was either home education or a place at the same pupil referral unit that his older brother had attended. His family didn't want him getting into the same bad crowds as his brother. So when the school suggested home education as the only alternative, Mohammed's mother readily agreed. ""I never knew about the home schooling. I'm not that very educated myself and I'm not good with computers,"" she says. The council had suggested a home education website. ""We had a few links but because of my home life situation and working I hadn't enough hours. He'd be depressed every morning and I'd put him on the home education website but it wasn't working for him,"" says Mohammed's mum. When she tried to get Mohammed out of bed to work, he refused. Now she doesn't bother trying and he passes his time helping his granddad, who has a serious lung condition and needs round-the-clock care. For a brief period he attended Raising Explorers, an after-school facility in Bradford that tutored Mohammed for a couple of hours a week. ""It was hard to start over and not mess about and think about what I'm doing and to concentrate,"" he says. ""When I first went to the after-school club I was new, my background was different and I made mistakes. I got put on report and was doing good, but when people disturb me I just get annoyed and retaliate back,"" he says. He was excluded for brawling with another boy. Mohammed says he regrets the bad behaviour that lost him his place in a mainstream school. ""I used to go to school and do stupid things I didn't think it would come to this, I thought I'd just do it a bit and I'd have a chance. I was falling behind at school anyway, but now that I don't have school I won't have any education for my GCSEs. I do think about my future - it's not going to be good."" Out of School, Out of Sight is broadcast at 11:00 on Wednesday 4 October on BBC Radio 4, orlisten again on iPlayer Abdur Rahman, who runs a project working with excluded youngsters, says that like Richard Watts he is coming across an increasing number of cases where parents are persuaded to home educate, yet don't have the capacity to do so. ""These schools don't ask about the ability of parents to teach - that isn't part of the discussion. Schools work like businesses and it isn't about looking out for the child, it's about saying to Mum and Dad that: 'This is what you have to do because your child isn't engaging and it will keep you out of trouble.' It's a strategy that the schools are increasingly using."" The inspection of home education is carried out by local government officials, but it is a voluntary register and although numbers are thought to be growing, there is no real idea of how many families are doing this. It's because so little is known about the extent and quality of home education, that Lord Soley recently introduced a private members bill aimed at bringing in a mandatory registration system. He says that there are concerns about the quality of education some youngsters are receiving. There is also a cost for schools who take back pupils like Mohammed when home education hasn't worked. ""These pupils who fall behind have disruption to their own education outcomes, but then if they go back into schools they cause problems across the board as they try to catch up. It isn't helping them and it isn't good for the schools when it doesn't work,"" he says. Bradford Council is currently discussing school options with Mohammed and his family. A spokesman says the details of individual cases cannot be discussed, but any parent has the right to choose to home educate their child at any stage of their formal education. ""Local authorities can give advice but have no role in deciding whether this should happen,"" the spokesman continues. ""When the local authority becomes aware of an electively home-educated child, we offer a home visit or to meet at another venue. The local authority has no statutory duty to monitor the quality of home education on a routine basis. However, we always work to keep contact with parents to ensure our information about the child is kept up to date. ""All parents of electively home-educated children can contact our home education team at any time and parents can apply to the local authority for a school place at any point.  The local authority will always look to work with the district's schools to find a solution which works for the child and their parents."" Mohammed's mum is currently trying to get her son back into school. ""I want him to do his GCSEs and go further, to study and move on to what he wants to do - instead of just finishing with no qualifications in a cruel world. I want him to try hard and I've told him, but there's nothing else I can do. Mohammed says he'll do anything to go back to school and to study,"" she says. Mohammed agrees. He says he desperately wants to be back in the classroom. ""When I used to go to school I used to be around other children and I was happy. Now I'm by myself and it's just boring alone, I don't like it."" Join the conversation - find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,external,Snapchat,externalandTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played 'Nothing quite like it' - Laura Kuenssberg on PM's speech What now? The conference has packed up. The prime minister is home. No one will forget her speech. And there are MPs who believe that today's surreal events ought to mark the beginning of the end. There is a group of them ramping up their discussions about persuading her to go. One minister said the situation is ""brutal"" but the events will hasten her departure because it is ""like the moment when the vet tells you it is more cruel to keep the labrador alive"". Politics is certainly cruel, and clearly the prime minister was the victim of some appallingly bad luck. PM struggles through interrupted speech May revives promise to cap energy prices Another former minister told me that after the election and Grenfell it would only have taken one more event to trigger her exit and this ""was the event"". In normal political times, it is probably the case that what one minister described as a ""tragedy"" today would have led to a prime minister being forced out or quitting. But these aren't normal times. Allies of Theresa May say today she has shown her resilience and determination in spades, demonstrating exactly why she deserves to stay in the job. A senior colleague of hers told me she importantly did manage to put forward a coherent vision and talked about her personal beliefs. More than that, for those who want her gone there are three obstacles. First, with Brexit negotiations under way, any change of leader could be destabilising at a time when the UK needs to look strong. Second, Tory MPs don't agree on who a natural successor is, and a leadership election could open a Pandora's Box with untold consequences. And third, many Tory MPs are terrified of a general election. Doing anything that could precipitate a national contest means their jobs are at risk. But in the next few days the balance between the desire to end the torment on display today and preserve stability will be endlessly discussed by Tory MPs. And in these volatile times few would predict what they will conclude.

"Space exploration began with Sputnik's successful launch on 4 October, 1957 The launch of Sputnik, the first man-made satellite, 60 years ago kicked off the space race between the Soviet Union and America. The satellite was a success not just in terms of scientific advancement but in terms of providing a propaganda opportunity for the socialist state. Early reports detailed a wealth of technical information about the launch of the ""Earth satellite"", such was the general interest in it. One news correspondent described seeing the satellite appear ""like a flashing spark over the horizon"" and the Communist Party's main newspaper, Pravda, wrote that ""all the world heard the announcement of the launching of the artificial moon"". But reports by the state news agency Tass also mentioned its orbital velocity of about 8km a second, the fact that it was travelling at up to 900km above the surface of the earth, and that Sputnik was making one complete revolution in an hour and 35 minutes. Sputnik was just 58cm in diameter and weighed 84kg Russian media also detailed the frequencies and wavelengths on which Sputnik was emitting regular beeps, saying its transmitters were powerful enough for amateur radio operators to be able to receive them. Later, radio broadcasts to America touted the fact that the Soviet magazine Radio was offering ""special prizes"" for radio hams who submitted reports of the signals. Special broadcasts listed the places and times the satellite was expected to pass over. BBC Monitoring, a unit of the World Service, recorded Soviet broadcasts about Sputnik's movements The day after its launch, Tass and Russian radio reported world reaction to it, noting how major media outlets like AFP, the Daily Mail and the BBC had reported it and how ""some US radio stations interrupted their programmes in order to broadcast the satellite's signals"". On Soviet radio, various scientists, such as jet propulsion expert Professor Kirill Stanyukovich, called it ""a great victory not only for Soviet science but also for the Soviet order"". ""I think that the very fact that this has been achieved in our socialist country must not be regarded as mere chance,"" another academic told listeners. ""That we are not as rich as America is no secret to us. Why then has it happened that we have been capable of solving these most advanced and difficult scientific and technical problems ahead of Americans?"" Several digs at America made their way into reports. ""For 40 years they closed their eyes to the enormous successes of Soviet industry and agriculture,"" one radio broadcast said. ""Now the most reactionary personalities in the USA are trying to raise some doubts about the tremendous value and great significance of this new success of Soviet science."" BBC Monitoring, a unit of the World Service which monitored Soviet broadcasts at the time, notes that ""Leading officials were quoted by Tass as showing reluctance to accept the news; and Moscow radio told the home audience on the 7th that the United States Information Agency had adopted a policy of minimising the military and scientific significance of the achievement. US scientists, on the other hand, were given as expressing pleased congratulations."" Komsomolskaya Pravda described Sputnik as ""the victory of Soviet power"" Today, the name Sputnik is also associated with an international news agency, which has a presence on the web and radio,  and is one of the main media outlets through which Russia influences global opinion. Sputnik tends to seek audiences on the political margins - whether it's supporters of the Front National in France, or the Democrat Bernie Sanders in the US. Its political stances include the idea that NATO is a menace to world peace, criticism of what it sees as US hegemony, and the general decadence of Western democracies and their institutions, especially in the face of the challenges posed by Islamist terrorism and migration into Europe. Sputnik is still potent force for Russian influence, just in a different sort of space now.

"The claim:Prime Minister Theresa May said that following a speech at the Conservative Party conference in 2014, government action had meant ""the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds"". Reality Check verdict:The number of black people being stopped and searched by police has fallen by two-thirds since 2010-11 but not since the 2014 conference. Also, black people still form a disproportionately large percentage of those being stopped and searched and the percentage has actually risen since 2013-14. As she delivered her keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference, the prime minister reminded Tories of what she sees as a key achievement - a reduction in the number of black people being stopped and searched, but all is not what it seems. Theresa May spoke about a young black man called Alexander Paul who spoke at the conference in 2014 about his experience of police stop-and-search tactics. She said: ""Inspired by his example, we took action. We shook up the system, and the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two-thirds."" The overall number of stop-and-searches fell dramatically between 2010-11 and 2015-16, which is the most recent year for which data is available. So, the number of black people being stopped also fell. This graph shows that the number of black people being stopped fell by two-thirds over the total period, but not since Mr Paul spoke at the conference in 2014. But even though far fewer black people are being stopped and searched, they are still more likely to be stopped than any other ethnic group. When you look at the percentage of those stopped and searched who define themselves as black, little has changed. It was 15.2% in 2010-11, and fell to about 11% in 2013-14. Then it rose, and in 2015-16 was back up to 15.1%. The 2011 census found that 3.3% of people in England and Wales defined themselves as black - meaning black people are being stopped and searched nearly five times as often as you would expect them to be. So, while the number of black people being stopped and searched fell, their proportion of the total rose since Mr Paul spoke at the 2014 Conservative party conference. Just to be clear - these figures don't include stop-and-searches related to terrorism or that are carried out because police are trying to manage an incident that affects public safety - those fall under different legislation and are recorded separately. They would not have significantly changed the data. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter,external Should the police stop and search more?

"When we think about ourselves positively, we stimulate parts of our brains involved in reward, motivation, and pleasure, says Dr Stacie Grossman Bloom Dr Stacie Grossman Bloom is a neuroscientist who has three daughters. She also has a successful career at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. She has examined the role that neuroscience can play in boosting confidence. This is particularly useful to many women who need exactly that, she writes as part of this year's100 Women Challenge. Confidence is something that many women want, but don't know how to get.  Yet, we need to embrace our abilities and our value and have self-esteem to be successful.  Without it, we are less likely to seek promotion, speak up in meetings, and rise into leadership positions. This ultimately has an enormous impact, as study after study shows that having women at work in positions of power correlates with profitability, more collaborative environments, and improved problem solving. With some practice, we can use neuroscience to be more confident. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. In 2017, we're challenging them to tackle four of the biggest problems facing women today - the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, harassment in public spaces and sexism in sport. With your help, they'll be coming up with real-life solutions and we want you to get involved with your ideas. Find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,externaland use #100Women We know that self-confidence, like all of our personality traits, resides within our brains. And while a large part of the architecture of our brains is predetermined, our experiences and the choices we make continue to shape us. Over the course of our lives, we acquire new knowledge and abilities by modulating the intricate and malleable connections between the cells and circuits in our brains. We can utilise neuroscience to silence our negative inner voices and boost our confidence. These strategies work by engaging the ""value areas"" of the brain. When we think about ourselves positively, we are able to stimulate the parts of our brains that are involved in reward, motivation, and pleasure. One output of this pattern of neurological activation is that we literally feel good when we are confident, we hold our heads high. Dr. Bloom with her three daughters That feeling is contagious in that it also promotes those around us to be more engaged with us, whether that is our colleagues, our friends, or our troops. The reinforcing reactions we see and feel in response to our confidence also feed back to our brains to encourage more activity. The first step is to push back against the obstacles we know stand in our way by being mindful of the situation, and deciding to be confident. Making that complex decision is a multi-step process that taps into our emotions and engages many other parts of the brain. Once we have made the decision to be confident, we have to start training our brains. The orange structure here is one of billions of neurons. It is stretching out to make all the connections (synapses) you see in yellow (more than 75,000). Those connections are what we are tweaking when we learn to choose confidence Just like mastering any other talent, gaining self-assurance requires repetition and time. Every time we do or learn something new, our brains adjust to store our new skill or bit of knowledge. This happens because parts of our brains are plastic, and the synapses that connect our brain cells, called neurons, to each other can be modified, strengthened, and even newly created to store what we have acquired - in this case our confidence boost. BBC 100 Women: Who is on the list? Reality Check: Do women make companies richer? From a scientific perspective, women can blame both nature and nurture for stacking the odds against us when it comes to how we value ourselves compared to men.  It is a biological reality that women secrete different levels of hormones than men, causing us to react differently to the same world around us. The areas of the brain in these images that are coloured to show they are activated are so-called âvalue areasâ of the brain Women tend to have a desire to please others, to seek acceptance and inclusion, and to avoid conflict.  The way we respond to stressful situations is also different. While men tend to take more risk under pressure, women look for surer successes and reach out to connect with others to manage stress. Our genetic differences are compounded by the fact that we are socialised differently from the moment we are born and a pink hat is placed upon our heads. As we grow up, young women are not necessarily taught to exhibit self-confidence, and if we do, we are often criticized for being ""snobby"" or ""stuck-up"" or ""bitchy"" - words seldom associated with men. Reality Check: Do female leaders improve women's lives? Is the gender gap closing for rural women? We hear damaging terms like ""women's intuition"" suggesting that we aren't making strategic analyses, but basing our decisions on some ethereal gut feeling when study after study shows that women and men are equally data-driven. And the relentless emphasis placed on how we look erodes our self-image and for most of us, gets worse over time. As a mother of three young girls, this resonates with me every time my daughters receive yet another impossibly-proportioned doll designed for dress up, caregiving, or primping. This video can not be played Are women hitting a glass ceiling, or are they also climbing a broken ladder? It is well-documented that we way we raise our girls and women has a lasting impact on the way they view themselves and their abilities. Negative messages will engender self-doubt and lead us to underestimate ourselves. The result is not only a nearly universal feeling of imposter syndrome, but a fear of making mistakes, a suspicion that we are underperforming, and an unattainable quest for perfection. This is what we are shutting down when we make the decision to be confident. It doesn't matter what level of self-assurance you start at, the more time and effort you dedicate to practicing being more confident, the faster your brain will change and the faster you'll master it. To start, it's important to remove ourselves from situations and people that make us feel bad because confidence largely comes from being in a supportive environment. That environment comprises the people and environment around us and what we choose to focus our attention on. It is beneficial to concentrate on things that are empowering and to steer clear of exposure to images and content that make us feel bad about ourselves. The way we choose to hold and conduct ourselves is another factor. Mental simulations also help - envisioning ourselves finishing a race, speaking in public to a standing ovation, mastering a job, getting a degree - can all help build ourselves up. Just as a coach gives an encouraging pep talk to the team before taking the field, we can give ourselves a confidence lift. Notably, these practices have an impact on our overall health and wellbeing, serving as a buffer to stress and depression, and fostering good mental and physical health. When we choose confidence, we are rewiring our brains and we are able to change ourselves, and maybe even the world, for the better.

"Aaron Barley has been jailed for life for the murders Orphaned by the age of six, Aaron Barley's life was one of chaos and disorder. By 24, he was a double murderer, having turned on a family who tried to help him in a terrifying attack at their home. But how did he become a remorseless killer? Stourbridge stabbing: Aaron Barley sentenced to life Latest updates, plus more breaking news Stability was never a factor in the young Barley's life. Born the child of incest - his parents were uncle and niece - he was an orphan by the age of six. His father died of cancer when Barley was four and his mother of a heart attack about two years later. Barley's formative years were spent in numerous homes with foster carers and other family members. Tracey Wilkinson and son Pierce were brutally murdered on 30 March by Barley Eileen Adams, a former teacher and foster carer from 2003-2007, described him as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character who could be caring and sensitive, but also threatening. He became more difficult over time as he displayed signs of an increasingly violent personality, she said. According to the Birmingham Mail, 11-year-old Barley waskicked out,externalof a children's home in Worcestershire around 2005 and 2006. A former resident of the home described him as a  ""deeply troubled"" individual, constantly getting into fights and stealing a staff member's car. Police circulated this image of Barley when he went missing at the age of 13 At the age of 13, he was the subject of a police appeal when he went missing with other children in Bromsgrove. In the intervening years, he amassed 21 convictions for various offences, including an assault on his former partner. Aaron Barley has shown no remorse for his crimes and a motive is not known In 2016, Barley, who was living on the streets, was brought home by Tracey Wilkinson, who spotted him trying to stay warm in a cardboard box. Barley, who insisted he just needed ""a chance"", became a regular visitor at the family's home in Stourbridge, West Midlands, doing odd jobs in return for food and cash. He attended an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre where volunteers told of him being obsessed with weapons, in particular knives. Although he told them he wanted to kill someone with a knife - with his ""two aims in life"" being to kill a policeman and a prison officer - his remarks were dismissed as bravado caused by drug abuse. This video can not be played Lydia Wilkinson thought all her family was dead Peter Wilkinson's firm, Asset International, created Project Shelter to help Barley, and by late summer 2016 they had arranged a permanent job for him at Newport docks. All seemed to be going well until managers started to report he was not attending work. He was evicted from his flat and several managers reported aggressive behaviour towards them. By February 2017 he had secured a job as a furniture polisher. But before long he was sacked - he had claimed he was taking drugs and couldn't be bothered to work. That same month he made violent threats about ""taking down"" his family on Facebook, and wondering how many he could kill before he was caught. In the weeks before the killings he began frequenting local pubs, behaving unpredictably and taking drugs. Pierce Wilkinson, pictured with sister Lydia and father Peter, was killed in the attack Barley's motive for the killings remains a mystery. Mr Wilkinson can only think that the family's decision to end Barley's mobile phone contract - which they had paid for until a week before the attack - may have created a grudge. What is known is that when Barley, 24, went to Greyhound Lane, Norton, on 29 March, his intentions were clear. He lay in wait before he carried out the attacks, hiding in the garden shed overnight after failing to gain entry to the home he once shared with the family. Emergency services were called to Greyhound Lane, Norton on 30 March He emerged the next day, entered the house and carried out the cold and calculated killings. He stabbed Mrs Wilkinson and Pierce first, before attacking Mr Wilkinson as he returned home from walking the family dog. To this day Barley has shown no remorse for his crimes. His only regret, he told police, was that he didn't succeed in killing Mr Wilkinson. When he appeared in court two days after the stabbings, he was flanked by three officers in full riot gear, after he tried to bite and punch police while in custody. As he is jailed for life, it may never be known what drove him to kill the people who tried to help him most.

"Six days after the Christchurch mosque attack, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a ban on ""military-style"" semi-automatic rifles, prompting questions in the US. Following a series of mass shootings in the US in recent years, there has been little in the way of sweeping gun-control reforms. On the federal level, at least, the interest and attention in new legislation has led to almost no action in decades, despite numerous polls showing widespread public support for measures like strengthened background checks and banning certain types of high-capacity gun magazines and military-style assault rifles. The Trump administration has issued a regulatory ban on bump-stock modifications that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns, and there have been some tweaks to the background check database for gun-store purchases. Last March, Donald Trump entertained the notion of more ambitious, ""comprehensive"" legislation, telling senators pro-gun lobbyists had little power over him. But there's been no such talk from the president since. Part of the reason New Zealand is ability to move quickly, of course, is that it's a parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the government is controlled entirely by one party or a politically compatible coalition. That's not the only explanation for why the US has charted a different course, however. Here are five big obstacles that stand in the way of the kind of the US taking the kind of quick, major changes to firearm policy being advanced in New Zealand. A woman shows off a model gun and holster at an NRA fashion show The National Rifle Association is one of the most influential interest groups in US politics - not just because of the money it spends on lobbying politicians, but also because of the engagement of its five million members. It opposes most proposals to strengthen firearm regulations and is behind efforts at both the federal and state levels to roll back many existing restrictions on gun ownership. In 2016 theNRA spent,external$4m on lobbying and direct contributions to politicians as well as more than $50m on political advocacy, including an estimated $30m to help elect Donald Trump president. Its overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts. This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire More than just the numbers, however, the NRA has developed a reputation in Washington as a political force that can make or break even the strongest politicians. It grades politicians on their votes and directs its resources and those of its membership - both financial and organisational - to supporting its fiercest advocates and defeating staunch opponents. As one former Republican congressmantold the New York Times,externalin 2013: ""That was the one group where I said, 'As long as I'm in office, I'm not bucking the NRA.'"" Last March the president said he wasn't ""afraid"" of the NRA - but that was a rhetorical flourish that has not resurfaced. Could it change?Gun-control groups, backed by wealthy benefactors like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have become more organised in recent years, attempting to match the NRA's political might. They actually outspent the NRA in the 2018 mid-terms, during which some prominent pro-gun-control Democrats won close elections. The NRA's revenues dropped $56m in 2017, driven largely by a decline in membership dues. It still brought in $378.1m that year, however, ensuring that it will be the biggest single player in the firearm debate. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Obama: Guns laws were the biggest frustration of my presidency For the first time in eight years, Democrats have control of the House of Representatives - and their success in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections was fuelled largely by victories in suburban swing districts. In Atlanta, for instance, a gun-control activist won one of the closest races of the election, unseating an incumbent Republican. This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Despite these advances for the party, the House electoral playing field is still tilted toward Republicans, who tend to be for gun rights. Due to the way the lines of House congressional districts are drawn, many by Republican-controlled state legislatures, there are more seats that tilt to the right than the left. While 2018 was a Democratic wave election, political gravity may eventually reassert itself, giving control of the chamber back to conservatives. Demographics also play a part in the pro-gun sentiment in the House, as there are more rural districts with higher levels of gun ownership than there are urban ones. Racking up big pro-gun-control majorities in urban areas does little to change the political realities in the House. House members sit on the floor ""to demand action on common sense gun legislation"" For the moment, however, the initiative is with Democrats, and 2019 marked a significant step forward for gun-control proponents in Congress. One of their first actions was to pass a bill in the House requiring comprehensive background checks of private gun sales, including those that take place at gun shows. Previously the requirement to run the name of gun purchasers in a federal database was limited only to registered gun dealers. Prior to 2019, attempts to pass new federal laws regulating firearms had been over before they ever really begin, stymied by House Republicans. In June 2016 a group of Democratic politicians staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to protest over the Republican House leadership's decision not to hold a vote on two gun-control bills. Could it change?The House of Representatives was once one of the biggest obstacles to federal gun-control legislation. It no longer is - for now. With every House seat up for election every two years, and an American electorate that has proven fickle, the door could slam shut again with little advanced notice. Now that gun-control bills have hopes in the House of Representatives, the Senate - where the rural-urban divide plays itself out on the state level - becomes the biggest obstacle to legislative success. States dominated by big-city voters, such as New York, Massachusetts or California, are outnumbered by rural and Southern states with pro-gun sentiments. The rules of the Senate can also thwart efforts to enact more stringent firearm regulation, thanks to the ""filibuster"" - a procedural hurdle that means most major pieces of legislation need the backing of 60 out of 100 senators to pass, rather than a simple 51-vote majority. In 2013, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, it appeared that efforts to strengthen gun-purchase background checks had significant bipartisan support in the Senate. After a concerted lobbying effort by the NRA, however, the bill received only 56 votes in favour, four short of the mark necessary to break the filibuster. This video can not be played Barack Obamaâs mass shooting speeches No gun-control measure has come close to passage since then. At least for the moment, there appears little chance the Senate will take up the House-passed universal background check bill, despite indications that a majority of senators would vote in favour of it. Could it change?Mr Trump has been a vocal proponent of doing away with the Senate filibuster, as he views it as an obstacle to enacting his legislative agenda. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made similar calls. A majority of senators are on the record against changing the rules, however. Protesters in front of the Supreme Court in 2008 With Congress deadlocked on new gun legislation, left-leaning US states have taken a greater role in implementing gun-control measures. After the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York. Some of the laws have run up against another barrier, however - the US judicial system. In recent years the Supreme Court has twice ruled that the right to own personal weapons such as handguns is enshrined in the constitution. This video can not be played How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings The Second Amendment says that ""a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed"". Gun-control activists point to the introductory clause as evidence that the amendment was meant primarily to create a ""well regulated"" militia. In 2008, however, a sharply divided court held that the Second Amendment provides a broad right to firearm ownership that prohibits stringent registration requirement for personal weapons. Since then, lower courts have considered challenges to state-imposed assault weapon bans, registration requirements and open-carry prohibitions. Could it change?Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have a record of viewing Second Amendment rights broadly. The president is filling out the ranks of the lower courts with pro-gun-rights judges. If anything, the judiciary is moving to the right on this issue. In the autumn, the Supreme Court will consider a challenge to a New York City law restricting how handgun owners can transport their firearms. Gun-control advocates fear the high court is poised to strike another blow against state and local regulations. How Trump turned against gun control What gunfire tells us about weapons used in Las Vegas Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws at the national level is that opponents tend to hold fiercely to their beliefs, while support for new regulation tends to ebb and flow around each new instance of violence. The NRA's strategy, and that of pro-gun politicians, is to wait out the storm - to delay legislative efforts until attention turns elsewhere and the outcry fades. Pro-gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed. The mass student-led protests following the Parkland school shooting focused white-hot attention on the issue for a time, but the marches have died down and the changes to gun laws, at least on the federal level, have been minimal. Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters ""there's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country"". Mr Trump  said ""we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by"". As time goes by. As that song from the film Casablanca says, it's still the same old story. Could it change?According to one poll during the 2016 presidential campaign, guns were an important issue for both Democrats and Republicans. That could be a reflection of that year's mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub or the first indication of a new trend.

"For more than 2,000 years, the Baiga tribeswomen have been getting tattoos In India, and across the world, getting a tattoo is nowadays seen as a sign of independence and rebellion. Many young people get inked to showcase their identity, what makes them distinctive and who they are. But for me, a decision to not get a tattoo was my version of rebellion, an assertion of my hard-fought independence. It was my way of saying: ""I will not toe the line."" I grew up thinking of tattoos, along with nose and ear piercings, as symbols of the subjugation of women. That's because my mother has a couple of tattoos. And my grandmother had more than a couple. And they told me they had no choice in the matter. In many rural communities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, where my family comes from, it's mandatory for married women to have tattoos, locally known as Godna. ""My family told me that if I didn't have a tattoo, no-one in my matrimonial home would drink water or take food offered by me. I'd be considered impure, an untouchable,"" my mother told me recently. My father, of course, didn't need to get one because, as mum says, ""he was a boy"". She was a child bride, not even 11 at the time of her wedding in the 1940s. A few weeks after the ceremony, an elderly woman who lived in the neighbourhood was called to the house to brand her. Tattoos are believed to have been in existence for thousands of years. They were used to mark prisoners, servants and slaves. Ancient Greeks and Romans had them, so did ancient Indians. Jews were given numerical tattoos in concentration camps. They were used for human branding and caste markings. Often meant to be punitive, they were used to shame and as symbols of subjugation. Sometimes, they were symbols of ownership with the names of a father or husband. Her tools were rudimentary: a needle that she would heat with fire. The process involved burning the upper layer of skin and filling the tattoo with black colour pigment. In those days, there was no anaesthetic to numb the pain and no ointments to quicken the healing process, and a tattoo would take a month to heal. More than seven decades later, my mother's tattoos have somewhat faded, but the memory of the pain inflicted in childhood remains vivid. ""I cried through it. I kept kicking the tattoo maker. At the end, she went and complained to my grandfather. She told him I was trouble,"" she says. Calling your husband by name for the first time The women eating with their families for the first time Why Indian women are no Cinderellas Are women less important than cows in India? She has no idea what the small patterns on her arms mean and I can't figure them out either. ""Maybe it's phool-patti,"" she says, meaning flowers and leaves. Keya Pandey, a social anthropologist at Lucknow University who has researched tattoos extensively in rural and tribal India, says flora and fauna are among the preferred designs. Also high on the list are the names of husbands or fathers, or even the village, totems or other symbols of cultural or clan identity, and images of a god or local deity. Ms Pandey says she's seen tattoos in every rural culture in India and estimates that millions of women in villages have them. My mother was told that if she didn't get a tattoo, she would be regarded as impure She has no idea what her tattoos mean In some communities, especially in tribal areas, both men and women have tattoos. ""It's a symbol of identity, in life and even after death. The idea is that when you die and your soul travels up to heaven or hell and you'll be asked where you come from, you'll be able to trace your ancestry through your tattoos,"" she says. There are also communities where women get tattoos for the purpose of beautification - though there are instances where low-caste women got tattooed to make themselves ugly and less desirable to avoid being sexually assaulted by influential men. But in many communities, as in my ancestral village, tattoos are meant only for a woman, a sign of her marital status. For my mother and grandmother, they were a symbol of purity, the idea that unless a woman was put through a painful purification ritual, she was not fit to serve the patriarchy. The practice, however, is declining - and many young women, even girls, are saying no to being branded. With modernity and development creeping in and growing contact with the outside world, things are changing in rural and tribal India. Traditions and folklore are being modified and girls in villages are no longer interested in getting a tattoo, Ms Pandey says. Nowhere is that more evident than among the girls of the Baiga tribe in central India. Mother Badri Bai (left) has tattoos all over her body, daughter Anita has one and she has refused to get any more For more than 2,000 years, the women here have been getting branded. ""The tattooing starts as they hit puberty when they get the first one on their forehead and over the next few years, most parts of their bodies are covered bit by bit with the exception of some part of the torso,"" says Pragya Gupta of WaterAid India. Ms Gupta, who recently travelled to meet the Baigas to understand theaccess they have to safe drinking water, told the BBC that all the women she met had tattoos, but more and more girls today were refusing to get inked. As road connectivity has improved, television and cellphones have arrived and children have begun going to school, many have started rejecting what's been passed on to them for generations in the name of tradition. ""I met this 15-year-old called Anita. She has a tattoo on her forehead and she told me that it was very painful and she would never get another one. Her mother, 40-year-old Badri, has tattoos covering most of her body,"" Ms Gupta says. Anita's rebellion has won grudging support from her mother. ""I was illiterate and I accepted unquestioningly what my parents told me. But she goes to school and if she doesn't want a tattoo, it's fine by me,"" she says. In recent years, educated affluent Indians in cities have begun to get tattoos, inspired by images of Hollywood actors and rock musicians. Many of my friends have got inked too. But for me, because of my cultural heritage, tattoos remain taboo - a symbol of subjugation.

"Carles Puigdemont (left) criticised Spain's King Felipe in his address Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has attacked Spain's King Felipe VI for ""deliberately ignoring millions of Catalans"", after a disputed vote was held on independence. He accused the king of adopting the Spanish government's position. King Felipe made a TV address on Tuesday night, calling Sunday's vote illegal and undemocratic. Mr Puigdemont has already indicated that independence could be declared next week. ""This moment calls for mediation,"" he said in a televised statement late on Wednesday. He claimed that the king had rejected a moderating role granted to him by the Spanish constitution. In response, the Spanish government in Madrid said it would not accept ""blackmail"" from the Catalan leader. Mr Puigdemont must return to the path of law before any negotiation could take place, itsaid in a statement (in Spanish).,external His criticism of the king showed that he was ""out of touch with reality,"" it added. Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? Mr Puigdemont told the BBC on Tuesday that he would declare independence ""at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". The Catalan government has said there will be an extraordinary meeting of parliament on Monday to discuss the outcome of the disputed referendum. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold Catalan officials say more than 2.2 million people voted on Sunday and that nearly 90% of them backed independence. The turnout has been estimated at 42% but final results have not been given. There have been a number of reports of irregularities, partly because voters were allowed to cast ballots anywhere to avoid police measures aimed at halting the vote. In some areas far more votes were cast than the number of residents. In his statement on Wednesday evening, Mr Puigdemont did not give any further details of a possible declaration of independence. Switching to Spanish from Catalan, he thanked Spanish citizens who had sent their ""solidarity"" to Catalonia. Nearly 900 people - according to Catalan authorities - were hurt as police violently tried to enforce a Spanish court order suspending the vote, which the government had declared illegal. Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Thirty-three police officers were also injured, local medical officials said. Shocked by what they had seen, hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined street protests on Tuesday. A general strike was also called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"". Q&A: Do Catalans really want independence? Why Catalan emotions are running high How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote By Patrick Jackson, BBC News, Girona It was a rare public attack on the Spanish monarch but King Felipe himself, symbol of national unity, seldom addresses the country on TV, and President Puigdemont had to respond. At a bar in the Catalan leader's home region, they clapped respectfully afterwards, happy with their leader and his call for mediation, and then they joked about the Game of Thrones TV series. ""We need a king like Jon Snow who tries to keep his lands together and is with the people,"" said one woman, laughing.

"US police have said the woman, a former casino employee, was living with Paddock in Nevada The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who shot dead 58 people on Sunday has said she had no idea what her ""kind, caring, quiet"" partner was planning. Marilou Danley's comments came hours before police suggested Stephen Paddock had been living ""a secret life"". They said he may have been planning to escape instead of shooting himself dead, but did not give further details. It is not yet known why he opened fire on an open-air concert, committing the worst shooting in modern US history. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference that: Police had found more explosives in Paddock's car at the hotel, along with about 1,600 rounds of ammunition Paddock had been gambling just hours before he began shooting He had booked into an apartment at the high-rise Ogden in downtown Las Vegas a week earlier during a different open-air festival where acts including Muse, Lorde and Blink-182 were due to play But he said Paddock's motivations and whether there were any possible accomplices remained a mystery. The FBI's Aaron Rouse said so far no link to terrorism had been found but they would continue to ""look at all avenues"" without ""closing any doors"" because it was ""an ongoing investigation"". ""We don't understand it yet,"" Sheriff Lombardo told reporters, but questioned whether he could have accomplished his plan by himself. ""You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" he said. Ms Danley, who spoke to the FBI on Wednesday, expressed shock at the ""horrible unspeakable acts of violence"" Paddock had committed. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes Paddock ""never said anything to me or took any action"" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer. Ms Danley added: ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together."" What do we know about Marilou Danley? Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas US authorities named Ms Danley a ""person of interest"" in their investigation and said they had made contact with her shortly after the shooting. Ms Danley voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI, just over two weeks after Paddock had surprised her with a ""cheap ticket"" to enable her to visit her family. While there, he wired her $100,000 (Â£75,400), explaining it was to buy a house. ""I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,"" she said. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone."" Her sister earlier told Australian outlet7News,externalthat Ms Danley ""was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning"". Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. What does Las Vegas want Trump to do? Who are the victims? 'Pandemonium' on the Strip US President Donald Trump, who visited the city on Wednesday, said ""America is truly a nation in mourning"" in the wake of the mass killings. Hundreds of people were injured in the attack. President Trump praised the emergency services who battled to save as many as they could, despite the danger to themselves. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse ""When the worst of humanity strikes - and strike it did - the best of humanity responds,"" he said as he applauded injured officers. ""In the depths of horror, we will always find hope in the men and women who risk their lives for ours,"" he added. Mr Trump said he was in the ""company of heroes"" after visiting the first responders. ""Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night,"" he said. ""Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage."" The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate.

"This video can not be played Carles Puigdemont spoke to the BBC on Tuesday evening Pro-independence Catalan leaders are pressing ahead despite an emphatic warning from King Felipe VI. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont told the BBC he would declare independence ""at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". The European Union said it was ""time to talk"" to find a solution to the crisis in Catalonia. Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said the Spanish constitution must be followed. Mr Timmermans, addressing the European Parliament, described the images of violence from Catalonia as ""saddening"", but emphasised the importance of upholding the rule of law. In his intervention, late on Tuesday, King Felipe branded Sunday's referendum in the north-eastern Spanish region illegal and undemocratic. But correspondents say his failure to acknowledge the violent repression of the vote has fired up rather than deterred independence supporters. Meanwhile, Spain's high court has summoned the head of Catalonia's regional police force to testify as a suspect in a investigation of alleged sedition - inciting rebellion against the state. Josep LluÃ­s Trapero and three other people are expected to appear in court on Friday in a move likely to inflame sentiment further amid Spain's deepest political crisis in decades, say correspondents. Divided loyalties: The couples at odds over independence Analysis: Biggest crisis for a generation Could Catalonia make a success of independence? Following the BBC interview in which he said there would be a declaration of independence in the coming days, Carles Puigdemont said he would make a statement at 21:00 (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Groups in the Catalan parliament have agreed that parliament should meet in full assembly on Monday. Mr Puigdemont could also use that occasion to make a unilateral declaration of independence. When asked what he would do if the Spanish government were to intervene and take control of Catalonia's government, Mr Puigdemont said it would be ""an error which changes everything"". Under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, the government in Madrid is permitted to impose direct rule on  autonomous regions. Mr Puigdemont says not, and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has kept silent since the scenes of police violence which accompanied Sunday's vote. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Burridge on how the crisis in Spain is likely to unfold The Spanish government has vowed to resist any declaration of independence, with Mr Rajoy previously saying the vote made a ""mockery"" of democracy. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau has called on both sides to talk. ""Neither a unilateral declaration of independence nor article 155. More than ever we need dialogue and bridges,""she tweeted,external. The European parliament was due to debate the crisis on Wednesday afternoon, but any resolution passed will be non-binding. This video can not be played King Felipe VI: ""Catalan society is fractured"" In his televised address, King Felipe said the Catalan leaders who organised the referendum showed their ""disrespect to the powers of the state"". ""They have broken the democratic principles of the rule of law,"" he said. But many Catalans were more concerned about what the king did not say, reports the BBC's Patrick Jackson who watched the address in a bar in Barcelona city centre. ""There were no words about the scenes of police beating voters on Sunday, no urgent appeal for dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments, no acknowledgment of the real hunger here for independence or at least a proper, legal referendum, not even a word or two of Catalan,"" he says. This video can not be played Clare and Kike react to the Spanish king's address It was a missed opportunity to push the two sides towards dialogue, said one customer in the bar. Q&A: Do Catalans really want independence? Why Catalan emotions are running high How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote News that the head of the local police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, his deputy and two civic organisers are to be questioned as part of the high court's sedition investigation will likely further aggravate the situation. On 20 September members of the national security forces were trapped by an angry crowd of pro-independence supporters during a raid on the regional economy ministry, aimed at disrupting Sunday's poll. The Mossos has been accused of failing to respond properly to their urgent requests for back-up. Nearly 900 people were hurt as police violently tried to enforce a Spanish court order suspending the vote, which the government had declared illegal. This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, storming into polling stations and pulling women by their hair. Thirty-three police officers were also injured, local medical officials said. Shocked by what they had seen, hundreds of thousands of Catalans joined street protests on Tuesday. A general strike was also called in protest at ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"" seen during the ballot. More than 2.2 million people voted on Sunday, according to the Catalan government. Officials put the vote in support of independence at nearly 90%, but official results have not yet been released. There are several reports of gaping irregularities, partly attributed to a system which permitted voters to cast their ballots anywhere in a bid to get around the police measures to stop the vote. Spanish media carried reports of some Catalan areas counting far more votes than residents. Catalan officials said the turnout was 42%, potentially weakening the position of Mr Puigdemont.

"US police have said the woman, a former casino employee, was living with Paddock in Nevada The girlfriend of Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock has arrived in the United States, where she is due to be questioned by police. Marilou Danley was met by federal agents as she landed in Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night. Paddock reportedly wired $100,000 (Â£75,400) to her in the Philippines before the rampage. US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, arrived in Las Vegas on Wednesday to console a shocked nation. What does Las Vegas want Trump to say? What do we know about Marilou Danley? ""Well, it's a very sad thing,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House as he left for Nevada. ""We're going to pay our respects and to see the police who have done really a fantastic job in a very short time."" This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes The president also said ""a lot more"" was emerging about the gunman. ""That'll be announced at the appropriate time,"" he added. From his 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Paddock, a retired accountant with no criminal record, sprayed bullets into a crowd at a country music festival below. He killed 58 concertgoers and injured more than 500, before apparently killing himself. Police officials quoted by the Reuters news agency said they hoped Ms Danley - an Australian citizen who moved to the US 20 years ago - would consent to be interviewed voluntarily. US authorities have named Ms Danley a ""person of interest"" in their investigation, and said they made contact with her shortly after the shooting. She had been in the Philippines since late September, local media reported. Her sisters told Australian outlet7News,externalthat Ms Danley had not known about the trip until Paddock told her he had bought her a ticket to the Philippines. ""She was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning,"" they said. Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. 'Pandemonium' on the Strip Five reasons US gun control won't happen Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation told AFP news agency it was investigating reports that Paddock sent $100,000 to Ms Danley in the Philippines days before the shooting. Ms Danley's sisters also told 7News that she had been wired that amount in the Philippines. An unnamed US official told Reuters news agency that investigators were assuming the amount was intended as a form of life insurance. Eric Paddock, the youngest brother of Stephen Paddock, toldthe New York Times,externalthat his brother loved and doted on Ms Danley. ""She was probably one of the only people I've ever seen that he'd go out of his way to do a little thing for,"" he said. But the pair are also said to have had a turbulent relationship, according to other reports.The Los Angeles Times,externalhas spoken to people who witnessed Paddock verbally abusing Ms Danley at a coffee shop in Mesquite, Nevada. Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? The 62-year-old was reportedly born in the Philippines Lived in Queensland for about 10 years in the 1980s while married to an Australian She then moved to the US and was married to American Geary Danley, whom she divorced in 2015 Used to work as a casino hostess attending to ""high-limit"" players, and is thought to have met Stephen Paddock in a Nevada casino US police say she had been living in Nevada with Paddock Sources: Australian Broadcasting Corporation, US media outlets Police say Paddock set up a number of cameras in and around his hotel suite. Two cameras in the hallway and one in the peephole allowed him to see if ""law enforcement or security"" were approaching, they said. Although the authorities are still unable to explain why a 64-year-old gambler and retired accountant should want to carry out a mass shooting by hauling such a vast arsenal of weapons to the hotel, they do know there was a high degree of planning. The authorities in Las Vegas revised the death toll down from 59 on Tuesday evening, saying that one of the bodies was that of the gunman. Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas Who are the victims? People paid tribute to the victims of the massacre in the Las Vegas Strip Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters: ""It was pre-planned extensively and I'm pretty sure he evaluated everything he did in his actions."" Undersheriff Kevin McMahill suggested the attack may have stopped when Paddock was disturbed, shooting a security guard. Who are the victims? President Trump is in no doubt. He described Paddock as ""a sick man, a demented man"". But a senior US homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said there was ""no evidence"" of ""mental illness or brain damage"". Reports on Wednesday said Paddock was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug in June, but this has not been officially confirmed. Nor have police found links to any foreign or domestic terrorist organisations, despite the claims made by the group known as Islamic State that the gunman was acting on their behalf. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Paddock, who had a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas. He reportedly shared his house there with Marilou Danley. Nineteen firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition with electronic devices were found at the property. According to reports, Paddock had a troubled upbringing - his father was a bank robber who regularly beat him and his three brothers, while his mother struggled to cope bringing up the family. A contrasting picture of the gunman has emerged - with some describing him as cold and stand-offish and others saying he was friendly. One of his three brothers told US media that he gave financial support to his elderly mother. The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate. How Trump turned against gun control Las Vegas shooting - what we know Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck.

Hundreds of shots were fired over the course of nine minutes, according to police.

"RAF Typhoon jets intercepted a passenger flight and diverted it to Stansted Airport following a suspected ""hoax"" security alert. The RAF said its quick reaction alert Typhoon aircraft were deployed on Wednesday morning and safely escorted the plane to the airport, near London. Flights were temporarily grounded at Stansted but have since resumed. Ryanair said the flight from Kaunas in Lithuania to Luton was diverted ""in line with procedures"". One passenger, Jonathan Zulberg, said when passengers boarded the flight they saw fire engines and a police car but were not told about a threat being made. The flight was delayed for up to 40 minutes, he said, and he was told by a stewardess that a bomb threat had been made in Lithuania. Mr Zulberg said the captain announced that a bomb threat had been made after the plane landed in the UK. He said: ""When I heard I was pretty surprised the plane was allowed to take off."" A sonic boom could be heard in Suffolkafter the Typhoon aircraft were authorised to travel at supersonic speed for the operation, the RAF said. The aircraft are kept on high alert and can take off ""within minutes"" from RAF Coningsby and RAF Lossiemouth to defend UK airspace.

"This video can not be played Theresa May struggles with her cough Theresa May might be stocking up on cough remedies after battling through a croaky voice during her Conservative Party conference speech - but could the prime minister have done anything to fix her faltering voice? Mrs May had to stop several times to drink water during her party's annual conference address - at one point being handed a lozenge by Chancellor Philip Hammond. To make matters worse, a heckler handed the PMa joke P45 before being bundled out of the hall, after which the slogan written behind the lectern fell apart. Fellow politicians praised Mrs May for carrying on - with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisting she did a ""fantastic job"" while Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""This was the speech of a brave prime minister struggling on."" But Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former aide and a public speaker, insisted that her pre-speech prep was ""shocking"" - claiming thatdoctors could ""sort"" a croaky voice,externalfor an hour. BBC Radio 4 announcer Neil Nunes also offered his voice tips -tweeting,externalthat the PM should have spoken more softly, suggesting: ""Take a moment, pause, drink and it'll come back.""

Prof Neil Tolley, a head and neck surgeon at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in London, insists ""no quick fix"" could have covered up Mrs May's tired voice. ""She's had a very heavy workload,"" he says. ""Life's tough for her at the moment."" Arguing the case for Brexit, shouting in the House of Commons and chairing cabinet meetings have all taken their toll, Prof Tolley explains. He says many politicians suffer from voice problems, but they can combat overuse by practicing breathing techniques to help them vocalise more effectively. ""I would change my delivery technique by speaking more slowly to take tension out of my larynx [voice box], rather than trying to shout my way through a presentation,"" Prof Tolley says. But he adds: ""In the House of Commons she's got to overcome a wall of noise, and that can be particularly challenging."" Confidence coach Anne Walsh says Mrs May's body language also impaired her voice - saying she was in ""fight or flight"" mode. ""The cough will have thrown her off, but she wasn't breathing regularly,"" she says. ""She doesn't fully extend her height and is exerting a lot of muscle tension."" Ms Walsh says the PM could have benefitted from simple voice exercises, like humming, to warm up her vocal chords. ""The best thing to do is to release your shoulders, ground your feet, and slightly bend your knees."" But what if you have to deliver a speech with a spluttering cough you really cannot suppress? Some have expressed their sympathy for Mrs May's inability to stifle her coughs - including BBC Scotland's political correspondent Nick Eardley, who had a coughing fit at the SNP conference last year. ""We've all been there,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The show must go on, so there's no choice but to acknowledge it with the crowd,"" suggests dialect coach Elspeth Morrison. If a speaker really cannot hold their cough in, it is better to make a joke about it rather than to overlook it completely, she says. ""The same goes for a heckler - the worst thing is to ignore it because everybody knows it's happened and it's a chance to win over the audience."" After being interrupted with a fake P45, Mrs May got cheers from the audience for joking that the only redundancy notice she wanted to give out was to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. If you have a cold, Ms Morrison says drinking a hot beverage or inhaling steam can help, adding: ""It might sound unsavoury but if you're feeling a bit phlegmy then swallow rather than cough to prevent further irritation."" She advises avoiding highly caffeinated drinks like coffee, as well as sugary foods, which can dry out the mouth. And one final tip? ""If your mouth suddenly goes dry, take a bite of a green apple - it will make your salivary glands go!"" Ms Morrison says. ""If you act confident in the body often your voice will follow.""

"Clive Davis's discoveries include Alicia Keys (pictured), Aerosmith and Billy Joel If it wasn't for Clive Davis, you might never have heard of Bruce Springsteen. The singer was still a rookie when he stood in Davis's office in 1972 and played his heart out. ""This was like the biggest days of my life,"" Springsteen later recalled. Davis signed him on the spot, taking a punt that this raw, untested talent could become a household name. Seven years, and a lot of hard work, later, Springsteen sold out Madison Square Garden. For most of us, discovering one superstar would be enough - but over the last four decades, Davis has steered the likes of Aretha Franklin, Billy Joel, Aerosmith, Barry Manilow and Alicia Keys towards the top 40. But his biggest artist was always Whitney Houston. Davis discovered her in her teens, nurturing her talent and shaping her into one of the best-selling artists of all time. He maintained a strong hand in her career, staging an intervention when drugs took over her life, and says her death, in 2012, still feels ""startling and unexpected"". Clive Davis and Whitney Houston with a few of the records they sold Now aged 85, Davis is the chief creative officer of Sony Music, and revered as one of the dons of the music industry. And his story is explored in a new documentary, Soundtrack of Our Lives, which premiered this week on Apple Music. ""I think the film captures the fact that I got into the business by accident,"" he tells the BBC. ""I never planned it. And when I got in, I discovered a natural gift that I never would have known I had. ""I don't read music - but [I still get] that visceral feeling when I'm looking for that next great star, or the next hit song."" Along the way, his gut has guided him towards surprising, often tough, decisions. Many of them have changed the course of pop music. Here are just five examples. Prince: Putting the P-funk into ""paragraph II B, sub-clause nine"" In 1999, Prince licensed his 23rd album, Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic, to Arista Records. Davis's job was merely to market the record, but he struck up a friendship with the musician, taking him to see Basketball games, and joining him at concerts. They talked about music a lot ""but the subject that really fascinated him, in that electrifying mind of his, was legal stuff. ""Stuff like, 'I don't believe in the compulsory licensing part of the copyright act,' or, 'I don't believe in sampling'. From everywhere he ever was, he called me once or twice a week for a long period of time to keep discussing this. ""And eventually he said, 'I've never heard these issues articulated as well as you're articulating them. Let's record this. I think a tape of our dialogue on these subjects would be great'. ""I said, 'I'm flattered. But you're the only one interested in this.'"" ""It's not against nature to want a favourable critical or commercial reaction,"" says Davis After getting the go-ahead from Davis, Bruce Springsteen set off to record his debut album, Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ. ""We went in and we did the record and I sent it over to himâ¦ and he sent it back,"" recalls Springsteen in Soundtrack of our Lives. ""He said, 'There's no singles on the record.'"" ""Springsteen was a mature guy, even though he was young,"" says Davis of the incident. ""He said, 'OK, if that's the way it works, let me go back and think about it.' ""And he came back and said, 'That was a good call. I wrote Blinded By The Light and Spirit In The Night.'"" Both songs went on to become singles - and the documentary digs out archive footage of Davis reciting the lyrics in a promotional video that was sent to record distributors and radio stations in 1975. Clive Davis recites Bruce Springsteen's lyrics in a promotional video from 1975 ""I was shocked to see it,"" laughs Davis. ""Why did I do it? I don't know. ""But I had a few other artists - Tim Hart and Eric Andersen - who were all called 'the next Bob Dylan,' and that turned out to be the kiss of death. ""I did not want Springsteen to be categorised as another Bob Dylan. I said, 'His imagery is so different from Dylan [so] I'm going to, into a camera, read the lyrics of every song on this Greetings From Asbury Park album, to show them this is a unique artist coming through.'"" The band wanted to release Cecelia instead ""I was so blown away by Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" says Davis of Simon & Garfunkel's best-loved composition. ""I thought it was a landmark song."" Defying both the band and conventional wisdom, Davis decided the song should be the first single from the duo's fifth and final album. ""Simon and Garfunkel said, 'God, we thought he'd pick Cecelia. It's uptempo, it's the right length, it's an obvious candidate for Top 40 radio. Why has he come up with Bridge Over Troubled Water, which is much too long, a ballad?'"" ""But to me it's one of the best songs ever written, and so I said I'd prefer to take on that. ""That's why to this day Garfunkel will say, 'That's leadership. He knows enough to say, 'Hold on, I'm not going to formulise everything.'"" The mogul signed Whitney Houston to Arista Records when she was a teenager ""Whitney had an incredible gift and power as a performer,"" says Davis. ""She was the greatest singer of her era."" The pair formed a creative collaboration when Whitney was just 19 years-old, and Davis helped her choose every song she recorded. And it's thanks to him that I Will Always Love You starts with 45 seconds of the star singing alone, unadorned and unaccompanied. ""My radio promotion people all said, 'Cut that out - it's going to be tough,'"" recalls Davis. ""'Radio doesn't love a capella.'"" ""That was another case, like Bridge Over Troubled Water, where it was too unique, it was too special. I said, 'Unless they force us, I want to fight it.'"" It wasn't just radio he had to fight... it was the song's producer, David Foster, who was unhappy that Davis chose to release his first demo of the song, rather than the polished version he submitted later on. ""He unleashed this string of obscenities,"" says Davis, ""but he never came up with a version that was as pure. And so, faced with a decision, of choosing what to release to radio, I chose that first version. ""And after one day of his invective, he called me literally on the second day, and said, 'Everyone is stopping off the highway. They cannot believe it. This is giving them goose pimples. You were right! Thank you!'"" Can an artist like Adele be discovered on Spotify or Apple Music? The explosion in streaming has helped the music industry return to growth after more than a decade of piracy and plummeting profits. But although the industry has turned a corner, Davis is wary of streaming's impact on artists' longevity. ""There's an awful lot of cherry-picking hit singles at the moment,"" he observes. ""And the music that's being played is not creating opportunities for certain artists. Where will the next Aretha Franklin or Whitney Houston come from? ""Big ballad artists are relegated to 'adult' playlists,"" which don't have the power to break new acts in the mainstream, he explains. A similar thing is happening on radio, where urban stations ""are only playing hip-hop"". ""So where will the next Luther Vandross come from? What's happening with the great Maxwell? ""We have to be vigilant, within a healthy industry, to encourage more than one-hit wonders."" He says the success of Adele and Ed Sheeran shows ""the principle of buying an album can survive"". ""So now that we're assured that we still have a business, we've got to make sure that artists who are signed today are still headlining in 40 years. ""That's the goal. That'll always be the goal.""

"Aaron Barley admitted the two murders on what would have been the first day of his trial A homeless man who ""destroyed a family"" by stabbing to death a mother and son who had helped him has been jailed for life with a minimum of 30 years. Aaron Barleyadmitted murdering Tracey Wilkinson and 13-year-old son Pierceon the first day of his trial on Tuesday. Mrs Wilkinson's husband Peter was also stabbed six times in the attack at their home in Stourbridge in March. Mrs Justice Carr told Barley, 24, he had ""betrayed their trust in every way"" and warned he might never be released. Midlands Live: Murder charge after mass brawl; Teenager held after schoolboy stabbing Barley murdered the pair after a year in which he was given food, friendship and shelter by Mrs Wilkinson, Birmingham Crown Court heard on Tuesday. Tracey Wilkinson died at the family home in Stourbridge and her 13-year-old son Pierce died in hospital Details of Barley's 21 previous convictions were read out in court, including an assault on his former partner. The judge told Barley she had decided not to impose a whole-life tariff ""principally because of your youth"". ""You clearly represent a very significant risk of serious harm to members of the public,"" she said. The orphan who turned double murderer 'I thought my whole family was gone' Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said Barley killed Mrs Wilkinson, 50, in her bed and her son in his room before then attacking her 47-year-old husband as he returned home from walking their dog. Mrs Justice Carr told the court of the ""terror"" Tracey and Pierce must have felt when Barley attacked them. ""One of them, at least, must have been aware of the stabbing of the other,"" she added. The couple's daughter Lydia, 19, was away at Bristol University at the time of the attack. This video can not be played Murderer Aaron Barley crept through his victims' garden Passing sentence, High Court judge Mrs Justice Carr said Barley had carried out ""a vicious and unprovoked attack"" in the home where he had once been welcomed. The judge told Barley: ""You abused your knowledge of the family home, which you had only gained through the Wilkinsons' extraordinary kindness and generosity to you."" Mrs Justice Carr described the ""chilling"" security camera footage, showing Barley ""crawling"" on all fours around the back garden moments before attacking. He had hidden in the garden shed overnight after failing to get into the home he once shared with the family. Less than a week before the stabbings, the Wilkinsons cancelled a mobile phone contract they had paid for Barley. Barley, whose parents died when he was a child, was brought up by a foster carer, who had reported concerns about his behaviour to the police before the killings. The judge told him: ""You have shown no remorse - indeed only regret that Mr Wilkinson survived his injuries and at times satisfaction in what you did achieve."" Lydia Wilkinson and her father Peter outside court Mr Khalil told the court Barley was a ""compulsive liar and manipulator"" who was also given a job, accommodation and a mobile phone after Mrs Wilkinson met him outside a supermarket and took him home. The court heard how hours after his arrest for the killings, Barley told a police officer: ""I've stabbed three people up - I ain't bothered about taking one of you with me."" The judge said biology undergraduate Lydia had been left with ""understandable anger"" and distress over ""remorseless"" Barley's actions. After Barley admitted the murders on Tuesday, Miss Wilkinson told him in court: ""I will never forgive you."" At Wednesday's sentencing hearing the judge praised Miss Wilkinson for reading out her victim impact statement with ""maturity and courage well beyond her years"". The judge said the 19-year-old was a ""shell of her former self"", adding Miss Wilkinson suffers anxiety attacks and cannot be left alone.

"Sgt Emile Cilliers denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers An Army sergeant tried to kill his wife by removing parts of her parachute, causing her to spin thousands of feet to the ground, a court has heard. Emile Cilliers, 37, is accused of two counts of attempted murder of Victoria Cilliers who survived the jump on 5 April 2015. Winchester Crown Court heard Ms Cilliers suffered multiple injuries. Mr Cilliers, who denies all charges, wanted to leave his wife for a lover he had met on Tinder, prosecutors said. It is also claimed that just days before the jump, on 29 March 2015, the defendant tried to kill Ms Cilliers, 40, by deliberately causing a gas leak in the family home while he stayed away. Police evidence showed the kitchen cupboard where the gas leak occurred (large arrow) Prosecutor Michael Bowes QC said that on the night of the gas leak Mr Cilliers had left his wife at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire, to stay at his Army barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire. He said the following morning Ms Cilliers contacted her husband complaining of a gas smell coming from a kitchen cupboard next to the oven. She noticed dried blood on the fitting which was later found to be a full DNA match to her husband, the court was told. The jury was told the Royal Army Physical Training Corps sergeant lied to his lover, Stefanie Glover, that he was leaving his wife because she was having an affair and he was not the father of one of their children. Mr Bowes QC said Mr Cilliers was also having an affair with his ex-wife Carly Cilliers. He told the court the defendant had debts of Â£22,000 and believed he would receive a Â£120,000 life insurance payout on his wife's death. Emile Cilliers made up lies about his wife having an affair, the court heard Mr Bowes QC said Ms Cilliers was a highly experienced parachutist and instructor but when she jumped out of the plane 4,000ft (1,200m) above Netheravon Airfield in Wiltshire ""both her main parachute and her reserve parachute failed"". ""Those attending at the scene expected to find her dead, although she was badly injured, almost miraculously she survived the fall. ""Those at the scene immediately realised that something was seriously wrong with her reserve parachute, two vital pieces of equipment which fasten the parachute harness were missing,"" he said. Police picture of the gas pipe which Sgt Cilliers allegedly tampered with The day before the failed jump the couple had visited Netheravon together, the court heard. While there Mr Cilliers collected a hire parachute for his wife and took it into the men's toilets at the base, where he is alleged to have tampered with it. Mr Bowes QC said: ""It's heavy, it's bulky, there is absolutely no reason to take it in there at all. ""The weather was so poor that afternoon that Victoria couldn't jump, the cloud base was too low."" The court heard that Mr Cilliers then arranged to keep the equipment overnight in his wife's locker, a move that was against normal procedure. He added that at the time of the murder attempts, Mr Cilliers was leaving his wife and treated her with ""callousness and contempt"". The third allegation, which Mr Cilliers also denies, is damaging a gas fitting, reckless to endangerment of life. The trial continues.

"Pro-independence parties have won a slim majority in the Catalan parliament. The regional election backfired on the Spanish government, but for now Madrid remains firmly in control, under emergency powers invoked in October. What if Catalonia were to secede eventually - would it be able to stand on its own two feet? To the casual observer, Catalonia looks like it has already got many of the trappings of a state. Flags. A parliament. But its leader, Carles Puigdemont, is in self-imposed exile in Belgium. The region has its own police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra. It has its own broadcast regulator, and even boasts a series of foreign ""missions"" - mini embassies that promote trade and investment in Catalonia around the world. Catalonia delivers some public services already - schools and healthcare, for example. There'd be much more to set up in the event of independence, though. Border control. Customs. Proper international relations. Defence. A central bank. Inland revenue. Air traffic control. All of these are currently run by Madrid. But assuming it did create these new institutions - would it be able to pay for them? Catalonia already has its own police force ""Madrid nos roba"" is a popular secessionist slogan - ""Madrid is robbing us"". The received wisdom is that comparatively wealthy Catalonia pays in more than it gets out of the Spanish state. Catalonia is certainly rich compared with other parts of Spain. It is home to just 16% of the Spanish population, but 19% of its GDP and more than a quarter of Spain's foreign exports. It punches above its weight in terms of tourism too - 18 million of Spain's 75 million tourists chose Catalonia as their primary destination last year, easily the most visited region. Tarragona has one of Europe's largest chemical hubs. Barcelona is one of the EU's top 20 ports by weight of goods handled. About a third of the working population has some form of tertiary education. It's also true that Catalans pay more in taxes than is spent on their region. In 2014, the last year the Spanish government has figures for, Catalans paid nearly â¬10bn (Â£8.9bn) more in taxes than reached their region in public spending. Would an independent Catalonia get the difference back? Some have argued that even if Catalonia gained a tax boost from independence, that might get swallowed up by having to create new public institutions and run them without the same economies of scale. And some argue that it makes sense for the state to redistribute money from richer to poorer regions in this way. Perhaps of greater concern is Catalonia's public debt. The Catalan government owes â¬77bn (Â£68bn) at the last count, or 35.4% of Catalonia's GDP. Of that, â¬52bn is owed to the Spanish government. In 2012, the Spanish government set up a special fund to provide cash to the regions, who were unable to borrow money on the international markets after the financial crisis. Catalonia has been by far the biggest beneficiary of this scheme, taking â¬67bn since it began. Not only would Catalonia lose access to that scheme, but it would raise the question of how much debt Catalonia would be willing to repay after independence. That question would surely cast a shadow over any negotiations. And on top of the sum owed by the regional government - would Madrid expect Barcelona to shoulder a share of the Spanish national debt? Many Catalans are proud to be EU citizens - that might be tricky to maintain after independence The uncertainty created by the struggle for independence has already hit the Catalan economy. More than 3,100 companies have moved their legal headquarters out of the region, including major banks Caixabank and Banco de Sabadell. At least part of the uncertainty is over Catalonia's relationship with Europe. Two-thirds of Catalonia's foreign exports go to the EU. It would need to reapply to become a member if it seceded from Spain - it wouldn't get in automatically or immediately. And it would require all EU members to agree - including Spain. Some in the pro-independence camp feel that Catalonia could settle for single-market membership without joining the EU. Catalans may well be happy to pay for access, and continue to accept free movement of EU citizens across the region's borders. But if Spain chose to, it could make life difficult for an independent Catalonia. There is also the question of currency. In 2015, the governor of the Bank of Spain warned Catalans independence would cause the region to drop out of the euro automatically, losing access to the European Central Bank. Normally, new EU member states must apply to join the euro. They have to meetcertain criteria,external, such as their debt not being too large a percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP). Even if they meet those criteria, a qualified majority of eurozone countries has to approve their entry. In theory, that means even if Catalonia became a new EU member state, it may well take time to rejoin the eurozone - and Spain and its allies could block that. In practice, we just don't know what would happen. Nobody has ever declared independence from a member of the eurozone then asked to rejoin as a new country. Could Catalonia use the euro without joining the eurozone? It does happen. Some countries such as San Marino and Vatican City do so with the eurozone's blessing, since they're too small to ever become EU member states.

"The European Union has launched a fresh crackdown over taxes paid by tech giants Amazon and Apple. Amazon has been ordered to repay â¬250m (Â£221m; $293m) in back taxes after the European Commission said it had been given an unfair tax deal in Luxembourg. The Commission also plans to take Ireland to court over its failure to collect â¬13bn of back taxes from Apple. Amazon denied it owed any back tax, saying it did ""not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg"". ""We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. But European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the Luxembourg arrangement meant that Amazon had been allowed to pay ""substantially less tax than other businesses"", which it said was  ""illegal under EU state aid rules"". Facebook's UK tax bill rises to Â£5.1m Why Amazon's UK tax bill has dropped 50% Apple fights back over EU tax ruling ""Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,"" Ms Vestager added. She said Amazon paid four times less tax than other local companies. ""Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,"" she added. The Commission said until the taxes were recovered Apple was still ""continuing to benefit from an illegal advantage"" Meanwhile, the Commission said it planned to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover â¬13bn in back taxes from tech giant Apple. Itconcluded last yearthat the US firm's Irish tax benefits were illegal, enabling the firm to pay a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%. The Commission said that more than a year on from that decision, Ireland had still not recovered the money. As a result, it was referring Ireland to the European Court of Justice, it said. Ireland, which has contested the decision, claiming that EU regulators were interfering with national sovereignty, said the decision was ""extremely disappointing"". ""Today's decisions are to order Luxembourg to recover unpaid tax from Amazon and refer Ireland to the European Court for failing to recover unpaid tax from Apple. I hope that both decisions are seen as a message that companies must pay their fair share of taxes, as the huge majority of companies do,"" said Ms Vestager. The decision on Amazon follows a three-year long investigation by the European Commission,which said in 2014that it had suspicions the arrangement had broken EU rules. The tax deal between Luxembourg and Amazon was struck in 2003. The Commission said it had enabled Amazon to shift the ""vast majority"" of its profits from Amazon EU to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, which was not subject to tax. It said this arrangement had ""significantly reduced"" Amazon's taxable profits. At the time the deal was struck, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission's president, was the prime minister of Luxembourg.

"Nick Steward is the founder of Gallivant fragrances Corporate giants such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal and Coty have dominated the fragrance market, but could that be about to change? ""Everything smells the same - people are getting bored of the big brands and want something different,"" says Nick Steward, the London-based founder of a new fragrance brand, Gallivant. He is convinced that there is a growing appetite for ""something more personal that other people don't have"". Mr Steward decided to start his own company after several years as creative director of the trendy Paris house L'Artisan Parfumeur. ""I wanted to do something clever and interesting, avoiding all the froth, focused on the best materials,"" he says. He now sells his fragrances online and via specialist retailers in the US, Italy, Germany and as far away as Australia. Gallivant fragrances are smaller than the standard industry size The Gallivant range of unisex fragrances are inspired by and named after cities such as Tel Aviv and London. They are packaged in air-travel-friendly 30ml bottles - smaller than the standard industry sizes. Mr Steward says that also makes them more affordable, reflecting consumers' desire to have a variety of fragrances to choose from. Reception from both consumers and retailers has been positive since the launch earlier this year, but he admits the road to profitability will be a challenge: ""It's a really tough business to make money in."" He is seeking a slice of the fragrance market - worth about $27bn (Â£20bn; â¬22bn) a year globally - but it is dominated by corporate giants such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal and Coty. Chanel's latest campaign stars Kristen Stewart These firms spend tens of millions of dollars a year in a bid to make their fragrances seem impossibly alluring to consumers, using celebrities such as Kristen Stewart, star of the latest Chanel campaign, or Charlize Theron, who features in ads for Dior J'Adore. Seeing glamorous ads on TV, in the cinema or in magazines means consumers are more likely to try, if not buy, one of the hundreds of perfumes on the market. Despite the daunting competition, Michael Edwards, publisher of global perfume database Fragrances of the World, says some consumers are favouring niche and artisan fragrance brands like Gallivant because they offer something special that none of their friends will have. He believes that innovation in the sector is coming from smaller brands because the big players are afraid of taking risks. The big brands want a new launch to appeal to as wide a range of consumers as possible, meaning they often produce something ""bland"", he says. Coty, behind brands including Gucci Bloom, reported a loss in August ""The future lies in bespoke - younger people want something of their own. While marketing is crucial, word of mouth is even more crucial,"" says Mr Edwards. The fact that some of the bigger names in the industry are struggling suggests he may be right. Even Coty - the New York beauty brand behind famous names such as Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Hugo Boss and Chloe - has faced headwinds this year. In August, it reported a surprise quarterly loss that was partly blamed on ""materially"" higher marketing costs for the launch of new fragrances, including Gucci Bloom and Hugo Boss Tonic. L'Oreal, which sells fragrances under brands including Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren and Diesel, also reported disappointing sales and profits for its most recent quarter. Michael Edwards founded the Fragrances of the World guide But Roshida Khanom, an analyst at market research firm Mintel, says the industry giants are not taking the threat from upstart rivals lying down. Chanel, one of the world's most well known perfume makers, has revamped its range, launching No5 L'Eau in time for the Christmas rush last year. The new version of Chanel's classic fragrance - aimed squarely at younger generations - helped boost sales of the No5 range by a fifth. At the same time, the French company also launched its first new fragrance in 15 years last month, Gabrielle, with a big-budget ad campaign. The experience of wearing the fragrance - not the bottle or the packaging - is still the most important thing for consumers, says Michael Edwards, publisher of global perfume database, Fragrances of the World. Most people want a scent that is ""pretty easy to like"", he says. A fragrance has to entice at first sniff with a compelling ""top note"", and convince the buyer that it will linger sufficiently long on his or her skin. Above all else, he says: ""It must make the wearer feel special."" Retailers will be hoping that the launch will help return the fragrance sector to modest growth in the UK after two years of what Ms Khanom calls ""disappointing sales"". Mintel estimates UK sales will be worth about Â£1.5bn this year, making it the fifth-biggest market globally behind Brazil, the US, Russia and France. As with other retail sectors, she says one of the problems is savvy consumers who try out products in a physical store but then go online to buy it for less. Manufacturers are spending more on the bottle and packaging, as well as marketing, in a bid to get consumers to buy their fragrances. Some consumers think celebrity fragrances are ""tacky"" But the power of another popular trick - releasing a fragrance emblazoned with the name of a celebrity, such as Britney Spears, Beyonce or Jennifer Lopez - appears to be waning. Mintel says that a third of consumers describe this approach as tacky. ""Celebrity fragrances are just not aspirational in the way they used to be,"" says Ms Khanom. Of course, for Gallivant's Mr Steward this is good news. But while some Gallivant buyers want it to remain a tiny brand only they know about for ""bragging rights"", Mr Steward says that is not sustainable.

"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

"US police have said the woman, a former casino employee, was living with Paddock in Nevada The girlfriend of Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock has arrived in the United States, where she is due to be questioned by police. Marilou Danley was met by federal agents as she landed in Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night. Paddock reportedly wired $100,000 (Â£75,400) to her in the Philippines before the rampage. US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, arrived in Las Vegas on Wednesday to console a shocked nation. What does Las Vegas want Trump to say? What do we know about Marilou Danley? ""Well, it's a very sad thing,"" Mr Trump told reporters at the White House as he left for Nevada. ""We're going to pay our respects and to see the police who have done really a fantastic job in a very short time."" This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes The president also said ""a lot more"" was emerging about the gunman. ""That'll be announced at the appropriate time,"" he added. From his 32nd-floor suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Paddock, a retired accountant with no criminal record, sprayed bullets into a crowd at a country music festival below. He killed 58 concertgoers and injured more than 500, before apparently killing himself. Police officials quoted by the Reuters news agency said they hoped Ms Danley - an Australian citizen who moved to the US 20 years ago - would consent to be interviewed voluntarily. US authorities have named Ms Danley a ""person of interest"" in their investigation, and said they made contact with her shortly after the shooting. She had been in the Philippines since late September, local media reported. Her sisters told Australian outlet7News,externalthat Ms Danley had not known about the trip until Paddock told her he had bought her a ticket to the Philippines. ""She was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning,"" they said. Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. 'Pandemonium' on the Strip Five reasons US gun control won't happen Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas The Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation told AFP news agency it was investigating reports that Paddock sent $100,000 to Ms Danley in the Philippines days before the shooting. Ms Danley's sisters also told 7News that she had been wired that amount in the Philippines. An unnamed US official told Reuters news agency that investigators were assuming the amount was intended as a form of life insurance. Eric Paddock, the youngest brother of Stephen Paddock, toldthe New York Times,externalthat his brother loved and doted on Ms Danley. ""She was probably one of the only people I've ever seen that he'd go out of his way to do a little thing for,"" he said. But the pair are also said to have had a turbulent relationship, according to other reports.The Los Angeles Times,externalhas spoken to people who witnessed Paddock verbally abusing Ms Danley at a coffee shop in Mesquite, Nevada. Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? The 62-year-old was reportedly born in the Philippines Lived in Queensland for about 10 years in the 1980s while married to an Australian She then moved to the US and was married to American Geary Danley, whom she divorced in 2015 Used to work as a casino hostess attending to ""high-limit"" players, and is thought to have met Stephen Paddock in a Nevada casino US police say she had been living in Nevada with Paddock Sources: Australian Broadcasting Corporation, US media outlets Police say Paddock set up a number of cameras in and around his hotel suite. Two cameras in the hallway and one in the peephole allowed him to see if ""law enforcement or security"" were approaching, they said. Although the authorities are still unable to explain why a 64-year-old gambler and retired accountant should want to carry out a mass shooting by hauling such a vast arsenal of weapons to the hotel, they do know there was a high degree of planning. The authorities in Las Vegas revised the death toll down from 59 on Tuesday evening, saying that one of the bodies was that of the gunman. Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas Who are the victims? People paid tribute to the victims of the massacre in the Las Vegas Strip Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters: ""It was pre-planned extensively and I'm pretty sure he evaluated everything he did in his actions."" Undersheriff Kevin McMahill suggested the attack may have stopped when Paddock was disturbed, shooting a security guard. Who are the victims? President Trump is in no doubt. He described Paddock as ""a sick man, a demented man"". But a senior US homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said there was ""no evidence"" of ""mental illness or brain damage"". Reports on Wednesday said Paddock was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug in June, but this has not been officially confirmed. Nor have police found links to any foreign or domestic terrorist organisations, despite the claims made by the group known as Islamic State that the gunman was acting on their behalf. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Paddock, who had a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas. He reportedly shared his house there with Marilou Danley. Nineteen firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition with electronic devices were found at the property. According to reports, Paddock had a troubled upbringing - his father was a bank robber who regularly beat him and his three brothers, while his mother struggled to cope bringing up the family. A contrasting picture of the gunman has emerged - with some describing him as cold and stand-offish and others saying he was friendly. One of his three brothers told US media that he gave financial support to his elderly mother. The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate. How Trump turned against gun control Las Vegas shooting - what we know Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. According to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room Aside from the 23 guns found in the two-room hotel suite, Sheriff Lombardo said there were 10 suitcases. Thousands were enjoying a performance by singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of gunfire rang out, starting at 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of shots were fired over the course of nine minutes, according to police. Concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. The fake photos shared after tragedies What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting Las Vegas killer 'had cameras in hotel' It is thought he moved between two windows in his suite as he carried out the attack.

"The glass ceiling of the Javits Center ended up being horribly symbolic for Hillary Clinton ""I can't believe we just put the biggest crack in that glass ceiling yet... if there are any girls out there that stayed up late to watch - I may become the next woman president, but one of you is next."" The words of Hillary Clinton on becoming the Democrat nominee in July 2016. In the end she failed to smash the ceiling, but Hillary Clinton's choice of election night venue was anything but coincidental. The Javits Center is thought to have the biggest glass ceiling in New York City, and would have been the perfect setting for her to become the first woman president in US history. BBC 100 Women 2017 BBC 100 Women 2017: Who is on the list? Can women change the world in a week? But Mrs Clinton's defeat bucked the trend - the number of elected women in power globally has doubled over the past decade. There are 15 women currently in power, eight of whom are their country's first female leader,according to analysis by Pew Research Centre,external. But that still means that women leaders represent fewer than 10% of the 193 United Nations member states. A study found girls with women leaders had higher aspirations for themselves These leaders are clearly breaking down barriers - but are they taking other women in their country along with them?  The political quota system in Indian local government may yield a clue. Since 1993, one in three randomly selected Indian villages has been required to reserve the role of chief councillor for a woman, creating a naturalised social experiment. A2012 study of thousands of Indian adolescents and their parents,externaldiscovered that having a female leader correlated with higher aspirations for young women in the village. When asked what they wanted for their children in terms of education, age when they had their first child and job prospects, parents generally had higher aspirations for their sons. But once a village had a female leader for two election cycles, the parents' ""aspiration gap"" for boys and girls closed by 25% compared with those who had never had a woman leader. For the adolescents themselves, it narrowed by 32%.  Expectations for boys didn't fall when there was a woman in charge, so the smaller gap was entirely down to higher aspirations for girls. The authors noted the female leaders had limited scope to change the situation of women and girls through the policy. But their presence as positive role models was enough to improve the aspirations and education of the young women around them. Images of Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel both inspired women to make longer speeches A2012 Swiss study,externalalso suggests role models inspire women's behaviour in leadership situations, even from a distance. The authors invited male and female students to make a speech in a virtual reality environment in four groups: one saw a picture of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the wall, one saw Hillary Clinton (then US secretary of state), one saw Bill Clinton and a control group saw no picture at all. Women spoke significantly longer when primed with a successful female politician than when primed with a male politician or no role model. And the longer they spoke, the more positively they rated their own performance. ""Not only is an increase in female politicians the goal of equality, it can also be (as our results show) the engine that drives it,"" the authors say in their report. Where is the best place to be a woman in Britain? A long engagement: Weddings waiting for marriage equality There is data to back up the idea that the mere existence of women in political roles can be linked with greater equality in everyday life. The World Economic Forum (WEF) ranks countries in itsGlobal Gender Gap Report,externalbased on four key factors - health and survival, educational attainment, participation in the economy and political participation. In 2016, the countries that had the smallest overall gender gap - Iceland, Finland and Norway -  were also the most likely to have women in politics. It suggests that women do better overall in countries where they are represented politically. There are difficulties in making a concrete link between women leaders and an improvement in quality of life for their female counterparts. This is partly because equality has improved greatly over the past century in almost every country, regardless of whether or not it has had a female leader. Also, because many women were either elected recently or were in positions of leadership for a short period of time, it's difficult to measure the direct impact of their policies. However, the evidence we do have makes a case that women who are able to crack the glass ceiling raise the aspirations of their female citizens, and that their countries are also more likely to offer a better quality of life for women.

"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes. Universal credit isa single benefit payment for working-age people,external. It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according toofficial government statistics.,externalNearly 40% of claimants have jobs. The government is expected to spend Â£90bn on UC in 2024-25. That compares with Â£153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, Â£40bn on disability benefits and Â£14bn on child benefit. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May. The rule change means180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (Â£11.44 for those aged 21 or over). Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET). The AET now stands at Â£892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage. Universal credit claimants must seek 18 hours work Sunak sets out plans to tackle 'sick note culture' If a couple is earning less than Â£1,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings. Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sickness have increased. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save Â£4bn a year. Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household: Single claimant under 25: Â£311.68 a month Single claimant 25 or over: Â£393.45 a month Joint claimants both under 25: Â£489.23 a month Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: Â£617.60 a month You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. You may also be able to claima reduction in council tax,externalwhile on UC, orassistance to pay your mortgage,external, although you would need to meet strict criteria. Under the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn more. The current taper ""rate"" is 55%. This means thatfor every additional Â£1 earned over the work allowance,external, UC payments are reduced by 55p. It is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. Some people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. Those with Â£16,000 or more in savings are not eligible. It usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible. An application for UCmay put a stop to any tax credits you receive,even if it proves to be unsuccessful. 'One click and I was worse off' from benefit claim The main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work isnew-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).,external This is worth Â£71.70 a week if you are under 25, or Â£90.50 a week if you are 25 or over. You can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike UC, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim, although you may get less if you have part-time earnings or a pension. You may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.

"This video can not be played Police officers repeatedly shout at bystanders to run for cover Stephen Paddock, the gunman who killed 58 people and injured more than 500 in Las Vegas on Sunday, set up a number of cameras in and around his hotel suite. Two cameras in the hallway and one in the peephole allowed him to see if ""law enforcement or security"" were approaching, police said. Officers are still trying to determine why Paddock, 64, opened fire on a concert from the Mandalay Bay Hotel. The killer's girlfriend has returned to the US from the Philippines. Police consider the woman, Marilou Danley, ""a person of interest"", and while she is not reported to be in custody they are ""in conversation"" with her. She was met by FBI officials on her arrival in Los Angeles. Marilou Danley had a turbulent relationship with Paddock, reports say Ms Danley had been in the Philippines,the Philippine immigration bureau spokeswoman told reporters, but left there on Tuesday to go back to the US. New details of their relationshiphave emerged in the Washington Post,,externalwhich quotes authorities as saying that Paddock transferred about $100,000 to the Philippines - which may have been for his girlfriend - just before he committed mass murder. The pair had a turbulent relationship,The Los Angeles Times reports,external, quoting witnesses as saying that Paddock often verbally abused Ms Danley - an Australian citizen who moved to the US 20 years ago - in public at a coffee shop in Mesquite, Nevada. Tales of heroism emerge from Las Vegas Who are the victims? 'Pandemonium' on the Strip Although the authorities are so far unable to explain why a 64-year-old gambler and retired accountant should want to carry out a mass shooting by hauling such a vast arsenal of weapons to the hotel, they do know there was a high degree of planning. The authorities in Las Vegas revised the death toll down from 59 on Tuesday evening, saying that one of the bodies was that of the gunman. Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters: ""This individual was pre-meditated. Obviously pre-meditated, the fact that he had the type of weaponry and the amount of weaponry in that room. ""It was pre-planned extensively and I'm pretty sure he evaluated everything he did in his actions."" Undersheriff Kevin McMahill suggested the attack may have stopped when Paddock was disturbed, shooting a security guard. The shooting - the worst in modern US history - has sparked debate over US gun laws, but President Donald Trump has said the discussion over what, if anything, needs to be done was ""not for now"". This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes He earlier described Paddock as ""a sick man, a demented man"". But a senior US homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said there was ""no evidence"" of ""mental illness or brain damage"". Nor have police found links to any foreign or domestic terrorist organisations. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Paddock, who appears to have killed himself before police stormed his hotel room, had no criminal record and was not known to police. However, police found 23 guns in Paddock's hotel room, as well as firearms and explosives at his home. In total, across three locations, 47 firearms have been recovered, officials said. Photos from the hotel room of guns used in the attack have been obtained byBoston 25 News,external. Guns seen on the hotel room floor The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws. But President Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting the Second Amendment during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way. After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate. How Trump turned against gun control Las Vegas shooting - what we know This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Paddock, a former accountant with a big gambling habit, lived in a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite, north-east of Las Vegas. He reportedly shared his house there with Marilou Danley. Initially police had said she was in Japan rather than the Philippines and discounted her involvement. Nineteen firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition with electronic devices were found at the property. Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Officers also found ammonium nitrate in Paddock's car. The chemical compound used in fertilisers can be a component of bombs such as that deployed in the 1995 Oklahoma City attack. David Famiglietti of the New Frontier Armory told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in North Las Vegas in the spring of this year, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. The fast shooting rate audible in recordings of Sunday night's attack indicates that Paddock may have modified his guns with legal accessories to make them fire at speeds approaching those of automatic weapons. This video can not be played How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings Despite the large cache of weapons found in the killer's home, his brother, Eric, is struggling to accept that he acted in this way. He said he was ""in shock, horrified, completely dumbfounded"". So-called Islamic State claimed on Monday to be behind the attack, saying Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. The FBI said it had found ""no connection to an international terrorist organisation"". Who was ex-accountant-turned-killer? The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. According to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room Aside from the 23 guns found in the two-room hotel suite, Sheriff Lombardo said there were 10 suitcases. Thousands were enjoying a performance by singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out, starting at 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of shots were fired over the course of nine minutes, according to police. Concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. The fake photos shared after tragedies What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting It is thought he moved between two windows in his suite as he carried out the attack.

"This video can not be played Five things that went wrong with May's speech Theresa May had to battle losing her voice and being interrupted on stage by a comedian as she sought to reassert her Conservative leadership. Mrs May, who at one point was handed a throat sweet by the chancellor, did make it to the end of a speech in which she vowed to ""renew the British dream"". She announced plans for more council houses and a cap on energy prices. But they were overshadowed by the problems she had delivering the set-piece speech in Manchester. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the annual conference ""was meant to be about restoring Theresa May's authority - it may prove instead to have been further undermined"". Rolling text and video reaction to Theresa May speech May revives promise to cap energy prices May unveils Â£2bn council homes plan Could May have fixed her croaky voice? Security review after PM pranked Mrs May was interrupted early on in her speech by comedian Simon Brodkin - also known as Lee Nelson - who managed to make it to the podium to hand her a P45, a redundancy notice, saying to her that ""Boris asked me to give you this"". After he was removed and she got encouraging cheers from the audience she joked that the only P45 she wanted to give out was to Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played A prankster interrupted the prime minister during her speech But she struggled to finish the speech because of a croaky voice, having to stop several times to drink water. Sources close to the prime minister have said that the PM had caught the ""conference cold"", and that her many interviews and meetings this week have taken their toll on her voice. They say the prankster who interrupted her speech has been arrested for a breach of the peace and there will be a thorough investigation of security. To add to her woes, some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop. By the end it read: ""Building a country that works or everyon."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg on PM's speech In normal political times, it is probably the case that what one minister described as a ""tragedy"" today would have led to a prime minister being forced out or quitting. But these aren't normal times. Allies of Theresa May say today she has shown her resilience and determination in spades, demonstrating exactly why she deserves to stay in the job. A senior colleague of hers told me she importantly did manage to put forward a coherent vision and talked about her personal beliefs. More than that, for those who want her gone there are three obstacles. Read more from the BBC's political editor Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said of the prime minister's performance: ""If ever there was a metaphor for battling through adversity, that was it."" In the speech itself, Mrs May delivered a call for a ""modern, compassionate Britain"" and focused on her personal commitment to social justice and fairness. She also apologised to activists in Manchester for an election campaign that had been ""too scripted, too presidential"". And she said the ""British dream"" that ""life should be better for the next generation"" was out of reach for too many people, something she vowed to dedicate her premiership to fixing. Mrs May began her speech by outlining the reasons why she joined the Conservative Party more than 40 years ago, stressing that the things that have made her most proud in politics have not been the positions she has held, but ""knowing that I made a difference - helped those who cannot be heard"". She announced that there would be an independent review of the Mental Health Act, to tackle injustice, and would press for justice to be done for the families of those killed and injured in the Grenfell Tower tragedy. ""That's what I'm in this for,"" she said. Turning to Brexit, Mrs May said she was ""confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe"". She also reassured European citizens living in the UK that ""you are welcome here"" and urged negotiators to reach agreement on this policy ""because we want you to stay"". The prankster turned to Boris Johnson after interrupting the speech Even the sign was against her A big hug from husband Philip at the end of the speech Mrs May said it had ""always been a great sadness for Philip and me that we were never blessed with children"", but she said this did not stop her wanting to help young people on to the housing ladder. Hailing plans to ""reignite home ownership"" in Britain, she said the government plans to invest an additional Â£2bn in affordable housing, taking the total budget up to almost Â£9bn. If ministers made the land available and gave young people the skills to build the houses, she challenged house builders to ensure they ""build the homes our country needs"". Simon Brodkin is an English comedian more commonly known by his TV character name Lee Nelson. Handing the prime minister a P45 was far from his first. His most famous interruption came at Glastonbury in 2015 when he ran onstage as Kanye West was performing. He pulled a similar stunt on The X Factor in 2014, running onstage as the Stereo Kicks were playing. He also threw US dollar bills over former Fifa president Sepp Blatter during the football organisation's bidding scandal. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the focus on council housing underlines Mrs May's readiness to intervene and use the public sector to build houses in a way not seen since the 1950s. Mrs May announced that the government will next week publish draft legislation to impose a cap on energy prices. Downing Street says it will apply to all standard variable rates. This video can not be played Amber Rudd says the government is 'carefully' looking at the stunt during PM's conference speech Having seen her Commons majority vanish after June's general election and facing calls to sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over his interventions on Brexit, Mrs May attempted to use the conference to unite the party behind her ""mission"" to transform Britain. She said it would not be easy, but ""it has never been my style to hide from a challenge, to shrink from a task, to retreat in the face of difficulty, to give up and turn away."" ""And it is when tested the most that we reach deep within ourselves and find that our capacity to rise to the challenge before us may well be limitless."" The disruptions to the speech dominated discussion afterwards, but for Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying that there had been Â£15bn of pledges made by the end of the speech showing ""the Tory magical money tree returns"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called it ""the speech of a brave prime minister struggling on, while her disloyal Cabinet colleagues openly plot against her"".

"Six days after the Christchurch mosque attack, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a ban on ""military-style"" semi-automatic rifles, prompting questions in the US. Following a series of mass shootings in the US in recent years, there has been little in the way of sweeping gun-control reforms. On the federal level, at least, the interest and attention in new legislation has led to almost no action in decades, despite numerous polls showing widespread public support for measures like strengthened background checks and banning certain types of high-capacity gun magazines and military-style assault rifles. The Trump administration has issued a regulatory ban on bump-stock modifications that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns, and there have been some tweaks to the background check database for gun-store purchases. Last March, Donald Trump entertained the notion of more ambitious, ""comprehensive"" legislation, telling senators pro-gun lobbyists had little power over him. But there's been no such talk from the president since. Part of the reason New Zealand is ability to move quickly, of course, is that it's a parliamentary democracy, ensuring that the government is controlled entirely by one party or a politically compatible coalition. That's not the only explanation for why the US has charted a different course, however. Here are five big obstacles that stand in the way of the kind of the US taking the kind of quick, major changes to firearm policy being advanced in New Zealand. A woman shows off a model gun and holster at an NRA fashion show The National Rifle Association is one of the most influential interest groups in US politics - not just because of the money it spends on lobbying politicians, but also because of the engagement of its five million members. It opposes most proposals to strengthen firearm regulations and is behind efforts at both the federal and state levels to roll back many existing restrictions on gun ownership. In 2016 theNRA spent,external$4m on lobbying and direct contributions to politicians as well as more than $50m on political advocacy, including an estimated $30m to help elect Donald Trump president. Its overall annual budget is roughly $250m, allocated to educational programmes, gun facilities, membership events, sponsorships, legal advocacy and related efforts. This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire More than just the numbers, however, the NRA has developed a reputation in Washington as a political force that can make or break even the strongest politicians. It grades politicians on their votes and directs its resources and those of its membership - both financial and organisational - to supporting its fiercest advocates and defeating staunch opponents. As one former Republican congressmantold the New York Times,externalin 2013: ""That was the one group where I said, 'As long as I'm in office, I'm not bucking the NRA.'"" Last March the president said he wasn't ""afraid"" of the NRA - but that was a rhetorical flourish that has not resurfaced. Could it change?Gun-control groups, backed by wealthy benefactors like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have become more organised in recent years, attempting to match the NRA's political might. They actually outspent the NRA in the 2018 mid-terms, during which some prominent pro-gun-control Democrats won close elections. The NRA's revenues dropped $56m in 2017, driven largely by a decline in membership dues. It still brought in $378.1m that year, however, ensuring that it will be the biggest single player in the firearm debate. Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? Las Vegas shootings: Is the gunman a terrorist? Obama: Guns laws were the biggest frustration of my presidency For the first time in eight years, Democrats have control of the House of Representatives - and their success in the 2018 mid-term congressional elections was fuelled largely by victories in suburban swing districts. In Atlanta, for instance, a gun-control activist won one of the closest races of the election, unseating an incumbent Republican. This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Despite these advances for the party, the House electoral playing field is still tilted toward Republicans, who tend to be for gun rights. Due to the way the lines of House congressional districts are drawn, many by Republican-controlled state legislatures, there are more seats that tilt to the right than the left. While 2018 was a Democratic wave election, political gravity may eventually reassert itself, giving control of the chamber back to conservatives. Demographics also play a part in the pro-gun sentiment in the House, as there are more rural districts with higher levels of gun ownership than there are urban ones. Racking up big pro-gun-control majorities in urban areas does little to change the political realities in the House. House members sit on the floor ""to demand action on common sense gun legislation"" For the moment, however, the initiative is with Democrats, and 2019 marked a significant step forward for gun-control proponents in Congress. One of their first actions was to pass a bill in the House requiring comprehensive background checks of private gun sales, including those that take place at gun shows. Previously the requirement to run the name of gun purchasers in a federal database was limited only to registered gun dealers. Prior to 2019, attempts to pass new federal laws regulating firearms had been over before they ever really begin, stymied by House Republicans. In June 2016 a group of Democratic politicians staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to protest over the Republican House leadership's decision not to hold a vote on two gun-control bills. Could it change?The House of Representatives was once one of the biggest obstacles to federal gun-control legislation. It no longer is - for now. With every House seat up for election every two years, and an American electorate that has proven fickle, the door could slam shut again with little advanced notice. Now that gun-control bills have hopes in the House of Representatives, the Senate - where the rural-urban divide plays itself out on the state level - becomes the biggest obstacle to legislative success. States dominated by big-city voters, such as New York, Massachusetts or California, are outnumbered by rural and Southern states with pro-gun sentiments. The rules of the Senate can also thwart efforts to enact more stringent firearm regulation, thanks to the ""filibuster"" - a procedural hurdle that means most major pieces of legislation need the backing of 60 out of 100 senators to pass, rather than a simple 51-vote majority. In 2013, following the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting, it appeared that efforts to strengthen gun-purchase background checks had significant bipartisan support in the Senate. After a concerted lobbying effort by the NRA, however, the bill received only 56 votes in favour, four short of the mark necessary to break the filibuster. This video can not be played Barack Obamaâs mass shooting speeches No gun-control measure has come close to passage since then. At least for the moment, there appears little chance the Senate will take up the House-passed universal background check bill, despite indications that a majority of senators would vote in favour of it. Could it change?Mr Trump has been a vocal proponent of doing away with the Senate filibuster, as he views it as an obstacle to enacting his legislative agenda. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made similar calls. A majority of senators are on the record against changing the rules, however. Protesters in front of the Supreme Court in 2008 With Congress deadlocked on new gun legislation, left-leaning US states have taken a greater role in implementing gun-control measures. After the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, 21 states passed new gun laws, including imposing assault weapons bans in Connecticut, Maryland and New York. Some of the laws have run up against another barrier, however - the US judicial system. In recent years the Supreme Court has twice ruled that the right to own personal weapons such as handguns is enshrined in the constitution. This video can not be played How countries around the world introduced restrictions following mass shootings The Second Amendment says that ""a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed"". Gun-control activists point to the introductory clause as evidence that the amendment was meant primarily to create a ""well regulated"" militia. In 2008, however, a sharply divided court held that the Second Amendment provides a broad right to firearm ownership that prohibits stringent registration requirement for personal weapons. Since then, lower courts have considered challenges to state-imposed assault weapon bans, registration requirements and open-carry prohibitions. Could it change?Trump-appointed Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have a record of viewing Second Amendment rights broadly. The president is filling out the ranks of the lower courts with pro-gun-rights judges. If anything, the judiciary is moving to the right on this issue. In the autumn, the Supreme Court will consider a challenge to a New York City law restricting how handgun owners can transport their firearms. Gun-control advocates fear the high court is poised to strike another blow against state and local regulations. How Trump turned against gun control What gunfire tells us about weapons used in Las Vegas Perhaps the single biggest obstacle to new gun-control laws at the national level is that opponents tend to hold fiercely to their beliefs, while support for new regulation tends to ebb and flow around each new instance of violence. The NRA's strategy, and that of pro-gun politicians, is to wait out the storm - to delay legislative efforts until attention turns elsewhere and the outcry fades. Pro-gun politicians offer their thoughts and prayers, observe moments of silence and order flags flown half-staff. Then, in the quiet, legislative efforts are deferred and ultimately derailed. The mass student-led protests following the Parkland school shooting focused white-hot attention on the issue for a time, but the marches have died down and the changes to gun laws, at least on the federal level, have been minimal. Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters ""there's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country"". Mr Trump  said ""we will be talking about gun laws as time goes by"". As time goes by. As that song from the film Casablanca says, it's still the same old story. Could it change?According to one poll during the 2016 presidential campaign, guns were an important issue for both Democrats and Republicans. That could be a reflection of that year's mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub or the first indication of a new trend.

"This video can not be played Five things that went wrong with May's speech Theresa May had to battle losing her voice and being interrupted on stage by a comedian as she sought to reassert her Conservative leadership. Mrs May, who at one point was handed a throat sweet by the chancellor, did make it to the end of a speech in which she vowed to ""renew the British dream"". She announced plans for more council houses and a cap on energy prices. But they were overshadowed by the problems she had delivering the set-piece speech in Manchester. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the annual conference ""was meant to be about restoring Theresa May's authority - it may prove instead to have been further undermined"". Rolling text and video reaction to Theresa May speech May revives promise to cap energy prices May unveils Â£2bn council homes plan Could May have fixed her croaky voice? Security review after PM pranked Mrs May was interrupted early on in her speech by comedian Simon Brodkin - also known as Lee Nelson - who managed to make it to the podium to hand her a P45, a redundancy notice, saying to her that ""Boris asked me to give you this"". After he was removed and she got encouraging cheers from the audience she joked that the only P45 she wanted to give out was to Jeremy Corbyn. This video can not be played A prankster interrupted the prime minister during her speech But she struggled to finish the speech because of a croaky voice, having to stop several times to drink water. Sources close to the prime minister have said that the PM had caught the ""conference cold"", and that her many interviews and meetings this week have taken their toll on her voice. They say the prankster who interrupted her speech has been arrested for a breach of the peace and there will be a thorough investigation of security. To add to her woes, some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop. By the end it read: ""Building a country that works or everyon."" This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg on PM's speech In normal political times, it is probably the case that what one minister described as a ""tragedy"" today would have led to a prime minister being forced out or quitting. But these aren't normal times. Allies of Theresa May say today she has shown her resilience and determination in spades, demonstrating exactly why she deserves to stay in the job. A senior colleague of hers told me she importantly did manage to put forward a coherent vision and talked about her personal beliefs. More than that, for those who want her gone there are three obstacles. Read more from the BBC's political editor Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said of the prime minister's performance: ""If ever there was a metaphor for battling through adversity, that was it."" In the speech itself, Mrs May delivered a call for a ""modern, compassionate Britain"" and focused on her personal commitment to social justice and fairness. She also apologised to activists in Manchester for an election campaign that had been ""too scripted, too presidential"". And she said the ""British dream"" that ""life should be better for the next generation"" was out of reach for too many people, something she vowed to dedicate her premiership to fixing. Mrs May began her speech by outlining the reasons why she joined the Conservative Party more than 40 years ago, stressing that the things that have made her most proud in politics have not been the positions she has held, but ""knowing that I made a difference - helped those who cannot be heard"". She announced that there would be an independent review of the Mental Health Act, to tackle injustice, and would press for justice to be done for the families of those killed and injured in the Grenfell Tower tragedy. ""That's what I'm in this for,"" she said. Turning to Brexit, Mrs May said she was ""confident that we will find a deal that works for Britain and Europe"". She also reassured European citizens living in the UK that ""you are welcome here"" and urged negotiators to reach agreement on this policy ""because we want you to stay"". The prankster turned to Boris Johnson after interrupting the speech Even the sign was against her A big hug from husband Philip at the end of the speech Mrs May said it had ""always been a great sadness for Philip and me that we were never blessed with children"", but she said this did not stop her wanting to help young people on to the housing ladder. Hailing plans to ""reignite home ownership"" in Britain, she said the government plans to invest an additional Â£2bn in affordable housing, taking the total budget up to almost Â£9bn. If ministers made the land available and gave young people the skills to build the houses, she challenged house builders to ensure they ""build the homes our country needs"". Simon Brodkin is an English comedian more commonly known by his TV character name Lee Nelson. Handing the prime minister a P45 was far from his first. His most famous interruption came at Glastonbury in 2015 when he ran onstage as Kanye West was performing. He pulled a similar stunt on The X Factor in 2014, running onstage as the Stereo Kicks were playing. He also threw US dollar bills over former Fifa president Sepp Blatter during the football organisation's bidding scandal. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the focus on council housing underlines Mrs May's readiness to intervene and use the public sector to build houses in a way not seen since the 1950s.

She said it would not be easy, but ""it has never been my style to hide from a challenge, to shrink from a task, to retreat in the face of difficulty, to give up and turn away."" ""And it is when tested the most that we reach deep within ourselves and find that our capacity to rise to the challenge before us may well be limitless.""

"The European Union has launched a fresh crackdown over taxes paid by tech giants Amazon and Apple. Amazon has been ordered to repay â¬250m (Â£221m; $293m) in back taxes after the European Commission said it had been given an unfair tax deal in Luxembourg. The Commission also plans to take Ireland to court over its failure to collect â¬13bn of back taxes from Apple. Amazon denied it owed any back tax, saying it did ""not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg"". ""We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal,"" an Amazon spokesperson said. But European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the Luxembourg arrangement meant that Amazon had been allowed to pay ""substantially less tax than other businesses"", which it said was  ""illegal under EU state aid rules"". Facebook's UK tax bill rises to Â£5.1m Why Amazon's UK tax bill has dropped 50% Apple fights back over EU tax ruling ""Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,"" Ms Vestager added. She said Amazon paid four times less tax than other local companies. ""Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,"" she added. The Commission said until the taxes were recovered Apple was still ""continuing to benefit from an illegal advantage"" Meanwhile, the Commission said it planned to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover â¬13bn in back taxes from tech giant Apple. Itconcluded last yearthat the US firm's Irish tax benefits were illegal, enabling the firm to pay a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%. The Commission said that more than a year on from that decision, Ireland had still not recovered the money. As a result, it was referring Ireland to the European Court of Justice, it said. Ireland, which has contested the decision, claiming that EU regulators were interfering with national sovereignty, said the decision was ""extremely disappointing"". ""Today's decisions are to order Luxembourg to recover unpaid tax from Amazon and refer Ireland to the European Court for failing to recover unpaid tax from Apple. I hope that both decisions are seen as a message that companies must pay their fair share of taxes, as the huge majority of companies do,"" said Ms Vestager. The decision on Amazon follows a three-year long investigation by the European Commission,which said in 2014that it had suspicions the arrangement had broken EU rules. The tax deal between Luxembourg and Amazon was struck in 2003. The Commission said it had enabled Amazon to shift the ""vast majority"" of its profits from Amazon EU to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, which was not subject to tax. It said this arrangement had ""significantly reduced"" Amazon's taxable profits. At the time the deal was struck, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission's president, was the prime minister of Luxembourg.

"The salt content in some pesto sauces has increased despite a push to reduce levels, a campaign group has found. Consensus Action on Salt and Health said Sacla's Italia Organic Vegetarian Pesto No 5 Basil and Italia Pesto No 1 Classic Basil now contain more salt per serving than a McDonald's hamburger. It said none of the sauces it checked, including some made by Sainsbury's and Tesco, could be described as healthy. Sacla said its products should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) said salt levels in both Sacla sauces had increased in both products since they were last surveyed in 2009 - they now contained more than 1.5g of salt per 47.5g serving. Cash found that Napolina Green Pesto with Basil, Gino D'Acampo Pesto alla Genovese Basil Pesto and Truly Italian Genovese Basil Pesto contained between 2g and 2.5g of salt per 100g. Tesco Reduced Fat Red Pesto, Aldi's Specially Selected Italian Pesto Genovese and Italian Pesto Rosso, Jamie Oliver Green Pesto and Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Pesto alla Genovese contained less than 1g of salt per 100g. How one man got the world making pesto by hand Cash assistant nutritionist Sarah Alderton said: ""Pesto is an everyday product eaten by adults and children alike, but people might not realise just how salty it can be. ""None of the products we surveyed could be described as 'healthy', so consider having pesto in smaller portions, less frequently or try other pasta sauces lower in salt and fat instead."" Cash called on Public Health England (PHE) to ""act tough"" on the food industry.

Genoese basil Ligurian extra virgin olive oil Garlic (preferably from Vessalico) Italian pine nuts Parmesan cheese Pecorino cheese Coarse salt PHE said it had been very clear with the industry on the importance of reducing salt and meeting targets.

The Commission said until the taxes were recovered Apple was still ""continuing to benefit from an illegal advantage"" Meanwhile, the Commission said it planned to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover â¬13bn in back taxes from tech giant Apple. Itconcluded last yearthat the US firm's Irish tax benefits were illegal, enabling the firm to pay a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%. The Commission said that more than a year on from that decision, Ireland had still not recovered the money. As a result, it was referring Ireland to the European Court of Justice, it said. Ireland, which has contested the decision, claiming that EU regulators were interfering with national sovereignty, said the decision was ""extremely disappointing"". ""Today's decisions are to order Luxembourg to recover unpaid tax from Amazon and refer Ireland to the European Court for failing to recover unpaid tax from Apple. I hope that both decisions are seen as a message that companies must pay their fair share of taxes, as the huge majority of companies do,"" said Ms Vestager. The decision on Amazon follows a three-year long investigation by the European Commission,which said in 2014that it had suspicions the arrangement had broken EU rules. The tax deal between Luxembourg and Amazon was struck in 2003. The Commission said it had enabled Amazon to shift the ""vast majority"" of its profits from Amazon EU to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, which was not subject to tax. It said this arrangement had ""significantly reduced"" Amazon's taxable profits. At the time the deal was struck, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission's president, was the prime minister of Luxembourg.

"Amazon is facing a bill for hundreds of millions of euros in back taxes linked to an alleged ""sweetheart"" tax deal with Luxembourg. The European Union's (EU) competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is expected to announce a recovery order later, reports the Financial Times. It follows a three-year investigation into tax arrangements between the US online retailer and Luxembourg. In a preliminary ruling the commission said the deal ""constituted state aid"". Such a move by the European Commission (EC) would be similar to a 13bn euros (Â£11.5bn) bill it levied against US technology giant Apple last year for Irish back taxes, the Financial Times said. Europe claimed that Ireland had given Apple, which employs around 4,000 people in the Republic, illegal state aid through special tax arrangements. Apple is appealing against the ruling. The tax deal between Luxembourg and Amazon was struck in 2003. At the time, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission's president, was the prime minister of Luxembourg. The European Commission declined to comment. Amazon was unavailable for comment. Previously the EC has saidthat its ""preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid."" However, Amazon said it ""has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg"". ""We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],"" it said. Separately, the European Commission is set to announce plans to crack down on VAT fraud which cost the 28-nation bloc 150bn euros in lost tax each year. It is expected to set out a major reform of EU tax rules, including changes to cross-border VAT, on Wednesday. Why Amazon's UK tax bill has dropped 50% Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big?

"Summers in Sydney and Melbourne will get hotter, researchers say Australia's two biggest cities could swelter through 50C (122F) days within a few decades, a study has found. Sydney and Melbourne are likely to endure such summers even if global warming is contained to the Paris accord limit of a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels, scientists said. Limiting warming to below that would make 50C days less likely, they said. Sydney reached a record 45.8C in 2013 while Melbourne hit 46.4C in 2009, the nation's Bureau of Meteorology said. The study examined only forecasts for Victoria and New South Wales, but researchers said the rest of Australia could also expect rises. ""One of the hottest years on record globally - in 2015 - could be an average year by 2025,"" said lead researcher Dr Sophie Lewis from the Australian National University. Australia's deadly relationship with heat What is in the Paris climate agreement? The research, also involving the University of Melbourne and published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, drew on observational data and climate modelling to predict future temperatures. Dr Lewis said the cities could experience 50C days between 2040 and 2050, a forecast based on global temperatures being at 2C above pre-industrial times. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the average global temperature in 2016, the warmest year on record, wasabout 1.1C higherthan the pre-industrial period. Australia's most recent summerbroke 205 weather recordswhile its winter was thewarmest on record, according to the nation's independent Climate Council.

"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

"Pheasants are far more likely than other species to be the victims of road kill Pheasants are the bird species most likely to be run over on UK roads, research suggests. There has been a big rise in the number of pheasants being bred for shooting across the UK over the past 50 years. The study in Royal Society Open Science journal says,externalthese captive bred pheasants are 12 times more likely than other species to end up as road kill. University of Exeter researchers found pheasants were most likely to be killed on the roads in autumn and spring. To gain a better understanding of what's causing the scale of road kill among pheasants, researchers looked at data from the early 1960s and the modern era. Fifty years ago there were far fewer of the species in the UK and most were wild bred. Now, experts estimate that about 35 million pheasants are captive bred by the shooting industry across the UK every year. Between 2013 and 2016 38.1% of reported road kill birds were pheasants. The rise of captive breeding has played a role in making the birds more vulnerable to cars Fifty years ago the worst time for road collisions with pheasants was in the breeding season in early summer. That has changed significantly, say the authors, and is the result in some measure of captive breeding. ""We see this spike in road kill in October. That's the time when the captive bred birds start to disperse from their release pens,"" said Dr Joah Madden from the University of Exeter, who led the study. ""Because they have been reared in the absence of any adults they have no one to show them how to live and so they walk around and get killed, they have no prior experience."" Dr Madden says that there is also a second peak in March or April. He believes that this is because commercial shoots put out food for the birds during the season. When that ends, so does the food supply. The birds have to forage more widely and end up being hit by traffic. While the researchers had expected to see an increase in the proportion of pheasants being killed they were surprised to find it was consistent with the rate of attrition found in the 1960s. The experts suspect that changes in behaviour among the gamekeepers in terms of feeding and keeping birds away from the roads may be limiting the level of road kill. During the shooting season, gamekeepers give food supplements to pheasants Natural behaviours and other factors are also likely playing a role in the continuing slaughter, with the chances of pheasants being killed on the roads almost 12 times higher than their share of the bird population would warrant. ""It may be to do with their small brains, but it's mainly to do with the fact that they are mainly terrestrial,"" said Dr Madden. ""They are not the world's best fliers and I think the numbers reported killed are high because they are easily spotted in their glorious plumage."" Despite the heavy toll on their numbers, Dr Madden says pheasants would persist in the UK even if they were not being bred for shooting. The research team used road kill data provided by the citizen science group, Project Splatter. ""Our work demonstrates how changes in animal behaviour can be revealed by road kill data reported by members of the public, and the value of citizen science,"" said Dr Sarah from Cardiff University who co-ordinates the project.

"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: The president of Catalonia has told the BBC that the region will be ready to declare independence from Spain within days,with his government prepared to ""act at the end of this week or the beginning of next"". Carles Puigdemont also warned the Madrid government not to intervene, as this would be an ""error which changes everything"". The comments follow more than 900 people being injured in violence at the weekend after the Spanish government attempted to stop an independence referendum it had declared illegal. King Felipe VI has given a televised address, calling for calm and declaring that organisers of the vote put themselves ""outside the law"". But protest rallies have been taking place across Catalonia.

The BBC's Patrick Jackson spoke to people in Barcelona to gauge their reaction to events. By BBC Reality Check Never mind the mess of disentangling Catalonia's economy from Spain's. Catalonia's economic power could also depend on whether it continues to be part of the EU - or at least the single market. Some 66% of Catalonia's foreign exports go to the EU. It would need to reapply to become a member if it seceded from Spain - it wouldn't get in automatically or immediately. And it would require all EU members to agree - including Spain.
