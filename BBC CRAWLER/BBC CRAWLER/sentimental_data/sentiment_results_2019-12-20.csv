"Andrew Bailey has been appointed as the next governor of the Bank of England. Mr Bailey, aged 60, is currently chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog. He will become the 121st governor of the Bank of England on 16 March, taking over from Mark Carney, and will serve a full eight-year term. The search for the new governor began in April and Mr Bailey, who spent more than 30 years at the Bank, was seen as an early favourite for the job. Andrew Bailey's 'slow and steady' rise to power What does the Bank of England governor do? Faisal Islam: Andrew Bailey's brush with animal spirits However, the FCA has faced criticism in recent months over its regulatory scrutiny of the flagship fund of one of the UK's best known money managers, Neil Woodford. The fund was suspended in June and eventually closed, with investors expected to lose large sums of money. In addition, the FCA's report into Royal Bank of Scotland's treatment of small business by its controversial restructuring division was called a ""whitewash"" after itrecommended taking no further action against the bank. It sets the official interest rate, which determines the cost of borrowing money It supervises the financial system, seeking to ensure it is stable and no banks are running out of cash It acts as the government's bank and a lender of last resort in times of financial difficulty It issues the UK's banknotes (coins are issued by the Royal Mint) It stores the UK's gold reserves, as well as those of other central banks Announcing the decision to appoint Mr Bailey, Chancellor Sajid Javid said he was ""the stand-out candidate in a competitive field"". ""He is the right person to lead the Bank as we forge a new future outside the EU and level-up opportunity across the country,"" he added. This video can not be played What does the Bank of England governor do? The BBC's Dharshini David explains Accepting the role, Mr Bailey said it was ""a tremendous honour"" to be chosen. ""The Bank has a very important job and, as governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does."" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith congratulated Mr Bailey, saying:  ""His strong experience, both in Threadneedle Street and at the Financial Conduct Authority, means he is particularly well placed to steer the British economy through the new course it will take after Brexit and through challenging global economic times."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell was critical of the appointment, saying: ""As an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record at the FCA, Andrew Bailey will need to demonstrate early that he appreciates the need to address the deep structural problems of our economy and, like Mark Carney, understands the climate change threat."" Mr Carney had been due to step down on 31 January, but has now agreed to stay on until 15 March in order to provide for a smooth transition. Mr Carney described Mr Bailey as ""an extraordinary public servant"". ""Andrew brings unparalleled experience, built over three decades of dedicated service across all policy areas of the Bank,"" he said. Minouche Shafik was seen as an early favourite to succeed Mark Carney The decision means hopes that the Bank could have been led by a female governor for the first time in its history have been dashed. Minouche Shafik, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee,had been hotly tipped for the role. Mr Bailey has spent almost the entirety of his career at the Bank of England, which he joined in 1985. He has held a number of roles including chief cashier, which meant that his signature appeared on all bank notes issued by the Bank of England. Mr Bailey was chief cashier during the financial crisis when,he recalled in an interview,external: ""The [RBS] treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attack... and he looked at me and said: 'I need Â£25bn today, can you do it?'. I said: 'Yes, I can do that'."" Mr Bailey was also a deputy governor and head of the Bank's prudential regulation division, before joining the FCA as its chief executive in 2016. Andrew Bailey was the early frontrunner for one of the most powerful positions in the UK. However, his time as head of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, was peppered with a number of high-profile controversies - including its handling of complaints intoRBS's treatment of small businesses in the aftermath of the financial crisis- which many thought might have harmed his chances for the top job. He is highly thought of by colleagues and civil servants. Former Permanent Treasury Secretary Lord McPherson described him as the most able and competent Bank of England official he had ever worked with, adding that while Bailey would not make waves for the government he had the backbone to stand up to it. Mr Bailey, who will be paid Â£495,000 a year, is taking over at a fraught time for the Bank of England. It emerged this week that an audio feed of sensitive market information from the Bank had been leaked to fund managers. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed which gave traders early access to information that could potentially generate large sums of money. The matter has been referred to the FCA, which Mr Bailey currently leads. The City watchdog said it was ""looking at the issue"". PA reported that the prime minister's official spokesman, when asked whether Brexit was a factor in Mr Bailey's appointment, said: ""The way it works is the chancellor recommends candidates to the PM, the PM then advises the Queen."" When pressed on the issue, the spokesman added:  ""I just went through the process and the prime minister thinks he will do an excellent job.""

" By Lauren Turner It starts with one stitch, by one woman. A pattern she’s ordered from the back of a magazine, created for the 1976 US bicentennial celebration. A quilt featuring a hexagon for every state in the US, with its state outline, state flower, and state bird part of the design, along with 50 stars. She will set it down again. But the next person to pick up Rita Smith’s meticulously prepared project, bundled together in a Tupperware box, will be a stranger, some decades later. Shannon Downey will find it at an estate sale in a home in Mount Prospect, Illinois, after Rita’s death at the age of 99. “There was a vintage embroidery hoop - they don’t make them like that any more. Then I noticed there was a picture inside it - the outline of New Jersey. I went through the [container], and realised ‘this is a project’”. Rita had prepared the hexagons by cutting up pieces of bedsheet and transferring designs on them, ready to be embroidered, but had only stitched two of the states. She had started on a third. A school nurse, Rita may have started on the quilt 20 or even 30 years ago, believes Bill, one of her sons. He told Shannon that the project was then probably abandoned several years ago when his father became seriously ill and she began caring for him. Shannon, who uses craft to promote social and political activism, always tries to complete unfinished projects she comes across which have been started by someone who has died. “I feel like I’m doing something to make sure their soul is resting,” she says. Shannon Downey But on this occasion the project was far too big for her to manage alone. She asked for help on Instagram. What happened next took her by surprise. Within 24 hours more than 1,000 volunteers came forward, far more than she needed. She chose 100 embroiderers living all over the US to sew the hexagons - some wanted to represent their own state, others just wanted to be part of the enormous endeavour. Some 30 women, mostly local to Chicago, then gathered for the sewing together of the hexagons to make the quilt.  It is a freezing cold Saturday in December, but the atmosphere at the sewing bee, held at Wishcraft Workshop in Chicago - some 20 miles (32km) from the area Rita lived in - is bustling and warm, a cacophony of voices. Friends who have only met online, in the context of this project, are meeting in real life for the first time. There is the sharing of stories and frequent laughter. Emily Marlowe is showing off a cat tattoo she has had done that morning, to join the sewing scissors tattoo she already has on her forearm. Another has brought her grandmother’s thimble to wear while she works. Hannah Allen is telling others how she used plants from her family’s farm in Kentucky to create the dyes for her work. She made the decision to move back to the state the week she received her hexagon, buying a house that had been lived in by a 91-year-old. “Two old ladies were looking out for me that week,” she says. That morning, she has embroidered stars on her white shirt. Some of the women are wearing embroidered name badges, making the task of getting to know their sewing neighbours easier. Sarah Tafelsky has baked platefuls of biscuits, each meticulously decorated with designs celebrating Rita’s quilt. Tiffany Quade, who embroidered a hexagon to represent her native state of Minnesota, says many people have felt energised by the project.  Tiffany Quade “This was a call to action. Aristotle said the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - and that’s how this feels. This is so much bigger than these fabric pieces.” The women may have been connected by social media, but Tiffany, who has also brought the youngest person in the room with her - her daughter Aeowyn, aged 12 - says the sewing bee is a welcome break from the digital onslaught of modern life. “There’s so much isolation right now. You have children playing video games. We’re so separated from each other. So this is the epitome of coming together. Especially because this quilt is of the states. We have so many different opinions and belief systems. But none of that matters in this room.” The embroiderers have, however, added their own little tweaks. Tiffany has taken the artistic liberty of adding wild rice to her hexagon to represent native communities in Minnesota. Photo of Rita Smith In fact one of the stitchers who isn’t at the sewing bee, but contributed another of the hexagons, said she had contemplated including the land boundaries of the native communities living in the area at the time it became one of the US states. Shannon says she applauds the use of the quilt for that conversation, but also feels when completing projects that she’s acting as the “hands” of the project originator who may not have wanted to change the pattern. “I do want this to be a conversation we’re having though, and I’m glad that’s started online,” she says. Romanian Laura Najemy, who wasn't at the sewing bee but took part in the project, told us by phone that it gave her a connection to her own grandmother, Minodora Boriga, 85. She is an “amazing textile artist,” Laura said, “but at the age where she can’t do it any more”. “The idea of helping someone of her generation was so moving,” she added. “My grandmother taught me everything - how to sew, knit, and crochet. And she also taught me about those moments when you do a textile project and your stresses vanish. It’s just you and the work you’re doing. It’s very powerful. It’s a way of practising mindfulness and meditation - and I wish more people knew about it. They would be so much more balanced. You sit down with your thread and you don’t even realise you’re resting.” But when Laura showed Minodora her hexagon over Skype - the state of Delaware, her adopted home for the last six years - her grandmother had some reservations. Laura Najemy's finished Delaware hexagon “She commented that the beak [of the bird] didn’t look right,” said Laura, an artist and lawyer. “So I redid it. “By elevating women’s textiles as art, you elevate my grandmother’s work. She has created things that would take your breath away.” Shannon says it is important that the project be seen in this way. She says that handicraft has been historically viewed as “right down the bottom of the hierarchy of art”. “Rita represents so many people and so much more than this one quilt. It’s become synonymous with a larger piece of women’s art and legacy.” Shannon herself uses embroidery to create provocative art work, stitching slogans on fabric and posting photos of the pieces on social media because she finds it more effective than words and images alone. “It stops people in their tracks because it's so unexpected,” she says. Although Rita’s quilt is more traditional in design, finishing it has nevertheless fulfilled Shannon’s other aim in her work of building community. “For each person, the meaning has been so different.” Some have reconnected with family, some have sewn for the first time, she says.  “It's so layered. Everyone has their own connection to it.”  The women may have been connected by social media, but Tiffany, who has also brought the youngest person in the room with her - her daughter Aeowyn, aged 12 - says the sewing bee is a welcome break from the digital onslaught of modern life. “There’s so much isolation right now.

Everyone has their own connection to it.” Jewellery designer Vanessa Walilko, who is also helping out with the sewing bee, sees the importance of finishing a piece of work. “My boyfriend Ed Siemienkowicz passed away a couple of years ago. He was a comic book artist and a tonne of his friends – more than 100 - got together to finish his book. They were just moved by it. Someone carrying a project to the finish line is important.  Vanessa Walilko “He had finished the script and illustrated the first page… Everybody knew it was his life’s work. All of his friends, who loved him so much. The day after he passed, they said ‘We’re finishing the book.’ “So, when I heard about Rita’s quilt, it resonated. I couldn’t do anything for Ed’s book – but my grandmother had taught me to hand sew when I was six. This felt important.”  Jewellery designer Vanessa Walilko, who is also helping out with the sewing bee, sees the importance of finishing a piece of work. “My boyfriend Ed Siemienkowicz passed away a couple of years ago.

Women getting together could do amazing, worldly things - finding each other and finding their voice. I like to think she’d have seen this as passing this on to a younger generation. I’m sure she’s smiling, wherever she is.” But for others the quilt has more than a personal resonance - the coming together is a radical act. “There’s definitely a political aspect to this,” says Mary Scott-Boria, who was a member of the Black Panther Party in the 1970s before becoming involved in the women’s movement in the 70s and 80s. “Just the art of community, creating community, creating an opportunity for people who don’t know each other to come together and share a common goal,” she says. “There’s something powerful in being able to create.” Mary Scott-Boria Mary, looking across the tables at which women have their heads huddled close together as they work, feels that Rita would have approved. “She has to have done this as a group as well - it’s what women did at that time.

I’m sure she’s smiling, wherever she is.” At the time Rita would have bought the quilt’s pattern, there was something of a quilting revival in the US, according to Lauren Whitley, senior curator of textile and fashion arts at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. The practice took a back seat in the 40s and 50s, but became fashionable again in the 60s and 70s, she says, when there was a re-claiming of craft - hitherto dismissed as  “women's work” - from a feminist perspective. It was also a way of kicking against the commercialisation of modern society.  The centre of the new quilt - Rita's original tapestry - laid face down “This pattern Rita used could have been bought around the time of the bicentennial in 1976, when there were so many patriotic American quilts and a whole revival going on,” she says. “It’s also very folky and there’s a certain nostalgia to it. People were celebrating America at the time.” Lauren, who is currently working on an exhibition that tells the history of the US through quilts, to be shown at the museum next year, says they provoke strong feelings about the notion of home in the country.  Alaska hexagon “There’s a lot of mythology of quilts. They seem to speak to the heart of Americans, even though America didn’t invent them,” she said. “They’re linked to the myth of the happy home in the 19th Century. “They have so many meanings. They’re intimate. They’re close to the body, connected to family and speak about community. They’re something that is usually handed down. Mothers taught daughters to sew. Quilts are very powerful objects for people.” As Rita’s quilt takes shape, the women reach out to touch parts of it, and make sure all the stitches are complete and it’s flat. As each section is held up, there is spontaneous applause and cheering. “Don’t drop the baby!” someone calls out, to laughter.  Stitching the hexagons together The group size gets whittled down. Activity becomes focused on one corner of the room, now being lit by people’s phone lights and torches, as darkness falls. It comes down to just one stitcher. Finally it’s done. But there’s a last minute panic - there’s a spot missing a stitch, and the quilt is handed to someone else.

The next stage is for quilting expert Sarah Evans to stitch this top layer to its other layers, before it is previewed in Chicago. Because this is a quilt that will hang not on a bed, but on a museum wall - at the National Quilting Museum. There will be Rita’s fingerprints at the centre of the piece - a tapestry completed by her that Shannon saw hanging in her house when she first entered the estate sale. Messages in the quilt's stars There are messages in the quilt. The star spelling Rita's name in morse code. The star bearing a quote written in Nushu, a script that was developed and used exclusively by women in China's Hunan province. There are messages everywhere, once you know where to look. “I know that Rita is resting in craft peace today,” Shannon says. “I love the legacy it brings.”   Additional research:Rozina Sini, Kris Bramwell and Paula Hong",Positive,1.0
"The UK left the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 January, but that is not the end of the Brexit story. That's because the UK is now in an 11-month period, known as the transition, that keeps the UK bound to the EU's rules. So what is the transition and why is it necessary? The transition (sometimes called the implementation period) will end on 31 December 2020. It cannot be extended beyond that date. While in transition, the UK remains in both the EU customs union and single market. That means - until the transition ends - most things will stay the same. This includes: Travelling to and from the EU (including the rules around driving licences and pet passports) Freedom of movement (the right to live and work in the EU and vice versa) UK-EU trade, which will continue without any extra charges or checks being introduced Despite many things staying the same the UK has already left the EU's political institutions, including the European Parliament and European Commission. So while the UK will no longer have any voting rights, it will continue to follow EU rules during the transition. For example, the European Court of Justice will have the final say over any legal disputes. The transition also means theUK will continue to contribute to the EU's budget.,external Seven things that changed after Brexit day Brexit: All you need to know The idea behind the transition period is to give some breathing space while new UK-EU negotiations take place. These talks will determine what the future relationship will eventually look like. Negotiations started in March and both sides have agreed to intensify talks over the summer. Talks have been taking place via video link due to the coronavirus pandemic. Top of the to-do list will be a UK-EU free trade deal. This will be essential if the UK wants to be able to continue to trade with the EU with no tariffs, quotas or other barriers after the transition. Tariffs are a type of tax, usually paid on imported goods. If goods are subject to quotas, it means there are limits on how many can be traded over a given period. Both sides will also need to decide how far the UK is allowed to move away from existing EU regulations (known aslevel playing field rules). However, a free trade deal will not eliminate all checks between the UK and EU - so businesses will need to prepare. In 2018, total UK trade (goods and services) was valued at Â£1.3 trillion, of which the EU made up 49%. As well as negotiating a UK-EU trade deal, the transition will also allow the UK to hold formal trade talks with other countries - such as the US and Australia. If completed and ready in time, these deals could also take effect at the end of the transition. The pro-Brexit camp has long argued that allowing the UK freedom to set its own trade policy will benefit the economy - although critics say it's more important to remain close to the EU. Aside from trade, many other aspects of the future UK-EU relationship will need to be decided. For example: Law enforcement, data sharing and security Aviation standards and safety Access to fishing waters Supplies of electricity and gas Licensing and regulation of medicines The UK will also need to design and implement many new systems, such as how it will handle immigration once freedom of movement comes to an end. Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? What are level playing field rules? At the end of the transition phase, there will be two possible outcomes: A UK-EU trade deal comes into force If a UK-EU trade deal is ready by the end of the year, the UK could begin the new trading relationship as soon as the transition ends. If the trade deal is reached but questions remain in other areas - like the future of security co-operation - than the trade deal might go ahead, with contingency plans used for other parts of the relationship. However, the EU wants one comprehensive deal covering all aspects of the future relationship while the UK argues there should be a series of separate agreements, including a basic free trade deal. Brexit trade deal: What are the sticking points? Ursula von der Leyen will head the European Commission during the transition period The UK exits transition with no EU trade deal Under this scenario, UK and EU negotiators fail to agree and implement a trade deal by 1 January 2021 and no transition extension is agreed. That would leave the UK trading on WTO (World Trade Organization) terms with the EU. This means that most UK goods would be subject to tariffs until a free trade deal was ready to be brought in. If other aspects of the future relationship aren't ready, they too would have to proceedon no-deal terms. The deadline for extending the transition has now passed.

"""Getting Brexit done"" turned out to be a useful slogan, and no doubt it helped Boris Johnson win the election. But almost nothing in politics is truly simple - least of all Brexit. Today he passed an historic milestone - but the destination is still some way off. Ruling out any extension to the Brexit transition period might mean Britain leaves with no deal - equally some in government believe it's possible we could see a kind of phased trade deal with the EU, thrashed out over the months and maybe years ahead. MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU on 31 January At home, no-one's ever really spoken about Johnsonism. He's maybe been too busy facing challenges and dangers day-to-day, hour-to-hour, for a guiding philosophy to take shape, let alone find a name. But the PM's goal of ending austerity and reuniting the country, north and south, richer and poorer, behind the Tory flag could fairly be described as a new. highly ambitious, political idea. Even so, giving a political mission a name - calling it Johnsonism -  is a lot easier than pulling it off.

"MPs vote by 358 to 234 to back the prime minister's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January - a majority of 124 The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, now moves to its next stage Boris Johnson said the country was now ""one step closer to getting Brexit done"" Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""reckless"" bill that will tear communities apart Mr Corbyn ordered Labour MPs to vote against the bill - but six backed it and 32 abstained Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have declared their intention to run to become Labour's next leader Jennifer Scott, Lucy Webster and Gavin Stamp A week ago, the country was digesting the result of the most clear-cut Conservative general election victory in 30 years. Today, we witnessed another decisive political moment when MPs backed legislation to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, a vote described as ""historic"" by leading Brexiteers.    Some more reaction from MPs who voted against the Brexit bill. The SNP's Alyn Smith - a former member of the European Parliament - says there was ""palpable hubris"" emanating from the Conservative benches during Friday's debate. He urges the government to remember that Scotland voted to stay in the EU and is being dragged out against its will ""due to events elsewhere"". For the Lib Dems, the new St Albans MP Daisy Cooper says her party will continue to lead ""cross-party efforts to oppose Brexit"". She says she and the party's other 10 MPs will continue to make the case for the values of openness, inclusivity and internationalism that she suggests are part and parcel of EU membership. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent It is going to be tricky - though not impossible - forClive Lewis (pictured) and some other candidatesto be the next Labour leader to get on to the ballot in the first place. Under former leader Ed Miliband's reforms, MPs were the gatekeepers in the process - the sole nominees of candidates, with no role for the unions nor the grassroots. But under Mr Corbyn, two more criteria were added. A candidate now also has to be nominated by ""5% of affiliates"" - translated, this means basically two of the dozen affiliated unions, or one big union and a ""socialist society"" such as the Fabians. If this proves impossible then 5% of constituency parties would have to nominate - that is, more than 30 local groups. Mr Lewis has told me that, so far, he has no union nominations, but would expect some left-led constituencies to come behind him if they want a debate. His championing of Remain from the left and not the Blairite/centrist wing of the party endeared him to many grassroots activists. But his difficulty is he will be fishing in the same waters as Rebecca Long-Bailey, another left-winger who is more likely to get union support.

For many viewers, the Mark Francois-Will Self stare-off was the TV moment of 2019, but there were others as this montage recalls.The lunchtime programme will return on Monday, 6 January This video can not be played Politics Live: Highlights of UK politics in 2019 Away from events in the House of Commons, former Welsh secretary Alun Cairns has been cleared of breaking the ministerial code over claims he knew about a former aide's role in a collapsed rape trial. An inquiry found it ""unlikely"" Mr Cairns had not been told something about Ross England's role as a witness. But Mr Cairns insisted he did not know the details of the case, and an adviser concluded there was no evidence to contradict that position. The MP resigned from the cabinet ahead of the general election. The position of Welsh secretary remained vacant during the campaign, in which Mr Cairns defended and won his Vale of Glamorgan seat. Read more BBC News Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck - who defied her party to vote for the government's Brexit bill - has been talking about her preference for Labour leader and whether it matters if they backed Leave or Remain. All of the likely contenders to replace Jeremy Corbyn voted against the government. ""I think the party can move on, but it absolutely matters to a lot of us, it absolutely matters to me, what people's stance is on Brexit whether or not I will vote for them as leader,"" said the South Shields MP. ""They will have to say they have heard what happened, they understand the reasons why we lost those Leave seats, but also I would like to see some actions and it would have been good today to have seen them come through the lobby with me."" Asked to describe the last few years being an MP in Westminster during the Brexit debates, Ms Lewell-Buck says: ""It's been absolutely grim. It has been a toxic pressure cooker, there has been abuse flying around left, right and centre. No one has crowned themselves with any glory. ""Whilst I am absolutely devastated that we've lost this general election, I hope we can start moving forward, start behaving like grown ups and actually get Parliament back to where it should be - a debating chamber where people work for the benefit of our country."" BBC News Channel Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party voted against the EU Withdrawal Bill, says the PM must live up to his claim to be leading a One Nation government and his pledge to treat all parts of the UK equally when it comes to Brexit. He told the BBC the UK had a stronger hand as it entered the second phase of the Brexit talks as there was no risk of Mr Johnson being ""undermined"" by MPs. ""We will be saying to the government 'use your negotiating position to try and undo some of the damaging impact of the withdrawal agreement'. ""If there was a no-tariff, no-quota agreement with the EU, then many of the checks that would be required across the Irish Sea would no longer exist."" Boris Johnson's director of communications, Lee Cain, is among the best-paid advisers in Downing Street, according to new government figures. He is one of three special advisers paid between Â£140,000 and Â£145,000. The others are Sir Edward Lister, the PM's chief of staff, and Munira Mirza, the head of No 10 Policy Unit. Dominic Cummings (pictured), the architect of the PM's election strategy who is regarded as the most influential special adviser in Downing Street, is on slightly less, receiving between Â£95,000 and Â£99,000. The PM's Europe adviser David Frost is taking home between Â£125,000 and Â£129,000. As of last month, there were 108 special advisers working across government, the vast majority of them earning more than Â£60,000. The total pay bill rose from Â£6.6m in 2017-8 to Â£7.1m in 2018-9.  Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck went against her party by voting in favour of Boris Johnson's Brexit bill, saying she had promised her constituents she would ""always do my best to try and get us to leave the EU with a deal"". She also defied the whip by voting for the schedule for the bill, telling BBC News: ""Last time, I went against the timetable, then Boris Johnson called a general election and it was the worst general election in living memory. ""He has a massive mandate now. To resist that on the back of losing 52 Leave Labour seats... it just doesn't send the right message that we have learnt our lesson here."" Ms Lewell-Buck says she has ""always tried to be loyal to the party"", but they made ""the wrong call"" going against the bill. ""I think off the back of losing so badly in the general election to then have the first vote in Parliament on the issue we lost over to say let's continue to keep doing what we have done historically was the wrong call,"" she adds.

Seven out of the eight Democratic Unionist MPs opposed the bill, which they say will create a border down the Irish Sea, while one appears not to have voted. All 11 Lib Dem MPs voted against, as did Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. The vast majority of SNP members of Parliament, 45 in total, voted against. Labour MPs Sarah Champion, Emma Lewell-Buck, Jon Cruddas, Rosie Cooper, Grahame Morris and Toby Perkins all voted with the government. BBC News Labour's Tony Lloyd says the government has a mandate for delivering Brexit but it does not have a mandate for pushing through a ""bad Brexit deal"". The shadow Scottish Secretary urges the PM to reconsider his decision to rule out any further time for talks on a trade deal with the EU if an agreement is not reached by the end of 2020. Locking the UK into such a tight timetable is ""foolish"", he tells the BBC. He urges Mr Johnson to be more statesmanlike, saying the PM has a habit of getting by through ""flashy rhetoric or a quick joke"" and he needs to ""move on"" from that kind of style to govern in the interests of the whole of the UK.

BBC News Tory MP Mark Francois welcomes the support of a handful of Labour MPs who he says appear to have ""got the message"". He tells the BBC that the outcome of the vote was ""emphatic"" and ""tremendous"", adding that the Commons had ""obeyed the instruction"" of the people. Looking forward, he says aspects of the next phase of Brexit trade talks could be ""crunchy"" but a deal with the EU can be concluded next year. He insists any extension to the transition period beyond 2020 ""will not be needed"" and the European Research Group of MPs, of which he is a leading member, won't back one. ""There is more than enough time to negotiate the details,"" he adds.  We have now got the breakdown of the votes in favour of Boris Johnson's Brexit bill. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 353 of them came from Tories. But six Labour MPs voted for the plan too:  A further 32 Labour MPs abstained in the vote - despite Jeremy Corbyn telling his party to vote against it. They include three shadow cabinet members: MPs have voted in favour of Boris Johnson's EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill and the schedule to see it through Parliemnt. So what happens next? After the end of business today, MPs will go on recess until Tuesday, 7 January. As soon as they are back, they will enter the Committee stage of the bill for two days (or 16 hours of debate), where they will scrutinise the legislation and debate any amendments that have been tabled. The final stage of the bill in the Commons will then take place on Thursday, 9 January, before it heads to the Lords for approval. Only then can it be made into law - but if it is all agreed, that would be far ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 January. Finally, it will be sent to the European Parliament for ratification.

" By Lauren Turner It starts with one stitch, by one woman. A pattern she’s ordered from the back of a magazine, created for the 1976 US bicentennial celebration. A quilt featuring a hexagon for every state in the US, with its state outline, state flower, and state bird part of the design, along with 50 stars. She will set it down again. But the next person to pick up Rita Smith’s meticulously prepared project, bundled together in a Tupperware box, will be a stranger, some decades later. Shannon Downey will find it at an estate sale in a home in Mount Prospect, Illinois, after Rita’s death at the age of 99. “There was a vintage embroidery hoop - they don’t make them like that any more. Then I noticed there was a picture inside it - the outline of New Jersey. I went through the [container], and realised ‘this is a project’”. Rita had prepared the hexagons by cutting up pieces of bedsheet and transferring designs on them, ready to be embroidered, but had only stitched two of the states. She had started on a third. A school nurse, Rita may have started on the quilt 20 or even 30 years ago, believes Bill, one of her sons. He told Shannon that the project was then probably abandoned several years ago when his father became seriously ill and she began caring for him. Shannon, who uses craft to promote social and political activism, always tries to complete unfinished projects she comes across which have been started by someone who has died. “I feel like I’m doing something to make sure their soul is resting,” she says. Shannon Downey But on this occasion the project was far too big for her to manage alone. She asked for help on Instagram. What happened next took her by surprise. Within 24 hours more than 1,000 volunteers came forward, far more than she needed. She chose 100 embroiderers living all over the US to sew the hexagons - some wanted to represent their own state, others just wanted to be part of the enormous endeavour. Some 30 women, mostly local to Chicago, then gathered for the sewing together of the hexagons to make the quilt.  It is a freezing cold Saturday in December, but the atmosphere at the sewing bee, held at Wishcraft Workshop in Chicago - some 20 miles (32km) from the area Rita lived in - is bustling and warm, a cacophony of voices. Friends who have only met online, in the context of this project, are meeting in real life for the first time. There is the sharing of stories and frequent laughter. Emily Marlowe is showing off a cat tattoo she has had done that morning, to join the sewing scissors tattoo she already has on her forearm. Another has brought her grandmother’s thimble to wear while she works. Hannah Allen is telling others how she used plants from her family’s farm in Kentucky to create the dyes for her work. She made the decision to move back to the state the week she received her hexagon, buying a house that had been lived in by a 91-year-old. “Two old ladies were looking out for me that week,” she says. That morning, she has embroidered stars on her white shirt. Some of the women are wearing embroidered name badges, making the task of getting to know their sewing neighbours easier. Sarah Tafelsky has baked platefuls of biscuits, each meticulously decorated with designs celebrating Rita’s quilt. Tiffany Quade, who embroidered a hexagon to represent her native state of Minnesota, says many people have felt energised by the project.  Tiffany Quade “This was a call to action. Aristotle said the whole is greater than the sum of its parts - and that’s how this feels. This is so much bigger than these fabric pieces.” The women may have been connected by social media, but Tiffany, who has also brought the youngest person in the room with her - her daughter Aeowyn, aged 12 - says the sewing bee is a welcome break from the digital onslaught of modern life. “There’s so much isolation right now. You have children playing video games. We’re so separated from each other. So this is the epitome of coming together. Especially because this quilt is of the states. We have so many different opinions and belief systems. But none of that matters in this room.” The embroiderers have, however, added their own little tweaks. Tiffany has taken the artistic liberty of adding wild rice to her hexagon to represent native communities in Minnesota. Photo of Rita Smith In fact one of the stitchers who isn’t at the sewing bee, but contributed another of the hexagons, said she had contemplated including the land boundaries of the native communities living in the area at the time it became one of the US states. Shannon says she applauds the use of the quilt for that conversation, but also feels when completing projects that she’s acting as the “hands” of the project originator who may not have wanted to change the pattern. “I do want this to be a conversation we’re having though, and I’m glad that’s started online,” she says. Romanian Laura Najemy, who wasn't at the sewing bee but took part in the project, told us by phone that it gave her a connection to her own grandmother, Minodora Boriga, 85. She is an “amazing textile artist,” Laura said, “but at the age where she can’t do it any more”. “The idea of helping someone of her generation was so moving,” she added. “My grandmother taught me everything - how to sew, knit, and crochet. And she also taught me about those moments when you do a textile project and your stresses vanish. It’s just you and the work you’re doing. It’s very powerful. It’s a way of practising mindfulness and meditation - and I wish more people knew about it. They would be so much more balanced. You sit down with your thread and you don’t even realise you’re resting.” But when Laura showed Minodora her hexagon over Skype - the state of Delaware, her adopted home for the last six years - her grandmother had some reservations. Laura Najemy's finished Delaware hexagon “She commented that the beak [of the bird] didn’t look right,” said Laura, an artist and lawyer. “So I redid it. “By elevating women’s textiles as art, you elevate my grandmother’s work. She has created things that would take your breath away.” Shannon says it is important that the project be seen in this way. She says that handicraft has been historically viewed as “right down the bottom of the hierarchy of art”. “Rita represents so many people and so much more than this one quilt. It’s become synonymous with a larger piece of women’s art and legacy.” Shannon herself uses embroidery to create provocative art work, stitching slogans on fabric and posting photos of the pieces on social media because she finds it more effective than words and images alone. “It stops people in their tracks because it's so unexpected,” she says. Although Rita’s quilt is more traditional in design, finishing it has nevertheless fulfilled Shannon’s other aim in her work of building community. “For each person, the meaning has been so different.” Some have reconnected with family, some have sewn for the first time, she says.  “It's so layered. Everyone has their own connection to it.”  The women may have been connected by social media, but Tiffany, who has also brought the youngest person in the room with her - her daughter Aeowyn, aged 12 - says the sewing bee is a welcome break from the digital onslaught of modern life. “There’s so much isolation right now.

Everyone has their own connection to it.” Jewellery designer Vanessa Walilko, who is also helping out with the sewing bee, sees the importance of finishing a piece of work. “My boyfriend Ed Siemienkowicz passed away a couple of years ago. He was a comic book artist and a tonne of his friends – more than 100 - got together to finish his book. They were just moved by it. Someone carrying a project to the finish line is important.  Vanessa Walilko “He had finished the script and illustrated the first page… Everybody knew it was his life’s work. All of his friends, who loved him so much. The day after he passed, they said ‘We’re finishing the book.’ “So, when I heard about Rita’s quilt, it resonated. I couldn’t do anything for Ed’s book – but my grandmother had taught me to hand sew when I was six. This felt important.”  Jewellery designer Vanessa Walilko, who is also helping out with the sewing bee, sees the importance of finishing a piece of work. “My boyfriend Ed Siemienkowicz passed away a couple of years ago.

Women getting together could do amazing, worldly things - finding each other and finding their voice. I like to think she’d have seen this as passing this on to a younger generation. I’m sure she’s smiling, wherever she is.” But for others the quilt has more than a personal resonance - the coming together is a radical act. “There’s definitely a political aspect to this,” says Mary Scott-Boria, who was a member of the Black Panther Party in the 1970s before becoming involved in the women’s movement in the 70s and 80s. “Just the art of community, creating community, creating an opportunity for people who don’t know each other to come together and share a common goal,” she says. “There’s something powerful in being able to create.” Mary Scott-Boria Mary, looking across the tables at which women have their heads huddled close together as they work, feels that Rita would have approved. “She has to have done this as a group as well - it’s what women did at that time.

The practice took a back seat in the 40s and 50s, but became fashionable again in the 60s and 70s, she says, when there was a re-claiming of craft - hitherto dismissed as  “women's work” - from a feminist perspective. It was also a way of kicking against the commercialisation of modern society.  The centre of the new quilt - Rita's original tapestry - laid face down “This pattern Rita used could have been bought around the time of the bicentennial in 1976, when there were so many patriotic American quilts and a whole revival going on,” she says. “It’s also very folky and there’s a certain nostalgia to it. People were celebrating America at the time.” Lauren, who is currently working on an exhibition that tells the history of the US through quilts, to be shown at the museum next year, says they provoke strong feelings about the notion of home in the country.  Alaska hexagon “There’s a lot of mythology of quilts. They seem to speak to the heart of Americans, even though America didn’t invent them,” she said. “They’re linked to the myth of the happy home in the 19th Century. “They have so many meanings. They’re intimate. They’re close to the body, connected to family and speak about community. They’re something that is usually handed down. Mothers taught daughters to sew. Quilts are very powerful objects for people.” As Rita’s quilt takes shape, the women reach out to touch parts of it, and make sure all the stitches are complete and it’s flat. As each section is held up, there is spontaneous applause and cheering. “Don’t drop the baby!” someone calls out, to laughter.  Stitching the hexagons together The group size gets whittled down. Activity becomes focused on one corner of the room, now being lit by people’s phone lights and torches, as darkness falls. It comes down to just one stitcher. Finally it’s done.

There will be Rita’s fingerprints at the centre of the piece - a tapestry completed by her that Shannon saw hanging in her house when she first entered the estate sale. Messages in the quilt's stars There are messages in the quilt. The star spelling Rita's name in morse code. The star bearing a quote written in Nushu, a script that was developed and used exclusively by women in China's Hunan province. There are messages everywhere, once you know where to look. “I know that Rita is resting in craft peace today,” Shannon says. “I love the legacy it brings.”   Additional research:Rozina Sini, Kris Bramwell and Paula Hong",Negative,0.007781037
"The Glen Sannox is one of two ferries being built to serve CalMac routes Two CalMac ferries at the centre of a political storm over cost and delays should be scrapped and work started again, it has been claimed. Industrialist Jim McColl has spoken out against the Scottish government's plan to spend at least Â£110m on the part-finished ferries. He was in charge of the shipyard where the ferries were being built before it collapsed and was nationalised. Management of the yard has been sharply criticised ina new government report,external. The ferries were being constructed at Ferguson shipyard in Inverclyde to replace old ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes operated by CalMac. They are more than a year overdue. Costs double on delayed CalMac ferry contract Shipyard formally taken into public ownership The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift In an exclusive interview with BBC Scotland, the former chairman of Ferguson Marine Engineering said he was taking legal advice on whether the Scottish government's attack on his management was defamatory. He said the report into the ferry fiasco, drawn up for the government after it took ownership of the yard, was ""outrageous"" and a ""snow job"" to cover up the role of the government agency involved in procuring the ferries. Mr McColl said Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited, which required numerous design changes, was the key reason why the budget and timetable went out of control. Jim McColl is taking legal advice on the Scottish government's report The ship design uses a novel hybrid power system, using marine diesel for getting in and out of ports, and liquefied natural gas while at sea. The need for new safety certificates also caused delays. Mr McColl challenged the Scottish government's plan to continue building the two ships, after months of neglect. One has been moored at the quayside and the other sits on the slipway at the Port Glasgow yard. That would effectively write off more than Â£80m already spent on them, while more than Â£45m in loans from the Scottish government have been written off. The businessman said some materials could be used in new hulls, but that it would be better value for taxpayer money to start building again, to a simpler design. He suggested three smaller ferries could be built for the same original Â£97m budget. The report published this week was strongly critical of the management of Ferguson Marine while Mr McColl was chairman, saying it lacked project and financial controls. Internal controls were reported as poor or non-existent.  It said that there had been a ""major departure from the specification"" and as a result of defects, most of the pipe work would have to be removed from the engine rooms. The attack on Mr McColl's competence is despite his success in running engineering companies around the world. He gets closely involved in management and is reckoned to be a billionaire. His advice was sought by the Scottish government as a member of its Council of Economic Advisers. The report went on to estimate a Â£13m bill for remedial work on the hulls taking seven months, including removal of rust and a dry dock inspection of the first ferry's hull. There would then be a Â£95m bill to complete the vessels. Ferguson Marine in Inverclyde was nationalised by the Scottish government in August Whereas the ships were due to be delivered in summer 2018, the first one, the Glen Sannox, is now scheduled for delivery by December 2021 and the second, known as Vessel 802, by October 2022. But that is with only an 80% probability. There is, in addition, a warning of ""significant challenges"" to get the yard working effectively, to improve productivity, recruiting the right people and it flags up a problem in ""controlling and managing"" the sub-contracted design firm. Mr McColl, who accurately predicted the doubling in cost, said: ""It'll become more than that and the vessels will take longer than they're saying. ""You'd be better building from scratch and to a design that's more suited to what's needed. They could probably build three smaller vessels for less than Â£100m and it would give them more flexibility."" Facing criticisms for his own management, Mr McColl drew attention to the reports commissioned by Scottish ministers from an expert adviser over the past two years, which he says were ""damning"" of the role of the government-owned procuring company, CMAL. Luke van Beek was appointed by economy secretary Derek Mackay to report back on the state of the project, with advice on whether government loans should be released. In a private report to ministers released under Freedom of Information law in October, Mr van Beek said that the breakdown of relations between the client and the shipbuilder should be addressed through mediation, andhe advised against nationalisation of the yard. Mr McColl said the minister was ""trying to put people off the scent"". Criticism of his management team was ""outrageous and unacceptable - the team selected were some of the best in the UK, and head and shoulders above those in there now. I've asked if we can sue them for defamation of character"". He added: ""There needs to be an inquiry. The way they've handled this is incompetent"". The Holyrood committee for the rural economy and connectivity is to carry out an inquiry into ferry procurement, looking into the contract that has gone so badly wrong and at the implications for future ferry services. The committee convener, Conservative MSP Edward Mountain, said the aim would be to avoid mistakes being made with future orders. He said: ""These developments clearly have important implications, not only for the completion of the two vessels but also for future plans for the replacement and refurbishment of vessels to meet the ongoing needs of the Clyde and Hebrides ferries network more generally. ""The committee wants to find out not only what has gone wrong and how things will be put right but how these problems can be avoided in the future."" ""We need to make sure that the relevant lessons from this saga are learned for the procurement and construction of new ferries in future."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Our efforts saved Ferguson Marine from closure, saving over 300 jobs, ensured that the two vessels under construction will be completed, and secured a future for the yard. ""Scottish ministers are committed to transparency on these issues. We have kept parliament informed of progress and have proactively published information on our website. ""We welcome the opportunity to respond to any additional inquiries that the committee might wish to raise.""

"Three years late and Â£100m over budget. The deal to build two new CalMac ferries for Arran and the Hebrides has run into serious trouble. Back in 2015, the Â£97m order was seen as a lifeline for Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow - the last commercial yard on the Clyde which had been rescued by industrialist Jim McColl the previous year. That contract ended up dragging the yard back into administration. The yard has been nationalised and the final cost of building the ferries will be at least double the original estimate. So what's gone wrong? You'll get very different answers to that question, depending on who you're talking to. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay visited the shipyard after the Scottish government stepped in Ministers have published email correspondence anda report by marine engineer Tim Hair,external- the ""turnaround manager"" appointed after they took the shipyard into public ownership. He blames an ""immature design"" along with poor project management and cost controls. Here are some of the key points. The basic design of the two ships hasstillnot been approved by the customer, insurers or regulators. This is several years behind schedule and ""a key cause of rework on the vessels"". The detailed design work was subcontracted to a firm in Portugal, with little management control of the subcontractor. There has been poor project planning and control with work undertaken out of sequence. For example insulation, ceilings and cladding have been fitted on the first ship, Glen Sannox, giving an appearance of completion - but they'll have to be removed again for other work to be carried out. Pipework installed in the engine and generator rooms is not to the customer's specification - and will have to be stripped out and replaced. About 1,000 pipes have already been fitted and another 2,500 (3.75km of piping) are still to be installed. ""Housekeeping and cleanliness"" is of poor standard with debris, construction materials and uninstalled fittings evident. Glen Sannox, has been moored at the quayside for two years since its slipway launch. It will need to go into dry dock to inspect the condition of its underside. Internally some bilge areas have still not been painted. The second ship, Hull 802 is still on the slipway and its primer paintwork is degrading in places. Water is getting into both ships leading to damage. It will take seven months and Â£12.8m to remedy these faults and restructure the management systems before new installation work can take place. The total extra cost of completing the vessels is expected to be about Â£110m. More than 50% of the staff are on temporary contracts, the average age of employees is 46, labour efficiency is ""low"", sickness levels are running at 7% and apprentice recruitment was cancelled for 2019 when the firm went into administration. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined Jim McColl and the Ferguson workforce for the slipway launch of Glen Sannox in 2017 A self-made billionaire who transformed the ailing Clyde Blowers into a successful portfolio of engineering investment companies, Jim McColl claimed he was ""begged"" to step in and rescue the Ferguson shipyard when it went bust in 2014. One of the most prominent business figures to support Scottish independence ahead of the referendum of that year, he enjoyed a close relationship with the Scottish government, sitting on its council of economic advisers. But the ferry problems have strained that relationship, with Mr McColl laying the blame at the door of Caledonian Marine Assets Ltd (CMAL) the Scottish government-owned company that owns the ferries used by CalMac. Jim McColl says the main factor in driving up costs has been repeated design changes by CMAL. He claims there have been more than 600 such modifications - including the design of the propellers, the location of the refuelling system which required cutting through bulkheads, the design of the engine room and changes to passenger seating which meant that pillars had to be removed. He says the specification had not been adequately worked out before the contract was put out to tender. As a result his company was left having to make design changes ""on the hoof"" to accommodate CMAL's changing requirements. The ferries were to be a dual-fuel design - the first of their kind to be built in the UK, using marine diesel and  liquefied natural gas (LNG).  But this ""first in class"" design  had to be signed off at every stage by insurers and regulators - resulting in further delays. The hybrid propulsion system was meant to reduce harmful emissions - but Mr McColl questions whether this was a suitable choice given that the ferries will be used for relatively short journeys. The benefits of being able to use LNG may never be realised, and the ships may end up being almost exclusively run on diesel, he says. He claims the turnaround of the yard was in good shape until the ferry contract became an ""albatross"" - according to nautical superstition an omen of ill fortune. He cites reports commissioned by ministers from an independent expert Luke van Beek who was generally positive about the ability of Ferguson Marine to complete the job. Mr van Beek suggested mediation in its troubled relationship with CMAL andadvised against nationalisation. The tycoon says he regrets bidding for the ferry orders and insists he wasn't asking for a bailout from the Scottish government, but simply payment for additional work. He describes the latest government report as a ""snow job"" designed to cover up the role of CMAL in the fiasco. He had told the Holyrood ferry inquiry he repeatedly asked the Scottish government to intervene but they were ""passive"". He claims Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told him the board of CMAL would resign if he appointed an independent mediator. Caledonian Marine Assets Ltd is the Scottish government-owned body that owns the ships and other infrastructure used by the state-owned ferry operator CalMac. CMAL  - the customer in the ferry deal - emphatically rejects Jim McColl's versions of events. CMAL says only 81 changes have been agreed - 46 were at the request of Ferguson, 35 came from CMAL. It says it has paid for these agreed changes at a total cost of Â£1.5m. It says the 1,000 seat passenger requirement was part of its original specification - Ferguson produced a drawing for fewer seats - and it was within its rights to insist on the initial spec. CMAL points out it was a ""design and build contract"" - it was Ferguson's responsibility to design the ship. It believes the shipyard started cutting steel too early, before the design was sufficiently worked out. CMAL says it is normal for a shipyard to spend 9-12 months getting the design is finalised before starting construction work in earnest. Ferguson, it says, chose to build the ferries ""at risk""  based on an assumption that its designs would be approved at a later stage. CMAL says it was unwilling to agree to a ""freeze"" on design changes because Ferguson had only designed about 80% of the first ship. That would have in effect meant agreeing in advance designs it had not had a chance to scrutinise. It says Ferguson's claim late in 2018 for an extra Â£66m compensation for extra work had ""no merit whatsoever"". As a ""custodian of taxpayer's money"" it could not enter into such a negotiation.

"The A5 dual carriageway scheme would link Dublin to the north west of Northern Ireland Eleven major capital projects in NI have not been completed on time and have run millions over budget, according to an Audit Office report. They include theA5 roadupgrade,Casement Park, Ulster University's (UU) new Belfast campus and the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital. Seven of the 11 were identified by the executive in 2015 as flagship projects. The report highlights funding, planning and legal issues, and a lack of construction industry interest. Further setback for Casement Park stadium Department concedes A5 road court challenge Key findings from the report include: The A5 upgrade, linking counties Londonderry and Tyrone, has a Â£300m overspend and has been overrun by 10 years. The Regional Children's Hospital has a Â£130m overspend and has overrun by five years. The cost of building UU's new Belfast campus is now expected to be Â£363.9m - more than Â£100m over budget. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has already withdrawn a Â£150m loan because of project delays. The new Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) stadium at Casement Park in west Belfast has an overspend of Â£33m. It has still not started three years after the expected completion date. The critical care centre at the Royal Victoria Hospital is over budget by Â£57m and has over run by eight years. The new maternity hospital in Belfast is six years overdue and is Â£17m over budget. A spokeswoman for UU said the new campus would ""deliver a progressive student experience in a state-of-the art city centre campus"". She added: ""An independent assessment of this project's overall regeneration impact details benefits to the NI economy of Â£1.4bn, through this significant investment in the aspirations of our young people, the city and beyond."" The Audit Office report also says the Strule Shared education campus in County Tyrone will be further delayed until at least 2024 and has also gone about Â£45m over budget. The biggest school building project in Northern Ireland will eventually see six schools built on the site of the former Lisanelly army base in Omagh. Although work began on the Strule campus in 2013, only one school is currently open despite the original target date of 2020 for the entire project. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education (DE) said it remained fully committed to delivering the programme. She added: ""The next phase of construction for Strule Shared Education Campus has been delayed as a result of tendering issues in appointing a contractor. ""In light of this delay the campus go live date has been revised, and the Department is provisionally working towards September 2024."" The 11 projects identified by the Audit Office: Flagship projects: â¢A5 upgrade. â¢A6 upgrade. â¢Mother and Children's Hospital - regional children's hospital and maternity hospital. â¢Belfast Transport Hub. â¢Belfast Rapid Transit. â¢Regional and Sub-Regional Stadia (Casement). â¢Desertcreat College ( A joint training college for Northern Ireland's police, fire and prison services). The additional four projects: â¢Critical Care Centre at the Royal Victoria Hospital; â¢Primary Community Care Centres at Lisburn and Newry; â¢Ulster University - Greater Belfast Development; â¢Strule Shared Education Campus. Kieran Donnelly, auditor general, said major capital projects are complex and delivery problems are not unique to Northern Ireland. ""Existing, cumbersome governance and delivery structures within the Northern Ireland public sector can be a barrier to achieving value for money,"" he added. The campus is being built on the site of the former Lisanelly army base in Omagh This is not the first report that has raised questions around how capital projects are delivered in Northern Ireland. In 2013, a review of commissioning and delivering major infrastructure projects found that ""the system as a whole is not fit for purpose"". The report did not receive universal support. Proposed reform stalled and consequently some of the improvements were not realised. The Audit Office echoes previous reports that highlighted the need to eliminate duplication, improve project prioritisation, reduce bureaucracy, and drive better deals by increasing innovation. An aerial view of the proposed stadium at Casement Park Capital projects are identified in the Investment Strategy, a rolling 10-year plan prepared by the Strategic Investment Board on behalf of the executive. The original strategy ran from 2005-2015, and was updated for the period 2011-21. A further update has been put on hold following the collapse of devolution in Northern Ireland.

"MPs vote by 358 to 234 to back the prime minister's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January - a majority of 124 The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, now moves to its next stage Boris Johnson said the country was now ""one step closer to getting Brexit done"" Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""reckless"" bill that will tear communities apart Mr Corbyn ordered Labour MPs to vote against the bill - but six backed it and 32 abstained Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have declared their intention to run to become Labour's next leader Jennifer Scott, Lucy Webster and Gavin Stamp A week ago, the country was digesting the result of the most clear-cut Conservative general election victory in 30 years. Today, we witnessed another decisive political moment when MPs backed legislation to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, a vote described as ""historic"" by leading Brexiteers.    Some more reaction from MPs who voted against the Brexit bill. The SNP's Alyn Smith - a former member of the European Parliament - says there was ""palpable hubris"" emanating from the Conservative benches during Friday's debate. He urges the government to remember that Scotland voted to stay in the EU and is being dragged out against its will ""due to events elsewhere"". For the Lib Dems, the new St Albans MP Daisy Cooper says her party will continue to lead ""cross-party efforts to oppose Brexit"". She says she and the party's other 10 MPs will continue to make the case for the values of openness, inclusivity and internationalism that she suggests are part and parcel of EU membership. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent It is going to be tricky - though not impossible - forClive Lewis (pictured) and some other candidatesto be the next Labour leader to get on to the ballot in the first place. Under former leader Ed Miliband's reforms, MPs were the gatekeepers in the process - the sole nominees of candidates, with no role for the unions nor the grassroots. But under Mr Corbyn, two more criteria were added. A candidate now also has to be nominated by ""5% of affiliates"" - translated, this means basically two of the dozen affiliated unions, or one big union and a ""socialist society"" such as the Fabians. If this proves impossible then 5% of constituency parties would have to nominate - that is, more than 30 local groups. Mr Lewis has told me that, so far, he has no union nominations, but would expect some left-led constituencies to come behind him if they want a debate. His championing of Remain from the left and not the Blairite/centrist wing of the party endeared him to many grassroots activists. But his difficulty is he will be fishing in the same waters as Rebecca Long-Bailey, another left-winger who is more likely to get union support.

An inquiry found it ""unlikely"" Mr Cairns had not been told something about Ross England's role as a witness. But Mr Cairns insisted he did not know the details of the case, and an adviser concluded there was no evidence to contradict that position. The MP resigned from the cabinet ahead of the general election. The position of Welsh secretary remained vacant during the campaign, in which Mr Cairns defended and won his Vale of Glamorgan seat. Read more BBC News Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck - who defied her party to vote for the government's Brexit bill - has been talking about her preference for Labour leader and whether it matters if they backed Leave or Remain. All of the likely contenders to replace Jeremy Corbyn voted against the government. ""I think the party can move on, but it absolutely matters to a lot of us, it absolutely matters to me, what people's stance is on Brexit whether or not I will vote for them as leader,"" said the South Shields MP. ""They will have to say they have heard what happened, they understand the reasons why we lost those Leave seats, but also I would like to see some actions and it would have been good today to have seen them come through the lobby with me."" Asked to describe the last few years being an MP in Westminster during the Brexit debates, Ms Lewell-Buck says: ""It's been absolutely grim. It has been a toxic pressure cooker, there has been abuse flying around left, right and centre. No one has crowned themselves with any glory. ""Whilst I am absolutely devastated that we've lost this general election, I hope we can start moving forward, start behaving like grown ups and actually get Parliament back to where it should be - a debating chamber where people work for the benefit of our country."" BBC News Channel Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party voted against the EU Withdrawal Bill, says the PM must live up to his claim to be leading a One Nation government and his pledge to treat all parts of the UK equally when it comes to Brexit. He told the BBC the UK had a stronger hand as it entered the second phase of the Brexit talks as there was no risk of Mr Johnson being ""undermined"" by MPs. ""We will be saying to the government 'use your negotiating position to try and undo some of the damaging impact of the withdrawal agreement'. ""If there was a no-tariff, no-quota agreement with the EU, then many of the checks that would be required across the Irish Sea would no longer exist."" Boris Johnson's director of communications, Lee Cain, is among the best-paid advisers in Downing Street, according to new government figures. He is one of three special advisers paid between Â£140,000 and Â£145,000. The others are Sir Edward Lister, the PM's chief of staff, and Munira Mirza, the head of No 10 Policy Unit. Dominic Cummings (pictured), the architect of the PM's election strategy who is regarded as the most influential special adviser in Downing Street, is on slightly less, receiving between Â£95,000 and Â£99,000. The PM's Europe adviser David Frost is taking home between Â£125,000 and Â£129,000. As of last month, there were 108 special advisers working across government, the vast majority of them earning more than Â£60,000. The total pay bill rose from Â£6.6m in 2017-8 to Â£7.1m in 2018-9.  Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck went against her party by voting in favour of Boris Johnson's Brexit bill, saying she had promised her constituents she would ""always do my best to try and get us to leave the EU with a deal"". She also defied the whip by voting for the schedule for the bill, telling BBC News: ""Last time, I went against the timetable, then Boris Johnson called a general election and it was the worst general election in living memory. ""He has a massive mandate now. To resist that on the back of losing 52 Leave Labour seats... it just doesn't send the right message that we have learnt our lesson here."" Ms Lewell-Buck says she has ""always tried to be loyal to the party"", but they made ""the wrong call"" going against the bill. ""I think off the back of losing so badly in the general election to then have the first vote in Parliament on the issue we lost over to say let's continue to keep doing what we have done historically was the wrong call,"" she adds.

We now have a full breakdown of the result of the vote. Seven out of the eight Democratic Unionist MPs opposed the bill, which they say will create a border down the Irish Sea, while one appears not to have voted. All 11 Lib Dem MPs voted against, as did Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. The vast majority of SNP members of Parliament, 45 in total, voted against. Labour MPs Sarah Champion, Emma Lewell-Buck, Jon Cruddas, Rosie Cooper, Grahame Morris and Toby Perkins all voted with the government. BBC News Labour's Tony Lloyd says the government has a mandate for delivering Brexit but it does not have a mandate for pushing through a ""bad Brexit deal"". The shadow Scottish Secretary urges the PM to reconsider his decision to rule out any further time for talks on a trade deal with the EU if an agreement is not reached by the end of 2020. Locking the UK into such a tight timetable is ""foolish"", he tells the BBC. He urges Mr Johnson to be more statesmanlike, saying the PM has a habit of getting by through ""flashy rhetoric or a quick joke"" and he needs to ""move on"" from that kind of style to govern in the interests of the whole of the UK.

BBC News Tory MP Mark Francois welcomes the support of a handful of Labour MPs who he says appear to have ""got the message"". He tells the BBC that the outcome of the vote was ""emphatic"" and ""tremendous"", adding that the Commons had ""obeyed the instruction"" of the people. Looking forward, he says aspects of the next phase of Brexit trade talks could be ""crunchy"" but a deal with the EU can be concluded next year. He insists any extension to the transition period beyond 2020 ""will not be needed"" and the European Research Group of MPs, of which he is a leading member, won't back one. ""There is more than enough time to negotiate the details,"" he adds.  We have now got the breakdown of the votes in favour of Boris Johnson's Brexit bill. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 353 of them came from Tories. But six Labour MPs voted for the plan too:  A further 32 Labour MPs abstained in the vote - despite Jeremy Corbyn telling his party to vote against it. They include three shadow cabinet members: MPs have voted in favour of Boris Johnson's EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill and the schedule to see it through Parliemnt. So what happens next? After the end of business today, MPs will go on recess until Tuesday, 7 January. As soon as they are back, they will enter the Committee stage of the bill for two days (or 16 hours of debate), where they will scrutinise the legislation and debate any amendments that have been tabled. The final stage of the bill in the Commons will then take place on Thursday, 9 January, before it heads to the Lords for approval. Only then can it be made into law - but if it is all agreed, that would be far ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 January. Finally, it will be sent to the European Parliament for ratification.

Paul Mortimer, head of ITV's digital channels and acquisitions, said: ""I'm delighted that Laura is able to step in this winter on ITV2's biggest show. ""She is the best person for the job and is a popular and experienced presenter of live television. Whilst Caroline is away, we know that Love Island will be in very safe hands."" Flack had hosted Love Island since it returned to screens in 2015 Whitmore said she was ""excited"" to step into the role but wished her opportunity had come under ""better circumstances"". ""Caroline is a brilliant host and also a friend,"" she said in a statement. ""We've spoken a lot in the last few days since she stepped down. She has been very kind to me and strongly pushed me for this role. I've watched her host every series and know I have big boots to fill. I will try and do it justice."" She added: ""Above all, I am a massive fan of this show. I've never been to a Love Island villa, and I can't wait to get in there to meet all the new Islanders looking for love. The Love Island team are the best in the businessâ¦ including the voice and heart of the show, Iain. He thought he was getting a holiday away from meâ¦ not a chance!"" Allow Instagram content?

The incoming Love Island host is guaranteed to be greeted in South Africa by one familiar face at least, in the form of boyfriend and Scottish comedian Iain Stirling - who does the voiceovers on the show. He greeted the announcement of her arrival by joking: ""I wonder if she's single..."" Caroline Flack has given her approval online over the decision to replace her with Laura Whitmore Flack gave her approval to the decision to appoint Whitmore too, via her Instagram story on Friday. ""She loves the show as much as I do,"" she noted. Flack was charged with assault by beating following an incident at her Islington home in north London. Police were called to her house, where she lives with her partner, tennis player Lewis Burton, at 05:25 GMT last week. Officers attended after reports of a man being assaulted. The man was not seriously injured, police said. The 40-year-old will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 23 December. Announcing her decision to step aside, she said: ""There have been a significant number of media reports and allegations into my personal life. ""While matters were not as have been reported, I am committed to working with the authorities and I can't comment further on these matters until the legal process is over."" She added: ""In order not to detract attention from the upcoming series I feel the best thing I can do is stand down for series six. I want to wish the incredible team working on the show a fantastic series in Cape Town."" ITV announced the winter spin-off in July following the show's success over the past five summers. The company said the 2019 series reached more than six million viewers and was the most-watched programme of the year at the time among adults aged between 16 and 34. In November, Whitmore took up hernew role as a BBC Radio 5 Live broadcaster, as part of the station's shake-up to their weekend line-up, which also saw Scott Mills join. The 34-year-old had previously filled in on occasion and said at the time she was  ""thrilled"" to return on a permanent basis with ""big name guests from the worlds of politics, music and showbiz"". The Bray-born star studied at Dublin City University and made her breakthrough as a TV presenter with MTV Ireland from 2008 onwards. She hosted I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! NOW; a companion series to the popular ITV reality show from 2011-2015, before appearing as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. Unlike Flack, who won the competition in 2014, Whitmore was voted off the show following a dance-off with eventual winner Ore Oduba. Whitmore has also worked as a model and as a co-commentator for BBC Three on the Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Finals in 2014. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played ""A huge step"": Harry's mother reacts to the charge A US woman will be charged with causing the death of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn by dangerous driving. Mr Dunn, 19, died in a road crash in Northamptonshire in August that led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had started extradition proceedings through the Home Office. US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"" and Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK. Lawyer Amy Jefress said: ""Anne will not return voluntarily to the UK to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident."" Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family was ""relieved"" Mrs Sacoolas had ""finally"" been charged. Outside the CPS headquarters she said: ""We feel that we have made a huge step in the start of achieving the promise to Harry that we made. ""We made that promise to him the night we lost him to seek justice thinking it was going to be really easy. ""We had no idea it was going to be so hard and it would take so long."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton where her husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, left the UK and returned to her native US, claiming diplomatic immunity. A statement from the US State Department said that at the time of the crash Mrs Saccolas had ""status that conferred diplomatic immunities"" and added the foreign secretary ""stated the same in Parliament"". It added: ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an egregious abuse. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent. ""We do not believe that the UK's charging decision is a helpful development."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 A statement via her lawyer said Mrs Sacoolas had ""co-operated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility"". It added: ""This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response. ""We have been in contact with the UK authorities about ways in which Anne could assist with preventing accidents like this from happening in the future, as well as her desire to honour Harry's memory. ""We will continue that dialogue in an effort to move forward from this terrible tragedy."" BBC correspondent Duncan Kennedy This has been a tortuous, raw, unrelenting, four months for Harry Dunn's family. They cannot bear to be at the centre of what they regard as an prolonged, unnecessary, international spat between lawyers, diplomats and politicians over what, to them, was a tragic family road accident. Meeting presidents, foreign secretaries and chief constables has been an alien, disorientating experience for them. They sometimes feel that Harry has been forgotten amid all their efforts to keep his case prominent in the minds of those who carry influence. They know that the Home Office will now start the extradition process. They realise that although extradition may take some time, their efforts on behalf of their son now have some meaning. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab previously urged Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK voluntarily Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said a review into the immunity arrangements at Croughton for US personnel and their families had concluded. It found that it was an ""anomaly"" that family members had ""greater protection from UK criminal jurisdiction than the officers themselves"". He said he welcomed the decision to charge Mrs Sacoolas. Mr Raab added: ""I hope that Anne Sacoolas will now realise the right thing to do is to come back to the UK and cooperate with the criminal justice process."" Chief Crown Prosecutor Janine Smith said it had authorised Northamptonshire Police to charge Mrs Sacoolas. She said the director of public prosecutions had met Mr Dunn's family to explain the decision. The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's parents Tim Dunn and Mrs Charles had previously been critical of the lack of communication from the CPS. His father said on Friday he was ""overwhelmed"" by the CPS's decision. Mr Dunn's parentsrejected a ""bombshell"" offer from Donald Trumpto meet Mrs Sacoolas at the White House in October.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson  'Now is the moment to reunite our country' MPs are voting on whether to back the PM's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill would also ban the government from extending the transition period - where the UK is out of the EU but follows many of its rules - past 2020. Boris Johnson said it would allow the UK to ""move forward"". But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would oppose the bill, and there was ""a better and fairer way"" to leave the EU. Mr Johnson has insisted a trade deal with the EU can be in place by the end of the transition period, but critics say this timetable is unrealistic. The result of the Commons vote is expected at about 14:30 GMT. LIVE: MPs to vote on Brexit What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What could Brexit look like by 2021? Government to shut Brexit department on 31 January The withdrawal bill, which would implement theBrexit agreement the prime minister reached with the EUin October, was introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, setting out the government's priorities for the next year. Beginning the debate in the Commons, the prime minister said his bill ""learns the emphatic lesson of the last Parliament"" and ""rejects any further delay"". ""It ensures we depart on 31 January. At that point Brexit will be done. It will be over,"" he told MPs. ""The sorry story of the last three years will be at an end and we can move forward."" Mr Johnson said it also ""paves the way"" for a ""ambitious free trade deal"" with the EU. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We still believe this is a terrible deal"" The bill's second reading is the first chance MPs have had to debate its main principles in the House of Commons. With the Conservatives having won an 80-seat majority at last week's general election, the bill is expected to pass easily, before it moves on to further scrutiny by MPs and the House of Lords. MPs have been given a further three days - 7, 8 and 9 January - to continue their debate. The government says it will get the bill into law in time for the 31 January Brexit deadline. There are changes to the previous bill, which was backed by the Commons in October, but withdrawn by the government after MPs rejected a three-day deadline for getting it through Parliament. The changes include: Legally prohibiting the government from extending the transition period - during which a trade deal between the UK and EU will be discussed - beyond 31 December 2020 Allowing more UK courts to reconsider European Court of Justice rulings that have been retained in UK law after Brexit Requiring ministers to report annually to Parliament on disputes with the EU under the prime minister's withdrawal agreement Repealing spent legislation that ""now serves no purpose"" The bill also loses a previous clause on strengthening workers' rights. The government now says it will deal with this issue in a separate piece of legislation, but the TUC has warned that the change will help ""drive down"" working conditions. What a difference a year makes. It was back in January that Theresa May embarked on a series of Commons defeats as she tried and failed to begin the process of getting her Brexit plans approved. It was only in October that Boris Johnson paused his own efforts when MPs rejected the proposed timetable for getting the Withdrawal Agreement through parliament. But now, following the general election and with an 80-strong Conservative majority, things look very different. And Boris Johnson knows it, claiming that it's time for ""certainty"" after years of ""delay and rancour"". But the bill will come in for criticism. Gone are clauses about workers' rights - Downing Street says that will be dealt with in separate legislation. And added: a provision ruling out any extension to the transition period beyond December 2020. The process of ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement Bill will continue in the New Year but Friday's vote is, in part, designed to signal that the UK is now motoring towards that January 31 departure date. Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the government's ""mishandling of Brexit"" had ""paralysed the political system,"" divided communities and was a ""national embarrassment"". He said MPs ""have to respect the decision"" of the EU referendum in 2016 ""and move on"". ""However, that doesn't mean that we as a party should abandon our basic principles,"" he said. ""Labour will not support this bill as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU."" He said there had to be something better than this ""terrible"" Brexit deal that would not ""sell out public services"" or ""sacrifice hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process"". However, Labour MP for South Shields, Emma Lewell-Buck, said she would vote for the bill, adding: ""The party opposite have a mandate they did not have before. ""It is with the heaviest of hearts that I cannot vote with my party today but I will always put my constituents first."" The Queen outlined the government's agenda at Thursday's State Opening of Parliament The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: ""Scotland still totally and utterly rejects Brexit, yet the prime minister is blindly hurtling towards the cliff edge with these Brexit plans that will leave us poorer, leave us worse off."" On the change in the bill that would legally prohibit the government from extending the transition period beyond 31 December 2020, Mr Blackford said: ""By placing that deadline, that risk of a no-deal Brexit, that we all fear is very much, is on the table again."" And the Democratic Unionist Party's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a ""major contradiction"" in the prime minister's deal ""that causes us great concern"". He said, while it mentioned ""unfettered access"" for Northern Ireland when it comes to trade in the UK, it also had customs arrangements ""that inhibit our ability to have that unfettered access"". Meanwhile, Labour 's Lord Dubs said it was ""appalling and deeply distressing"" that his amendment to the previous Brexit bill, which proposed that the UK would continue to enable unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families, had been removed.

But Mr Johnson said: ""We remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children.

But the subsequent difficulties in getting Brexit through Parliament have caused gridlock at Westminster. An earlier withdrawal agreement - reached between previous Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU - was rejected three times by MPs.

"Andrew Bailey has been appointed as the next governor of the Bank of England. Mr Bailey, aged 60, is currently chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog. He will become the 121st governor of the Bank of England on 16 March, taking over from Mark Carney, and will serve a full eight-year term. The search for the new governor began in April and Mr Bailey, who spent more than 30 years at the Bank, was seen as an early favourite for the job. Andrew Bailey's 'slow and steady' rise to power What does the Bank of England governor do? Faisal Islam: Andrew Bailey's brush with animal spirits However, the FCA has faced criticism in recent months over its regulatory scrutiny of the flagship fund of one of the UK's best known money managers, Neil Woodford. The fund was suspended in June and eventually closed, with investors expected to lose large sums of money. In addition, the FCA's report into Royal Bank of Scotland's treatment of small business by its controversial restructuring division was called a ""whitewash"" after itrecommended taking no further action against the bank. It sets the official interest rate, which determines the cost of borrowing money It supervises the financial system, seeking to ensure it is stable and no banks are running out of cash It acts as the government's bank and a lender of last resort in times of financial difficulty It issues the UK's banknotes (coins are issued by the Royal Mint) It stores the UK's gold reserves, as well as those of other central banks Announcing the decision to appoint Mr Bailey, Chancellor Sajid Javid said he was ""the stand-out candidate in a competitive field"". ""He is the right person to lead the Bank as we forge a new future outside the EU and level-up opportunity across the country,"" he added. This video can not be played What does the Bank of England governor do? The BBC's Dharshini David explains Accepting the role, Mr Bailey said it was ""a tremendous honour"" to be chosen. ""The Bank has a very important job and, as governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does."" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith congratulated Mr Bailey, saying:  ""His strong experience, both in Threadneedle Street and at the Financial Conduct Authority, means he is particularly well placed to steer the British economy through the new course it will take after Brexit and through challenging global economic times."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell was critical of the appointment, saying: ""As an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record at the FCA, Andrew Bailey will need to demonstrate early that he appreciates the need to address the deep structural problems of our economy and, like Mark Carney, understands the climate change threat."" Mr Carney had been due to step down on 31 January, but has now agreed to stay on until 15 March in order to provide for a smooth transition. Mr Carney described Mr Bailey as ""an extraordinary public servant"". ""Andrew brings unparalleled experience, built over three decades of dedicated service across all policy areas of the Bank,"" he said. Minouche Shafik was seen as an early favourite to succeed Mark Carney The decision means hopes that the Bank could have been led by a female governor for the first time in its history have been dashed. Minouche Shafik, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee,had been hotly tipped for the role. Mr Bailey has spent almost the entirety of his career at the Bank of England, which he joined in 1985. He has held a number of roles including chief cashier, which meant that his signature appeared on all bank notes issued by the Bank of England. Mr Bailey was chief cashier during the financial crisis when,he recalled in an interview,external: ""The [RBS] treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attack... and he looked at me and said: 'I need Â£25bn today, can you do it?'. I said: 'Yes, I can do that'."" Mr Bailey was also a deputy governor and head of the Bank's prudential regulation division, before joining the FCA as its chief executive in 2016. Andrew Bailey was the early frontrunner for one of the most powerful positions in the UK. However, his time as head of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, was peppered with a number of high-profile controversies - including its handling of complaints intoRBS's treatment of small businesses in the aftermath of the financial crisis- which many thought might have harmed his chances for the top job. He is highly thought of by colleagues and civil servants. Former Permanent Treasury Secretary Lord McPherson described him as the most able and competent Bank of England official he had ever worked with, adding that while Bailey would not make waves for the government he had the backbone to stand up to it. Mr Bailey, who will be paid Â£495,000 a year, is taking over at a fraught time for the Bank of England. It emerged this week that an audio feed of sensitive market information from the Bank had been leaked to fund managers. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed which gave traders early access to information that could potentially generate large sums of money. The matter has been referred to the FCA, which Mr Bailey currently leads. The City watchdog said it was ""looking at the issue"". PA reported that the prime minister's official spokesman, when asked whether Brexit was a factor in Mr Bailey's appointment, said: ""The way it works is the chancellor recommends candidates to the PM, the PM then advises the Queen."" When pressed on the issue, the spokesman added:  ""I just went through the process and the prime minister thinks he will do an excellent job.""

"After a lengthy search for the next Bank of England governor, the Treasury has gone back to the candidate it first thought of. As far back as June, Andrew Bailey was being spoken of as the favourite for the job. However, his time as head of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has been marked by a number of high-profile controversies. These included the FCA's handling of complaints into the Royal Bank of Scotland's treatment of small businesses in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The FCA has also faced criticism in recent months over the demise of the flagship fund of one of the UK's best known money managers, Neil Woodford. Many thought these issues might have harmed his chances for the top job. But in the meantime, other big names cited as possible candidates for the governorship fell by the wayside and Mr Bailey emerged as the victor. ""Mr Bailey has played a slow and steady campaign,"" Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, told the BBC. Andrew Bailey named as next Bank of England governor What does the Bank of England's governor do? What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? Mr Bailey, 60, is married with two children. He was born in Leicester and went to Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. He studied at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he gained a BA First Class Honours in history and PhD in economic history. He then became a research officer at the London School of Economics, before working at the Bank of England from 1985 to 2016. He was chief cashier from January 2004 until April 2011, which meant his signature appeared on billions of UK banknotes. During the financial crisis, he was also responsible for the Bank's special operations to resolve problems in the banking sector. As a result, he was involved with the 2008 government rescue of Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. ""The [RBS] treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attackâ¦ and he looked at me and said, I need Â£25bn today, can you do it? I said, 'Yes, I can do that,'""Mr Bailey said in an interview. He then served as the Bank's first deputy governor for prudential regulation from April 2013 to July 2016. He is highly thought of by colleagues and civil servants. Mark Carney, the man he will be succeeding as governor, has described his work in helping to manage the financial crisis and then to develop the post-crisis regulatory framework as ""exemplary"". Former Permanent Treasury Secretary Lord McPherson described Mr Bailey as the most able and competent Bank of England official he had ever worked with.

"Bears are not just for markets where Andrew Bailey is concerned The appointment of Andrew Bailey as the 121st Bank of England governor is a safety-first move from the government after its re-election. The former deputy governor has long-standing experience at the Bank and takes over at a tumultuous moment in the UK's economic history. As the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), he is well known internationally for his role in the regulation of the banking system and helping clean up the financial crisis. Mr Bailey's challenge now will be keeping inflation low and maintaining the stability of the banking system, particularly through the Brexit process. Both require co-operation with the government, but on occasion, having to stand up to them. Focus not on the fact that Chancellor Sajid Javid has a rescue puppy coincidentally called ""Bailey"", but the reality that the new governor once helped his wife Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey fight off a grizzly bear, albeit from a distance. According to the Financial Times, Ms Schonhardt-Bailey, a professor and head of the government department at the London School of Economics, was confronted by the bear in 2007, after it wandered into their home in New Meadows, Idaho. Mr Bailey gave her ""moral telephonic support"" on the line from London, where he was trying to halt the collapse of Northern Rock. Andrew Bailey's 'slow and steady' rise to power What does the Bank of England governor do? What exactly is the Bank of England interest rate? Mr Bailey was the ""stand-out candidate"", Mr Javid said when making the announcement, which was confirmed after Prime Minister Boris Johnson made the recommendation to the Queen to appoint Mr Bailey. The chancellor said it was one of the most important decisions he would have to make, denying that Brexit views were a consideration in the process. For example, Gerard Lyons, a key ally of Mr Johnson, was overlooked for the post. Mr Bailey has, however, stressed the importance of being a public servant, and while applying Bank of England modelling which assumes the economy could have faced a severe hit from a no-deal Brexit, he has also suggested new options for the UK from greater regulatory freedom outside the European Union. But the FCA, the City misconduct watchdog, has also been right at the heart of a number of some recent financial controversies, such as the closure of the Neil Woodford investment funds and the ""mini-bond"" scandal. The government was not tempted down the path of creating a more compliant, less independent central bank, as is an emerging pattern elsewhere. It is difficult to see Boris Johnson tweeting abuse at Andrew Bailey for not cutting interest rates, as does now occur in the US. I asked the chancellor if he would welcome the Bank continuing to make frank and occasionally unflattering assessments of its Brexit plans. Mr Javid said the Bank needed to be completely independent. Indeed, he chose on purpose to host the announcement in the same room where 22 years previously, Gordon Brown had announced the Bank would be responsible for setting interest rates. At that time, Mr Bailey was the private secretary to Eddie George, a key official in the ""Ken and Eddie show"" that had decided rates up until then with Chancellor Ken Clarke. Setting interest rates and avoiding financial crises is now his show, alongside the Bank's expert committees for the next eight years. He will take over in mid-March, as Mark Carney has agreed to extend his tenure by a few weeks.

"Mitra Mehrad studied mental health issues among her compatriots A migrant who died while trying to cross the Channel wanted to help fellow Iranians, it can be revealed. Mitra Mehrad, 31, fell from a dinghy off the coast of Kent in August and her body was later found in Dutch waters. Police have now confirmed her identity with the help of the BBC. Ms Mehrad, who had started a PhD in counselling psychology, wanted to help her compatriots by researching mental health issues among Iranians, her friends said. A massive rescue effort was launched on 9 August when she and three others fell from a flimsy vessel ferrying 20 migrants - including four children - from northern France to the English coast in rough seas. Two were pulled from the water, and 19 people - 14 from Iran and 5 from Iraq - were brought to Ramsgate by the RNLI but there was no sign of Ms Mehrad. Helicopters from both British and Belgian coastguards joined the search, which continued at first light the following day. Her body was eventually found by a guard ship at a wind farm more than 30 miles off the coast of the Netherlands on 18 August. Mitra Mehrad had a masters degree in psychology Dutch police were only able to positively ID her body this week after the BBC tracked down Ms Mehrad's father and helped to arrange a visit to their embassy in Tehran. A DNA sample was flown back to a lab in The Netherlands and Ms Mehrad's father was given the news on Tuesday. The student had left the family home in the south-western Khuzestan province to complete her psychology masters degree, graduating from Assumption University in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2017. Parvathy Varma, a lecturer who supervised Ms Mehrad's thesis, said: ""She was a highly motivated person. She wanted to work hard and get a PHD and be settled, that was her desire."" Her thesis looked atmental health issues in the Iranian population,externaland she travelled back to Iran to conduct research, working in a hospital while she collected data on personality disorders. ""She wanted to help people in her homeland,"" Mrs Varma said. ""She said the reason why she wanted to do her research area was because people have a lot of these personality issues [in Iran]."" She recalled that her student had told her: ""I don't want to do any research that isn't useful to my people."" Ms Mehrad started her PhD but was unable to find a job in Bangkok that could support her studies, Mrs Varma said. At some point in early 2019, she left Thailand, eventually arriving in France. The French rescued migrants found clinging to the hull of their dinghy on the day Ms Mehrad died It is not clear exactly when she settled upon the plan to pay smugglers to carry her across the Channel, but it seems she kept it secret from friends, who were shocked to learn how she died. In February, she had told colleagues she was planning to travel to Canada to continue her research. Mrs Varma said they shared a joke about her plans. ""I was thinking, what, all of a sudden Canada, did you find a Canadian boyfriend? She said no, no, no, I'll talk to you later."" ""She also said: ''Please pray for me'. Then I thought maybe she was into something."" According to Dutch police, by early August Ms Mehrad had arrived at a makeshift camp at the Grande Synthe gymnasium in Dunkirk, which was home to hundreds of other migrants, many of them Iranian. The National Crime Agency warned earlier this year that the camp was controlled by OCGs - or organised crime groups - who are ""willing to use violence to threaten migrants into travelling to the UK by boat"". Two men, who helped to organise Ms Mehrad's crossing, have beenjailed for manslaughter in France. She was spoken to by the Refugee Women's Centre at the camp, where she spent just a handful of days before embarking on the doomed journey. Mrs Varma said she could not understand why Ms Mehrad made such a decision. ""That is the part I couldn't actually believe. Why was she so desperate to leave?"" Newspapers in the UK and the Netherlands named Ms Mehrad shortly after she fell from the boat, but Dutch police spokesman Ed Kraszewski said they had been unable to say for certain until her father's DNA proved a match. ""We can't say she is probably dead,"" he said. ""We have to be sure. That's the same for her father. He has to be sure, otherwise he can go through all his life waiting. ""I know from other missing [person] cases, the people who stay behind have hope [their loved ones] will come back."" Mr Kraszewski said the positive DNA match had ended a painful wait for Ms Mehrad's family, who, more than four months after she died, can finally make arrangements to lay her to rest.

"Bank of England chief operating officer Joanna Place is responsible for information security A former member of the Bank of England has called for the resignation of its chief operating officer after it emerged an audio feed of sensitive information had been leaked to traders. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed to give hedge funds early access to information. Danny Blanchflower, who previously served on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said Joanna Place should step down following the breach. The Bank of England refused to comment. Many Bank press conferences are broadcast via video, but there is also a back-up audio feed in case of problems. The audio is available between five and eight seconds before the video. It meant that high-speed financial traders had access to the words of Governor Mark Carney and his officials before their remarks were more widely broadcast. Ms Place reports directly to Mr Carney and has had responsibility for information security since July 2017. Mr Blanchflower said: ""The question I ask is did the chief operating officer at the Bank of England know that access was being sold? If so, she should resign. And if she didn't know she should resign as well. ""I just don't know how her position is maintained because this could have created a lot of harm. People could have made a lot of money."" The Bank of England said it had disabled the audio supplier's access. Bank governor Mark Carney is due to stand down at the end of January The hijacking of the audio feed, first reportedin the Times,external, gave an advantage to high-speed traders, such as currency speculators, who can make millions of pounds on tiny market moves. Comments from Bank officials about market sensitive matters such as interest rate decisions can affect the value of sterling and other market assets within fractions of a second. The Times said it understood that the eavesdropping on the press conferences had been happening at least since the beginning of this year. Mr Blanchflower said the ""astonishing"" revelation was ""a stain"" on Mr Carney as he prepares to step down as Governor on 31 January. Commenting on who could be in line to replace Mr Carney, Mr Blanchflower said his ""old graduate school room mate"" Gerard Lyons, who was Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former chief economist when he was Mayor of London, may ""rise to the top of pack"". The Bank of England said the leak ""was wholly unacceptable use of the audio feed"" and the way hedge funds were allowed to make use of it was ""without the Bank's knowledge or consent, and is being investigated further"". The matter has been referred to the market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, which told the BBC it was ""looking at the issue"". Being able to hear the press conference early would provide an unfair advantage. Interest rates, economic guidance, and the financial health of banks and the markets are frequently discussed at the press conferences. The Bank sets rates eight times a year and holds a press conference on four of those occasions. A report on financial stability comes out twice, which also includes a press conference. All of this is broadcast on video provided by Bloomberg, which is shared to other news outlets. The company that provides the audio feed, which is separate from the video feed, has not been identified. A spokesperson from Bloomberg confirmed to the BBC that the company does not provide the audio. ""Bloomberg provides a distinct and independent video feed for the BoE's press conferences. This is completely separate to the backup audio feed."" The pronouncements of central bank chiefs can sound like boring technical gobbledy-gook. But every word, every nuance, is carefully studied by financial markets for the slightest hint about the Bank's intentions and can cause big movements in the value of the pound and government bonds. So getting wind of any potential future changes, even a few seconds ahead of the rest of the market, could be extremely valuable. Computerised trading programs can execute thousands of transactions a second, so the four-to-eight second advantage enjoyed by those traders accessing the back-up audio feed is a vast amount of time in terms of market movements. The Bank of England is usually very careful in managing the dissemination of sensitive information and the Bank was keen to stress that the information breach did not apply to the release of decisions on interest rates - just the press conferences afterwards. But those press conferences can - and do - move markets so this is still an embarrassing admission. The Times said it had seen documents revealing how the service was sold on to traders. The supply cost between Â£2,500 and Â£5,000 each press conference for each client in addition to a subscription fee. It is unclear whether the leaked audio feed was used by traditional traders at their desks to steal a march on rivals, or whether algorithm-driven software, that can conduct thousands of transactions a second, could be used to exploit those few seconds advantage. Hypothetically a computer program could be designed to pick out key words from the Bank Governor's comments and trade on them. But central bankers are notoriously euphemistic. ""[Early access] would be more important to a traditional voice trader or hedge fund,"" says Malcolm Baker, co-Founder at FX FWD, a trading firm. ""Central bankers can speak in language that is hard to understand and there is a lot that's implied. It's like old Elizabethan language and can be misleading. A trader like me just wants to understand - is it hawkish? Or dovish?"" The Bank has not named the audio supplier, but market intelligence firm Statisma has posted a denial that it offers its customers information not available to the public. Statisma, operating under the same management as a production firm called Encoded Media, advertises on Twitter a service where traders can hear central bank announcements first. Statisma offers on Twitter its audio feeds for several central bank announcements Press conferences from the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada were also on offer to trading firms. Traders signed up to Statisma's service receive an email detailing the speeches with dial in numbers. In a response to several calls made from the BBC and other media outlets, it posted on its website this statement: ""We DO NOT carry embargoed information and we DO NOT release information without it first being made available to the public"". An ECB spokesman said the central bank moved to address possible issues with audio broadcasts in September, effectively delaying the feed. ""Since September this year the ECB offers a low latency audio feed for each monetary policy press conference to address exactly the issues that were in the news today. ""Therefore, it doesn't make any sense for anyone to use commercially offered solutions because the solution we offer is the fastest option available and it is free for everyone,"" the spokesman said.

"An architect's visualisation of Heathrow's planned expansion Heathrow has said its project to build a third runway has been delayed by ""at least 12 months"" after the aviation regulator rejected its spending plans. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has refused Heathrow's request to lift spending from Â£650m to Â£2.4bn before it even gets planning consent. The CAA is concerned passengers will end up shouldering the cost if Heathrow does not win permission to expand. The airport now expects to complete a third runway between 2028 and 2029. In a consultation published by the CAA, it said ""the best approach in the interest of consumers"" is to limit certain early construction costs to Â£1.6bn. The consultation also said an assessment by an independent fund surveyor of Heathrow's plan to open a new runway by 2026 was an ""aggressive schedule"" which would require ""maximum activity"" even before the airport knew whether it had been granted a development consent order. What is the Heathrow expansion masterplan? Why are people arguing over Heathrow? Paul Smith, group director of consumers and markets at the CAA, said: ""We believe that more runway capacity at Heathrow will benefit air passengers and cargo owners. ""Its timely delivery is required to prevent future consumers experiencing higher airfares, reduced choice and lower service quality. ""However, we have also been clear that timeliness is not the only factor that is important to consumers. ""Passengers cannot be expected to bear the risk of Heathrow Airport Limited spending too much in the early phases of development, should planning permission not be granted."" The CAA has approved Heathrow's proposal to increase its spending on planning costs from Â£265m to Â£500m. Heathrow said the CAA's announcement was ""an important milestone"" in the expansion of the airport. A spokesman added: ""We will now review the detail to ensure it will unlock the initial Â£1.5bn to Â£2bn of private investment over the next two years at no cost to the taxpayer. ""While this is a step forward, the CAA has delayed the project timetable by at least 12 months. We now expect to complete the third runway between early 2028 and late 2029.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson  'Now is the moment to reunite our country' MPs are voting on whether to back the PM's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill would also ban the government from extending the transition period - where the UK is out of the EU but follows many of its rules - past 2020. Boris Johnson said it would allow the UK to ""move forward"". But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would oppose the bill, and there was ""a better and fairer way"" to leave the EU. Mr Johnson has insisted a trade deal with the EU can be in place by the end of the transition period, but critics say this timetable is unrealistic. The result of the Commons vote is expected at about 14:30 GMT. LIVE: MPs to vote on Brexit What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What could Brexit look like by 2021? Government to shut Brexit department on 31 January The withdrawal bill, which would implement theBrexit agreement the prime minister reached with the EUin October, was introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, setting out the government's priorities for the next year. Beginning the debate in the Commons, the prime minister said his bill ""learns the emphatic lesson of the last Parliament"" and ""rejects any further delay"". ""It ensures we depart on 31 January. At that point Brexit will be done. It will be over,"" he told MPs. ""The sorry story of the last three years will be at an end and we can move forward."" Mr Johnson said it also ""paves the way"" for a ""ambitious free trade deal"" with the EU. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We still believe this is a terrible deal"" The bill's second reading is the first chance MPs have had to debate its main principles in the House of Commons. With the Conservatives having won an 80-seat majority at last week's general election, the bill is expected to pass easily, before it moves on to further scrutiny by MPs and the House of Lords. MPs have been given a further three days - 7, 8 and 9 January - to continue their debate. The government says it will get the bill into law in time for the 31 January Brexit deadline. There are changes to the previous bill, which was backed by the Commons in October, but withdrawn by the government after MPs rejected a three-day deadline for getting it through Parliament. The changes include: Legally prohibiting the government from extending the transition period - during which a trade deal between the UK and EU will be discussed - beyond 31 December 2020 Allowing more UK courts to reconsider European Court of Justice rulings that have been retained in UK law after Brexit Requiring ministers to report annually to Parliament on disputes with the EU under the prime minister's withdrawal agreement Repealing spent legislation that ""now serves no purpose"" The bill also loses a previous clause on strengthening workers' rights. The government now says it will deal with this issue in a separate piece of legislation, but the TUC has warned that the change will help ""drive down"" working conditions. What a difference a year makes. It was back in January that Theresa May embarked on a series of Commons defeats as she tried and failed to begin the process of getting her Brexit plans approved. It was only in October that Boris Johnson paused his own efforts when MPs rejected the proposed timetable for getting the Withdrawal Agreement through parliament. But now, following the general election and with an 80-strong Conservative majority, things look very different. And Boris Johnson knows it, claiming that it's time for ""certainty"" after years of ""delay and rancour"". But the bill will come in for criticism. Gone are clauses about workers' rights - Downing Street says that will be dealt with in separate legislation. And added: a provision ruling out any extension to the transition period beyond December 2020. The process of ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement Bill will continue in the New Year but Friday's vote is, in part, designed to signal that the UK is now motoring towards that January 31 departure date. Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the government's ""mishandling of Brexit"" had ""paralysed the political system,"" divided communities and was a ""national embarrassment"". He said MPs ""have to respect the decision"" of the EU referendum in 2016 ""and move on"". ""However, that doesn't mean that we as a party should abandon our basic principles,"" he said. ""Labour will not support this bill as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU."" He said there had to be something better than this ""terrible"" Brexit deal that would not ""sell out public services"" or ""sacrifice hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process"". However, Labour MP for South Shields, Emma Lewell-Buck, said she would vote for the bill, adding: ""The party opposite have a mandate they did not have before. ""It is with the heaviest of hearts that I cannot vote with my party today but I will always put my constituents first."" The Queen outlined the government's agenda at Thursday's State Opening of Parliament The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: ""Scotland still totally and utterly rejects Brexit, yet the prime minister is blindly hurtling towards the cliff edge with these Brexit plans that will leave us poorer, leave us worse off."" On the change in the bill that would legally prohibit the government from extending the transition period beyond 31 December 2020, Mr Blackford said: ""By placing that deadline, that risk of a no-deal Brexit, that we all fear is very much, is on the table again."" And the Democratic Unionist Party's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a ""major contradiction"" in the prime minister's deal ""that causes us great concern"". He said, while it mentioned ""unfettered access"" for Northern Ireland when it comes to trade in the UK, it also had customs arrangements ""that inhibit our ability to have that unfettered access"". Meanwhile, Labour 's Lord Dubs said it was ""appalling and deeply distressing"" that his amendment to the previous Brexit bill, which proposed that the UK would continue to enable unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with their families, had been removed.

But Mr Johnson said: ""We remain proud of our work in receiving unaccompanied children.

But the subsequent difficulties in getting Brexit through Parliament have caused gridlock at Westminster. An earlier withdrawal agreement - reached between previous Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU - was rejected three times by MPs.

"The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25% for the seventh time at its June meeting, keeping them at their highest level for 16 years. The pause follows a period of 14 successive increases, as the Bank tried to control inflation. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. It is independent of government but works closely with the Treasury. It describes its key job as ensuring the UK hassecure banknotes, stable prices, a safe banking sector and a resilient financial system.,external The Bank has a target to keep inflation -the official measure of how quickly prices are rising. The headline Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate - which tracks the price ofa typical basket of goods- has fallen from a high of 11.1% in October 2022to 2% in May 2024. This was the first time inflation has hit the Bank of England's target in almost three years. The recent sharp increases in inflation were initially due to rising energy and food costs - largely caused by global events such as the war in Ukraine. But other factors - like wage increases in the UK - also helped keep prices high. The Bank's traditional response to rising inflation is to increase the UK's official interest rate. This affects the saving and mortgage rates which High Street banks and building societies charge individuals and businesses. From November 2021, the Bank increased interest rates on 14 successive occasions to 5.25%, the highest level since February 2008. The Bank has since held rates at that level seven times,most recently in June 2024. Although the headline rate of inflation has now fallen to the Bank's target, other measures of inflation are still higher than it would like. What are UK interest rates and when will they fall? Higher interest rates mean people have to pay more for their mortgages, for example, which means they have less money to spend on other things. Fewer people wanting to buy things should, in theory, mean that prices rise less quickly. It also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand. Alternatively, if the Bank cuts interest rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, and people have more money to spend on other things. This can encourage businesses and people to borrow and spend more, boosting the economy. The Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said he had seen ""strong evidence"" that the process to reduce inflation ""is working its way through"". But he emphasised that the Bank had to be sure that having reached its 2% target, it would stay there. The minutes of the Bank's June meeting suggest the first cut could come at its next meeting on 1 August. What is the UK inflation rate and how does it affect me? Why inflation is falling but prices are still rising The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets eight times a year to set rates. Itsnine members,externalvote on whether to increase, reduce or hold interest rates. Minutes of the meeting at which the decision was taken are also published. These show how the different members voted, and can gave some clues about future decisions. Four times a year, the Bank also publishes aMonetary Policy Report,,externalwhich sets out the economic analysis and inflation projections that the MPC uses to make its interest rate decisions. The next report will be published alongside its August decision. The Bank of England alsobuys and sells government bonds. Bonds are a bit like an IOU from the government, which uses them to raise money to help meet its spending commitments. In the period from the 2009 financial crisis until 2021, the Bank bought Â£875bn of government bonds. This was done through a process calledquantitative easing.This was designed to reduce overall government borrowing costs, lower interest rates and stimulate spending in the economy. The bank also announced anemergency bond-buying programmeto try to stabilise the economy, after the September 2022 mini-budgetcaused turmoil on financial markets. Once that intervention ended, the Bank said it would go ahead with a plan - first announced in August 2022 - to sell off some of the government bonds it holds. The Bank also: produces banknotes and oversees credit and debit card payments regulates banks and building societies monitors risks in the UK financial system and acts to reduce them, like lending to banks if they need it. It shares responsibility for this with the Treasury and financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority storesthe UK's gold reserves,external- 400,000 bars worth more than Â£200bn - as well as those of other central banks. Andrew Baileybecame governor in 2019,having already worked at the Bank of England for more than 30 years. He was the chief cashier from January 2004 until April 2011, which meant his signature appeared on billions of UK banknotes. As well as being responsible for overseeing the Bank, the governor also chairs three important committees that help it work towards its targets: the Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority.

"MPs vote by 358 to 234 to back the prime minister's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January - a majority of 124 The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, now moves to its next stage Boris Johnson said the country was now ""one step closer to getting Brexit done"" Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""reckless"" bill that will tear communities apart Mr Corbyn ordered Labour MPs to vote against the bill - but six backed it and 32 abstained Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have declared their intention to run to become Labour's next leader Jennifer Scott, Lucy Webster and Gavin Stamp A week ago, the country was digesting the result of the most clear-cut Conservative general election victory in 30 years. Today, we witnessed another decisive political moment when MPs backed legislation to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, a vote described as ""historic"" by leading Brexiteers.    Some more reaction from MPs who voted against the Brexit bill. The SNP's Alyn Smith - a former member of the European Parliament - says there was ""palpable hubris"" emanating from the Conservative benches during Friday's debate. He urges the government to remember that Scotland voted to stay in the EU and is being dragged out against its will ""due to events elsewhere"". For the Lib Dems, the new St Albans MP Daisy Cooper says her party will continue to lead ""cross-party efforts to oppose Brexit"". She says she and the party's other 10 MPs will continue to make the case for the values of openness, inclusivity and internationalism that she suggests are part and parcel of EU membership. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent It is going to be tricky - though not impossible - forClive Lewis (pictured) and some other candidatesto be the next Labour leader to get on to the ballot in the first place. Under former leader Ed Miliband's reforms, MPs were the gatekeepers in the process - the sole nominees of candidates, with no role for the unions nor the grassroots. But under Mr Corbyn, two more criteria were added. A candidate now also has to be nominated by ""5% of affiliates"" - translated, this means basically two of the dozen affiliated unions, or one big union and a ""socialist society"" such as the Fabians. If this proves impossible then 5% of constituency parties would have to nominate - that is, more than 30 local groups. Mr Lewis has told me that, so far, he has no union nominations, but would expect some left-led constituencies to come behind him if they want a debate. His championing of Remain from the left and not the Blairite/centrist wing of the party endeared him to many grassroots activists. But his difficulty is he will be fishing in the same waters as Rebecca Long-Bailey, another left-winger who is more likely to get union support.

An inquiry found it ""unlikely"" Mr Cairns had not been told something about Ross England's role as a witness. But Mr Cairns insisted he did not know the details of the case, and an adviser concluded there was no evidence to contradict that position. The MP resigned from the cabinet ahead of the general election. The position of Welsh secretary remained vacant during the campaign, in which Mr Cairns defended and won his Vale of Glamorgan seat. Read more BBC News Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck - who defied her party to vote for the government's Brexit bill - has been talking about her preference for Labour leader and whether it matters if they backed Leave or Remain. All of the likely contenders to replace Jeremy Corbyn voted against the government. ""I think the party can move on, but it absolutely matters to a lot of us, it absolutely matters to me, what people's stance is on Brexit whether or not I will vote for them as leader,"" said the South Shields MP. ""They will have to say they have heard what happened, they understand the reasons why we lost those Leave seats, but also I would like to see some actions and it would have been good today to have seen them come through the lobby with me."" Asked to describe the last few years being an MP in Westminster during the Brexit debates, Ms Lewell-Buck says: ""It's been absolutely grim. It has been a toxic pressure cooker, there has been abuse flying around left, right and centre. No one has crowned themselves with any glory. ""Whilst I am absolutely devastated that we've lost this general election, I hope we can start moving forward, start behaving like grown ups and actually get Parliament back to where it should be - a debating chamber where people work for the benefit of our country."" BBC News Channel Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson, whose party voted against the EU Withdrawal Bill, says the PM must live up to his claim to be leading a One Nation government and his pledge to treat all parts of the UK equally when it comes to Brexit. He told the BBC the UK had a stronger hand as it entered the second phase of the Brexit talks as there was no risk of Mr Johnson being ""undermined"" by MPs. ""We will be saying to the government 'use your negotiating position to try and undo some of the damaging impact of the withdrawal agreement'. ""If there was a no-tariff, no-quota agreement with the EU, then many of the checks that would be required across the Irish Sea would no longer exist."" Boris Johnson's director of communications, Lee Cain, is among the best-paid advisers in Downing Street, according to new government figures. He is one of three special advisers paid between Â£140,000 and Â£145,000. The others are Sir Edward Lister, the PM's chief of staff, and Munira Mirza, the head of No 10 Policy Unit. Dominic Cummings (pictured), the architect of the PM's election strategy who is regarded as the most influential special adviser in Downing Street, is on slightly less, receiving between Â£95,000 and Â£99,000. The PM's Europe adviser David Frost is taking home between Â£125,000 and Â£129,000. As of last month, there were 108 special advisers working across government, the vast majority of them earning more than Â£60,000. The total pay bill rose from Â£6.6m in 2017-8 to Â£7.1m in 2018-9.  Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck went against her party by voting in favour of Boris Johnson's Brexit bill, saying she had promised her constituents she would ""always do my best to try and get us to leave the EU with a deal"". She also defied the whip by voting for the schedule for the bill, telling BBC News: ""Last time, I went against the timetable, then Boris Johnson called a general election and it was the worst general election in living memory. ""He has a massive mandate now. To resist that on the back of losing 52 Leave Labour seats... it just doesn't send the right message that we have learnt our lesson here."" Ms Lewell-Buck says she has ""always tried to be loyal to the party"", but they made ""the wrong call"" going against the bill. ""I think off the back of losing so badly in the general election to then have the first vote in Parliament on the issue we lost over to say let's continue to keep doing what we have done historically was the wrong call,"" she adds.

We now have a full breakdown of the result of the vote. Seven out of the eight Democratic Unionist MPs opposed the bill, which they say will create a border down the Irish Sea, while one appears not to have voted. All 11 Lib Dem MPs voted against, as did Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. The vast majority of SNP members of Parliament, 45 in total, voted against. Labour MPs Sarah Champion, Emma Lewell-Buck, Jon Cruddas, Rosie Cooper, Grahame Morris and Toby Perkins all voted with the government. BBC News Labour's Tony Lloyd says the government has a mandate for delivering Brexit but it does not have a mandate for pushing through a ""bad Brexit deal"". The shadow Scottish Secretary urges the PM to reconsider his decision to rule out any further time for talks on a trade deal with the EU if an agreement is not reached by the end of 2020. Locking the UK into such a tight timetable is ""foolish"", he tells the BBC. He urges Mr Johnson to be more statesmanlike, saying the PM has a habit of getting by through ""flashy rhetoric or a quick joke"" and he needs to ""move on"" from that kind of style to govern in the interests of the whole of the UK.

BBC News Tory MP Mark Francois welcomes the support of a handful of Labour MPs who he says appear to have ""got the message"". He tells the BBC that the outcome of the vote was ""emphatic"" and ""tremendous"", adding that the Commons had ""obeyed the instruction"" of the people. Looking forward, he says aspects of the next phase of Brexit trade talks could be ""crunchy"" but a deal with the EU can be concluded next year. He insists any extension to the transition period beyond 2020 ""will not be needed"" and the European Research Group of MPs, of which he is a leading member, won't back one. ""There is more than enough time to negotiate the details,"" he adds.  We have now got the breakdown of the votes in favour of Boris Johnson's Brexit bill. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 353 of them came from Tories. But six Labour MPs voted for the plan too:  A further 32 Labour MPs abstained in the vote - despite Jeremy Corbyn telling his party to vote against it. They include three shadow cabinet members: MPs have voted in favour of Boris Johnson's EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill and the schedule to see it through Parliemnt. So what happens next? After the end of business today, MPs will go on recess until Tuesday, 7 January. As soon as they are back, they will enter the Committee stage of the bill for two days (or 16 hours of debate), where they will scrutinise the legislation and debate any amendments that have been tabled. The final stage of the bill in the Commons will then take place on Thursday, 9 January, before it heads to the Lords for approval. Only then can it be made into law - but if it is all agreed, that would be far ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 January. Finally, it will be sent to the European Parliament for ratification.

"The Welsh Government wants ""zero waste"" by 2050 Repair cafes, apps for selling clothes, and treatment facilities for hard-to-recycle items like nappies are some of the proposals in a new Welsh Government strategy on reducing waste. The goal is to ensure no waste is sent to landfill or incinerators by 2050. They are also considering a ban on disposable cups in sports stadiums. Wales is already third in global league tables for household recycling and First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was now ""the norm"". ""Over the next decade we need to go beyond recycling to make a circular economy a reality,"" he said. Items like mattresses are currently not widely recycled Wales' household recycling rate has grown from 5.2% in 1998-99 to 60.7% in 2018-19, well ahead of the rest of the UK. The ambition is to reach 100% by 2050 - meaning no waste at all is sent to landfill or incinerators. The Welsh Government said it would develop more plants that can treat materials which are currently not widely recycled - including mattresses and nappies. Why do we recycle in different ways? Forget the Wombles - meet the litter champs Among its plans are to pay for this by bringing forward so-called ""extended producer responsibility"" rules - which make manufacturers more accountable for disposing of their products and packaging, and a deposit return scheme for drinks containers. It also wants to make non-domestic premises separate recyclable materials for collection. Ellen Potts runs Greenstream Flooring which ""upcycles"" old carpets - re-using materials is viewed as key to a ""circular economy"" Moving to a more ""circular economy"" - where resources are kept in use and not disposed of - means radically cutting down how much we throw away. The Welsh Government wants to encourage the use of apps to collect surplus food or swap and sell clothes, and ""repair cafes"" where people can take products to be fixed. It wants to halve avoidable food waste by 2025 and support the re-use and repair sectors to grow. Climate emergency: What are Welsh businesses doing? What does the climate emergency mean for how we live? Public sector organisations will be forced to prioritise the use of re-used materials and ""remanufactured"" items - meaning rebuilt or restored - and will be asked to justify any purchases that are not recycled or recyclable. They will also be asked to donate valuable and useful surplus equipment. House-building programmes supported by the Welsh Government will be asked to use only sustainable and low carbon materials in construction. Stopping waste being exported overseas is also proposed. Ministers want to phase out single-use plastics Ministers want Wales to become the first country to send no plastic to landfill. It proposes phasing out single-use plastics with bans and restrictions on several products. Reusable cups cannot be refilled on Irish train over safety fears Plastic straws, stirrers and polystyrene cups face Welsh ban Biodegradable plastic from renewable sources will be used where it is still needed, for example in medical settings. It also wants to increase the range of plastic material that can be recycled and develop more plants to process it. Viridor incinerator in Cardiff Bay burns black bag waste from five councils in south east Wales Legislation banning key recyclable material from being sent to landfill or incinerators is proposed. Ministers say they will also work with the UK government to explore the idea of an incinerator tax. Waste incineration is hotly debated at the moment, with several campaigns against proposed plants across Wales. Earlier this year, the chairs of both the assembly's environment and health committees told BBC Wales they believed the government should ban them, over concerns about air pollution and carbon emissions. First look inside Cardiff's Viridor incinerator Waste: Landfill a 'better option' than burning, says AM A public consultation on the proposals will run until April, with events set to be held across Wales to seek people's views.  The final strategy will be published later next year. Hannah Blythyn, deputy minister for housing and local government - in charge of recycling - said the Welsh Government wanted views on ""any new ideas or aspects you feel are missing"". She also announced an additional Â£6.5m for local authorities and other publicly funded bodies alongside the consultation. Andrew RT Davies, Conservative shadow minister for environment and rural affairs, said of the goal for no waste to be sent to landfill or incinerators by 2050: ""I think that's what we've got to be chasing."" He told BBC Radio Wales that climate change was happening ""without a shadow of a doubt"". ""Why throw away something that has a use to it?"" he added. Ben Francis, Wales policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, said the debate on how to tackle environmental issues was ""one of the most pressing issues of our time"". He said its priority was ""to help businesses look at ways to become more environmentally responsible, whilst pushing the Welsh Government to provide meaningful support for those businesses, whilst understanding the landscape in which they are operating"". ""We look forward to responding in detail to the consultation on a circular economy strategy over the next few months,"" he added. Olivia Knight, chair of trade body Sharing Economy UK, said it ""supports the scale and ambition of the Welsh Government to achieve zero landfill within the next 30 years and to actively encourage more people to engage in the sharing economy"". But she added: ""If we genuinely want to enable people to share more and waste less then we need to see this ambition matched with support for businesses already operating in the sharing economy and those companies wanting to develop circular economy practices within their business model and supply chain. ""We need incentives and rewards for companies making the transition that we need to see."" A spokeswoman for South Wales Chamber of Commerce said it has seen ""a growing interest across the private sector and businesses in Wales in recycling and reduction of carbon footprint"". She added: ""Many procurement contracts in supply chains are now specifying that businesses need to demonstrate their move towards a more sustainable approach to business.""

"The Glen Sannox is one of two ferries being built to serve CalMac routes Two CalMac ferries at the centre of a political storm over cost and delays should be scrapped and work started again, it has been claimed. Industrialist Jim McColl has spoken out against the Scottish government's plan to spend at least Â£110m on the part-finished ferries. He was in charge of the shipyard where the ferries were being built before it collapsed and was nationalised. Management of the yard has been sharply criticised ina new government report,external. The ferries were being constructed at Ferguson shipyard in Inverclyde to replace old ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes operated by CalMac. They are more than a year overdue. Costs double on delayed CalMac ferry contract Shipyard formally taken into public ownership The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift In an exclusive interview with BBC Scotland, the former chairman of Ferguson Marine Engineering said he was taking legal advice on whether the Scottish government's attack on his management was defamatory. He said the report into the ferry fiasco, drawn up for the government after it took ownership of the yard, was ""outrageous"" and a ""snow job"" to cover up the role of the government agency involved in procuring the ferries. Mr McColl said Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited, which required numerous design changes, was the key reason why the budget and timetable went out of control. Jim McColl is taking legal advice on the Scottish government's report The ship design uses a novel hybrid power system, using marine diesel for getting in and out of ports, and liquefied natural gas while at sea. The need for new safety certificates also caused delays. Mr McColl challenged the Scottish government's plan to continue building the two ships, after months of neglect. One has been moored at the quayside and the other sits on the slipway at the Port Glasgow yard. That would effectively write off more than Â£80m already spent on them, while more than Â£45m in loans from the Scottish government have been written off. The businessman said some materials could be used in new hulls, but that it would be better value for taxpayer money to start building again, to a simpler design. He suggested three smaller ferries could be built for the same original Â£97m budget. The report published this week was strongly critical of the management of Ferguson Marine while Mr McColl was chairman, saying it lacked project and financial controls. Internal controls were reported as poor or non-existent.  It said that there had been a ""major departure from the specification"" and as a result of defects, most of the pipe work would have to be removed from the engine rooms. The attack on Mr McColl's competence is despite his success in running engineering companies around the world. He gets closely involved in management and is reckoned to be a billionaire. His advice was sought by the Scottish government as a member of its Council of Economic Advisers. The report went on to estimate a Â£13m bill for remedial work on the hulls taking seven months, including removal of rust and a dry dock inspection of the first ferry's hull. There would then be a Â£95m bill to complete the vessels. Ferguson Marine in Inverclyde was nationalised by the Scottish government in August Whereas the ships were due to be delivered in summer 2018, the first one, the Glen Sannox, is now scheduled for delivery by December 2021 and the second, known as Vessel 802, by October 2022. But that is with only an 80% probability. There is, in addition, a warning of ""significant challenges"" to get the yard working effectively, to improve productivity, recruiting the right people and it flags up a problem in ""controlling and managing"" the sub-contracted design firm. Mr McColl, who accurately predicted the doubling in cost, said: ""It'll become more than that and the vessels will take longer than they're saying. ""You'd be better building from scratch and to a design that's more suited to what's needed. They could probably build three smaller vessels for less than Â£100m and it would give them more flexibility."" Facing criticisms for his own management, Mr McColl drew attention to the reports commissioned by Scottish ministers from an expert adviser over the past two years, which he says were ""damning"" of the role of the government-owned procuring company, CMAL. Luke van Beek was appointed by economy secretary Derek Mackay to report back on the state of the project, with advice on whether government loans should be released. In a private report to ministers released under Freedom of Information law in October, Mr van Beek said that the breakdown of relations between the client and the shipbuilder should be addressed through mediation, andhe advised against nationalisation of the yard. Mr McColl said the minister was ""trying to put people off the scent"". Criticism of his management team was ""outrageous and unacceptable - the team selected were some of the best in the UK, and head and shoulders above those in there now. I've asked if we can sue them for defamation of character"". He added: ""There needs to be an inquiry. The way they've handled this is incompetent"". The Holyrood committee for the rural economy and connectivity is to carry out an inquiry into ferry procurement, looking into the contract that has gone so badly wrong and at the implications for future ferry services. The committee convener, Conservative MSP Edward Mountain, said the aim would be to avoid mistakes being made with future orders. He said: ""These developments clearly have important implications, not only for the completion of the two vessels but also for future plans for the replacement and refurbishment of vessels to meet the ongoing needs of the Clyde and Hebrides ferries network more generally. ""The committee wants to find out not only what has gone wrong and how things will be put right but how these problems can be avoided in the future."" ""We need to make sure that the relevant lessons from this saga are learned for the procurement and construction of new ferries in future."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Our efforts saved Ferguson Marine from closure, saving over 300 jobs, ensured that the two vessels under construction will be completed, and secured a future for the yard. ""Scottish ministers are committed to transparency on these issues. We have kept parliament informed of progress and have proactively published information on our website. ""We welcome the opportunity to respond to any additional inquiries that the committee might wish to raise.""

"Fire service chiefs say crews are bearing the brunt of ""poorly maintained"" alarm systems Faulty alarm systems and burnt food led to more than 75,000 firefighter call-outs in England in one year. Five out of six English fire services say they do not send crews out to every automatic alarm because ""the vast majority"" are false. The National Fire Chiefs' Council (NFCC) said repeated false alarms put the public in danger. Inspectors have also said some services,including London Fire Brigade, attend too many false alarms. The majority of false alarms calls are caused by automatic systems being set off by things such as burnt toast, steam, aerosols or cigarette smoke or because the system is badly maintained. Home Office figures show there were more than 150,000 fire service call-outs in England in the year ending March 2019 that were ""due to apparatus"" - such as automatic fire alarms - about two-thirds of all false alarms. Of those, 40,813 were caused by ""faulty equipment"" and 34,582 were listed as ""cooking/burned toast"". These have been the top two causes of false alarms among English fire services for the past eight years. Across England fire services went to more than 34,000 false alarms triggered by burnt toast or cooking in 2018-19 Just over a third of London's 104,000 call-outs in 2018-19 were false alarms triggered by automatic systems. The most common cause of an automatic false alarm was ""cooking or burnt toast"" - on 9,145 occasions. A brigade spokesman said the service had set up a ""false alarm reduction team"" and filters out calls it can ""safely not attend"" while educating those responsible for fire safety in buildings. Paul McCourt, lead officer for unwanted fire signals at the NFCC, said: ""False alarms can make people complacent. ""They also increase the road risk to the public from the crew attending under blue lights."" He said fire and rescue services ""should not be bearing the cost of attending commercial properties with poorly maintained alarms"". Afnan Gohar thought the fire at The Cube was a false alarm When Afnan Gohar heard the fire alarm at her student accommodation, she thought it had gone off by accident. Yet minutes after the alarm started sounding on 15 November, another student banged on doors to say there was a fire. The 21-year-old, who studies psychology at Bolton University, said: ""After that, we just ran."" Two people were hurt and about 100 residentshad to evacuate The Cube in the blaze,which was tackled by up to 200 firefighters. Students are still not able to re-enter parts of the privately-owned accommodation block as an investigation into the blaze is ongoing. Urban Student Life, which runs the site for owners Idealsite, said the activation of alarms on the evening of the fire ""successfully triggered the rapid response of the fire services"". A spokesman said the alarm system in the building complied with fire regulations and was ""regularly serviced and maintained"" by an accredited company. The company said all false alarms at the building were recorded, and it was having a ""full review"" of its activity logs. 200 firefighters tackled the blaze at The Cube When a fire alarm goes off in a building, most fire services contact someone responsible for fire safety at the property before dispatching firefighters. Humberside Fire and Rescue Service does not respond where ""the alarm is sounding in non-sleeping premises during normal working hours, unless backed up by a call confirming that there is a fire"". A spokesman said fire crews would ""always attend confirmed fires"" and ""high risk"" properties but the service was facing ""an extremely challenging financial situation"" and it was ""hard to justify"" sending fire engines to all automatic alarms. He said about 86% had been found to be false. The service recovers costs by charging a minimum of Â£346 to ""frequent false alarm callers"". Price for Humberside Fire and Rescue Service crew attendance per hour Â£346.25Minimum callout charge Â£37for a crew manager Â£73.25admin costs Â£102for three firefighters Â£134for a fire engine Â£276extra for an aerial ladder platform The seven services that do respond to every automatic alarm are Buckinghamshire, Dorset and Wiltshire, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester, Isle of Wight, Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire. A spokesman for Buckinghamshire said: ""The vast majority of these automatic fire alarm activations turn out to be false alarms, but of course when they are the real thing, prompt attendance and quick intervention can save a business from suffering considerable damage from which it might not recover."" HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said London Fire Brigade ""could do much more to reduce the burden of false alarms"". Its report on Greater Manchester for 2018-19 said the service had ""made some changes by sending only one fire engine initially"" but ""it needs to do more to reduce this burden"".

"Andrew Bailey has been appointed as the next governor of the Bank of England. Mr Bailey, aged 60, is currently chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog. He will become the 121st governor of the Bank of England on 16 March, taking over from Mark Carney, and will serve a full eight-year term. The search for the new governor began in April and Mr Bailey, who spent more than 30 years at the Bank, was seen as an early favourite for the job. Andrew Bailey's 'slow and steady' rise to power What does the Bank of England governor do? Faisal Islam: Andrew Bailey's brush with animal spirits However, the FCA has faced criticism in recent months over its regulatory scrutiny of the flagship fund of one of the UK's best known money managers, Neil Woodford. The fund was suspended in June and eventually closed, with investors expected to lose large sums of money. In addition, the FCA's report into Royal Bank of Scotland's treatment of small business by its controversial restructuring division was called a ""whitewash"" after itrecommended taking no further action against the bank. It sets the official interest rate, which determines the cost of borrowing money It supervises the financial system, seeking to ensure it is stable and no banks are running out of cash It acts as the government's bank and a lender of last resort in times of financial difficulty It issues the UK's banknotes (coins are issued by the Royal Mint) It stores the UK's gold reserves, as well as those of other central banks Announcing the decision to appoint Mr Bailey, Chancellor Sajid Javid said he was ""the stand-out candidate in a competitive field"". ""He is the right person to lead the Bank as we forge a new future outside the EU and level-up opportunity across the country,"" he added. This video can not be played What does the Bank of England governor do? The BBC's Dharshini David explains Accepting the role, Mr Bailey said it was ""a tremendous honour"" to be chosen. ""The Bank has a very important job and, as governor, I will continue the work that Mark Carney has done to ensure that it has the public interest at the heart of everything it does."" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith congratulated Mr Bailey, saying:  ""His strong experience, both in Threadneedle Street and at the Financial Conduct Authority, means he is particularly well placed to steer the British economy through the new course it will take after Brexit and through challenging global economic times."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell was critical of the appointment, saying: ""As an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record at the FCA, Andrew Bailey will need to demonstrate early that he appreciates the need to address the deep structural problems of our economy and, like Mark Carney, understands the climate change threat."" Mr Carney had been due to step down on 31 January, but has now agreed to stay on until 15 March in order to provide for a smooth transition. Mr Carney described Mr Bailey as ""an extraordinary public servant"". ""Andrew brings unparalleled experience, built over three decades of dedicated service across all policy areas of the Bank,"" he said. Minouche Shafik was seen as an early favourite to succeed Mark Carney The decision means hopes that the Bank could have been led by a female governor for the first time in its history have been dashed. Minouche Shafik, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee,had been hotly tipped for the role. Mr Bailey has spent almost the entirety of his career at the Bank of England, which he joined in 1985. He has held a number of roles including chief cashier, which meant that his signature appeared on all bank notes issued by the Bank of England. Mr Bailey was chief cashier during the financial crisis when,he recalled in an interview,external: ""The [RBS] treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attack... and he looked at me and said: 'I need Â£25bn today, can you do it?'. I said: 'Yes, I can do that'."" Mr Bailey was also a deputy governor and head of the Bank's prudential regulation division, before joining the FCA as its chief executive in 2016. Andrew Bailey was the early frontrunner for one of the most powerful positions in the UK. However, his time as head of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, was peppered with a number of high-profile controversies - including its handling of complaints intoRBS's treatment of small businesses in the aftermath of the financial crisis- which many thought might have harmed his chances for the top job. He is highly thought of by colleagues and civil servants. Former Permanent Treasury Secretary Lord McPherson described him as the most able and competent Bank of England official he had ever worked with, adding that while Bailey would not make waves for the government he had the backbone to stand up to it. Mr Bailey, who will be paid Â£495,000 a year, is taking over at a fraught time for the Bank of England. It emerged this week that an audio feed of sensitive market information from the Bank had been leaked to fund managers. The Bank admitted one of its suppliers had ""misused"" the feed which gave traders early access to information that could potentially generate large sums of money. The matter has been referred to the FCA, which Mr Bailey currently leads. The City watchdog said it was ""looking at the issue"". PA reported that the prime minister's official spokesman, when asked whether Brexit was a factor in Mr Bailey's appointment, said: ""The way it works is the chancellor recommends candidates to the PM, the PM then advises the Queen."" When pressed on the issue, the spokesman added:  ""I just went through the process and the prime minister thinks he will do an excellent job.""

"Adolfo Martinez, 30, admitted to his crimes in a jailhouse interview A US judge has handed down a sentence of at least 15 years to a man who stole an LGBT pride flag from a church and burned it outside a strip club. Adolfo Martinez, 30, admitted to the media that he took the flag from Ames United Church of Christ due to his animosity towards homosexuals. He was found guilty last month of hate crime harassment, reckless use of fire and being a habitual offender. The incident occurred around midnight on 11 June in downtown Ames, Iowa. Police say the crime spree began at Dangerous Curves, a strip club, when police were called because a man was making threats. By the time they arrived, he had already been kicked out by bar staff. After leaving the club, Martinez then travelled to the church and ripped down its flag. He then returned to the strip club where he used lighter fluid to burn the flag in the street. He also threatened to burn down the bar. He was arrested later that day, and told local media in a jail house interview that he was ""guilty as charged"". ""It was an honour to do that. It's a blessing from the Lord,"" he said, explaining that he did it because he ""opposed homosexuality"". ""I burned down their pride, plain and simple,"" he told KCCI-TV. The interview was entered into the trial as evidence against him. Church pastor Eileen Gebbie, who identifies as gay woman, says she agrees that Martinez' actions were motivated by hatred. ""I often experienced Ames as not being as progressive as many people believe it is, and there still is a very large closeted queer community here,"" she told the Des Moines Register when he was convicted in November. ""But 12 people that I don't know, who have no investment in me or this congregation, said this man committed a crime, and it was a crime borne of bigotry and hatred."" Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds said Martinez was the first person in the county's history to be convicted of a hate crime. ""The hard reality is there are people who target individuals and commit crimes against individuals because of their race, gender, sexual orientation,"" she told the Ames Tribune. ""And when that happens it's so important that as a society we stand up and people have severe consequences for those actions.""

"This video can not be played Queen's Speech: Brexit, the NHS and what happened next Boris Johnson has claimed his programme for government is the ""most radical Queen's Speech in a generation"". The prime minister said planned new laws to toughen up criminal justice and increase NHS spending would deliver on the ""people's priorities"". But his main priority is the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said many of the PM's promises mimicked the ""language of Labour policy but without the substance"". ""They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, even when it's a very pale imitation, but I fear those swayed by the prime minister's promises will be sorely disappointed,"" added the Labour leader. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the PM of ""denying [Scotland] the right to choose our own future"" referring to the SNP's desire for another referendum on Scottish independence. ""Why did democracy stop in the prime minister's world with the independence referendum in 2014?"" he asked. But Boris Johnson said he felt a ""colossal sense of obligation"" to the voters. He told MPs that ""a new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach"" adding that the government would ""work flat out to deliver it"". LIVE: Reaction to State Opening of Parliament What does the Queen's Speech mean for you? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Addressing Parliament for the second time in less than three months, the Queen said the priority for her government was to deliver Brexit on 31 January, but ministers also had an ""ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people's priorities"". Of the more than 30 bills announced in the Queen's Speech, seven were on Brexit. This video can not be played Queen's speech outlines plans for Brexit and NHS It comes as the government says it will close its Department for Exiting the European Union on 31 January. The seven bills announced that were devoted to Brexit cover legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law. The first to be put to Parliament will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that enables the UK to leave the EU - on Friday before the Christmas recess. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn walked to the House of Lords together in silence Following last week's general election, the prime minister has a Commons majority of 80 - the largest enjoyed by a Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? The prime minister's increased parliamentary authority and command of his party means it is likely to pass without major changes in the New Year in time to meet the 31 January deadline. In another move welcomed by Tory MPs, the bill willalso enable more British judgesto depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court. On the NHS, the government says it will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service's funding, with an extra Â£33.9bn per year provided by 2023/24. The PM's commitment on the NHS amounts to a 3.4% year-on-year increase in expenditure, a significant increase on what the NHS received during the five year Tory-Lib Dem coalition government as well as under his predecessors David Cameron and Theresa May. But it is significantly lower than the 6% average annual increases seen under Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And when adjusted for inflation, and factoring in the increased cost of equipment, medicines and staff pay, it could actually be worth Â£20.5bn by 2023-4. The Tories' environmental plans analysed Do the Tories' broadband plans add up? Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Labour's health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said: ""If the Conservatives' plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick, we would urge them to pledge the extra Â£6bn a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they've imposed for a decade."" There was also a commitment announced for ministers to seek cross-party consensus for long-term reform of the social care system and the government will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. This government wants to try to give the appearance that they are completely new, completely different, even though the Conservatives have been in power for nearly a full decade. That is quite a political stunt to try to pull off. But it's clear also that Boris Johnson came to the Commons today to present a vision that he hopes can straddle left and right, or what has traditionally been seen as Labour's place in politics and the Conservatives' place in politics. That is what the results of the general election gave him as an opportunity. And the challenge for Boris Johnson is not just to hold onto that for five years, but show to people who voted Tory for the first time that the party was worth the risk - that their vote was the right decision. The test will be enormous - whether or not all that rhetoric actually matches up to the reality of the actions and decisions that this government will make. Mr Johnson has had a reputation for years of being hungry with ambition to get to this place. We're going to find out in the next months and years whether he's hungry to take the decisions that actually will cement his place in history. Plans for longer sentences for violent criminals, were also unveiled, as well as the establishment of a Royal Commission to improve the ""efficiency and effectiveness"" of the criminal justice process and there are bills that will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms.

"The government has laid out its legislative plans for the year in the Queen's Speech. From Brexit to health, trade to the environment, it gives us a sense of what politicians will be debating over the next few months. Our experts analyse what was, and wasn't, said and what it all means for you. As well as the withdrawal agreement bill, which will pave the way for the UK's departure from the EU on 31 January, the government will have to pass a series of bills next year in other policy areas as a direct result of Brexit. Some of them will be major undertakings: a new way to run agriculture, to replace membership of the Common Agricultural Policy a fisheries bill to replace the Common Fisheries policy and turn the UK into an independent coastal state a new immigration system which will treat EU citizens the same as people from elsewhere in the world, once the policy of free movement comes to an end. There will also be bills covering trade, financial services and cross-border legal disputes. But passing legislation will be the easy bit - implementing it all will be the big challenge. New systems will need to be up and running by the end of the post-Brexit transition period in just over a year's time, new staff will have to be trained, and businesses and consumers will have to be ready too. Civil servants will be under enormous pressure to deliver everything that is required under the tight timetable the government has imposed. The Ministry of Justice and the Home Office will be among the busiest departments under Boris Johnson's new administration - a reflection of the importance he attaches to law and order. A number of measures, including those relating to domestic abuse, victims and policing, have been put forward before, but there are also new proposals on sentencing which could lead to a significant increase in the prison population among those jailed for violence, sexual assault and terrorism. Plans to extend the use of ""whole-life"" tariffs, where offenders can be ordered to spend the rest of their lives behind bars, are vaguely worded, indicating ministers are open-minded about the range of crimes for which offenders should be locked away for ever. The idea which has the most potential to alter the criminal justice landscape is for a Royal Commission to examine the process from arrest to sentence. The last time there was such a review was in 1991. The terms of reference and the chairperson have not been announced - they will be key to understanding which destination the government wishes the commission to steer towards.  Interesting times lie ahead. Environmentalists have welcomed many of the provisions of the new environment bill. But they point out that ministers are still committed to North Sea drilling, building roads that experts say will generate traffic, and blocking onshore wind power. They have stayed silent on aviation expansion, and have imposed a moratorium on fracking, rather than the permanent ban which some in the north of England were demanding. Critics point out that the planned new green watchdog won't have the sort of powers to take legal action that prompted the UK to improve air quality under the threat of fines. Action on business rates was billed as a measure to ""keep town centres vibrant"" - but what's on the table for now will only bring limited relief. Business groups have long been calling for a revamp of the rates system, which raises more than Â£31bn for the government each year. A quarter of that burden falls on retailers, who pay regardless of profit, says the British Retail Consortium. So a one-year extension of a discount for some retailers and an extension of the scheme to pubs, music venues and cinemas - with a saving of Â£320m - may feel tokenistic. This is especially so as thecancellation of planned corporation tax rate cutsmeans that business across the country will have to fork out Â£3.2bn more in bills next year than envisaged prior to the election, rising to more than Â£6bn by 2024. For greater relief, retailers will be looking ahead to the Budget and the much-touted overhaul of the rates system. However, it is questionable whether the government will be able to afford to relinquish much of what's become a key revenue raiser. Meanwhile, both business and the public sector will have to grapple with the government's plans to raise the national living wage to two-thirds median earnings by 2025 (projected to be Â£10.50), and lower the eligible age for the main rate. While the plans would in theory benefit more than four million people, alleviating in-work poverty, they have been given a cautious welcome by business groups and low-pay campaigners alike, who urge careful implementation and monitoring. While the increase in minimum wage to date hasn't had an impact on employment growth, these plans go into uncharted waters - at a time when there are already signs that the hiring spree of recent years is levelling off. Schools in England are promised more funding, rising by Â£7.1bn by 2022-23, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says will reverse the budget cuts of the austerity years. Minimum levels of per pupil spending are increasing to Â£5,000 in secondary and Â£3,750 in primary schools, and then Â£4,000 in the following year. Most schools already get significantly more than this - for instance, the average for secondary schools is currently about Â£6,200 per year and Â£5,000 in primary. Only about one in five primary schools and a third of secondary schools are below the proposed new minimum, with the biggest number of these in the South East and South West and the lowest number in London. But the overall increase should mean an uplift across schools which have been complaining loudly about funding shortages. So far there is no decision on whether to cut university tuition fees, other than a promise of ""better value"" for students. The future of the NHS in England has been put front and centre of the Queen's Speech. This is understandable given that, behind the scenes, ministers and advisers are saying there has to be an improvement in English NHS performance for the government to keep hold of the voters that backed it at the election. Ministers are making big play of the extra funding, but experts within the health service have warned even with the above-inflation sums going in, it will take years to turn the NHS around and get it back to where it was a decade ago in terms of waiting times and performance - perhaps even a decade. The idea of enshrining into law the multi-year NHS funding settlement sounds more significant than it actually is. Ministers want to put a law in place compelling them to keep to their promises, but it makes little difference in reality. There are also measures promising to make it easier to recruit doctors from abroad, and the government knows it faces a tough task filling the vacancy rates and growing the workforce. There is little detail about social care - despite Boris Johnson's promise to fix the ""crisis"" in the system in his first speech as PM. Instead, he wants to seek cross-party agreement on the way forward - something that is unlikely to happen quickly, given both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been plunged into leadership races following the election. Read more from Nick here. There are no big surprises in the busy environmental agenda outlined by the government. The headline commitment to reduce the UK's carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050 is there, as are the key elements of an environment bill and new measures on animal welfare. Left unspecified, so far, are the details of many of the initiatives. A plan to increase the power of local authorities to tackle air pollution makes no mention of whether there's new money to go with it (which is what many councils have been clamouring for). Campaign promises of new cash for flood defences, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency in homes, schools and hospitals are repeated - a key test will be how they are delivered. Opposition parties are already saying the government is failing to take the radical action needed. For ministers, here's a moment of intense scrutiny on the horizon - COP26, the massive UN climate summit planned for Glasgow next November, when the eyes of the world will judge the sincerity of the UK's green ambitions. The government has announced the first Royal Commission on the criminal justice system since 1991. The last one met 44 times, took evidence from more than 600 organisations and groups, commissioned 22 research studies and lasted for more than two years. It was part of a response to the miscarriage of justice cases, which included the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six and led to the establishment of Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates miscarriage of justice cases. These are different times. Many will welcome the new commission addressing the problems of what is widely seen to be a criminal justice system under extreme stress, if not in crisis. Much of the blame for that is put down to swingeing cuts to the police and Crown Prosecution Service, as well as modern-day challenges such as getting on top of vast amounts of digital evidence obtained from mobile devices. However, there is real fear that the commission could be a way of kicking immediate and solvable problems into the long grass and delaying across the board investment, which many lawyers see as critical to improving a complex system in its entirety.

"An architect's visualisation of Heathrow's planned expansion Heathrow has said its project to build a third runway has been delayed by ""at least 12 months"" after the aviation regulator rejected its spending plans. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has refused Heathrow's request to lift spending from Â£650m to Â£2.4bn before it even gets planning consent. The CAA is concerned passengers will end up shouldering the cost if Heathrow does not win permission to expand. The airport now expects to complete a third runway between 2028 and 2029. In a consultation published by the CAA, it said ""the best approach in the interest of consumers"" is to limit certain early construction costs to Â£1.6bn. The consultation also said an assessment by an independent fund surveyor of Heathrow's plan to open a new runway by 2026 was an ""aggressive schedule"" which would require ""maximum activity"" even before the airport knew whether it had been granted a development consent order. What is the Heathrow expansion masterplan? Why are people arguing over Heathrow? Paul Smith, group director of consumers and markets at the CAA, said: ""We believe that more runway capacity at Heathrow will benefit air passengers and cargo owners. ""Its timely delivery is required to prevent future consumers experiencing higher airfares, reduced choice and lower service quality. ""However, we have also been clear that timeliness is not the only factor that is important to consumers. ""Passengers cannot be expected to bear the risk of Heathrow Airport Limited spending too much in the early phases of development, should planning permission not be granted."" The CAA has approved Heathrow's proposal to increase its spending on planning costs from Â£265m to Â£500m. Heathrow said the CAA's announcement was ""an important milestone"" in the expansion of the airport. A spokesman added: ""We will now review the detail to ensure it will unlock the initial Â£1.5bn to Â£2bn of private investment over the next two years at no cost to the taxpayer. ""While this is a step forward, the CAA has delayed the project timetable by at least 12 months. We now expect to complete the third runway between early 2028 and late 2029.""

"Adolfo Martinez, 30, admitted to his crimes in a jailhouse interview A US judge has handed down a sentence of at least 15 years to a man who stole an LGBT pride flag from a church and burned it outside a strip club. Adolfo Martinez, 30, admitted to the media that he took the flag from Ames United Church of Christ due to his animosity towards homosexuals. He was found guilty last month of hate crime harassment, reckless use of fire and being a habitual offender. The incident occurred around midnight on 11 June in downtown Ames, Iowa. Police say the crime spree began at Dangerous Curves, a strip club, when police were called because a man was making threats. By the time they arrived, he had already been kicked out by bar staff. After leaving the club, Martinez then travelled to the church and ripped down its flag. He then returned to the strip club where he used lighter fluid to burn the flag in the street. He also threatened to burn down the bar. He was arrested later that day, and told local media in a jail house interview that he was ""guilty as charged"". ""It was an honour to do that. It's a blessing from the Lord,"" he said, explaining that he did it because he ""opposed homosexuality"". ""I burned down their pride, plain and simple,"" he told KCCI-TV. The interview was entered into the trial as evidence against him. Church pastor Eileen Gebbie, who identifies as gay woman, says she agrees that Martinez' actions were motivated by hatred. ""I often experienced Ames as not being as progressive as many people believe it is, and there still is a very large closeted queer community here,"" she told the Des Moines Register when he was convicted in November. ""But 12 people that I don't know, who have no investment in me or this congregation, said this man committed a crime, and it was a crime borne of bigotry and hatred."" Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds said Martinez was the first person in the county's history to be convicted of a hate crime. ""The hard reality is there are people who target individuals and commit crimes against individuals because of their race, gender, sexual orientation,"" she told the Ames Tribune. ""And when that happens it's so important that as a society we stand up and people have severe consequences for those actions.""
