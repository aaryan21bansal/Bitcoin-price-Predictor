"It was a quiet Friday morning last July when pandemonium broke out at a school in north-east Malaysia. Siti Nurannisaa, a 17-year-old student, was at the centre of the chaos. This is her account of what happened. The assembly bells rang. I was at my desk feeling sleepy when I felt a hard, sharp tap on my shoulder. I turned round to see who it was and the room went dark. Fear overtook me. I felt a sharp, splitting pain in my back and my head started spinning. I fell to the floor. Before I knew it, I was looking into the 'otherworld'. Scenes of blood, gore and violence. The scariest thing I saw was a face of pure evil. It was haunting me, I couldn't escape. I opened my mouth and tried to scream but no sound came out. I passed out. Siti's outburst triggered a powerful chain reaction that ripped through the school. Within minutes students in other classrooms started screaming, their frantic cries ricocheting through the halls. One girl fainted after claiming to have seen the same ""dark figure"". Classroom doors slammed shut at the Ketereh national secondary school (SMK Ketereh) in Kelantan as panicked teachers and students barricaded themselves in. Islamic spiritual healers were called to perform mass prayer sessions. By the end of the day, 39 people were deemed to have been affected by an outbreak of ""mass hysteria"". Mass hysteria, or mass psychogenic illness, as it's also known, is the rapid spread of physical symptoms such as hyperventilation and twitching among a substantial group of people - with no plausible organic cause. ""It is a collective stress response prompting an overstimulation of the nervous system,"" says American medical sociologist and author Robert Bartholomew. ""Think of it as a software problem."" The mechanisms behind mass hysteria are often poorly understood and it is not listed in the DSM - the manual of mental disorders. But psychiatrists like Dr Simon Wessely from King's College Hospital in London view it as a ""collective behaviour"". ""The symptoms experienced are real - fainting, palpitations, headaches, nausea, shaking and even fits,"" he says. ""It is often attributed to a medical condition but for which no conventional biomedical explanation can be found."" Transmission, he adds, ""is largely due to psychological and social factors"". Outbreaks have been recorded around the world, with cases dating back as early as the Middle Ages. Incidents in Malaysia were particularly prevalent among factory workers during the 1960s. Today it largely affects children in schools and dormitories. One of many mosques in the town of Ketereh Robert Bartholomew spent decades researching the phenomenon in Malaysia. He calls the South East Asian country ""the mass hysteria capital of the world"". ""It is a deeply religious and spiritual country where many people, especially those from rural and conservative states, believe in the powers of traditional folklore and the supernatural."" But the issue of hysteria remains a sensitive one. In Malaysia, cases have involved adolescent girls from the Malay Muslim ethnic majority more than any other group. ""There's no denying that mass hysteria is an overwhelmingly female phenomenon,"" says Mr Bartholomew. ""It's the one constant in the [academic] literature."" Surrounded by lush green rice fields, the sleepy Malay village of Padang Lembek sits on the outskirts of Kelantan's capital Kota Bharu. It's a small, tight-knit community where everyone knows each other, the sort of place that would make many Malaysians reminisce about how their country used to be. There are family-run restaurants, beauty salons, a mosque and good neighbourhood schools. Siti's family at their home in Padang Lembek Siti and her family live in a modest, single-storey terrace house, easily distinguishable by its weathered red roof and green exterior. An old, sturdy motorbike she shares with her best friend Rusydiah Roslan, who lives nearby, is parked outside. ""We rode it to school on the morning I was possessed by 'spirits',"" Siti says. Like any other teenager, stress affects Siti. She says she felt it most during her final school year in 2018, when all-important examinations loomed. ""I was preparing for weeks, trying to memorise my notes but something was wrong,"" she says. ""It felt like nothing was going into my head."" The incident at school during the July study period left Siti unable to sleep or eat properly. It took her a month of rest before she returned to her - almost-regular - self. An outbreak of mass hysteria usually begins with what experts call an ""index case"", the first person to become affected. In this story, that is Siti. ""It doesn't happen overnight,"" says Robert Bartholomew. ""It starts with one child and then quickly spreads to others because of an exposure to a pressure-cooker environment of stress."" And all it takes is a major spike in anxiety in a group situation, like seeing a fellow classmate faint or have a fit - to trigger a reaction in another person. Siti compares her experiences with spirits as having her ""eyes covered"" Rusydiah Roslan will never forget seeing her best friend in that state. ""Siti was screaming uncontrollably,"" she says. ""No one knew what to do. We were afraid to even touch her."" The girls have always been close but the events of the past year have strengthened their bond. ""It helps us to talk about what happened,"" Rusydiah says. ""It helps us to move on."" From the outside, SMK Ketereh looks like any other Malaysian high school. Giant trees shade its premises and its walls have fresh coats of grey and bright yellow paint. Makcik(aunty) Zan runs a popular stall across the street selling local rice dishes. She was preparing food a year ago, on that humid July morning, when she heard screams. ""The cries were deafening,"" the elderly vendor says as she serves up dishes of grilled mackerel, yellow curry and steaming glutinous rice. The SMK Ketereh, Siti Nurannisaa's school, sits along a busy road in the Kelantan countryside She saw at least nine girls being carried out of their classrooms, kicking and screaming. She recognised some of them as regulars at her stall. ""It was a heartbreaking sight,"" she says. She later saw a witch doctor enter a small prayer room with his assistants. ""They were in there for hours,"" she recalls. ""I pity the children for what they must have seen that day."" Security at SMK Ketereh has been heightened since the July 2018 incident. ""In order to prevent outbreaks from spiralling again, we restructured our safety programme and had a change in staff,"" a senior staff member told the BBC on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Daily prayer and psychology sessions have also been introduced, he said. ""Safety comes first but we also know the importance of aftercare for our students."" It is unclear what such sessions involve or if they have been designed by mental health professionals. He would not provide further details. Experts like Robert Bartholomew strongly advocate that Malaysian students be educated about the phenomenon, given its prevalence in the country. ""They should be taught why mass hysteria happens and how it spreads,"" he says. ""It's also important they learn how to cope with stress and anxiety."" Malaysian education ministry officials have not responded to a request for comment. SMK Ketereh is one of 68 secondary schools in Kelantan. But it is far from the only one to have witnessed an outbreak. In early 2016, mass hysteria took hold across many schools in the state. ""Officials could not handle the multiple outbreaks and shut all the schools,"" said Firdaus Hassan, a local reporter. He and TV cameraman Chia Chee Lin remember a febrile atmosphere that April. ""It was mass hysteria season and cases were happening non-stop, spreading from one school to another,"" says Chia. One case in the nearby town of Pengkalan Chepaattracted significant media attention. Students and teachers were described in reports as becoming ""possessed"" after seeing a ""dark, shadowy figure"" lurking around the compound. About 100 people were affected. Graduate Siti Ain (pictured right) with her mother, who sells drinks and snacks outside the school Siti Ain, who studied at SMK Pengkalan Chepa 2, says she will remember it as being ""the most haunted school in all of Malaysia"". ""The scare lasted hours but it took months for life to return to normal,"" the now 18-year-old says. She shows us a secluded spot next to a basketball court. ""This is where it first started,"" she says, pointing to a row of tree stumps. ""My schoolmates said they saw an elderly woman standing amongst the trees. ""I couldn't see what they saw but their reactions were real."" A row of stumps, where large Angsana trees used to stand Malaysia's fascination with ghosts dates back centuries and is deep-rooted in shamanic tradition and South East Asian folk mythology. Children grow up hearing stories about dead infants calledtoyol- invoked by shamans using black magic - and other terrifying vampiric ghosts like thepontianakandpenanggalan, vengeful powerful female spirits that feed on the living. Trees and burial sites are common settings for these eerie tales. These locations stoke fears that feed into superstitious beliefs. It's hard to determine what really happened that day at Pengkalan Chapa 2 but officials wasted no time in tackling what they believed to be the source of the problem. ""We watched from our classrooms as workers came with electric saws to cut down the trees,"" Siti Ain says. ""The old trees were beautiful and it was sad to see them go but I understood why."" Like many students here, she sees what happened that day not as an outbreak of mass hysteria but as a supernatural event. In 2016 a ""mass hysteria outbreak"" was reported at this sprawling multi-storey school But this isn't a phenomenon confined to Islamic schools in deeply religious areas. Dr Azly Rahman, a US-based, Malaysian anthropologist described an episode of mass hysteria in 1976 at an elite boarding school he attended in neighbouring Kuantan city. ""All hell broke loose"" during a campus singing competition when a female student claimed to have spotted ""a smiling Buddhist monk"" on top of a nearby dormitory. ""She let out a bloodcurdling scream,"" he recalls. As more of Malaysia's forests are lost in the name of development, some believe that spirits have lost their final resting places Witch doctors were brought in to perform exorcisms on 30 affected girls. ""Their role was to mediate between the living and the dead. But it's important for society today to look to logical explanations behind such outbreaks,"" Dr Rahman says. Siti Nurannisaa and her family were given the scientific and medical language of mass hysteria to understand the events of a year ago. ""It would hurt any parent to see their child suffer like ours has,"" says doting father and former military man Azam Yaacob. He insists that ""nothing was wrong"" with Siti psychologically. In the wake of the incident they turned to Zaki Ya, a spiritual healer with 20 years of experience. ""Science can't fully explain the supernatural,"" says Zaki Ya At his centre in Ketereh, he greets us with a warm smile. ""Apa khabar, how are you?"" He abides by the teachings of the Koran, Islam's holy book, and also believes in the power of Jinn - spirits in Middle Eastern and Islamic cosmology that""appear in a variety of shapes and forms"",external. ""We share our world with these unseen beings,"" Zaki Ya says. ""They are good or bad and can be defeated by faith."" ""Cursed"" items rest on a table at Zaki Ya's spiritual centre Islamic scriptures adorn the centre's bright green walls. Bottles of holy water are stacked up high near its entrance. In a corner by a window, a collection of mysterious objects are gathered on a table - rusty knives, combs, orbs and even a dried seahorse. ""These are cursed items,"" Zaki Ya warns. ""Please do not touch anything."" Zaki Ya met Siti Nurannisaa and her family after the 2018 outbreak at SMK Ketereh. ""I've been guiding Siti and she has been getting better with my help,"" he says proudly. He shows me a video of another girl he ""treated"". She is seen thrashing about wildly on the floor and screaming before being restrained by two men. Possession, Jinn and Britain's backstreet exorcists Minutes later, Zaki Ya enters the room and approaches the visibly distressed girl. He holds her head and chants Islamic verses, and she appears to calm down. ""Women are softer and physically weaker,"" he tells us. ""That makes them more susceptible to spiritual possession."" He professes to understand that mental health plays a role in many of the cases he sees, but is emphatic about the power of Jinn. ""Science is important but it can't fully explain the supernatural,"" he says. ""Non-believers won't understand these attacks unless it happens to them."" An ""anti-hysteria kit"" costs more than $2000 A more controversial approach comes from a team of Islamic academics in Pahang, the largest state in peninsular Malaysia. Priced at a hefty 8,750 Malaysian ringgit (Â£1,700; $2,100), the ""anti-hysteria kit"" they offer consists of items including formic acid, ammonia inhalants, pepper spray and bamboo ""pincers"". Wooden pincers are meant to induce pain in a possessed person and drive out demons and spirits ""According to the Koran, evil spirits are unable to tolerate such items,"" says Dr Mahyuddin Ismail, who developed the kit with the aim of ""combining science and the supernatural"". ""Our kits have been used by two schools and solved more than 100 cases,"" he says. There's no scientific evidence to back up these claims. Dr Mahyuddin Ismail poses with his ""anti-hysteria kit"" outside his office at the Universiti Malaysia Pahang The kit drew widespread criticism upon its release in 2016. Former minister Khairy Jamaluddin called it ""the mark of a backward society"". ""It's nonsensical, absurd superstition. We want Malaysians to be scientific and innovative, not remain entrenched in supernatural beliefs."" But clinical psychologists, like Irma Ismail from Universiti Putra Malaysia, do not discount such beliefs when it comes to mass hysteria cases. ""Malaysian culture has its own take on the phenomenon,"" she says. ""A more realistic approach is integrating spiritual beliefs with adequate mental health treatment."" A bird's eye view of Kelantan's capital city Kota Bharu If Malaysia is the ""mass hysteria capital of the world"", Kelantan on the north-east coast is ground zero. ""It is no coincidence that Kelantan, the most religiously conservative of all Malaysian states, is also the one most prone to outbreaks,"" Robert Bartholomew says. Known as the Muslim-majority nation's Islamic heartland, Kelantan is one of two states ruled by the conservative opposition Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Unlike the rest of the country, Kelantan's week follows the Islamic calendar - with the working week beginning on Sundays and ending on Thursdays to free up Fridays for prayers. ""This is a different side of Malaysia,"" says Ruhaidah Ramli, a sprightly 82-year-old vendor at a local market. ""Life here is simple. It isn't busy or stressful like it is in [the capital] Kuala Lumpur."" A woman walks past a mural at the central Siti Khadijah market in Kota Bharu Are religion and supernatural beliefs related? Academic Afiq Noor argues that the stricter implementation of Islamic law in school in states such as Kelantan is linked to the surge in outbreaks. ""Malay Muslim girls attend school under rigid religious discipline,"" he says. ""They observe stricter dress codes and can't listen to music which isn't Islamic."" The theory is that such a constricted environment could be creating more anxiety. Similar outbreaks have also been reported in Catholic convents and monasteries across Mexico, Italy and France, in schools in Kosovo and even among cheerleaders in a rural North Carolina town. Mexico, where exorcisms are on the rise The town that nearly danced itself to death Each case is unique - the cultural context is different and hence the form varies. But it ultimately remains the same phenomenon and researchers argue that the impact of strict, conservative cultures on those affected by mass hysteria is clear. To clinical psychologists like Steven Diamond, the ""painful, frightening and embarrassing symptoms"" often associated with mass hysteria could be ""indicative of a frustrated need for attention"". ""Might their remarkable symptoms be saying something about how they are really feeling inside but are unable or unwilling to allow themselves to consciously acknowledge, feel or verbalise?""he wrote in a 2002 article for Psychology Today.,external 2019 has been a quiet year for Siti Nurannisaa. ""I have been doing okay. It's been calm for me,"" she says. ""I haven't seen bad things for months now."" She's lost touch with much of her cohort after graduating from SMK Ketereh already but this doesn't bother her - she tells me she's always kept a small circle of friends. She is now taking a break from study before going on to university. Siti and her ginger cat Chomel On the day we meet, she shows me a shiny black microphone. ""Karaoke has always been a favourite pastime of mine,"" she says. Pop songs by Katy Perry and homegrown Malaysian diva Siti Nurhaliza are her favourites. Singing proved to be a great stress-reliever for the young girl during her ordeal. It helped her gain some confidence back after the very traumatic incident. ""Stress makes my body weak but I have been learning how to manage it,"" she says. ""My goal is to be normal and happy."" Siti and her father Azam Yacob, at their home On that note, I ask her what she wants to be in future. ""A policewoman,"" she says. ""They are brave and aren't afraid of anything.""

"This video can not be played Dramatic rescues after typhoon Lekima causes floods in China At least 28 people have been killed and more than a million forced from their homes as Typhoon Lekima hit China, according to state media. Officials said the deaths were caused by a landslide triggered by the storm. Ten others have been reported missing. Lekima made landfall in the early hours of Saturday in Wenling, between Taiwan and China's financial capital Shanghai. The storm was initially designated a ""super typhoon"", but weakened slightly before landfall. The fatal landslide happened in Wenzhou, near where the storm made landfall, state media said. It occurred after a barrier lake - or natural dam - formed, pooling water from the heavy rains before collapsing. Lekima is now slowly winding its way north through the Zhejiang province, and is expected to hit Shanghai, which has a population of more than 20 million. Emergency crews have battled to save stranded motorists from floods and searched for survivors in the rubble of damaged buildings. Fallen trees and power cuts are widespread. Rescue workers have been searching for survivors in the rubble of damaged buildings Authorities have cancelled more than 1,000 flights and cancelled train services in preparation for the storm. Shanghai Disneyland was also shut for the day. The storm is expected to weaken further by the time it reaches the city, but will still bring a high risk of dangerous flooding. The typhoon has brought heavy rain to Shanghai ""Now the disaster zones are mainly in the rural-urban integration zones,"" said Fu Songliang, head of a rescue team for Ningbo City's fire service. ""These are low-lying areas. When the flooding from mountainous areas converges and comes down, these areas are quite seriously affected,"" he told Reuters news agency.

"Hormone replacement therapy helps relieve symptoms of the menopause Women going through the menopause are facing a national shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Many of the most commonly prescribed forms of HRT, which helps deal with the symptoms of the menopause, are out of stock in some pharmacies. The Department for Health and Social Care said it was aware of ""ongoing supply issues"" due to ""manufacturing delays"". A spokesperson said alternative HRT products were available. Affected patients should discuss alternatives with their doctor, they said, adding that the government was working closely with suppliers to ""maintain the overall flow of medicines to patients"". Several women have told to the BBC how they have been affected, with one saying she feels ""absolutely devastated"" and another suffering ""considerable discomfort and distress"". What does the menopause do to the body? Chair of the Royal College of GPs Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard said the reasons for the delays were unclear. ""We know that there are the generic phrases like 'supply issues' and 'manufacturing problems,'"" she said. ""But because it's commercially sensitive... nobody will be honest with the public and the NHS. So it's frustrating."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she said: ""It's really complicated and as a GP myself it's an intensely frustrating problem. ""Occasionally over the years we've had shortages of drugs and we have to deal with that. But the last six months in particular have been spectacularly difficult for HRT."" This video can not be played Menopause: what are the symptoms and why does it happen? She urged women on HRT to start thinking about their getting their repeat prescriptions earlier than usual. She said if patients found their pharmacies were out of stock of their prescription, they should ask the pharmacist what similar treatments were available and feed that back to their GP surgery. One woman, Rachel, said her HRT went out of stock at the end of last year and she has struggled to find something as effective. ""In the meantime I have been tearful, angry, overwhelmed at work, tired and have struggled with some physical symptoms. I simply haven't been me. ""I know none of it is life-threatening, but the impact on life, work and family is greater than I'd ever expected."" Another woman, Judie, said she has had unwanted side effects after being forced to try alternative HRT, while Joan said: ""[I am] absolutely devastated. ""I cannot function without my medication. I lose concentration, confidence. I am sleep deprived and constantly anxious."" Meanwhile, Ava, a trans woman who is taking HRT, said: ""As I'm sure you can imagine, the realisation that my ability to continue on the course I've committed myself to for the last three years is dependent on such a fragile supply chain is not a happy one and leaves me feeling rather anxious whenever my supply gets low."" HRT shortage 'adds to the stress of menopause' Prof Stokes-Lampard said it was not clear how long the shortages would continue. Some products were experiencing a ""temporary blip"", she said, but for others it would be into early next year before the supply problems were fixed. HRT is the most common treatment for menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, and involves taking oestrogen to replace the decline in the body's own levels,the NHS website says,external. It is available as tablets, skin patches, a gel to rub into the skin or implants. Around a million women in the UK use treatment for menopausal symptoms, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. What is the menopause and what are the main signs?

"The shipyard, beside Newark Castle, is expected to be in administration by the end of next week The Scottish government says it is considering nationalising the beleaguered Ferguson shipyard. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said taking the Port Glasgow site, which isdue to enter administration, into public ownership was an option. The site currently employs about 350 staff and has been in a long-running dispute with the Scottish government over a contract to build two ferries. The Â£97m deal for CalMac is behind schedule and considerably over budget. Ferguson's has said it expects to lose nearly Â£40m on the ferry deal, which is being procured through the public-sector agency CMAL. Ferguson set for administration The lifeline ferry deal that went adrift Shipshape: when the state steps in On Friday, Ferguson Marine Engineering directors served notice of their intent to go into administration by the end of next week. Chief executive Gerry Marshall said the decision had been made ""with great regret and disappointment"", but that directors considered there not to be ""any other options in the current circumstances."" Two CalMac ferries have been at the centre of a long-running dispute Mr Mackay said nationalising the shipyard was being considered as a way to protect jobs and the future of the site. He said: ""Public ownership is an option. It is one of the options that we've been looking at. ""We wanted to try and find a commercial proposition that would work. We're disappointed that we've not been able to do that with the company owners. ""But we've made a commitment around the jobs, around the vessels and a future for the yard and that's what we're working on intensively right now."" Mr Mackay said the government had ""a range of possibilities and options open to us"" and added: ""The objectives I'm setting out for Ferguson's specifically is to complete those vessels currently under construction - because we need them, to secure employment at the yard and to give the yard a future."" Gary Smith, the Scotland organiser for the GMB Union, said taking the yards into public ownership was the right thing to do. He said: ""The only realistic option, the only way to secure the future of the yard, and most importantly for us - our members' jobs, is for the Scottish government to step in and nationalise the yard. I think that's what will happen and I think it's the right thing to do and those yards have got a very big future."" Gary Smith of the GMB said the yard had a big future despite its troubles It comes weeks after the yard's parent company, Clyde Blowers Capital - which is controlled by industrial tycoon Jim McColl - tabled a proposal for the Scottish government to take a share of ownership. However, the governmentrejected that plan. Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Jamie Greene has called for a full parliamentary inquiry into the troubles at the shipyard. He said the blame lay solely at the feet of the SNP government, which he accused of ""recklessly"" mismanaging the ferry contract. ""It is impossible to chart a way forward for the yard until we get to the bottom of both why things have gone so financially awry and what can now be done differently to secure a longer-term future for Scotland's shipbuilding industry,"" he said.

"There is ""a lot of uncertainty"" about the UK's capacity to patrol fishing waters after a no-deal Brexit, a government memo mistakenly emailed to the BBC has revealed. The memo, from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, says there are just 12 ships ""to monitor a space three times the size of the surface area of the UK"". Meanwhile Michael Gove has said there will be a government support fund to help British businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit. How would Brexit affect fishing waters? Why is everyone talking about fishing? What is a no-deal Brexit? The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. A ""divorce"" deal - which sets out how the UK leaves - has not been agreed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to leave whether one is reached or not. In the event of leaving without a deal,,externalthe UK would become an independent coastal state and leave the Common Fisheries Policy, which states the EU's shared rules about how much fish countries can catch and where. But ministers said they are confident security will be enforced after Brexit. Defra's internal email mentioned a number of media stories, including one being worked on by a freelance journalist for the Independent. According to the memo, the story planned to look at the preparation being made to deter EU fishermen from UK waters in the case of a no-deal Brexit, and also whether the UK will enforce the exclusion of foreign vessels. The note reads: ""While our public position on this wider issue is already clear and widely communicated, in that post-Brexit we will be an independent coastal state with control of our waters, both policy and MoD have indicated we are not on an overly strong footing to get ahead of the potential claims that could arise from this story. ""At this stage, there is a lot of uncertainty about the sufficiency of enforcement in a no-deal because we have 12 vessels that need to monitor a space three times the size of the surface area of the UK."" Admiral Lord West, a Labour peer and former First Sea Lord, said the email appeared to show the UK has ""insufficient assets to patrol and look after our exclusive economic zone for fisheries, and also our territorial seas"". ""This will be thrown into stark relief if we should cease to have an agreement with the EU on fisheries."" He added: ""This is something a number of us have been saying for some time now, but it has always been denied by Defra and the government."" However, Barrie Deas, the CEO of the National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO), said any EU vessel would be ""foolish"" to fish in UK waters - even without a deal in place. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Under international law, the UK would automatically become an independent coastal state with the rights and responsibilities of that status and there is an obligation under the UN Law of the Sea for countries that share stocks to co-operate. ""So I think there will be a fisheries agreement post-Brexit between the UK and the EU, but on a different basis from the Common Fisheries Policy."" A government spokesperson confirmed an internal email concerned with the ""veracity and details of media enquiries"" had been ""inadvertently sent outside of Defra"". They said: ""Britain is leaving the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. ""We are confident that we will have the ships and the expertise we need to properly enforce security in UK waters."" 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you What is the UK doing to get ready for no deal? Mr Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, spoke openly for the first time about a government support fund for British businesses during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday. The support package, known as Operation Kingfisher, will help companies deal with any ""bumps in the road"" that might occur as a result of a no-deal Brexit. Cabinet minister Michael Gove spoke about plans to help businesses on a visit to Northern Ireland BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said the plans predate Boris Johnson's premiership but few details have so far been revealed - including how much money will be made available and where the cash would come from. According to theTimes, the government has compiled a list of companies,externalit believes could be most exposed financially if the UK leaves the EU without a deal and may need of help. It is said to include a number of firms in the construction and manufacturing sectors. PM: No-deal preparations 'top priority' What would change with a no-deal Brexit? Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"This video can not be played Geoffrey Berman: ""If you believe you are a victim of this man... we want to hear from you."" ""I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender,'""Jeffrey Epstein told the New York Post in 2011,external. ""It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel."" Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender. This time, he was accused of running a ""vast network"" of underage girls for sex. He pleaded not guilty. Now,a New York court is expected to release a list ofpeople connected to Epstein. Some are accused of wrongdoing, while others are making allegations or are potential witnesses. But who was he? Born and raised in New York, Epstein taught maths and physics in the city at the private Dalton School in the mid 1970s. He had studied physics and maths himself at university, although he never graduated. A father of one of his students is said to have been so impressed that he put Epstein in touch with a senior partner at the Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns. He was a partner there within four years. By 1982, he had created his own firm - J Epstein and Co. The company managed assets of clients worth more than $1bn (Â£800m) and was an instant success. Epstein soon began spending his fortune - including on a mansion in Florida, a ranch in New Mexico, and reputedly the largest private home in New York - and socialising with celebrities, artists and politicians. ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,""Donald Trump told New York magazine for a profile on Epstein in 2002,external. ""He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. ""No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life."" Jeffrey Epstein, left, with Donald Trump at the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in 1997 In 2002, Epstein flew former President Bill Clinton and the actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker to Africa on a customised private jet. He made an unsuccessful bid to buy New York magazine with then film producer Harvey Weinstein in 2003 - the same year he made a $30m donation to Harvard University. But he also strove to keep his life private, reportedly shunning society events and dinners in restaurants. He dated women like Miss Sweden winner Eva Andersson Dubin and Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of publisher Robert Maxwell, although he never married. Rosa Monckton, the former CEO of Tiffany & Co, told Vanity Fair for a 2003 article that Epstein was ""very enigmatic"" and ""a classic iceberg"". ""You think you know him and then you peel off another ring of the onion skin andthere's something else extraordinary underneath,"" she said,external. ""What you see is not what you get."" In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. A police search of the property found photos of girls throughout the house. The Miami Herald reports that his abuse of underage girls dated back years,external. ""This was not a 'he said, she said' situation,"" Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter told the newspaper. ""This was 50-something 'shes' and one 'he' - and the 'shes' all basically told the same story."" ""He has never been secretive about the girls,""columnist Michael Wolff told New York magazine for a 2007 profile piece,external, as the case against Epstein moved through the courts. ""At one point, when his troubles began, he was talking to me and said, 'What can I say, I like young girls.' I said, 'Maybe you should say, 'I like young women.'"" However, prosecutors forged a deal with the hedge fund manager in 2008. He avoided federal charges - which could have seen him face life in prison - and instead received an 18-month prison sentence, during which he was able to go on ""work release"" to his office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. He was released on probation after 13 months. Prince Andrew, left, has been criticised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein The Miami Herald says that the federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta - who was Secretary of Labour in the Trump administration - struck a plea agreement hiding the extent of his crimes and ending an FBI investigation into whether there were more victims or more powerful people who took part. The paper described it as the ""deal of the century"". Mr Acosta resigned in July 2019 over the scandal, though he defended his actions as guaranteeing at last some jail time for Epstein. Since 2008 Epstein had been listed as a level three on the New York sex offenders register. It is a lifelong designation meaning he was at a high risk of reoffending. But Epstein maintained his properties and his assets after his conviction. In December 2010, Prince Andrew, the third child of the Queen, was pictured in New York's Central Park with Epstein, drawing controversy. In a BBC interview in November 2019, the prince, who had known Epstein since 1999, said he had gone to New York to break off their friendship. He said he regretted staying at the financier's house while he was there, and that he had ""let the side down"" by doing so. An Epstein accuser, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - would later allege that she was made to have sex with Prince Andrew in the early 2000s when she was 17. Prince Andrew categorically denied having sex with her and said he has no recollection of a photo of the pair being taken together in London. But in 2022, he paid millions to Ms Giuffre to settle a lawsuit she filed which alleged that he sexually abused her. Epstein was arrested in New York on 6 July 2019 after flying back from Paris on his private jet. Prosecutors were reportedly seeking the forfeiture of his New York mansion, where some of his alleged crimes occurred. Epstein always denied any wrongdoing, and pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. After being denied bail by the court, he was being held in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center.He was taken to hospital briefly in Julyfor what was widely reported to be injuries to his neck - which neither prison officials or his lawyers would officially comment on. At his last court appearance on 31 July, it became clear that he would spend a year in prison, with a trial no earlier than summer 2020. Prosecutors said they wanted no delay, and bringing the trial quickly was in the public interest. Now, Epstein will never face the trial at all. After Epstein's death, his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, came into the spotlight. She was arrested in July 2020 at her secluded mansion in the US state of New Hampshire on suspicion of having assisted Epstein's abuse of minors by helping to recruit and groom victims known to be underage. In December 2021, a jury in New York City found her guilty on five out of six counts, including the most serious charge - that of sex trafficking of a minor. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison, meaning the 60-year-old could spent the rest of her life behind bars. And it is a lawsuit brought against her by Ms Roberts that will see the names of dozens of associates of Epstein potentially made public. The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down The Oxford-educated Maxwell is said to have introduced Epstein to many of her wealthy and powerful friends, including Bill Clinton and the Duke of York. Friends said that although Maxwell and Epstein's romantic relationship lasted only a few years, she continued to work with him long afterward. This video can not be played Watch: The secret lives of Maxwell and Epstein In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach describe her as the house manager, who oversaw the staff, handled finances and served as social co-ordinator. In a Vanity Fair profile published in 2003, Epstein said Maxwell was not a paid employee, but rather his ""best friend"". During the trial, prosecutors alleged Ms Maxwell preyed on and groomed young girls for Epstein to abuse. Her defence claimed she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes following his death. But after her conviction, Maxwell offered some contrition, saying: ""It is the greatest regret of my life that I ever met Jeffrey Epstein. ""But today is ultimately not about Epstein,"" she continued. ""It is for me to be sentenced and for the victims to address me alone in court. To you, I say: I am sorry for the pain you experienced. I hope my conviction along with my harsh incarceration brings you closure.""

"A cruise missile test-firing in Russia's Arctic north (file photo) Five people were killed and three injured following a rocket explosion on an Arctic naval test range in Russia on Thursday, state nuclear company Rosatom confirmed. Rosatom said the accident occurred during tests on a liquid propellant rocket engine. The three injured staff members suffered serious burns in the accident. Authorities had previously said that two people died and six were injured in the blast at the site in Nyonoksa. The company told Russian media that its engineering and technical team had been working on the ""isotope power source"" for the propulsion system. The Nyonoksa site carries out tests for virtually every missile system used by the Russian navy, including sea-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and anti-aircraft missiles. Authorities in Severodvinsk, 47km (29 miles) east of Nyonoksasaid that radiation levels shortly after the blast were higher than normal for about 40 minutesbut returned to normal. Locals have rushed to buy medical iodine, with pharmacies' stocks of iodinereported to be running out in the cities of Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk. The rush for iodine was reported earlier bya news website for the Arkhangelsk region, 29.ru,external. It also said medics who evacuated the injured at Nyonoksa wore chemical and nuclear protection suits. There was a rush on iodine stocks during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, which sent a huge plume of radiation across Europe. Huge arms dump fire extinguished in Siberia Russian cruise missile hits flats Norway finds big radiation leak from Russian sub On Thursday the Severodvinsk administration reported a 40-minute spike in radiation, which reached 2 microsieverts per hour, then fell back to the normal 0.11 microsieverts. Both levels are too small to cause radiation sickness. The administration has now deleted its statement online about the spike. The BBC asked officials there why, and they said ""because this incident comes under the authority of the defence ministry"". The defence ministry insisted that ""there have been no harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere, the radiation levels are normal"". It is the second accident involving Russia's military this week. On Monday, one person was killed and eight others were injured in a blaze at an ammunition dump in Siberia.

"The TUC said construction jobs were among the middle-income roles which were squeezed Pay rates have effectively fallen for the UK's lower and middle income earners since 2010, research suggests. Workers in jobs paying between Â£9.56 and Â£12.73 an hour have seen their ""real"" wage drop 1% since 2010 after inflation is accounted for, analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) found. However, the lowest-paid workers have seen average real pay rates increase 5%, thanks to minimum wage rises. Ministers say all workers saw income tax cuts and real pay was now rising. Real wage rates adjust the hourly rate for the effect of inflation, the average increase in the cost of goods and services, which erode the spending power of your money. The TUC says lower and middle income earners may have seen their spending money squeezed The pay rate analysis identifies middle income earners, those earning near the median wage rate of Â£12.73 per hour, as having their earning power eroded since 2010. This 1% reduction in pay rates compares to a rise of 7% for this group of 7.7 million workers between 2002 and 2010, the TUC analysis argues. For workers earning between the median wage rate of Â£12.73 and Â£25.45 per hour, pay rates have on average fallen 3% in the period. The TUC analysis shows the 1.1 million highest income earners, banking above Â£25.45 per hour worked, saw average pay rates rise 4% since 2010. Kate Bell from the TUC says median wages still are not where they were before the financial crisis ""so a little bit of pay pick-up in the last couple of months... doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet"". Ms Bell added: ""People in middle earning jobs have seen their pay fall. Jobs like those in construction, the local government in administrative jobs for example you've likely seen your pay go down over this period. That has an impact on your ability to live and ability to pay your bills"". The most recentOffice for National Statistics data on employmentand earnings for the year to 31 May showed a record 32.75 million people in work and average wage growth for the year at 3.8%, the highest since the financial crisis in 2008. ONS data showed wage growth has been outpacing the inflation rate since March 2018, meaning the spending power of salaries is not being eroded by price rises in shops. The head of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, Neil Carberry, said businesses have faced increased costs since 2010 such as the apprenticeship levy and pension auto-enrolment. Mr Carberry said boosting the UK's lagging workplace productivity was key to improving wages and salaries for employees. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""It's staggering that millions of people have faced cuts to their real pay since 2010 while the highest earners have had their pay skyrocket."" He said a Labour government would introduce areal living wage,externalof at least Â£10 an hour and give trade unions more power to end the ""scandal"" of low pay. A Treasury spokesman said: ""Real wages are now rising on a sustainable basis for the first time in a decade. ""We have given the lowest paid a pay rise of almost 5% by increasing theNational Living Wage,external, cut income tax for 32 million people and taken 1.74 million people out of income tax. ""We are also helping with the cost of living by freezing fuel duty and doubling free child care for working parents of three and four year olds."" Conservative deputy chairman Paul Scully added: ""The facts are that under the Conservatives, the unemployment rate - and the proportion of low paid workers - have both fallen to a record low, and our National Living Wage is delivering pay rises for millions of people across the country"".

"This video can not be played Dramatic rescues after typhoon Lekima causes floods in China At least 28 people have been killed and more than a million forced from their homes as Typhoon Lekima hit China, according to state media. Officials said the deaths were caused by a landslide triggered by the storm. Ten others have been reported missing. Lekima made landfall in the early hours of Saturday in Wenling, between Taiwan and China's financial capital Shanghai. The storm was initially designated a ""super typhoon"", but weakened slightly before landfall. The fatal landslide happened in Wenzhou, near where the storm made landfall, state media said. It occurred after a barrier lake - or natural dam - formed, pooling water from the heavy rains before collapsing. Lekima is now slowly winding its way north through the Zhejiang province, and is expected to hit Shanghai, which has a population of more than 20 million. Emergency crews have battled to save stranded motorists from floods and searched for survivors in the rubble of damaged buildings. Fallen trees and power cuts are widespread. Rescue workers have been searching for survivors in the rubble of damaged buildings Authorities have cancelled more than 1,000 flights and cancelled train services in preparation for the storm. Shanghai Disneyland was also shut for the day. The storm is expected to weaken further by the time it reaches the city, but will still bring a high risk of dangerous flooding. The typhoon has brought heavy rain to Shanghai ""Now the disaster zones are mainly in the rural-urban integration zones,"" said Fu Songliang, head of a rescue team for Ningbo City's fire service. ""These are low-lying areas. When the flooding from mountainous areas converges and comes down, these areas are quite seriously affected,"" he told Reuters news agency. How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Shanghai evacuated some 250,000 residents, with another 800,000 in Zhejiang province also being taken from their homes. An estimated 2.7 million homes in the region lost power as power lines toppled in the high winds, Chinese state media said. This video can not be played Typhoon Lekima inches towards China It is the ninth typhoon of the year, Xinhua news said - but the strongest storm seen in years. It was initially given China's highest level of weather warning but was later downgraded to an ""orange"" level. Chinese weather forecasters said the storm, which had winds of 187km/h (116mph) when it made landfall, was moving north at 15km/h. It earlier passed Taiwan, skirting its northern tip and causing a handful of injuries and some property damage. Coming just a day after a magnitude six earthquake, experts warned that the combination of earth movement and heavy rain increased the risk of landslides.

"This video can not be played The National Grid's operations director explains why nearly one million people lost power on Friday National Grid has said it will ""learn the lessons"" after nearly one million people across England and Wales lost power on Friday. But director of operations Duncan Burt told the BBC that its systems ""worked well"" after the ""incredibly rare event"" of two power stations disconnecting. He said he did not believe that a cyber-attack or unpredictable wind power generation was to blame. The government has announced an investigation into what happened. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she is asking the Energy and Emergencies Executive Committee to carry out the investigation, which will look at whether National Grid's procedures are ""fit for purpose"". Regulator Ofgem has demanded an ""urgent detailed report"" into what went wrong. It said it could take enforcement action, including a fine, after train passengers were stranded, traffic lights failed to work and thousands of homes lost power during the blackout. National Grid power was restored by 17:40 BST on Friday but some train services continued to be disrupted on Saturday. 'We were stuck on a train with no food or toilets' Why the power cut caused so much disruption Major power failure affects homes and transport The power cut happened at about 17:00 BST on Friday, National Grid said, with blackouts across the midlands, the south east, south west, north west and north east of England, and Wales. National Grid said its systems were not to blame. Industry experts said a gas-fired power station at Little Barford, Bedfordshire, failed at 16:58 followed, two minutes later, by the Hornsea offshore wind farm disconnecting from the grid. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Burt acknowledged the ""immense disruption"" the blackout had caused. He said the near-simultaneous loss of two generators was more than the grid was routinely prepared for, prompting automatic safety systems to shut off power to some places. ""We think that worked well; we think the safety protection systems across the industry, on generators and on the network, worked well to secure and keep the grid safe, to make sure that we preserved power to the vast proportion of the country,"" he said. But he said the industry needed to examine whether these safety systems were set up correctly to have ""minimal impact"" on people's daily lives. RWE, owner of the Little Barford power station, said it shut down temporarily on Friday as a routine response to a technical issue, and called for National Grid and Ofgem to investigate the ""wider system issues"". And Orsted, the owner of the Hornsea offshore wind farm, said automatic systems on Hornsea One ""significantly reduced"" power around the same time others failed. A spokesperson added: ""We are investigating the cause, working closely with National Grid System Operator, which balances the UK's electricity system."" Police were called to help travellers during the huge disruption on the railways on Friday, with delayed passengers stranded for hours. Disruption continued into Saturday for some routes. London North Eastern Railway, which runs between King's Cross and the north of England and Scotland, said services were returning to normal, but a small number of trains were cancelled Great Northern services are still facing disruption and passengers are being advised to check their train's status before travelling Thameslink services have returned to normal. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern and Gatwick Express, says it is investigating why the power cut had such a severe effect on its trains. Thameslink trains were particularly badly impacted as GTR had to deploy technicians to manually restart trains north of London. All services in and out of King's Cross station were suspended during Friday's rush hour Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the impact of the power cut was ""unacceptable"" at a time when National Grid reported Â£1.8bn in profits and increased dividends to shareholders. By Ben Ando, BBC News correspondent Yesterday's power outage caused chaos for thousands of rail passengers left stranded as the electric trains they were on ground to a halt when the power supply went dead. But although the National Grid restored power inside a couple of hours, many passengers remained stuck on hot, stuffy trains because the drivers couldn't get them started again and had to wait for technicians to come out. The trains worst affected are the relatively new Class 700 and Class 717 commuter trains built in Germany by Siemens to specifications laid down by the Department for Transport. They were introduced onto the British network for Thameslink and Great Northern services from 2014. When the power died, the trains would have switched to back up batteries to keep essential systems going. Passengers on a train near Kentish Town station got off and began walking along the tracks But getting the trains restarted once the power came back was not straightforward. Drivers found that in some cases the on-board computers had shut systems down more fully, so a technician was needed. The Class 700 fleet is normally fast and efficient, but GTR has already launched an investigation with Network Rail and Siemens to examine what went wrong this time. And it's likely that the manufacturers will be asked to examine how they respond to serious power failures in future. Battery performance is also likely to come under scrutiny - a back-up diesel generator cannot be fitted to these trains because they spend much of their lives in long tunnels. King's Cross was one of the worst-hit stations, with all trains suspended for several hours. Passenger Dayna McAlpine told BBC Radio 5 Live her train took nearly 13 hours to reach London King's Cross from Edinburgh - a journey which would normally take less than five hours. ""By hour seven things were starting to get pretty tense,"" she said. ""People were threatening to self-evacuate off the train... Food ran out about five hours ago."" Others on social media reported having travelled for 12 hours, while some rail passengers were stuck on trains until the early hours of the morning. Allow Twitter content?

At the worst point of the power cut, about 500,000 people were affected in Western Power Distribution's area - including 44,500 customers in Wales - while 110,000 Northern Powergrid customers also lost power. In London and south-east England, 300,000 people were affected, UK Power Networks said, and another 26,000 customers were without power in north-west England. Northern Powergrid said the problems had affected Newcastle airport and city's metro system. BBC Radio 5 Live listener Ed, in Woodford Green, north-east London, said he felt ""totally cut off"" as mobile phone networks were also down. ""You heard all the alarms going off all around. Everything else was pretty eerie and quiet,"" he said. ""There was no way we could know anything - it could be any reason that the power had gone down.""

"A cruise missile test-firing in Russia's Arctic north (file photo) Five people were killed and three injured following a rocket explosion on an Arctic naval test range in Russia on Thursday, state nuclear company Rosatom confirmed. Rosatom said the accident occurred during tests on a liquid propellant rocket engine. The three injured staff members suffered serious burns in the accident. Authorities had previously said that two people died and six were injured in the blast at the site in Nyonoksa. The company told Russian media that its engineering and technical team had been working on the ""isotope power source"" for the propulsion system. The Nyonoksa site carries out tests for virtually every missile system used by the Russian navy, including sea-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and anti-aircraft missiles. Authorities in Severodvinsk, 47km (29 miles) east of Nyonoksasaid that radiation levels shortly after the blast were higher than normal for about 40 minutesbut returned to normal. Locals have rushed to buy medical iodine, with pharmacies' stocks of iodinereported to be running out in the cities of Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk. The rush for iodine was reported earlier bya news website for the Arkhangelsk region, 29.ru,external. It also said medics who evacuated the injured at Nyonoksa wore chemical and nuclear protection suits. There was a rush on iodine stocks during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, which sent a huge plume of radiation across Europe. Huge arms dump fire extinguished in Siberia Russian cruise missile hits flats Norway finds big radiation leak from Russian sub On Thursday the Severodvinsk administration reported a 40-minute spike in radiation, which reached 2 microsieverts per hour, then fell back to the normal 0.11 microsieverts. Both levels are too small to cause radiation sickness. The administration has now deleted its statement online about the spike. The BBC asked officials there why, and they said ""because this incident comes under the authority of the defence ministry"". The defence ministry insisted that ""there have been no harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere, the radiation levels are normal"". It is the second accident involving Russia's military this week. On Monday, one person was killed and eight others were injured in a blaze at an ammunition dump in Siberia. Flying munitions damaged a school and a kindergarten in the area. More than 9,500 people were evacuated.

"There is ""a lot of uncertainty"" about the UK's capacity to patrol fishing waters after a no-deal Brexit, a government memo mistakenly emailed to the BBC has revealed. The memo, from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, says there are just 12 ships ""to monitor a space three times the size of the surface area of the UK"". Meanwhile Michael Gove has said there will be a government support fund to help British businesses in the event of a no-deal Brexit. How would Brexit affect fishing waters? Why is everyone talking about fishing? What is a no-deal Brexit? The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. A ""divorce"" deal - which sets out how the UK leaves - has not been agreed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to leave whether one is reached or not. In the event of leaving without a deal,,externalthe UK would become an independent coastal state and leave the Common Fisheries Policy, which states the EU's shared rules about how much fish countries can catch and where. But ministers said they are confident security will be enforced after Brexit. Defra's internal email mentioned a number of media stories, including one being worked on by a freelance journalist for the Independent. According to the memo, the story planned to look at the preparation being made to deter EU fishermen from UK waters in the case of a no-deal Brexit, and also whether the UK will enforce the exclusion of foreign vessels. The note reads: ""While our public position on this wider issue is already clear and widely communicated, in that post-Brexit we will be an independent coastal state with control of our waters, both policy and MoD have indicated we are not on an overly strong footing to get ahead of the potential claims that could arise from this story. ""At this stage, there is a lot of uncertainty about the sufficiency of enforcement in a no-deal because we have 12 vessels that need to monitor a space three times the size of the surface area of the UK."" Admiral Lord West, a Labour peer and former First Sea Lord, said the email appeared to show the UK has ""insufficient assets to patrol and look after our exclusive economic zone for fisheries, and also our territorial seas"". ""This will be thrown into stark relief if we should cease to have an agreement with the EU on fisheries."" He added: ""This is something a number of us have been saying for some time now, but it has always been denied by Defra and the government."" However, Barrie Deas, the CEO of the National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO), said any EU vessel would be ""foolish"" to fish in UK waters - even without a deal in place. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Under international law, the UK would automatically become an independent coastal state with the rights and responsibilities of that status and there is an obligation under the UN Law of the Sea for countries that share stocks to co-operate. ""So I think there will be a fisheries agreement post-Brexit between the UK and the EU, but on a different basis from the Common Fisheries Policy."" A government spokesperson confirmed an internal email concerned with the ""veracity and details of media enquiries"" had been ""inadvertently sent outside of Defra"". They said: ""Britain is leaving the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. ""We are confident that we will have the ships and the expertise we need to properly enforce security in UK waters."" 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you What is the UK doing to get ready for no deal? Mr Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, spoke openly for the first time about a government support fund for British businesses during a visit to Northern Ireland on Friday. The support package, known as Operation Kingfisher, will help companies deal with any ""bumps in the road"" that might occur as a result of a no-deal Brexit. Cabinet minister Michael Gove spoke about plans to help businesses on a visit to Northern Ireland BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said the plans predate Boris Johnson's premiership but few details have so far been revealed - including how much money will be made available and where the cash would come from. According to theTimes, the government has compiled a list of companies,externalit believes could be most exposed financially if the UK leaves the EU without a deal and may need of help. It is said to include a number of firms in the construction and manufacturing sectors. PM: No-deal preparations 'top priority' What would change with a no-deal Brexit? Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?
