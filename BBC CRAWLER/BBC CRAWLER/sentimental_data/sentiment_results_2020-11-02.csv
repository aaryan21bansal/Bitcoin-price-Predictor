"Barry McGuigan (left) and Carl Frampton One of Barry McGuigan's sons has defended his family's management of boxer Carl Frampton during the nine years they worked together. Blain McGuigan said the fighter was paid a lot of money and was looked after very well. Mr McGuigan, 37, a boxing promoter and part-time musician, testified in the court case involving his father and Mr Frampton. ""We always wanted Carl to get the best money possible,"" he said. Mr McGuigan told the High Court that before the relationship turned sour, he regarded Mr Frampton as a friend. ""We worked very well togetherâ¦ close-knitâ¦ worked hard,"" he said. Monday was the 16th day of hearings in the case at the High Court in Belfast. Mr Frampton is suing Barry McGuigan and Cyclone Promotions over alleged unpaid earnings. Mr Frampton, on the other hand, has been accused of a breach of contract. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Their successful partnership broke down in August 2017. Barry McGuigan has three sons who all work in the boxing business - Jake, Shane and Blain, the eldest. One of the issues in the case is how much Mr Frampton was paid during the time he worked with the McGuigans from 2009 to 2017. Blain McGuigan told the court that the boxer was paid well and was always consulted about financial matters. ""Carl was always kept informed,"" he said. ""My dad insisted on him having the ability to check up on anything."" Blain McGuigan told the court Carl Frampton was paid well and was always consulted about financial matters Mr McGuigan was asked about a Frampton fight in New York in 2016 which was attended by a number of celebrities including the golfer Rory McIlroy. An issue was raised earlier in the case about whether or not celebrities were given free tickets for major fights or asked to pay for them. When this was put to Mr McGuigan, he said: ""I remember Rory didn't pay for his individual ticket."" However, he said the golfer may have paid for his friends and security team to attend the fight. ""That's really standard. Big-time celebrities would pay for additional tickets,"" he said. When asked for his view on Mr Frampton's new management company MTK Global, Mr McGuigan said: ""I don't think they're a good influence around sport."" The case will continue on Tuesday when Blain McGuigan is scheduled to face cross-examination.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First minister faces 'dilemma' over lockdown decision The furlough scheme will be available if there is a Covid-19 lockdown in Scotland in the future, the prime minister has suggested. Boris Johnson announced an extension of the job support scheme to 2 December as tough measures were imposed in England. Nicola Sturgeon said decisions on any Scottish lockdown may depend on when this funding would be available. Mr Johnson has now told MPs that the furlough scheme would ""continue to be available wherever it is needed"". Ms Sturgeon said this would be ""very welcome"" - but added she was ""seeking urgent confirmation from the Treasury that it will be exactly as we asked for"". What are the new Covid rules where you live? A new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions came into force in Scotland on Monday. At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she would ""ideally"" want to assess the impact of the latest measures before deciding whether it would be necessary to impose harsher measures. She said there were ""some encouraging signs"" that restrictions were having an impact in Scotland, with the rate of increase in cases ""slowing down"". Boris Johnson was questioned on the issue in the Commons However, she said the position remained ""very fragile"" - and that she faced a ""dilemma"" about imposing stricter measures in the short-term if there was a time limit on the furlough scheme. She said: ""I made clear last week that we might yet have to go further and we can't rule out a move to level four for all parts of the country. ""While that decision would never be easy, there is no doubt that the availability of a more extensive furlough scheme would make it slightly less difficult, because workers would have more of their wages paid. ""The decision we have to weigh up is should we take the opportunity of more generous financial support to step harder on the brakes now, to drive down infections."" She added: ""It cannot be right that the only time that additional financial support is made available is when the south of England needs to go into a lockdown. That just isn't fair given the situation we are dealing with."" The UK-wide job support scheme - which covers up to 80% of workers wages' and has supportedhundreds of thousands of jobs north of the border- was extended to 2 December when Mr Johnson announced the four-week lockdown in England. However, the UK's devolved administrations complained that this ""time limited"" extension only covered the period when England is under enhanced restrictions. Wales has been in a ""firebreak"" lockdown since 23 October, and First Minister Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies therehad been repeatedly turned down. Calls for more flexibility over furlough were backed by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said in a speech on Monday morning that ""this has to be cleared up, now"". He said: ""It cannot be that furlough is not affordable when Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or parts of Northern England need to go into lockdown - but when all of England goes into lockdown, the taps are turned on. ""We all hope that by following the guidance and doing the right thing, a second Scottish lockdown will not be necessary. ""But if it is, the UK government must treat Scotland the same way as England."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Repeatedly questioned about the matter in the Commons, Mr Johnson said that the job support scheme applied across the UK. He initially refused to be drawn about whether this could continue to be the case beyond December, should local lockdowns be needed in other parts of the UK. However, he then appeared to confirm that this would be the case when asked by Mr Ross to ""explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one"". The prime minister said: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies not just now but in the future."" Pressed on the question by SNP MP Pete Wishart, he added: ""The furlough scheme will continue to be available wherever it is needed."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has relaxed controls in what had been a tightly controlled state Gunmen have killed at least 32 people and set fire to homes in a ""horrendous"" attack in western Ethiopia, officials say. Local authorities said the rebel Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) was to blame for the attack in Oromia state. Residents said dozens were rounded up and killed and livestock was stolen. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Sunday's attack in Guliso district, in the Oromia region, may have been identity-based. Ethnic violence has increased since Mr Abiy took office in April 2018, loosening controls in what had been a highly centralised state.

One of their tactics is to arm civilians and carry out barbaric attacks based on identity, [for me] this is heart breaking,"" Mr Abiy said in a Twitter post. Survivors counted 54 bodies in a school compound where the militants, who identified as OLA members, gathered people who did not manage to flee, mainly women, children and the elderly, and killed them, rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. A survivor told AFP news agency that security forces stationed in the area left and the OLA then rounded up civilians. ""After collecting us, they opened fire on us, and then afterwards looted cattle and burnt down houses,"" they said. The OLA is an armed group that has been blamed for kidnappings and bomb attacks in western and southern Ethiopia. The OLA broke off from the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) - an opposition party that spent years in exile and returned to the country after Mr Abiy took office in 2018. A local official told the BBC a team had been sent to Guliso district to investigate, anticipating the death toll could be ""high"". The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said up to 60 ""armed and unarmed assailants"" were involved in the attack, which was carried out on Sunday. It said members of the Amhara ethnic group, the country's second largest ethnic group, were targeted. The Amhara branch of the ruling Prosperity Party also released a statement supporting the EHRC's report. Mr Abiy said that ""measures have started to be taken against the attackers"". The head of the African Union Moussa Faki condemned the violence and urged Ethiopians to refrain ""from inflammatory rhetoric and work towards de-escalating tensions in the country"".

"This video can not be played Two households in Wales can form a bubble after firebreak, said the first minister Two households in Wales will be able to form a bubble and meet at home after the 17-day firebreak ends. First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced some of the rules that will be in place from 9 November. There will be no travel restrictions within Wales, but people will not be able to leave the country except for essential purposes such as work during England's four-week lockdown. Groups of 15 will be allowed to meet for organised indoors activities. All businesses that were closed throughout the firebreak will be able to reopen, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But it is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be required to operate, prompting concerns from the sector. Q&A: What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Shops, pubs and gyms to reopen at end of firebreak Furlough backlash over rejected firebreak pleas Up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors for organised activities under the rules, which will be reviewed in a fortnight. But Health Minister Vaughan Gething suggested people would not be allowed to meet others from outside their household bubble in private gardens. Plaid Cymru said ministers should consider a phased reopening of hospitality, while the Welsh Conservatives welcomed some changes but called for clarity for businesses. The first minister said plans for the ""unexpected"" English lockdown,which is due to start on Thursday, have an impact on the next steps following the stay-at-home period in Wales. ""The English lockdown will have an impact on people who live in Wales but work in England, on companies operating in both England and Wales and on businesses trading along the border. ""It's really important that as we open up, Wales doesn't become an escape for people seeking to circumvent the new tighter restrictions imposed by the prime minister."" Meanwhile, the UK government said it would work with leaders from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on a joint approach to what will happen over the Christmas period. From 9 November, people will be able to meet others from their extended household bubble at home. There will be new arrangements in other indoors settings - but Mr Drakeford said there would be further consideration of how hospitality operates in light of the English lockdown. This video can not be played The community living by different Covid lockdown rules After Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that England would go into a month-long lockdown, the Welsh Government reiterated Wales' version would end on 9 November. During Wales' firebreak lockdown, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops have been required to shut, and people were told to stay at home. Supermarkets were instructed to stop selling non-essential items, and travel was restricted except for a limited set of reasons such as work and education, known as reasonable excuses. As well as shops and hospitality, churches will be able to reopen and local authority services will resume ""based on local circumstances"". Robert Jones said it had been hard not seeing his grandchildren Robert Jones from Ystrad Mynach agreed with the firebreak strategy, but said it had been hard not seeing his grandchildren. ""This virus got to be hit on the head one way or another, and they've got to stop people from England coming into Wales, and people from Wales going into England,"" he said. Following today's announcement on household bubbles, he said: ""I've got grandkids living in Cardiff, so I'll be able to see them again, won't I."" Jemma Hall said it had been difficult not seeing her family during lockdown. ""I haven't seen my family in months and I've only really seen a portion of my friends, and mainly ones that live up here, and that's only been outdoors and stuff. So it's been quite a horrible time."" Chelly Jones is trying to ""cheer everybody up"" with Christmas decorations after lockdown Chelly Jones, who runs the Stanton House Inn in Chirk, Wrexham, on the English border, has been putting up Christmas decorations ready for the pub to reopen to ""try and cheer everybody up"". ""It's been hard for everybody, we've all missed our families,"" she said. ""We'll have a bit of fun, Covid or not. It can't beat us. We can't lose Christmas. ""It's about families and we've got to try and do something for the community to cheer them up. We've got to make Christmas the best we can."" Retailers have been required to shut during the firebreak lockdown People in Wales will be subject to the same ban on international travel as people in England. But the first minister said people living in Wales could go on holiday in Wales when the Covid firebreak comes to an end. Mr Drakeford said: ""I can confirm that people will be able to travel within Wales, they won't be confined to their local authority area as was the case during the firebreak."" He added that ""tourism will be able to reopen"". Mr Drakeford said people would only see the benefits of the short lockdown if they ask in the weeks to come ""not 'what can I do' but 'what should I do'."" He said that would help ""to bring coronavirus under control and to give us a pathway through to Christmas and beyond."" All businesses closed during the firebreak will be able to reopen Mr Drakeford stressed that people who live and work on different sides of the Wales-England border would still be able to travel between the two nations. The Welsh Government will introduce a ""restricted list of essential purposes"" to allow people to travel between the countries which Mr Drakeford said would be ""the same broad system on both sides of the border"". He added: ""People who live in Wales but work in England will have a reasonable reason for travelling to work. ""And people who live in England and work in Wales really clearly have a reasonable excuse for coming across the border to work here. ""But it will be a restricted list of essential purposes, rather than the normal toing and froing across the border that you would have seen in less fraught and difficult times"". Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was ""surprised"" to learn about England's lockdown from newspapers at the weekend. The first minister said the first he knew of Mr Johnson's announcement were press reports. While repeating his call for more regular meetings, he added he was not ""criticising anybody for making these difficult decisions in their own circumstances"". He and health minister Vaughan Gething took part in a meeting chaired by Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove on Monday morning. This heat map shows how the case rate has increased since the summer The latest seven-day rolling average of case rates, since the firebreak started, shows on average cases in Wales have risen by 258.5 per 100,000 people. They have risen more sharply in the south Wales valleys areas, with Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent the highest, as we can see from a heat map. Mr Drakeford said restrictions had ""arrested the speed"" of the rise in cases and efforts had made a ""real and positive difference"" in ensuring that the firebreak did not need to be longer and more severe. Vaughan Gething suggested there will not be prescriptive rules for meeting individuals away from the home Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested that meeting people in household gardens would not be permitted under the new rules. He indicated that household bubble rules for home meetings would apply to the garden as well as the rest of the house. Asked on BBC Radio Wales if people would be able to meet their parents in a back garden and at a social distance, Mr Gething said: ""No. ""The reality is if you're in someone's garden you're likely to need to go indoors particularly this time of the year."" But he said they could be seen at a ""social distance in a range of venues"", such as a park or a walk, or ""all sorts of things that people do"". ""We're not going to write a set of prescriptive rules to try to determine how people can or can't see people in that sort of way,"" he added. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should consider a ""a two-week buffer period"" when the firebreak ends. Ministers should look at a ""phased reopening"" of the hospitality industry with pubs and bars closing at 18:00. Mr Price said it was ""crucial"" that financial support was available to the hospitality sector. PM warns of virus deaths 'twice as bad' as spring Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Senedd Conservative leader Paul Davies welcomed some of the changes but said the Welsh Government needed to ""explain urgently to businesses what support they will be able to access for the remainder of the Wales-wide lockdown and under the new national restrictions"". ""The Welsh Government needs to be bolder in getting core NHS activities back up and running to avoid other public health crises in devastating illnesses including cancer and heart disease."" The Conservatives have been criticised for vocally opposing Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown, only for a month-long lockdown for England to be announced by the Conservative government at the weekend. Mr Davies told BBC Wales:  ""What happens in England of course is a matter for the UK government and Boris Johnson, and his government has made that decision. What happens here in Wales is a different matter, and that's what devolution is about. ""The first minister and the prime minister have said that devolved governments sometimes take different decisions, and we've made it absolutely clear that we think this temporary national lockdown was not the right thing to do. ""But we are where we are, and we do hope we will see the suppression of this virus."" We're seeing a reset on the messaging here, with less emphasis on detailed rules and more on each of us exercising our personal judgement about what is the right thing to do. The more complex rules are, the easier it is for them to become derailed by confusion or controversy - the first weekend of lockdown was overwhelmed by the essential/non-essential row, for example. Government advisers talk a lot about finding ""sustainable interventions"", in other words something that can stop the spread of the virus that we can also live with longer term. Interventions are always more sustainable with public ""buy-in"" than without it, but once again the radically diverging approaches of politicians in different parts of the UK will raise questions - even as those same politicians try to agree a four-nation approach to what happens at Christmas. It is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be allowed to reopen on 9 November A spokeswoman for the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective said clarity had been promised on Monday on the terms their businesses would be able to reopen, but it had not been given. ""The first minister has announced that hospitality can reopen from 9 November but not announced under what restrictions,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Prior to firebreak we were clear in our consultations with Welsh Government that a return to previous restrictions including individual households only, 10pm curfew and so on would lead to a slow strangulation of the sector and businesses."" ""We need to make crucial decisions about the future viability of our businesses. Without knowing under what circumstances we can trade, this is impossible."" Ian Price of business lobby group CBI Wales said: ""The first minister has placed great emphasis on personal compliance and changing individual behaviours as we continue to live with the pandemic. ""Having already invested significant sums in making workplaces safe for staff and customers, business stands ready to play its part in making that a success."" Ben Francis of the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales said the organisation was ""pleased that there continues to be certainty that the firebreak will end on 9 November"". ""Many businesses will feel reassured by the first minister's statement on the lack of travel restrictions in Wales,"" he said. ""This will benefit high streets and towns across the country and help businesses claw back some of the opportunities that they have missed this year."" Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules?

"This video can not be played 'We are not going back to the full scale lockdown of March' The UK faces a ""medical and moral disaster"" unless tough action is taken now to stop the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs there was ""no alternative"" but to introduce a national lockdown - which is due to begin on Thursday -  to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. MPs will vote on the plans in the Commons on Wednesday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" over the pandemic. Sir Keir - who started calling fora short lockdown or circuit-breakerin October - criticised the government's ""inaction"", saying it meant the lockdown would be ""harder, longer and more damaging than it needed to be"". The prime minister was speaking in the Commons two days after announcing the lockdown at a televised press conference. Outlining the measures again, along with details of further support for businesses and jobs, Mr Johnson told MPs the government woulddouble its support from 40% to 80% of trading profitsfor the self-employed from next month - as well as extending the furlough scheme. Following earlier confusion over whether the furlough scheme would apply UK-wide, the PM suggested it would be available for parts of the UKwhere there is a Covid-19 lockdown in the future. Does the PM's lockdown 2.0 risk pleasing no-one? What are the latest lockdown plans? Lockdown 2.0: Your questions answered How many Covid cases are there in your area? He said the latest national restrictions would not be a return to the ""full-scale lockdown of March and April"", but he apologised for the ""anguish"" the restrictions would cause people and businesses. Mr Johnson also warned that without action ""the sick would be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals,"" with doctors and nurses potentially ""forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die"". On Monday, the UK recorded 18,950 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The PM said the lockdown regulations would end at 00:01 GMT on 2 December, with MPs given a vote on what should replace them. Mr Johnson insisted he had been right to ""try every possible option"" to get the virus under control at a local level before imposing a nationwide lockdown - and denied that the UK had been slower to act than other countries in Europe. Boris Johnson is stuck in between two groups. First, MPs on his own side who have become institutionally cross, but in the main, reluctantly swallow the government's plans, flaws and all. And second, MPs opposite who are frustrated at the government's handling of things, but don't disagree enough with the central features of the government's plan to try to block it.

"This video can not be played A large-scale security operation is ongoing Gunmen armed with rifles have opened fire in six different locations in central Vienna, killing three people and wounding several more, police say. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called it a ""repulsive terror attack"" and said one gunman was also killed. Police were searching for at least one attacker who was still at large, the interior minister said. The shootings took place near Vienna's central synagogue but it is not yet clear if that was the target. The city's police chief said two men and a woman were killed. At least a dozen other people were wounded, officials said. In pictures: Scene of gun attack The attack happened just hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were out enjoying bars and restaurants which are now closed until the end of November. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"". Police said the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman suffered a gunshot wound before other officers shot the perpetrator, who was armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete. Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch tweeted that the synagogue was closed at the time the attack began. Police sealed off streets near Schwedenplatz in Vienna An officer guarding the synagogue was among the wounded, newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported. It was not immediately clear how many attackers took part in the shooting. Austrian media said one person had been arrested, citing the interior ministry. Footage posted on social media showed people running through the streets as gunshots rang out. Witness Chris Zhao was in a nearby restaurant when the shooting started. He told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. We saw the ambulances... lining up. There were victims. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" The shooting began at about 20:00 local time As a major anti-terror operation swung into action, police urged people to avoid the area and not to use public transport. Roadblocks were set up around the city centre. Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria amid fears that the gunman might head in that direction. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the attacker still at large was ""heavily armed and dangerous"". He told a news conference that children in Vienna would not be expected to attend school on Tuesday. On Twitter, Mr Kurz said ""we are experiencing difficult hours in our republic"", adding that the army would take over the security of major buildings in Vienna. ""Our police will act decisively against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism,"" he said. This man raised his hands as police checked his identity during their search for the gunmen A number of people have been taken to hospital, including some with serious injuries Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. Leaders across the region condemned the shooting, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. ""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said. Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nicelast week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"". European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria. In pictures: Scene of gun attack Hunt for gunman after attack.

"As the latest regional coronavirus restrictions come into force, you have submitted hundreds of questions about how the new five-level system will affect you. The new framework sees each local authority assigned a level from zero (near normal) to four (close to full lockdown). Almost every part of life is affected by restrictions in levels three and four, from work and travel to sport and socialising. We've tried to answer the most common of your questions What level has your area been put in? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Many readers submitted questions about whether people are allowed to move between local authorities, all of which are currently placed in levels one, two or three. Announcing the new system last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those who lived in level three or four areas should not travel beyond their council boundaries unless they were required to do so for ""essential reasons"". These reasons include work which cannot be done from home, education, local outdoor exercise, healthcare or caring responsibilities, and essential shopping where it is not possible locally. Ms Sturgeon also said those who lived in level one or two local authority areas ""must not travel"" into a level three or future level four council area except for ""essential purposes"". Travel between level one and level two areas is permitted but people are asked to ""minimise unnecessary journeys"". People who live alone or people who live with only children under 18 - for example single parents - can form an ""extended household"" with people who live in another home. This means a retired person who lives alone could form a ""bubble"" with their grown-up child and their family. It can also apply to couples who do not live together. But if one member of the household tests positive for Covid, every member of the extended group should isolate for 14 days. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said extended households can continue to meet even if one lives in a level two area, and the other in a level three area. But he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I would urge individuals in that situation to exercise the greatest degree of care and caution."" This was a popular question as many people care for elderly relatives in different council areas. People who live in level three areas should avoid any unnecessary travel outside the local authority area. However, there are a number of exceptions, including to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, such as an elderly relative. Childcare is also one of the exceptions to the travel rule, with existing arrangements that are in place with relatives also deemed ""essential"". No, people should not travel into or out of a level three area for holidays or visits. There are exceptions for those who must travel for work, education, health or attending weddings or funerals which require an overnight stay. The Scottish government says a full refund should be offered to people who booked holiday homes but could not stay in them due to holiday restrictions. People should avoid any unnecessary travel between Scotland and England, according to Scottish government guidance. England is due to go into lockdown on Thursday, forcing the closure of non-essential shops, indoor and outdoor leisure facilities, entertainment venues, hair and beauty salons. The lockdown will last until at least 2 December so it is likely the Santa experience will be cancelled. People with a trade are still allowed to visit homes to carry out work and removal companies can also continue to go about their business. Mobile hairdresser are also allowed to operate in level three areas as long as they follow the government guidance on staff and customer safety. Funerals fall into the ""essential"" category so Alison would be able to travel into Edinburgh, a level three area, from Fife, which is in level two, on this occasion. However, only 20 people can attend, households should stay at least two metres apart and mourners should wear face coverings. The neighbouring councils of East Ayrshire and East Renfrewshire are both level three areas. One of the exemptions to the travel rule allows for ""local outdoor informal exercise such as walking, cycling or running"". However, we put this particular question to the Scottish government and they said it would not be permitted as travelling from Kilmarnock to Giffnock, for example, was not ""local"".

"Many self-employed claim they have been excluded from other support schemes The self-employed will be able to claim state aid of up to 80% of profits during the month-long lockdown, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. The rise is up from the current 40%, and will mean Â£4.5bn of government support for the self-employed between November and January, he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a backlash from within his own party over the new lockdown. That criticism included not doing enough to help the self-employed. It was also announced that businesses will continue to be able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans until 31 January, compared with a previous 30 November deadline for some of the programmes. England will enter a second lockdown on Thursday, which will  close restaurants, pubs and non-essential shops until at least 2 December, although unlike the first lockdown in late March and April, schools will stay open for all pupils. Under the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS), eligible workers can currently claim support covering 40% of their average earnings from last year to cover a period of three months, capped at Â£3,750. The new enhanced scheme will open for applications from the end of November, and cover 80% of trading profits for that month. Including the new higher November grant, it means the November-January payment will be at 55% of profits, up to a maximum of Â£5,160. However, as eligibility criteria will be the same as for previous grants, critics said it still meant as many as 2.9 million freelancers, contractors and newly self employed people would remain excluded. What help are self-employed people getting? Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) said the new measures will give ""vital support"" to some, but accused the government of still ""wilfully ignoring a third of self-employed"". Derek Cribb, the group's chief executive, said it was important to note the enhanced 80% rate only covered November, mirroring the extended furlough scheme. ""It is vital that if the furlough scheme is extended, SEISS should be adjusted accordingly,"" he said. ""It is deeply troubling that the government has still not fixed the devastating gaps in SEISS, despite urgent recommendations from the Treasury Select Committee. After so many calls to resolve the problems, it now looks as if the government is wilfully ignoring a third of the self-employed. ""The first lockdown drastically undermined self-employed incomes, and the gaps in government support led to the biggest drop in self-employed numbers on record. ""Unless government wakes up to the problem and supports all the self-employed, the second lockdown will accelerate the decline and hollow out swathes of this vital sector."" Small businesses have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to go even further than Mondays announcement The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also warned that too many self-employed people remain excluded. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""This is a five-million strong community that drives our economy forward, but the government has insisted that large swathes of it do not warrant any help where income is concerned. ""We have sadly already seen 250,000 self-employed people stop working and become economically inactive, a figure which is set to continue rising. ""Fundamentally, the business support landscape still remains too much of a mixed picture - a fact made all the more concerning given that this fresh lockdown in England is taking effect during the critical festive season."" Monday's announcement increases help for many people - but, then again, many people still say it is not nearly enough. The National Audit Office said last week up to 2.9 million people have been excluded from both the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme since March - some newly self-employed, others set up as limited companies and still others denied furlough. NAO head Gareth Davies said it was ""clear that many people have lost earnings and have not been able to access support"". Some have had little or no income for months, ineligible even for benefits. Yet they've paid their taxes and say they deserve the same level of support as everyone else. According to the ExcludedUK Facebook group, of 2,400 members in a recent poll, 79% described themselves as having trouble sleeping, 81% as being anxious or stressed, 58% had low self-esteem, 48% were depressed; and 14% had had suicidal thoughts - over three times the norm in the wider population. The cross-party Treasury Committee said in June these exclusions ""cannot be right"" and Sir Keir Starmer told the CBI conference today the chancellor must close the gaps in support. But so far those gaps remain wide open. What extra help will the self-employed get? What happens when furlough ends?

"This video can not be played Two households in Wales can form a bubble after firebreak, said the first minister Two households in Wales will be able to form a bubble and meet at home after the 17-day firebreak ends. First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced some of the rules that will be in place from 9 November. There will be no travel restrictions within Wales, but people will not be able to leave the country except for essential purposes such as work during England's four-week lockdown. Groups of 15 will be allowed to meet for organised indoors activities. All businesses that were closed throughout the firebreak will be able to reopen, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But it is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be required to operate, prompting concerns from the sector. Q&A: What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Shops, pubs and gyms to reopen at end of firebreak Furlough backlash over rejected firebreak pleas Up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors for organised activities under the rules, which will be reviewed in a fortnight. But Health Minister Vaughan Gething suggested people would not be allowed to meet others from outside their household bubble in private gardens. Plaid Cymru said ministers should consider a phased reopening of hospitality, while the Welsh Conservatives welcomed some changes but called for clarity for businesses. The first minister said plans for the ""unexpected"" English lockdown,which is due to start on Thursday, have an impact on the next steps following the stay-at-home period in Wales. ""The English lockdown will have an impact on people who live in Wales but work in England, on companies operating in both England and Wales and on businesses trading along the border. ""It's really important that as we open up, Wales doesn't become an escape for people seeking to circumvent the new tighter restrictions imposed by the prime minister."" Meanwhile, the UK government said it would work with leaders from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on a joint approach to what will happen over the Christmas period. From 9 November, people will be able to meet others from their extended household bubble at home. There will be new arrangements in other indoors settings - but Mr Drakeford said there would be further consideration of how hospitality operates in light of the English lockdown. This video can not be played The community living by different Covid lockdown rules After Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that England would go into a month-long lockdown, the Welsh Government reiterated Wales' version would end on 9 November. During Wales' firebreak lockdown, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops have been required to shut, and people were told to stay at home. Supermarkets were instructed to stop selling non-essential items, and travel was restricted except for a limited set of reasons such as work and education, known as reasonable excuses. As well as shops and hospitality, churches will be able to reopen and local authority services will resume ""based on local circumstances"". Robert Jones said it had been hard not seeing his grandchildren Robert Jones from Ystrad Mynach agreed with the firebreak strategy, but said it had been hard not seeing his grandchildren. ""This virus got to be hit on the head one way or another, and they've got to stop people from England coming into Wales, and people from Wales going into England,"" he said. Following today's announcement on household bubbles, he said: ""I've got grandkids living in Cardiff, so I'll be able to see them again, won't I."" Jemma Hall said it had been difficult not seeing her family during lockdown. ""I haven't seen my family in months and I've only really seen a portion of my friends, and mainly ones that live up here, and that's only been outdoors and stuff. So it's been quite a horrible time."" Chelly Jones is trying to ""cheer everybody up"" with Christmas decorations after lockdown Chelly Jones, who runs the Stanton House Inn in Chirk, Wrexham, on the English border, has been putting up Christmas decorations ready for the pub to reopen to ""try and cheer everybody up"". ""It's been hard for everybody, we've all missed our families,"" she said. ""We'll have a bit of fun, Covid or not. It can't beat us. We can't lose Christmas. ""It's about families and we've got to try and do something for the community to cheer them up. We've got to make Christmas the best we can."" Retailers have been required to shut during the firebreak lockdown People in Wales will be subject to the same ban on international travel as people in England. But the first minister said people living in Wales could go on holiday in Wales when the Covid firebreak comes to an end. Mr Drakeford said: ""I can confirm that people will be able to travel within Wales, they won't be confined to their local authority area as was the case during the firebreak."" He added that ""tourism will be able to reopen"". Mr Drakeford said people would only see the benefits of the short lockdown if they ask in the weeks to come ""not 'what can I do' but 'what should I do'."" He said that would help ""to bring coronavirus under control and to give us a pathway through to Christmas and beyond."" All businesses closed during the firebreak will be able to reopen Mr Drakeford stressed that people who live and work on different sides of the Wales-England border would still be able to travel between the two nations. The Welsh Government will introduce a ""restricted list of essential purposes"" to allow people to travel between the countries which Mr Drakeford said would be ""the same broad system on both sides of the border"". He added: ""People who live in Wales but work in England will have a reasonable reason for travelling to work. ""And people who live in England and work in Wales really clearly have a reasonable excuse for coming across the border to work here. ""But it will be a restricted list of essential purposes, rather than the normal toing and froing across the border that you would have seen in less fraught and difficult times"". Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was ""surprised"" to learn about England's lockdown from newspapers at the weekend. The first minister said the first he knew of Mr Johnson's announcement were press reports. While repeating his call for more regular meetings, he added he was not ""criticising anybody for making these difficult decisions in their own circumstances"". He and health minister Vaughan Gething took part in a meeting chaired by Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove on Monday morning. This heat map shows how the case rate has increased since the summer The latest seven-day rolling average of case rates, since the firebreak started, shows on average cases in Wales have risen by 258.5 per 100,000 people. They have risen more sharply in the south Wales valleys areas, with Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent the highest, as we can see from a heat map. Mr Drakeford said restrictions had ""arrested the speed"" of the rise in cases and efforts had made a ""real and positive difference"" in ensuring that the firebreak did not need to be longer and more severe. Vaughan Gething suggested there will not be prescriptive rules for meeting individuals away from the home Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested that meeting people in household gardens would not be permitted under the new rules. He indicated that household bubble rules for home meetings would apply to the garden as well as the rest of the house. Asked on BBC Radio Wales if people would be able to meet their parents in a back garden and at a social distance, Mr Gething said: ""No. ""The reality is if you're in someone's garden you're likely to need to go indoors particularly this time of the year."" But he said they could be seen at a ""social distance in a range of venues"", such as a park or a walk, or ""all sorts of things that people do"". ""We're not going to write a set of prescriptive rules to try to determine how people can or can't see people in that sort of way,"" he added. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should consider a ""a two-week buffer period"" when the firebreak ends. Ministers should look at a ""phased reopening"" of the hospitality industry with pubs and bars closing at 18:00. Mr Price said it was ""crucial"" that financial support was available to the hospitality sector. PM warns of virus deaths 'twice as bad' as spring Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Senedd Conservative leader Paul Davies welcomed some of the changes but said the Welsh Government needed to ""explain urgently to businesses what support they will be able to access for the remainder of the Wales-wide lockdown and under the new national restrictions"". ""The Welsh Government needs to be bolder in getting core NHS activities back up and running to avoid other public health crises in devastating illnesses including cancer and heart disease."" The Conservatives have been criticised for vocally opposing Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown, only for a month-long lockdown for England to be announced by the Conservative government at the weekend. Mr Davies told BBC Wales:  ""What happens in England of course is a matter for the UK government and Boris Johnson, and his government has made that decision. What happens here in Wales is a different matter, and that's what devolution is about. ""The first minister and the prime minister have said that devolved governments sometimes take different decisions, and we've made it absolutely clear that we think this temporary national lockdown was not the right thing to do. ""But we are where we are, and we do hope we will see the suppression of this virus."" We're seeing a reset on the messaging here, with less emphasis on detailed rules and more on each of us exercising our personal judgement about what is the right thing to do. The more complex rules are, the easier it is for them to become derailed by confusion or controversy - the first weekend of lockdown was overwhelmed by the essential/non-essential row, for example. Government advisers talk a lot about finding ""sustainable interventions"", in other words something that can stop the spread of the virus that we can also live with longer term. Interventions are always more sustainable with public ""buy-in"" than without it, but once again the radically diverging approaches of politicians in different parts of the UK will raise questions - even as those same politicians try to agree a four-nation approach to what happens at Christmas. It is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be allowed to reopen on 9 November A spokeswoman for the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective said clarity had been promised on Monday on the terms their businesses would be able to reopen, but it had not been given. ""The first minister has announced that hospitality can reopen from 9 November but not announced under what restrictions,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Prior to firebreak we were clear in our consultations with Welsh Government that a return to previous restrictions including individual households only, 10pm curfew and so on would lead to a slow strangulation of the sector and businesses."" ""We need to make crucial decisions about the future viability of our businesses. Without knowing under what circumstances we can trade, this is impossible."" Ian Price of business lobby group CBI Wales said: ""The first minister has placed great emphasis on personal compliance and changing individual behaviours as we continue to live with the pandemic. ""Having already invested significant sums in making workplaces safe for staff and customers, business stands ready to play its part in making that a success."" Ben Francis of the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales said the organisation was ""pleased that there continues to be certainty that the firebreak will end on 9 November"". ""Many businesses will feel reassured by the first minister's statement on the lack of travel restrictions in Wales,"" he said. ""This will benefit high streets and towns across the country and help businesses claw back some of the opportunities that they have missed this year."" Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules?

"This video can not be played A large-scale security operation is ongoing Gunmen armed with rifles have opened fire in six different locations in central Vienna, killing three people and wounding several more, police say. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called it a ""repulsive terror attack"" and said one gunman was also killed. Police were searching for at least one attacker who was still at large, the interior minister said. The shootings took place near Vienna's central synagogue but it is not yet clear if that was the target. The city's police chief said two men and a woman were killed. At least a dozen other people were wounded, officials said. In pictures: Scene of gun attack The attack happened just hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were out enjoying bars and restaurants which are now closed until the end of November. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"". Police said the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman suffered a gunshot wound before other officers shot the perpetrator, who was armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete. Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch tweeted that the synagogue was closed at the time the attack began. Police sealed off streets near Schwedenplatz in Vienna An officer guarding the synagogue was among the wounded, newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported. It was not immediately clear how many attackers took part in the shooting. Austrian media said one person had been arrested, citing the interior ministry. Footage posted on social media showed people running through the streets as gunshots rang out. Witness Chris Zhao was in a nearby restaurant when the shooting started. He told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. We saw the ambulances... lining up. There were victims. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" The shooting began at about 20:00 local time As a major anti-terror operation swung into action, police urged people to avoid the area and not to use public transport. Roadblocks were set up around the city centre. Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria amid fears that the gunman might head in that direction. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the attacker still at large was ""heavily armed and dangerous"". He told a news conference that children in Vienna would not be expected to attend school on Tuesday. On Twitter, Mr Kurz said ""we are experiencing difficult hours in our republic"", adding that the army would take over the security of major buildings in Vienna. ""Our police will act decisively against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism,"" he said. This man raised his hands as police checked his identity during their search for the gunmen A number of people have been taken to hospital, including some with serious injuries Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. Leaders across the region condemned the shooting, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. ""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said. Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nicelast week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"". European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria. In pictures: Scene of gun attack Hunt for gunman after attack.

"As the latest regional coronavirus restrictions come into force, you have submitted hundreds of questions about how the new five-level system will affect you. The new framework sees each local authority assigned a level from zero (near normal) to four (close to full lockdown). Almost every part of life is affected by restrictions in levels three and four, from work and travel to sport and socialising. We've tried to answer the most common of your questions What level has your area been put in? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Many readers submitted questions about whether people are allowed to move between local authorities, all of which are currently placed in levels one, two or three. Announcing the new system last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said those who lived in level three or four areas should not travel beyond their council boundaries unless they were required to do so for ""essential reasons"". These reasons include work which cannot be done from home, education, local outdoor exercise, healthcare or caring responsibilities, and essential shopping where it is not possible locally. Ms Sturgeon also said those who lived in level one or two local authority areas ""must not travel"" into a level three or future level four council area except for ""essential purposes"". Travel between level one and level two areas is permitted but people are asked to ""minimise unnecessary journeys"". People who live alone or people who live with only children under 18 - for example single parents - can form an ""extended household"" with people who live in another home. This means a retired person who lives alone could form a ""bubble"" with their grown-up child and their family. It can also apply to couples who do not live together. But if one member of the household tests positive for Covid, every member of the extended group should isolate for 14 days. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said extended households can continue to meet even if one lives in a level two area, and the other in a level three area. But he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""I would urge individuals in that situation to exercise the greatest degree of care and caution."" This was a popular question as many people care for elderly relatives in different council areas. People who live in level three areas should avoid any unnecessary travel outside the local authority area. However, there are a number of exceptions, including to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, such as an elderly relative. Childcare is also one of the exceptions to the travel rule, with existing arrangements that are in place with relatives also deemed ""essential"". No, people should not travel into or out of a level three area for holidays or visits. There are exceptions for those who must travel for work, education, health or attending weddings or funerals which require an overnight stay. The Scottish government says a full refund should be offered to people who booked holiday homes but could not stay in them due to holiday restrictions. People should avoid any unnecessary travel between Scotland and England, according to Scottish government guidance. England is due to go into lockdown on Thursday, forcing the closure of non-essential shops, indoor and outdoor leisure facilities, entertainment venues, hair and beauty salons. The lockdown will last until at least 2 December so it is likely the Santa experience will be cancelled. People with a trade are still allowed to visit homes to carry out work and removal companies can also continue to go about their business. Mobile hairdresser are also allowed to operate in level three areas as long as they follow the government guidance on staff and customer safety. Funerals fall into the ""essential"" category so Alison would be able to travel into Edinburgh, a level three area, from Fife, which is in level two, on this occasion. However, only 20 people can attend, households should stay at least two metres apart and mourners should wear face coverings. The neighbouring councils of East Ayrshire and East Renfrewshire are both level three areas. One of the exemptions to the travel rule allows for ""local outdoor informal exercise such as walking, cycling or running"". However, we put this particular question to the Scottish government and they said it would not be permitted as travelling from Kilmarnock to Giffnock, for example, was not ""local"".

"The Woolpack, in Banstead in Surrey, one of Shepherd Neame's pubs ""Anger, soul-destroying, disheartening, disillusioned"": everything about the latest lockdown fills pub and brewery boss Jonathan Neame with dismay. ""This is the fourth change of strategy affecting hospitality within the last six weeks, and I don't think it will be the last,"" the chief executive of Shepherd Neame told the BBC. At least during the last lockdown, his 320-pub group in the south east of England could sell takeaway beer alongside takeaway meals, he said. Not this time. ""We're now being told that we cannot even sell a pint of ale as a takeaway. So we have got to tip that all down the drain."" The company, which says it is the oldest brewery businesses in the UK, has already made about 10% of staff redundant. It had been planning to bring back other staff when furlough ended last week. ""We are now telling them they have got to stay on furlough. I really worry for their mental health,"" Mr Neame said. ""The premise for lockdown now is to save the NHS. Once again we're sacrificing our freedoms and our economy because of what I think is a failure of public health. ""The people that are paying for it are people who are very fragile already, having gone through one lockdown and are just beginning to find a way back."" Jonathan Neame fears the latest lockdown will extend beyond a month Nor does he believe the one-month lockdown announced on Saturday is the end of it, believing there is now a real threat Christmas trading will be lost. ""I feel there will be a substantial number of more redundancies and particularly in city areas. It's difficult to see how city centres are going to be revived any time soon,"" he said. ""During lockdown one, there was terrific support for local pubs from local communities,"" he said. ""People want their pubs, they came back in droves. They want to see the pubs survive and thrive. ""They want them to be there for their children's generation, so they bought into the take-home thing."" He said the government must review its restrictions on not allowing takeaway beer immediately. Mark Newcombe, chairman of Craufurd Arms Society, which runs the community-owned Craufurd Arms in Maidenhead, Berkshire, said it was ""ridiculous"" that his pub cannot serve takeaway pints when supermarkets can still sell alcohol. ""Last time we did a delivery service and a takeaway service and, although we weren't breaking even, at least it was bringing money in to the pub,"" he said. The Craufurd Arms, which specialises in real ales, does not serve food. ""Real ale does not have a long shelf life. Come Thursday, what hasn't been sold will have to be thrown away,"" said Mr Newcombe. ""Our unique selling point is our fine real ales. It's terrible. The takeaway pints kept the community involved,"" he said. ""We had spent so much money and time getting our pub safe for reopening, and now this. How do you plan? It could be four weeks, it could be five weeks, it could be until next January, we just don't know."" The Craufurd Arms is a community-owned pub in Maidenhead To try to avoid throwing its beer away, pub chain Wetherspoons is offering real ale on tap for 99p a pint at 750 venues in England until Wednesday night, in an effort to clear open barrels before the lockdown begins. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""The reality is that any real ales not sold between now and lockdown will have to be thrown away, so it is better that customers can enjoy it at a great price while the pubs remain open. ""Each and every one of our pubs has all Covid safety measures in place and the numbers of people allowed in our pubs is restricted, so the lower price for real ales will have no effect on the safety of customers and staff."" Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra), said: ""Offering alcohol for takeaway was a lifeline for many pubs, and particularly breweries, during the first lockdown. ""It is a baffling and damaging decision to remove this option, particularly when other businesses such as supermarkets are able to continue to sell takeaway alcohol. ""Pubs and breweries were already reporting losses and the risk of closure before Christmas, and this will only add to the risk of permanent closures within the next few months. ""Camra and the entire pub and brewery industry is now urging the government to reverse this bizarre decision and ensure the survival of our pubs and breweries."" James Calder, chief executive of the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba), said urgent clarification on sales restrictions was needed from the government. ""As if a second national lockdown in England wasn't disastrous enough for pubs and independent breweries, the government has gone further this time around and introduced an unjustified restriction banning pubs from selling takeaway beer, a service which was the only source of income for many businesses during the summer lockdown,"" he said. ""This is baffling considering supermarkets will presumably still be allowed to sell packaged beer, whilst small breweries and pubs will not. ""It is nonsensical to impose these new restrictions when pubs have time and time again proved that they are Covid-secure, both during lockdown when takeaway was their only option and since pubs reopened on 4 July."" Mr Calder added that, in addition to clarification on sales restrictions, further support was needed for pubs, including the extension of business rate holidays and grants to breweries, and a VAT cut on independent brewery beer.

""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said. Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nicelast week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"". European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria. In pictures: Scene of gun attack Hunt for gunman after attack.

"The Woolpack, in Banstead in Surrey, one of Shepherd Neame's pubs ""Anger, soul-destroying, disheartening, disillusioned"": everything about the latest lockdown fills pub and brewery boss Jonathan Neame with dismay. ""This is the fourth change of strategy affecting hospitality within the last six weeks, and I don't think it will be the last,"" the chief executive of Shepherd Neame told the BBC. At least during the last lockdown, his 320-pub group in the south east of England could sell takeaway beer alongside takeaway meals, he said. Not this time. ""We're now being told that we cannot even sell a pint of ale as a takeaway. So we have got to tip that all down the drain."" The company, which says it is the oldest brewery businesses in the UK, has already made about 10% of staff redundant. It had been planning to bring back other staff when furlough ended last week. ""We are now telling them they have got to stay on furlough. I really worry for their mental health,"" Mr Neame said. ""The premise for lockdown now is to save the NHS. Once again we're sacrificing our freedoms and our economy because of what I think is a failure of public health. ""The people that are paying for it are people who are very fragile already, having gone through one lockdown and are just beginning to find a way back."" Jonathan Neame fears the latest lockdown will extend beyond a month Nor does he believe the one-month lockdown announced on Saturday is the end of it, believing there is now a real threat Christmas trading will be lost. ""I feel there will be a substantial number of more redundancies and particularly in city areas. It's difficult to see how city centres are going to be revived any time soon,"" he said. ""During lockdown one, there was terrific support for local pubs from local communities,"" he said. ""People want their pubs, they came back in droves. They want to see the pubs survive and thrive. ""They want them to be there for their children's generation, so they bought into the take-home thing."" He said the government must review its restrictions on not allowing takeaway beer immediately. Mark Newcombe, chairman of Craufurd Arms Society, which runs the community-owned Craufurd Arms in Maidenhead, Berkshire, said it was ""ridiculous"" that his pub cannot serve takeaway pints when supermarkets can still sell alcohol. ""Last time we did a delivery service and a takeaway service and, although we weren't breaking even, at least it was bringing money in to the pub,"" he said. The Craufurd Arms, which specialises in real ales, does not serve food. ""Real ale does not have a long shelf life. Come Thursday, what hasn't been sold will have to be thrown away,"" said Mr Newcombe. ""Our unique selling point is our fine real ales. It's terrible. The takeaway pints kept the community involved,"" he said. ""We had spent so much money and time getting our pub safe for reopening, and now this. How do you plan? It could be four weeks, it could be five weeks, it could be until next January, we just don't know."" The Craufurd Arms is a community-owned pub in Maidenhead To try to avoid throwing its beer away, pub chain Wetherspoons is offering real ale on tap for 99p a pint at 750 venues in England until Wednesday night, in an effort to clear open barrels before the lockdown begins. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""The reality is that any real ales not sold between now and lockdown will have to be thrown away, so it is better that customers can enjoy it at a great price while the pubs remain open. ""Each and every one of our pubs has all Covid safety measures in place and the numbers of people allowed in our pubs is restricted, so the lower price for real ales will have no effect on the safety of customers and staff."" Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra), said: ""Offering alcohol for takeaway was a lifeline for many pubs, and particularly breweries, during the first lockdown. ""It is a baffling and damaging decision to remove this option, particularly when other businesses such as supermarkets are able to continue to sell takeaway alcohol. ""Pubs and breweries were already reporting losses and the risk of closure before Christmas, and this will only add to the risk of permanent closures within the next few months. ""Camra and the entire pub and brewery industry is now urging the government to reverse this bizarre decision and ensure the survival of our pubs and breweries."" James Calder, chief executive of the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba), said urgent clarification on sales restrictions was needed from the government. ""As if a second national lockdown in England wasn't disastrous enough for pubs and independent breweries, the government has gone further this time around and introduced an unjustified restriction banning pubs from selling takeaway beer, a service which was the only source of income for many businesses during the summer lockdown,"" he said. ""This is baffling considering supermarkets will presumably still be allowed to sell packaged beer, whilst small breweries and pubs will not. ""It is nonsensical to impose these new restrictions when pubs have time and time again proved that they are Covid-secure, both during lockdown when takeaway was their only option and since pubs reopened on 4 July."" Mr Calder added that, in addition to clarification on sales restrictions, further support was needed for pubs, including the extension of business rate holidays and grants to breweries, and a VAT cut on independent brewery beer.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First minister faces 'dilemma' over lockdown decision The furlough scheme will be available if there is a Covid-19 lockdown in Scotland in the future, the prime minister has suggested. Boris Johnson announced an extension of the job support scheme to 2 December as tough measures were imposed in England. Nicola Sturgeon said decisions on any Scottish lockdown may depend on when this funding would be available. Mr Johnson has now told MPs that the furlough scheme would ""continue to be available wherever it is needed"". Ms Sturgeon said this would be ""very welcome"" - but added she was ""seeking urgent confirmation from the Treasury that it will be exactly as we asked for"". What are the new Covid rules where you live? A new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions came into force in Scotland on Monday. At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she would ""ideally"" want to assess the impact of the latest measures before deciding whether it would be necessary to impose harsher measures. She said there were ""some encouraging signs"" that restrictions were having an impact in Scotland, with the rate of increase in cases ""slowing down"". Boris Johnson was questioned on the issue in the Commons However, she said the position remained ""very fragile"" - and that she faced a ""dilemma"" about imposing stricter measures in the short-term if there was a time limit on the furlough scheme. She said: ""I made clear last week that we might yet have to go further and we can't rule out a move to level four for all parts of the country. ""While that decision would never be easy, there is no doubt that the availability of a more extensive furlough scheme would make it slightly less difficult, because workers would have more of their wages paid. ""The decision we have to weigh up is should we take the opportunity of more generous financial support to step harder on the brakes now, to drive down infections."" She added: ""It cannot be right that the only time that additional financial support is made available is when the south of England needs to go into a lockdown. That just isn't fair given the situation we are dealing with."" The UK-wide job support scheme - which covers up to 80% of workers wages' and has supportedhundreds of thousands of jobs north of the border- was extended to 2 December when Mr Johnson announced the four-week lockdown in England. However, the UK's devolved administrations complained that this ""time limited"" extension only covered the period when England is under enhanced restrictions. Wales has been in a ""firebreak"" lockdown since 23 October, and First Minister Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies therehad been repeatedly turned down. Calls for more flexibility over furlough were backed by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said in a speech on Monday morning that ""this has to be cleared up, now"". He said: ""It cannot be that furlough is not affordable when Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or parts of Northern England need to go into lockdown - but when all of England goes into lockdown, the taps are turned on. ""We all hope that by following the guidance and doing the right thing, a second Scottish lockdown will not be necessary. ""But if it is, the UK government must treat Scotland the same way as England."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Repeatedly questioned about the matter in the Commons, Mr Johnson said that the job support scheme applied across the UK. He initially refused to be drawn about whether this could continue to be the case beyond December, should local lockdowns be needed in other parts of the UK. However, he then appeared to confirm that this would be the case when asked by Mr Ross to ""explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one"". The prime minister said: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies not just now but in the future."" Pressed on the question by SNP MP Pete Wishart, he added: ""The furlough scheme will continue to be available wherever it is needed."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Payment holidays on credit cards, car finance, personal loans and pawned goods have been extended ahead of tougher coronavirus restrictions. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said customers who had not yet deferred a payment could now request one for up to six months. Those with short-term credit such as payday loans can defer for one month. ""It is important that consumer credit customers who can afford to do so continue to make repayments,"" it said. ""Borrowers should only take up this support if they need it."" It comes after the government announced a nationwide lockdown for England beginning on Thursday, which will force all non-essential retailers to close. Mortgage holidays extended for up to six months Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' The FCA had already brought in payment holidays for credit customers in April, extending them for three months in July. But it has now reviewed the rules - which apply across the UK - amid fears tougher restrictions will hit many more people's finances. The payment holidays will also apply to those with rent to own and buy-now pay-later deals, it said. In addition, anyone already benefitting from a payment deferral will be able to apply for a second deferral. However, the FCA would not comment on whether people could still have interest on the first Â£500 of their overdrafts waived. It said it would make a fuller statement in due course. ""We will work with trade bodies and lenders on how to implement these proposals as quickly as possible, and will make another announcement shortly,"" the FCA said of the payment deferrals. In the meantime, it said customers should not contact lenders who will provide information ""soon"" on how to apply for the support. It advised anyone still experiencing payment difficulties to speak to their lender to agree ""tailored support"". On Saturday, the FCA also announced plans toextend payment holidays for mortgage borrowers. The extension of payment holidays will be a relief to many people already in lockdown and facing a drop in income, and those just about to return to restrictions. But the theme running through this FCA statement is that a debt problem delayed is not a debt problem solved. The financial watchdog is stressing that deferrals should not be used unless they are really needed, and that ""tailored support"" may be a better option for many people. People who think they will only have a short-term squeeze on their finances will watch developments keenly and hope for an extension to interest-free overdrafts. Importantly, banks and other lenders have a duty to identify anyone who is vulnerable and make sure they are supported. As this crisis intensifies, the number of people falling into that category is likely to rise.

"Barry McGuigan (left) and Carl Frampton One of Barry McGuigan's sons has defended his family's management of boxer Carl Frampton during the nine years they worked together. Blain McGuigan said the fighter was paid a lot of money and was looked after very well. Mr McGuigan, 37, a boxing promoter and part-time musician, testified in the court case involving his father and Mr Frampton. ""We always wanted Carl to get the best money possible,"" he said. Mr McGuigan told the High Court that before the relationship turned sour, he regarded Mr Frampton as a friend. ""We worked very well togetherâ¦ close-knitâ¦ worked hard,"" he said. Monday was the 16th day of hearings in the case at the High Court in Belfast. Mr Frampton is suing Barry McGuigan and Cyclone Promotions over alleged unpaid earnings. Mr Frampton, on the other hand, has been accused of a breach of contract. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Their successful partnership broke down in August 2017. Barry McGuigan has three sons who all work in the boxing business - Jake, Shane and Blain, the eldest. One of the issues in the case is how much Mr Frampton was paid during the time he worked with the McGuigans from 2009 to 2017. Blain McGuigan told the court that the boxer was paid well and was always consulted about financial matters. ""Carl was always kept informed,"" he said. ""My dad insisted on him having the ability to check up on anything."" Blain McGuigan told the court Carl Frampton was paid well and was always consulted about financial matters Mr McGuigan was asked about a Frampton fight in New York in 2016 which was attended by a number of celebrities including the golfer Rory McIlroy. An issue was raised earlier in the case about whether or not celebrities were given free tickets for major fights or asked to pay for them. When this was put to Mr McGuigan, he said: ""I remember Rory didn't pay for his individual ticket."" However, he said the golfer may have paid for his friends and security team to attend the fight. ""That's really standard. Big-time celebrities would pay for additional tickets,"" he said. When asked for his view on Mr Frampton's new management company MTK Global, Mr McGuigan said: ""I don't think they're a good influence around sport."" The case will continue on Tuesday when Blain McGuigan is scheduled to face cross-examination.

"All payments made in error through Stormont's emergency Covid grant scheme will be recovered, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said. A Â£10,000 payment was sent automatically to any business in receipt of small business rates relief, but some were found to be ineligible. Mrs Dodds said of the 452 payments made incorrectly, 74 have been recouped by her department. Three Sinn FÃ©in offices each mistakenly received Â£10,000. They were repaid but the delay in returning the payments hasled to the resignations of four party members. Former Foyle MP and Irish senator Elisha McCallion and West Tyrone MLA Catherine Kelly were among those who stepped down. No Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politicians received the payment but a landlord who rents an office to DUP MP Paul Girvan received a grant, however this has now been repaid. Fourth Sinn FÃ©in resignation over Covid grant money Ex-Sinn FÃ©in MP resigns over Covid grant money Sinn FÃ©in received Covid business grant First Minister Arlene Foster has said she supports a call for police to investigate delays in repaying Covid support payments made in error. Mrs Foster told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme her party could not ""deal with a situation where tenants are taking responsibility for their landlords' actions"". ""It's not the fact that people received the money in error, it's the fact that the money hadn't been returned after seven months."" Arlene Foster said there were questions over how long it took Sinn FÃ©in to repay the money In a statement issued on Monday, Cinq Properties Ltd, which rents office space to Mr Girvan, confirmed it did ""receive an unsolicited Â£10,000 small business grant earlier this year"". ""However, it has now transpired that the company was not entitled to this grant,"" the firm said. ""Several attempts were made to repay the funds and the Â£10,000 was repaid to an account of the Department of Finance on Friday."" Last week, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the ""incorrect"" payments came to the attention of the party's leadership on Monday 26 and Tuesday 27 October and were repaid on those dates. On Friday, it emerged Gary Middleton from the DUP had asked police to carry out a criminal investigation into the delayed repayments. The PSNI said it wasconsidering whether a criminal investigation is required. ""I think Gary is right to report this to the police,"" Mrs Foster said on Monday. ""The money is not theirs, the money was received in error and therefore it should have been returned."" She added that public representatives have ""particular duty"" over public funds. ""It's up to the police, of course, whether they decide to instigate a criminal investigation but I absolutely support my party colleague in the complaint he has made."" Payments were also sent to52 wind turbine owners who were ineligible. Appearing in the assembly on Monday to face MLAs about the matter, Mrs Dodds defended her department's handling of the scheme. She said ineligible payments issued amounted to less than 2% of all grants approved by the Department of the Economy back in March. ""I am content my department took the necessary and swift action to support tens of thousands of businesses and jobs under threat caused by Covid-19,"" she added. ""My department is committed to undertaking a post-scheme evaluation and will put in a place a process."" Catherine Kelly was a signatory for an account into which a payment was made The small business rates relief grant scheme closed on 20 October. ""Payments made in error will be recovered and we will be writing to everyone that we identify as being ineligible for payment and asking them to return the money,"" insisted the minister. ""It is important that we have proper accountability for taxpayers' money and indeed particularly important at a time like this when so many businesses and individuals are suffering."" The controversy was first revealed by the BBC's Stephen Nolan Show last week. Following Ms Kelly's resignation, Sinn FÃ©in's leader said the party's examination of the matter was now complete. Meanwhile Sinn FÃ©in have seven days to replace Ms Kelly as MLA for West Tyrone once her resignation letter has been handed in.

"This video can not be played There's a critical role for parents to play - education minister Schools have reopened after an extended half-term break. Theyclosed on 19 Octoberas part of tighter Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Northern Ireland Executive. Ascoronavirus cases continue to rise, extra safety measures will be in place, including the mandatory wearing of face coverings for post-primary pupils on school transport. The education minister said on Monday he is ""not envisaging exams being cancelled"". ""It is particularly important that we have compatibility and portability with the rest of the United Kingdom,"" he said during a visit to Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor, County Down. ""This is not something we can go on a solo run because particularly when it comes to universities and jobs, our students are going to be competing with those from different parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland and elsewhere."" He said his department had asked CCEA to look at ""contingency arrangements"" and said it was likely there would be ""a range of mitigations, some of which have been announced already."" Exams have been scheduled forone week later than normal in 2021. Mr Weir again stressed that keeping schools open remained his key priority and urged people not to congregate at school gates when dropping off pupils. But he said parents and carers ""are at the heart of fighting the virus and minimising any disruption to education"". Peter Weir said that transmission of the virus in schools remains low He asked parents and carers to practise social distancing, wear a mask and try to avoid going beyond the school gate unless an appointment has been made. As for pupils, he asked them to have face coverings with them at all times, practise good hand hygiene and not to eat or share food on transport. ""I know from speaking to parents, carers and teachers that they want their children to be in school,"" the education minister said. ""Face to face teaching is the best form of educational provision."" Eight more coronavirus-related deaths in NI Education minister defends reopening of schools Mr Weir said he understood there may be concerns over children's wellbeing during the pandemic. ""Children and young people have missed so much this year already, not just in terms of learning but in socialising with their friends, taking part in sports and other activities,"" he said. ""I know that the overwhelming desire of parents and carers is to maintain a full return to school and I thank them for all the sacrifices they are making in very difficult circumstances."" Caroline McCarthy, from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, said teachers are feeling anxious and concerned about the return to school. ""Protecting children's education actually goes hand in hand with protecting the staff in schools,"" she told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster. ""When we closed for the extended Halloween break for the children, some some schools were suffering serious staff shortages and I think the anxiety of staff within schools has to be acknowledged as well."" Ms McCarthy also called for the wearing of masks to be extended to the school environment in post-primary schools. First Minister Arlene Foster said she agreed with her party colleague Peter Weir that school was ""the best place for our young people to be"". ""We said they would be back at school by the 2nd of November and they are,"" she told Good Morning Ulster. ""I, of course, understand the concerns that I hear from some of the teachers unions, however, it is very important for our young people that they are back at school.""  2,030Positive Covid cases in schools 519Schools with at least one positive Covid case out of 1,035 total schools 302Schools with a single positive case 237Schools with a cluster of two to five cases 69Schools with a cluster of more than five cases There have beenconfirmed Covid-19 cases in half of Northern Ireland's schoolssince the start of term, according to the Public Health Agency.

Code eight can also be used if ""a pupil chooses not to attend school or parent chooses not to send their child to school on the advice of a medical professional as the child is self-isolating due to a significant underlying medical condition"". Using code eight is ""important to identify the number of pupils choosing to self-isolate due to Covid-19"", the DE guidance to schools said.

"What will the new rules for Wales be when the firebreak ends? The way Wales has been treated over cash for jobs during its firebreak compared to England is ""not fair at all"", says its first minister. Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies when a national lockdown was introduced in Wales were repeatedly turned down by the UK Treasury. In October, the UK government paid up to 60% of furlough pay - including in the first week of the Wales firebreak. It will now rise back to 80% across the UK asEngland's lockdown begins. ""When things change in England they change their minds about the furlough plan. And that's not fair,"" said Mr Drakeford. While welcoming the extension of furlough, he added: ""When we were asking it was impossible to do it. Now when they have made new decisions in England it is possible."" He said written requests to Chancellor Rishi Sunak prior to the all-Wales lockdown for additional job support measures were rebuffed. It included a request to bring forward the planned replacement for furlough in Wales - the new Job Support Scheme - to cover the Wales firebreak. ""I got an answer quickly to say that was not possible for a number of technical reasons and so no,"" Mr Drakeford toldBBC Radio Cymru. England faces a new lockdown from Thursday for a month. Eligible people in Wales will also benefit form the furlough extension - as well as from a decision toextend mortgage payment holidays. The Treasury said Wales was not being treated differently to England. A spokesman added: ""It is now clear that much broader restrictions are needed right across the country to contain the virus, so we have extended our financial support across the UK to help millions of people continue to provide for their families."" Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Firebreak to end regardless of new England lockdown Has devolution helped or hampered Covid response? Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the Welsh Government did not ask for a furlough extension, instead the request was related to the Job Support Scheme - which was due to replace furlough. Hetweeted, attaching a copy of the first minister's letter to the chancellor,external: ""They asked for a different scheme to be brought forward having already been told that it was impossible."" In a response to the comments, fired back on social media,external, the Welsh Government said Mr Hart ""has his facts wrong"". ""We have repeatedly asked and called for furlough to be extended to support workers and businesses in Wales,"" said Welsh Government officials. Mr Drakeford's cabinet has been meeting on Sunday to discuss the impact of the month-long lockdown in England. Wales' firebreak will end on 9 November - and the date will not change as a result of the prime minister's announcement on Saturday night, he said. But the English lockdown ""creates a new context"", Mr Drakeford said. He used the example of pubs in Wrexham serving until 22:00 GMT after the firebreak while pubs in Chester are still closed. If that attracts people over the border ""is that going to create problems for the police in Wales?"" he said. Mr Drakeford said he raised the issue with UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove on Saturday. ""He said it would be illegal for people in England to travel outside England during the lockdown period they will have,"" said Mr Drakeford. Health Minister Vaughan Gething toldBBC Breakfastthat England's restrictions, as he understood them, meant ""normal travel won't be possible into England because of their four week decision"". A new set of ""national rules"" across Wales is due to be announced on Monday. Non-essential shops have been closed in Wales, as well as pubs, restaurants and hotels The furlough extension has been a bone of contention between the Welsh and UK governments. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme. Mr Drakeford previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak but his requests were turned down. Mr Sunak also declined a request for the new Job Support Scheme (JSS) - which will cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. Allow Twitter content?

But on Saturday, the furlough scheme was extended until England's lockdown ends on 2 December, which will include a return to the previous 80% level. Under the scheme, the government pays 80% of the salaries of staff who were kept on by their employer while unable to work, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. The furlough extension and the English lockdown has to be approved by MPs - they will vote on the measures on Wednesday. Ian Price, Wales' director of business group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said a lot of businesses had already made decisions in terms of redundancies, ahead of the furlough extension announcement. ""It won't have stopped those decisions being made but I think it'll ensure that not more people are made redundant during the month of November,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said: ""I welcome the chancellor's swift action to support businesses in England, but it is regrettable that Welsh workers were not prioritised in the same way. ""People across Wales have been made redundant in recent days due to the UK government's dithering."" Meanwhile, Conservativemember of the Senedd (MS), Andrew RT Davies, said society needed to learn to live with coronavirus and avoid lockdowns that harm the economy. ""I still don't believe that a lockdown is the solution,"" he told theBBC's Politics Wales. ""Actually a lockdown is only introduced when governments have lost control of the situation and we have to accept that."" No go: Guests from England won't be able to travel to this Carmarthenshire holiday site for the next month Mark Hadley says the England announcement - even with furlough - will hit his family's holiday accommodation business hard. They run a self-catering and guesthouse site in Llandovery in Carmarthenshire. He said cancelledÂ bookings at Llanerchindda Farm will now top Â£250,000 this year, due to Covid restrictions. He said that was on an annual turnover of Â£340,000 - so it amounts to almost 75% of his business. ""Ninety-nine per cent plus of our business comes from England,"" he said. ""Now that people will not be able to travel from England, it really means that we will be remaining pretty much closed right until the beginning of December at the very least. ""It's a worst case scenario. We lost out the half-term weeks, which we cancelled over Â£20,000 of bookings over those two weeks and three weekends.Â ""We missed out on that and now we'll miss out again because we can't get anyone coming from over the border. It's a double whammy for us."" Covid cancellations have cost the family business Â£250,000 this year, says Mark Hadley, on the right with Martin and Lynn Hadley He said the problems he faces are being mirrored across the tourism and hospitality sector in Wales, but he understood governments both in Wales and the UK were under pressure to act. ""It's such a difficult situation isn't it? I can see there is a massive health agenda and a massive potential problem for the NHS. I would not like to be in their boat,"" he said. ""Could it have been handled better? Well, maybe."" Mr Hadley said he welcomed the extension to the furlough scheme during the England lockdown, as it meant his staff were ""secure for now"". But he added: ""Support for business, although they make it out to beÂ massive, it is minimal. ""For our compensation for the firebreak we're guarenteed hopefully a Â£1,000 - possibly Â£3,000 if we get the discretionary top-up - but nobody in our local authority can tell me how they work that discretionary amount out. ""We will be out of pocket, there are no two ways about it."" People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak Non-essential shops and hospitality will have to close in England for four weeks, until 2 December. But unlike the restrictions in spring, schools, colleges and universities will be allowed to stay open. After 2 December, the restrictions would be eased and regions would go back to the tiered system, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. Elsewhere,Scotland's new tiered system of restrictions,externalwill come into force at 06:00 on Monday. In Northern Ireland,external, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks on 16 October with the exception of takeaways and deliveries. Schools were closed for two weeks.

Our live page today was put together by: Lauren Turner, Chris Clayton, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Kate Whannel and Francesca Gillett. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Conservative MP
Bob Seely voiced concerns about coronavirus data the government has been using
and asked Boris Johnson to âpublish in full, the four studies that have gone
into the work this weekendâ. At Saturdayâs
government briefing, as the case for the new England lockdown was being made, a
chart was used showing potential paths of the daily death count over the
coming months. The most
eye-catching showed a peak of just above 4,000 deaths a day (roughly four times
the figure during the worst days of the first wave). The rest
were lower but still peaked at roughly double the level seen earlier this year. These curves were
all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that
followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case
planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then,
England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the
epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. On the day the
chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the
previous week. That is far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most
pessimistic model. But it is only a
little better than the most optimistic of the models, which still described a
very high level of deaths through the winter. Models like these
describe possible futures, if certain assumptions turn out to be true â but
they do not predict the future. Mr Johnson went to the House of Commons to update MPs, after announcing a national lockdown on Saturday Boris Johnson went before MPs this afternoon to defend his decision to introduce four weeks of national lockdown in England. The question and answer session has just finished. This is what happened:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent âShould I stay or should I go?â. Thatâs the question for students as the lockdown in England approaches. Universities are saying students will have to stay in their university accommodation, but the National Union of Students says they should have the choice to go home to their family âsupport networksâ before the lockdown comes into force this week. Universities do not want a campus exodus - and say that the government guidelines mean students should stay put until the end of term and the Christmas holidays. But the same government guidelines, issued alongside the announcement of the new restrictions, also suggest more online teaching rather than face-to-face classes. ""Universities and adult education settings should consider moving to increased levels of online learning where possible,â say the rules of the new lockdown. This does not mean more studying from home, say the universities. They are still waiting for a decision from the government about what is going to happen about the Christmas holidays - and long-awaited guidelines for how 1.2 million students will be safely able to travel home without spreading the virus. And universities want students to wait where they are - rather than making their own decisions about heading home. Read more here.

The guidance says you must not meet socially indoors with anyone unless you live with them, or if they're part of your support bubble. A support bubble is when a single-adult household joins another household - they can still visit each other and stay overnight. So unless you live with your partner or they're in your chosen bubble, meeting up for sex is off the cards. But the rules differ depending on where in the UK you are. Read more on this storyhere: Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter I've spent a lot of time this year coveringthe human impact of viral coronavirus conspiracy theories. Most recently, I exclusivelyinterviewed Sebastian Shemirani. His mum is one of the leaders of Britain's conspiracy community â and he told me about the impact that that is having on public health - and their relationship. Reporting on conspiracy theories is not about clamping down on healthy political discussion or legitimate concerns about the impact of restrictions on the economy and mental health. And of course there are valid debates about the still-developing science. But the kinds of stories I hear about are something else entirely. They are tales of sinister plots - supposed plans to implant microchips in the world's population to kill or enslave billions. Or completely unscientific ideas - that the virus somehow doesn't exist and that health experts are all wrong. These ideas appear to be having an impact on families across the country. Sebastian's was one of thousands of messages I've received from people who fear they are losing loved ones down the rabbit hole of online conspiracy. How can you tackle conspiracy theories with loved ones? And why do I cover the human impact of misinformation? Iâve written more about thishere. Get in touch if you want to tell me about the impact coronavirus conspiracy theories have had on your life at Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk or follow @mariannaspring. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross asks the prime minister if the furlough scheme will be available to other nations of the UK ""if in future the science demands that lockdowns are required anywhere in the country"". ""If he can't give that commitment will he explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one,"" he says. Boris Johnson replies: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies, not just now but in the future."" SNP Pete Wishart asks the PM to confirm that ""if the Scottish government required furlough funds beyond 2 December that will be available to Scotland"". ""The furlough scheme will continued to be available wherever it is needed,"" Boris Johnson replies. Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy says a local mum has texted her and is terrified because she works in a supermarket and has only recently returned to work - after having shielded because she has a serious medical condition. She says that as lockdown has now returned, the woman is worried that if she stays at home again she will lose her job, but if she doesn't she will lose her life. Ms Creasy asks what employment protection the PM is going to offer those who are clinically vulnerable in jobs that cannot be furloughed, so that people don't have to choose between their lives and their livelihoods. The PM says he would like to study the case that she mentions ""because what we're saying to those who are clinically vulnerable is that they should work from home and I'd be grateful if she'd send me the details of that case, so we can establish what kind of help she would be entitled to"". ""She should be entitled to furlough,"" he says. Conservative Saqib Bhatti asks the PM to do everything he can ""to ensure we have a normal Christmas and that households are able to mix on 25 December"". Boris Johnson says there are many religious celebrations coming up in December including Diwali and Hanukkah. He says he wants ""people to have as normal a Christmas as possible"". ""That is why it is important for the country to follow the measures,"" he says.

He says that in 2018, one of his constituents, a consultant cardiologist, took his own life. ""He was at the cutting edge of medical treatment but alas could not cope with the pressure that he faced,"" says Gareth Johnson. He asks whether the PM agrees that it's vital to do as much as possible for clinicians' welfare. Boris Johnson says he is ""deeply sorry"" to hear of the death, and said: ""All I can say is that we're doing everything we can to support NHS, care for its staff, their wellbeing and their mental health ""I would urge anybody within the NHS who is aware of a colleague who is struggling with their mental health to come forward and seek help."" If you or someone you know is affected by mental health issues,these organisations may be able to help.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There's a significant row over the support given to people whose workplaces are closed because of lockdown. The UK government has extended its full furlough scheme - giving 80% of pay to people who can't work. But that is only in place until 2 December - when the lockdown in England is due to end. We've seen decisions taken at different points by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They have the powers to make health decisions, but don't have the financial ability to pay furlough because they can't borrow money. So they rely on the Treasury for the funding. There is now a coalition building in support of furlough being promised to all parts of the UK when they go into lockdown. The SNP Scottish Government has called for such an approach â as have the Scottish Tories. The Labour Welsh Government is angry the decision was made after Englandâs position changed â after being refused when Wales announced its circuit-break last month. At the moment, the Treasury won't commit to that. Boris Johnson has been ducking the substance of the questions asked in this debate so far. Some in Whitehall are nervous about writing a blank cheque when they will not have power over the decisions taken. But expect considerable pressure to come from the devolved governments. Reality Check On 31 October, coronavirus test capacity hit 525,282,according to government data,external. At the beginning of September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set a target to scale up testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. The figures show this has now been met. However, it is important to note that ""capacity"" means how many tests labs can process in theory. In reality, the number of tests actually processed is significantly lower. On 31 October, out of a lab capacity of 525,282, the number of tests processed was 292,573. This is low, but not quite as low as some dates in June when labs were processing just a third of what they had capacity to do. ""Why can't pubs sell takeaway beer to go with their takeaway food,"" asks Conservative Mark Pawsey, noting that the months in the run-up to Christmas are particularly important for some venues. Boris Johnson says a number of measures are needed to reduce the infection rate and adds ""when you start unpicking one bit a lot of the rest of it comes out"". He says that if the measures are properly enforced, the infection rate should come down and pubs will be able to do Christmas business. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures, which showed there had been 18,950 new positive tests and a further 136 deaths. Our graphs show the seven-day average number of cases and deaths. To find out how many cases there are in your area, head here. Conservative MP, and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says he ""strongly supports these painful measures"". He asks if the new lockdown in England will be accompanied by weekly testing of all NHS staff. ""We are rolling out testing of NHS staff as fast as we possibly can,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says the aim is to regularly test those in ""vulnerable institutions"" including hospitals, care homes, schools and universities. Tory MP Bob Blackman asks the prime minister to set out the criteria that he will use to ensure the new lockdown is lifted on 2 December. Boris Johnson says: ""The R is above 1 but it is not much above 1 and if we work hard between now and the 2 December I believe that we can get it below 1. ""But whatever happens these restrictions end on 2 December and any further 
measures will be a matter for this House of Commons."" Conservative MP (and former minister) Andrea Leadsom says she will ""very reluctantly"" be supporting the new lockdown measures but has concerns about the restrictions. She emphasises the impact on mental health including those in care homes who are missing family or business people ""seeing their life's efforts in ruins"". She urges the PM to ensure the next lockdown is ""a compassionate lockdown"". Boris Johnson replies that the government has put Â£12bn into supporting mental healthcare. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Two households in Wales can form a bubble after firebreak, said the first minister Two households in Wales will be able to form a bubble and meet at home after the 17-day firebreak ends. First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced some of the rules that will be in place from 9 November. There will be no travel restrictions within Wales, but people will not be able to leave the country except for essential purposes such as work during England's four-week lockdown. Groups of 15 will be allowed to meet for organised indoors activities. All businesses that were closed throughout the firebreak will be able to reopen, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But it is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be required to operate, prompting concerns from the sector. Q&A: What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Shops, pubs and gyms to reopen at end of firebreak Furlough backlash over rejected firebreak pleas Up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors for organised activities under the rules, which will be reviewed in a fortnight. But Health Minister Vaughan Gething suggested people would not be allowed to meet others from outside their household bubble in private gardens. Plaid Cymru said ministers should consider a phased reopening of hospitality, while the Welsh Conservatives welcomed some changes but called for clarity for businesses. The first minister said plans for the ""unexpected"" English lockdown,which is due to start on Thursday, have an impact on the next steps following the stay-at-home period in Wales. ""The English lockdown will have an impact on people who live in Wales but work in England, on companies operating in both England and Wales and on businesses trading along the border. ""It's really important that as we open up, Wales doesn't become an escape for people seeking to circumvent the new tighter restrictions imposed by the prime minister."" Meanwhile, the UK government said it would work with leaders from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on a joint approach to what will happen over the Christmas period. From 9 November, people will be able to meet others from their extended household bubble at home. There will be new arrangements in other indoors settings - but Mr Drakeford said there would be further consideration of how hospitality operates in light of the English lockdown. This video can not be played The community living by different Covid lockdown rules After Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that England would go into a month-long lockdown, the Welsh Government reiterated Wales' version would end on 9 November. During Wales' firebreak lockdown, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops have been required to shut, and people were told to stay at home. Supermarkets were instructed to stop selling non-essential items, and travel was restricted except for a limited set of reasons such as work and education, known as reasonable excuses. As well as shops and hospitality, churches will be able to reopen and local authority services will resume ""based on local circumstances"". Robert Jones said it had been hard not seeing his grandchildren Robert Jones from Ystrad Mynach agreed with the firebreak strategy, but said it had been hard not seeing his grandchildren. ""This virus got to be hit on the head one way or another, and they've got to stop people from England coming into Wales, and people from Wales going into England,"" he said. Following today's announcement on household bubbles, he said: ""I've got grandkids living in Cardiff, so I'll be able to see them again, won't I."" Jemma Hall said it had been difficult not seeing her family during lockdown. ""I haven't seen my family in months and I've only really seen a portion of my friends, and mainly ones that live up here, and that's only been outdoors and stuff. So it's been quite a horrible time."" Chelly Jones is trying to ""cheer everybody up"" with Christmas decorations after lockdown Chelly Jones, who runs the Stanton House Inn in Chirk, Wrexham, on the English border, has been putting up Christmas decorations ready for the pub to reopen to ""try and cheer everybody up"". ""It's been hard for everybody, we've all missed our families,"" she said. ""We'll have a bit of fun, Covid or not. It can't beat us. We can't lose Christmas. ""It's about families and we've got to try and do something for the community to cheer them up. We've got to make Christmas the best we can."" Retailers have been required to shut during the firebreak lockdown People in Wales will be subject to the same ban on international travel as people in England. But the first minister said people living in Wales could go on holiday in Wales when the Covid firebreak comes to an end. Mr Drakeford said: ""I can confirm that people will be able to travel within Wales, they won't be confined to their local authority area as was the case during the firebreak."" He added that ""tourism will be able to reopen"". Mr Drakeford said people would only see the benefits of the short lockdown if they ask in the weeks to come ""not 'what can I do' but 'what should I do'."" He said that would help ""to bring coronavirus under control and to give us a pathway through to Christmas and beyond."" All businesses closed during the firebreak will be able to reopen Mr Drakeford stressed that people who live and work on different sides of the Wales-England border would still be able to travel between the two nations. The Welsh Government will introduce a ""restricted list of essential purposes"" to allow people to travel between the countries which Mr Drakeford said would be ""the same broad system on both sides of the border"". He added: ""People who live in Wales but work in England will have a reasonable reason for travelling to work. ""And people who live in England and work in Wales really clearly have a reasonable excuse for coming across the border to work here. ""But it will be a restricted list of essential purposes, rather than the normal toing and froing across the border that you would have seen in less fraught and difficult times"". Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was ""surprised"" to learn about England's lockdown from newspapers at the weekend. The first minister said the first he knew of Mr Johnson's announcement were press reports. While repeating his call for more regular meetings, he added he was not ""criticising anybody for making these difficult decisions in their own circumstances"". He and health minister Vaughan Gething took part in a meeting chaired by Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove on Monday morning. This heat map shows how the case rate has increased since the summer The latest seven-day rolling average of case rates, since the firebreak started, shows on average cases in Wales have risen by 258.5 per 100,000 people. They have risen more sharply in the south Wales valleys areas, with Merthyr Tydfil, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent the highest, as we can see from a heat map. Mr Drakeford said restrictions had ""arrested the speed"" of the rise in cases and efforts had made a ""real and positive difference"" in ensuring that the firebreak did not need to be longer and more severe. Vaughan Gething suggested there will not be prescriptive rules for meeting individuals away from the home Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested that meeting people in household gardens would not be permitted under the new rules. He indicated that household bubble rules for home meetings would apply to the garden as well as the rest of the house. Asked on BBC Radio Wales if people would be able to meet their parents in a back garden and at a social distance, Mr Gething said: ""No. ""The reality is if you're in someone's garden you're likely to need to go indoors particularly this time of the year."" But he said they could be seen at a ""social distance in a range of venues"", such as a park or a walk, or ""all sorts of things that people do"". ""We're not going to write a set of prescriptive rules to try to determine how people can or can't see people in that sort of way,"" he added. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should consider a ""a two-week buffer period"" when the firebreak ends. Ministers should look at a ""phased reopening"" of the hospitality industry with pubs and bars closing at 18:00. Mr Price said it was ""crucial"" that financial support was available to the hospitality sector. PM warns of virus deaths 'twice as bad' as spring Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Senedd Conservative leader Paul Davies welcomed some of the changes but said the Welsh Government needed to ""explain urgently to businesses what support they will be able to access for the remainder of the Wales-wide lockdown and under the new national restrictions"". ""The Welsh Government needs to be bolder in getting core NHS activities back up and running to avoid other public health crises in devastating illnesses including cancer and heart disease."" The Conservatives have been criticised for vocally opposing Wales' 17-day firebreak lockdown, only for a month-long lockdown for England to be announced by the Conservative government at the weekend. Mr Davies told BBC Wales:  ""What happens in England of course is a matter for the UK government and Boris Johnson, and his government has made that decision. What happens here in Wales is a different matter, and that's what devolution is about. ""The first minister and the prime minister have said that devolved governments sometimes take different decisions, and we've made it absolutely clear that we think this temporary national lockdown was not the right thing to do. ""But we are where we are, and we do hope we will see the suppression of this virus."" We're seeing a reset on the messaging here, with less emphasis on detailed rules and more on each of us exercising our personal judgement about what is the right thing to do. The more complex rules are, the easier it is for them to become derailed by confusion or controversy - the first weekend of lockdown was overwhelmed by the essential/non-essential row, for example. Government advisers talk a lot about finding ""sustainable interventions"", in other words something that can stop the spread of the virus that we can also live with longer term. Interventions are always more sustainable with public ""buy-in"" than without it, but once again the radically diverging approaches of politicians in different parts of the UK will raise questions - even as those same politicians try to agree a four-nation approach to what happens at Christmas. It is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be allowed to reopen on 9 November A spokeswoman for the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective said clarity had been promised on Monday on the terms their businesses would be able to reopen, but it had not been given. ""The first minister has announced that hospitality can reopen from 9 November but not announced under what restrictions,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Prior to firebreak we were clear in our consultations with Welsh Government that a return to previous restrictions including individual households only, 10pm curfew and so on would lead to a slow strangulation of the sector and businesses."" ""We need to make crucial decisions about the future viability of our businesses. Without knowing under what circumstances we can trade, this is impossible."" Ian Price of business lobby group CBI Wales said: ""The first minister has placed great emphasis on personal compliance and changing individual behaviours as we continue to live with the pandemic. ""Having already invested significant sums in making workplaces safe for staff and customers, business stands ready to play its part in making that a success."" Ben Francis of the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales said the organisation was ""pleased that there continues to be certainty that the firebreak will end on 9 November"".

"This video can not be played Two households in Wales can form a bubble after firebreak, said the first minister Two households in Wales will be able to form a bubble and meet at home after the 17-day firebreak ends. First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced some of the rules that will be in place from 9 November. There will be no travel restrictions within Wales, but people will not be able to leave the country except for essential purposes such as work during England's four-week lockdown. Groups of 15 will be allowed to meet for organised indoors activities. All businesses that were closed throughout the firebreak will be able to reopen, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But it is not clear under what terms pubs and restaurants will be required to operate, prompting concerns from the sector. Q&A: What can you do after Wales' firebreak ends? Shops, pubs and gyms to reopen at end of firebreak Furlough backlash over rejected firebreak pleas Up to 30 people will be able to meet outdoors for organised activities under the rules, which will be reviewed in a fortnight. But Health Minister Vaughan Gething suggested people would not be allowed to meet others from outside their household bubble in private gardens. Plaid Cymru said ministers should consider a phased reopening of hospitality, while the Welsh Conservatives welcomed some changes but called for clarity for businesses. The first minister said plans for the ""unexpected"" English lockdown,which is due to start on Thursday, have an impact on the next steps following the stay-at-home period in Wales. ""The English lockdown will have an impact on people who live in Wales but work in England, on companies operating in both England and Wales and on businesses trading along the border. ""It's really important that as we open up, Wales doesn't become an escape for people seeking to circumvent the new tighter restrictions imposed by the prime minister."" Meanwhile, the UK government said it would work with leaders from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on a joint approach to what will happen over the Christmas period. From 9 November, people will be able to meet others from their extended household bubble at home. There will be new arrangements in other indoors settings - but Mr Drakeford said there would be further consideration of how hospitality operates in light of the English lockdown. This video can not be played The community living by different Covid lockdown rules After Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that England would go into a month-long lockdown, the Welsh Government reiterated Wales' version would end on 9 November. During Wales' firebreak lockdown, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops have been required to shut, and people were told to stay at home. Supermarkets were instructed to stop selling non-essential items, and travel was restricted except for a limited set of reasons such as work and education, known as reasonable excuses. As well as shops and hospitality, churches will be able to reopen and local authority services will resume ""based on local circumstances"".

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: First minister faces 'dilemma' over lockdown decision The furlough scheme will be available if there is a Covid-19 lockdown in Scotland in the future, the prime minister has suggested. Boris Johnson announced an extension of the job support scheme to 2 December as tough measures were imposed in England. Nicola Sturgeon said decisions on any Scottish lockdown may depend on when this funding would be available. Mr Johnson has now told MPs that the furlough scheme would ""continue to be available wherever it is needed"". Ms Sturgeon said this would be ""very welcome"" - but added she was ""seeking urgent confirmation from the Treasury that it will be exactly as we asked for"". What are the new Covid rules where you live? A new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions came into force in Scotland on Monday. At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she would ""ideally"" want to assess the impact of the latest measures before deciding whether it would be necessary to impose harsher measures. She said there were ""some encouraging signs"" that restrictions were having an impact in Scotland, with the rate of increase in cases ""slowing down"". Boris Johnson was questioned on the issue in the Commons However, she said the position remained ""very fragile"" - and that she faced a ""dilemma"" about imposing stricter measures in the short-term if there was a time limit on the furlough scheme. She said: ""I made clear last week that we might yet have to go further and we can't rule out a move to level four for all parts of the country. ""While that decision would never be easy, there is no doubt that the availability of a more extensive furlough scheme would make it slightly less difficult, because workers would have more of their wages paid. ""The decision we have to weigh up is should we take the opportunity of more generous financial support to step harder on the brakes now, to drive down infections."" She added: ""It cannot be right that the only time that additional financial support is made available is when the south of England needs to go into a lockdown. That just isn't fair given the situation we are dealing with."" The UK-wide job support scheme - which covers up to 80% of workers wages' and has supportedhundreds of thousands of jobs north of the border- was extended to 2 December when Mr Johnson announced the four-week lockdown in England. However, the UK's devolved administrations complained that this ""time limited"" extension only covered the period when England is under enhanced restrictions. Wales has been in a ""firebreak"" lockdown since 23 October, and First Minister Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies therehad been repeatedly turned down. Calls for more flexibility over furlough were backed by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said in a speech on Monday morning that ""this has to be cleared up, now"". He said: ""It cannot be that furlough is not affordable when Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or parts of Northern England need to go into lockdown - but when all of England goes into lockdown, the taps are turned on. ""We all hope that by following the guidance and doing the right thing, a second Scottish lockdown will not be necessary. ""But if it is, the UK government must treat Scotland the same way as England."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Repeatedly questioned about the matter in the Commons, Mr Johnson said that the job support scheme applied across the UK. He initially refused to be drawn about whether this could continue to be the case beyond December, should local lockdowns be needed in other parts of the UK. However, he then appeared to confirm that this would be the case when asked by Mr Ross to ""explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one"". The prime minister said: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies not just now but in the future."" Pressed on the question by SNP MP Pete Wishart, he added: ""The furlough scheme will continue to be available wherever it is needed."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Many self-employed claim they have been excluded from other support schemes The self-employed will be able to claim state aid of up to 80% of profits during the month-long lockdown, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. The rise is up from the current 40%, and will mean Â£4.5bn of government support for the self-employed between November and January, he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a backlash from within his own party over the new lockdown. That criticism included not doing enough to help the self-employed. It was also announced that businesses will continue to be able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans until 31 January, compared with a previous 30 November deadline for some of the programmes. England will enter a second lockdown on Thursday, which will  close restaurants, pubs and non-essential shops until at least 2 December, although unlike the first lockdown in late March and April, schools will stay open for all pupils. Under the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS), eligible workers can currently claim support covering 40% of their average earnings from last year to cover a period of three months, capped at Â£3,750. The new enhanced scheme will open for applications from the end of November, and cover 80% of trading profits for that month. Including the new higher November grant, it means the November-January payment will be at 55% of profits, up to a maximum of Â£5,160. However, as eligibility criteria will be the same as for previous grants, critics said it still meant as many as 2.9 million freelancers, contractors and newly self employed people would remain excluded. What help are self-employed people getting? Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) said the new measures will give ""vital support"" to some, but accused the government of still ""wilfully ignoring a third of self-employed"". Derek Cribb, the group's chief executive, said it was important to note the enhanced 80% rate only covered November, mirroring the extended furlough scheme. ""It is vital that if the furlough scheme is extended, SEISS should be adjusted accordingly,"" he said. ""It is deeply troubling that the government has still not fixed the devastating gaps in SEISS, despite urgent recommendations from the Treasury Select Committee. After so many calls to resolve the problems, it now looks as if the government is wilfully ignoring a third of the self-employed. ""The first lockdown drastically undermined self-employed incomes, and the gaps in government support led to the biggest drop in self-employed numbers on record. ""Unless government wakes up to the problem and supports all the self-employed, the second lockdown will accelerate the decline and hollow out swathes of this vital sector."" Small businesses have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to go even further than Mondays announcement The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also warned that too many self-employed people remain excluded. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""This is a five-million strong community that drives our economy forward, but the government has insisted that large swathes of it do not warrant any help where income is concerned. ""We have sadly already seen 250,000 self-employed people stop working and become economically inactive, a figure which is set to continue rising. ""Fundamentally, the business support landscape still remains too much of a mixed picture - a fact made all the more concerning given that this fresh lockdown in England is taking effect during the critical festive season."" Monday's announcement increases help for many people - but, then again, many people still say it is not nearly enough. The National Audit Office said last week up to 2.9 million people have been excluded from both the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme since March - some newly self-employed, others set up as limited companies and still others denied furlough. NAO head Gareth Davies said it was ""clear that many people have lost earnings and have not been able to access support"". Some have had little or no income for months, ineligible even for benefits. Yet they've paid their taxes and say they deserve the same level of support as everyone else. According to the ExcludedUK Facebook group, of 2,400 members in a recent poll, 79% described themselves as having trouble sleeping, 81% as being anxious or stressed, 58% had low self-esteem, 48% were depressed; and 14% had had suicidal thoughts - over three times the norm in the wider population. The cross-party Treasury Committee said in June these exclusions ""cannot be right"" and Sir Keir Starmer told the CBI conference today the chancellor must close the gaps in support. But so far those gaps remain wide open. What extra help will the self-employed get? What happens when furlough ends?

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" Covid-19 deaths could be twice as high over the winter as they were in the first wave of the pandemic, PM Boris Johnson has told MPs. In a Commons statement he said there was ""no alternative"", as he seeks to win support for a planned four-week lockdown in England from Thursday. But Mr Johnson explained he was ""right to try every possible option"" before ordering people to stay at home. Labour has said it will back the lockdown but criticised the delay. Mr Johnson announced at a Downing Street news conference on Saturday that strict measures will include closing pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship. Live updates: PM to address MPs over England lockdown Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' Government resists calls to shut England's schools However, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick confirmed that moving house will still be allowed during the restrictions, adding that removal firms, estate agents and tradespeople can continue to work but must follow Covid safety guidelines. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK-wide furlough scheme, which had been due to end on 31 October, was extended until December ""to give businesses that ease at this difficult time"". He said it was his ""expectation and hope"" that the English lockdown would be ""sufficient"" to ""exit back into the tiered approach"" in a month's time. Business Secretary Alok Sharma defended the government's lockdown decision at the Confederation of British Industry Annual Conference on Monday, saying: ""The cost of inaction would be greater than the action."" This video can not be played The business secretary says a second lockdown is England is ""regrettable"". In his address to MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson was expected to say: ""Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave. ""Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level."" Religious groups in England criticise worship ban Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Mr Johnson was expected to acknowledge that some MPs believe ""we should have reached this decision earlier"", but will defend his earlier policy of trying to control the virus with ""strong local action and strong local leadership"". Prof Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the forecast death toll data provided to the government included a ""range of predictions"". ""From the multiple models they are all really showing unacceptable levels of death and the fact NHS services will be overwhelmed within weeks,"" he said. The prime minister was due to tell MPs that the government will ""seek to ease restrictions"" on 2 December and return to the current three-tier system. On Sunday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove saidthe lockdown could be extendedif it took longer to bring the transmission rate of the virus down. Those around the prime minister say he sees a moral and medical responsibility to act, in order to avert disaster. The thrust of Boris Johnson's argument in the Commons later will keep returning to the data presented to the country on Saturday night: the range of projections, all bleak, about the grim consequences of doing nothing. But he'll face sharp, and opposing, questions from behind him, on his backbenches, and opposite him, from Labour and others. Among the swirl of questions there is testing and tracing, the furlough scheme, the prospect of the English lockdown being extended and an exit strategy. Lives, liberties and livelihoods: the intensely difficult decisions, with a huge amount at stake, are not going away. Mr Johnson faces a rebellion from several senior Tory MPs, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, when they vote on the measures on Wednesday. Mr Brady told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour the ""repetitive cycle"" of lockdowns was damaging livelihoods, relationships and mental health.

Ex-party leader Iain Duncan Smith said the lockdown decision was a ""body blow"" and accused the government of ""giving in"" to scientific advisers. The BBC's Political editor Laura Kuenssberg spoke to Tory MPs ahead of the PM's statement, who she says were ""angry, not just about the decision, but about how it's been handled, and No 10's attitude to those arguing for a different course"".

Downing Street has said that MPs will also get to vote on the ""way forward"" and what should replace the new lockdown regulations when they expire at 00:01 GMT on 2 December. But the prime minister will have the support of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said the measures were ""necessary"" while criticising the government for delaying them and ensuring what would be a longer, harder lockdown.

"This video can not be played 'We are not going back to the full scale lockdown of March' The UK faces a ""medical and moral disaster"" unless tough action is taken now to stop the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told MPs there was ""no alternative"" but to introduce a national lockdown - which is due to begin on Thursday -  to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed. MPs will vote on the plans in the Commons on Wednesday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of a ""catastrophic failure of leadership"" over the pandemic. Sir Keir - who started calling fora short lockdown or circuit-breakerin October - criticised the government's ""inaction"", saying it meant the lockdown would be ""harder, longer and more damaging than it needed to be"". The prime minister was speaking in the Commons two days after announcing the lockdown at a televised press conference. Outlining the measures again, along with details of further support for businesses and jobs, Mr Johnson told MPs the government woulddouble its support from 40% to 80% of trading profitsfor the self-employed from next month - as well as extending the furlough scheme. Following earlier confusion over whether the furlough scheme would apply UK-wide, the PM suggested it would be available for parts of the UKwhere there is a Covid-19 lockdown in the future. Does the PM's lockdown 2.0 risk pleasing no-one? What are the latest lockdown plans? Lockdown 2.0: Your questions answered How many Covid cases are there in your area? He said the latest national restrictions would not be a return to the ""full-scale lockdown of March and April"", but he apologised for the ""anguish"" the restrictions would cause people and businesses. Mr Johnson also warned that without action ""the sick would be turned away because there was no room in our hospitals,"" with doctors and nurses potentially ""forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die"". On Monday, the UK recorded 18,950 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The PM said the lockdown regulations would end at 00:01 GMT on 2 December, with MPs given a vote on what should replace them. Mr Johnson insisted he had been right to ""try every possible option"" to get the virus under control at a local level before imposing a nationwide lockdown - and denied that the UK had been slower to act than other countries in Europe. Boris Johnson is stuck in between two groups. First, MPs on his own side who have become institutionally cross, but in the main, reluctantly swallow the government's plans, flaws and all. And second, MPs opposite who are frustrated at the government's handling of things, but don't disagree enough with the central features of the government's plan to try to block it. And so, the prime minister can proceed with lockdown 2.0, pleasing no one, but with not much standing in his way. Read more from Laurahere.

"Nigel Farage has applied to change the Brexit Party's name to Reform UK, promising to focus on dealing with the government's ""woeful"" Covid response. He said renewed lockdown would ""result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save"" and argued that ""building immunity"" would be more effective. The party leader also said there should be ""focused protection"" from coronavirus for the vulnerable. But Boris Johnson will tell MPs later there is ""no alternative"" to lockdown. From Thursday, pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship in England will close for four weeks, in an effort to stem the increase in infections.

Labour will back the government, although leader Sir Keir Starmer says it is bringing in the restrictions later than should have been the case. On Sunday, the UK recorded 23,254 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This isn't the first time Nigel Farage has raised the idea of rebranding the Brexit Party. Even before the results of last year's general election rolled in, he said his plan was to change its name into - guess what? - the Reform Party. He even claimed to have registered the new title. The idea was to change politics ""for good"", campaigning to overhaul the voting system and abolish the House of Lords. Now it seems Mr Farage is returning to the idea of a re-launch - this time with an anti-lockdown focus. Perhaps he sensed an opportunity to return to the political debate. It might cause some nerves in No 10. Mr Farage has posed a threat to mainstream parties - not least the Tories - in the past, espousing populist views which have at times shifted the national debate. Boris Johnson is attempting to find some middle ground between lockdown advocates and sceptics, with increasing push-back from the latter within his own party. There is a risk he ends up pleasing neither, and Mr Farage stands poised - as he has before - with an alternative view he'll have no qualms in expressing. Mr Farage set up the Brexit Party ahead of last year's European Parliament elections,winning 29 seats - the most of any UK party. In an email to supporters, he and party chairman Richard Tice said this had ""rescued Brexit and in so doing, restored some confidence in democracy in the UK"". While they were ""keeping a close eye"" on Mr Johnson ""to make sure he does not sell us down the river"" in any trade deal with the EU, they said it was time to ""apply our energy and resources to the other pressing issues facing the nation"". They applied last Friday to the Electoral Commission to rename the Brexit Party as Reform UK. Their email to supporters said: ""The government has dug itself into a hole [with coronavirus] and rather than admit its mistakes, it keeps on digging. ""The new national lockdown will result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save, as non-Covid patients with cancer, cardiac, lung and other illnesses have treatments delayed or cancelled again. Suicides are soaring. Businesses and jobs are being destroyed."" Mr Farage and Mr Tice said the UK shouldfollow the Great Barrington Declaration,which calls for ""focused protection"" for the elderly and other groups particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, while others continue to live relatively normally. Their email said: ""The rest of the population should, with simple hygiene measures and a dose of common sense, get on with life - this way we build immunity in the population. We must learn to live with the virus not hide in fear of it."" Treatments were ""getting better"" and survival rates were improving, they added. On Sunday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the lockdown in England could be extended if it took longer than four weeks to bring the transmission rate of the virus down. The government has said schools will remain open, with Mr Johnson expected to tell the Commons later that he was ""right to try every possible option"" - including region-by-region restrictions - before moving on to a national measures. After an extension to the furlough scheme was announced for England, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross called for similar support to be available if the country needed to go into a full lockdown. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown will end on 9 November, as planned. Schools in Northern Ireland reopen on Monday after an extended half-term break, while other restrictions including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants continue until 13 November.

"The Woolpack, in Banstead in Surrey, one of Shepherd Neame's pubs ""Anger, soul-destroying, disheartening, disillusioned"": everything about the latest lockdown fills pub and brewery boss Jonathan Neame with dismay. ""This is the fourth change of strategy affecting hospitality within the last six weeks, and I don't think it will be the last,"" the chief executive of Shepherd Neame told the BBC. At least during the last lockdown, his 320-pub group in the south east of England could sell takeaway beer alongside takeaway meals, he said. Not this time. ""We're now being told that we cannot even sell a pint of ale as a takeaway. So we have got to tip that all down the drain."" The company, which says it is the oldest brewery businesses in the UK, has already made about 10% of staff redundant. It had been planning to bring back other staff when furlough ended last week. ""We are now telling them they have got to stay on furlough. I really worry for their mental health,"" Mr Neame said. ""The premise for lockdown now is to save the NHS. Once again we're sacrificing our freedoms and our economy because of what I think is a failure of public health. ""The people that are paying for it are people who are very fragile already, having gone through one lockdown and are just beginning to find a way back."" Jonathan Neame fears the latest lockdown will extend beyond a month Nor does he believe the one-month lockdown announced on Saturday is the end of it, believing there is now a real threat Christmas trading will be lost. ""I feel there will be a substantial number of more redundancies and particularly in city areas. It's difficult to see how city centres are going to be revived any time soon,"" he said. ""During lockdown one, there was terrific support for local pubs from local communities,"" he said. ""People want their pubs, they came back in droves. They want to see the pubs survive and thrive. ""They want them to be there for their children's generation, so they bought into the take-home thing."" He said the government must review its restrictions on not allowing takeaway beer immediately. Mark Newcombe, chairman of Craufurd Arms Society, which runs the community-owned Craufurd Arms in Maidenhead, Berkshire, said it was ""ridiculous"" that his pub cannot serve takeaway pints when supermarkets can still sell alcohol. ""Last time we did a delivery service and a takeaway service and, although we weren't breaking even, at least it was bringing money in to the pub,"" he said. The Craufurd Arms, which specialises in real ales, does not serve food. ""Real ale does not have a long shelf life. Come Thursday, what hasn't been sold will have to be thrown away,"" said Mr Newcombe. ""Our unique selling point is our fine real ales. It's terrible. The takeaway pints kept the community involved,"" he said. ""We had spent so much money and time getting our pub safe for reopening, and now this. How do you plan? It could be four weeks, it could be five weeks, it could be until next January, we just don't know."" The Craufurd Arms is a community-owned pub in Maidenhead To try to avoid throwing its beer away, pub chain Wetherspoons is offering real ale on tap for 99p a pint at 750 venues in England until Wednesday night, in an effort to clear open barrels before the lockdown begins. Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""The reality is that any real ales not sold between now and lockdown will have to be thrown away, so it is better that customers can enjoy it at a great price while the pubs remain open. ""Each and every one of our pubs has all Covid safety measures in place and the numbers of people allowed in our pubs is restricted, so the lower price for real ales will have no effect on the safety of customers and staff."" Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra), said: ""Offering alcohol for takeaway was a lifeline for many pubs, and particularly breweries, during the first lockdown. ""It is a baffling and damaging decision to remove this option, particularly when other businesses such as supermarkets are able to continue to sell takeaway alcohol. ""Pubs and breweries were already reporting losses and the risk of closure before Christmas, and this will only add to the risk of permanent closures within the next few months. ""Camra and the entire pub and brewery industry is now urging the government to reverse this bizarre decision and ensure the survival of our pubs and breweries."" James Calder, chief executive of the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba), said urgent clarification on sales restrictions was needed from the government. ""As if a second national lockdown in England wasn't disastrous enough for pubs and independent breweries, the government has gone further this time around and introduced an unjustified restriction banning pubs from selling takeaway beer, a service which was the only source of income for many businesses during the summer lockdown,"" he said. ""This is baffling considering supermarkets will presumably still be allowed to sell packaged beer, whilst small breweries and pubs will not. ""It is nonsensical to impose these new restrictions when pubs have time and time again proved that they are Covid-secure, both during lockdown when takeaway was their only option and since pubs reopened on 4 July."" Mr Calder added that, in addition to clarification on sales restrictions, further support was needed for pubs, including the extension of business rate holidays and grants to breweries, and a VAT cut on independent brewery beer.

" By Jessica Lussenhop By Jessica Lussenhop By Jessica Lussenhop When Dr Ebun Ekunwe, 72, cast her ballot in 2016, she did so for Donald Trump. It was an act, she says, of “total rebellion” against the Democratic Party. “I fervently supported Bernie Sanders,” she says. “I felt that the nomination was actually stolen from him. So we revolted against our own party.” When Trump won, the retired doctor and pastor from Carrollton, Texas, hoped that he would rise to the occasion. Then, after white nationalists marched in Charlottesville in August 2017 and clashed violently with counter protesters, Trump made his now-infamous remark that “there were very fine people, on both sides”. “For the purpose of healing the country, a leader does not go out and say that,” she says. “He has made the country about himself. He is reading the Constitution as ‘me, the president’ instead of ‘we, the people’.” This year, even though she could vote by post, she wants to cast her ballot for Joe Biden in person. “I want my voice to count,” she says. But doing so is not without risks for her in the pandemic - Ebun has sickle cell anaemia. She is managing her condition, but it will be on her mind as she casts her vote. Ebun relies on Obamacare - another name for the 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. Without it, she says, she wouldn’t have been able to afford her cataract surgery The pandemic has meant she has been unable to visit her doctor, and while her medical background enables her to take care of herself, she worries about others with pre-existing conditions. “I don’t know how they live from day-to-day,” she sighs. “They might be quietly, desperately saying, ‘Let nothing happen to my health’.” Before two bullets sailed through the window of his Portland cafe in early October, John Jackson says he was on the fence over how to cast his vote. “I don’t follow party lines. I vote with my heart,” he says. John, 55, who served as a US Marine before a career in corporate America, now runs a small chain of restaurants in Oregon called Heroes American Cafe. The restaurants feature patriotic decor, and offer discounts to military veterans, police officers, firemen and teachers. He opened his most recent location in Portland during the pandemic, and well into the ongoing racial justice protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. According to John, his business partner received an ominous warning phone call at the restaurant a few days before the so-called “Day of Rage” anti-racism protest on 11 October. John had also heard rumours that his cafe was being called ""pro-police"" on social media. “First, we're pro-heroes,” he says. “That doesn't include things like policemen that kneel on people's necks and kill them. We call those zeros.” On the night of the protest, statues of Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were pulled down, and the entrance to the Oregon Historical Society was smashed. At around 22:00, John got a phone call from his building superintendent, telling him someone had shot through the windows of the cafe. “It was surreal,” he says. “You don’t expect people to escalate to that level.” When he heard President Trump’s comments criticising local officials over their handling of the protests, and suggesting use of federal law enforcement, he decided the president had earned another term. “I had an epiphany - we need strong leadership,” says John. ""I'm not saying that Trump is perfect leadership. [But] I'd heard him talk about Portland many times - how the violence needed to be squashed. And when I experienced it personally, it just connected. The violence couldn't go unchecked.” Nevertheless, he is dismayed to be labelled as being against Black Lives Matter. He is mixed-race - his father was black and his mother, German - and he says he has had his fair share of unpleasant interactions with police. “There is systematic racism, and Black Lives Matter is an important movement. It may be the match that ignites the change that we do need.” Earlier this year, 19-year-old Kayleah from San Diego, California, became something of a minor social media star. As the election began heating up, she started posting TikToks from her TRUMP 2020 flag-adorned bedroom, that not only praised the president, but mocked liberals like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her account, kp.thepatriot, now has more than 32,000 followers. When she first joined TikTok, Kayleah quickly stumbled across conservative influencers whose views inspired her to learn more about Trump's policies. Kayleah has always leaned to the right - she's an avid hunter who is pro-life and pro-gun rights. But entering the political TikTok universe made her a far more ardent - and vocal - Trump supporter, and she started making political TikToks of her own. ""The more I made, the more and more I learned about politics,"" she says. In liberal San Diego, her views were not always appreciated by her classmates. She would get into arguments with them in the TikTok comments. But as her profile grew, she was garnering attention from all over the country. Things took a turn. “The beginning of this year was more scary than it was exciting,” she says. “I started getting death threats and rape threats, and whether or not they're credible or not, I don't know.” She deleted her Instagram account, where most of the threats were coming in, and took a month off of TikTok. Before returning to it, she went through some of her videos with her father. “He pointed out that when I would respond to people, I'd be kind of snarky, or I would not really pay much attention to what they were saying. I was too concerned with telling them what I believed,” she says. “He said, ‘You can't have an educated conversation with somebody if you're not educated on both sides of the political spectrum on that issue.’” She’s now softened her tone towards people who disagree with her. The rhetoric has calmed, and she’s made friends with people on both sides of the political spectrum. Her tagline now reads, ""The Tolerant Republican"". Jeanne Crumly, 68, describes her husband as, “Not political, very quiet, non-confrontational.” But when he heard that TC Energy, the company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline, was coming to their farm in Holt County, northeastern Nebraska, to do a “cultural study”, he marched to the edge of one of their fields - corn stalks ready for harvest towering overhead - with a gigantic “Biden-Harris” campaign sign. He staked it into the ground right along the proposed route of the pipeline. For 12 years, the Crumlys have been fighting the pipeline, which would carry tar sand oil from Canada through Nebraska towards refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. They see it as a threat to the long-term environmental health of the land where they and their son raise cattle, corn, soybeans and potatoes. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama rejected the plan for the pipeline. But shortly after taking office, Donald Trump signed an executive order resurrecting the project. “He reversed it with no rationale. And that's ended up in court cases for four years,” says Jeanne. “While that is personal to me, it's just an example of what the current administration has done in terms of getting whatever they want.” Jeanne also says that between Trump’s trade wars with China and disruptions in the food chain due to the pandemic, this administration has made life harder for farmers like her. She says they will not break even on this year’s harvest and that the cattle market has become so volatile in the pandemic, she has no idea what to expect when the time comes to sell in December. “Confidence makes a huge impact,” she says. “To function in an economy that is so erratic and so illogical brings anxiety no matter what the final dollar line is.” Mark Ondishin, 55, was working at his tyre and car repair shop in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, when he started experiencing chest pain. As the feeling radiated into his shoulder, he knew something very bad was happening. In hospital, it was confirmed he was having a heart attack. A year later, he credits the doctors, nurses and med-evac team for saving his life. He also credits his health insurance. “I’m a living example of why you need to have insurance,” he says. In 2016, Mark was worried about how he was going to continue providing health insurance for his employees. His premiums had shot through the roof, and he laid the blame squarely on Obamacare’s impact on the insurance market. When Trump won, he eagerly awaited the new administration's promised healthcare reforms. Four years later, those reforms have failed to materialise. His premiums are as high as ever, but he blames Congress for that, not Trump. “Did I see a real plan there? No, I didn't really see a plan, but at least I saw an attempt to try to fix it,” he says. Business has been booming, he says, and with the extra money he's been making, he can pay for the benefits. “Everybody’s making a living,” he says. And he thanks Trump for that. Even the pandemic hasn’t hurt Mark’s bottom line. He credits Trump for the Paycheck Protection Program, which sent the businessman $50,000 (£38,590) within 36 hours of submitting his application. He used it to give his shop a much-needed facelift. It was the mid-term elections of 2018 and Antonne Henshaw, a graduate student, was on the campus of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey. He and a friend were approached by a small group of children carrying signs that said, “Did you vote today? Because I can’t.” “Excuse me, misters, did y’all vote today?” one of the boys asked them. Antonne and his friend looked blankly at one another. “Yeah,” they replied uneasily. “Yeah, we voted.” But it wasn't true. Antonne had just been released from prison and was prohibited by law from voting in New Jersey. When he was 18, he shot and killed another boy in a street fight. Thirty years in prison meant that he had never had the right to vote. Recalling the moment he was confronted by the children on campus, Antonne says: “I didn’t want to disappoint them and have to explain that I’m a convicted felon. I should never have to lie about something that should have never been taken away from me. It's a fundamental right.” This is the story Antonne told the New Jersey state legislature as he lobbied for a change in law that would allow formerly incarcerated men and women who are still on probation or parole to vote. At a ceremony in mid-March, he stood at a podium in a suit and tie, and filled out his voter registration form. He was the second parolee in the state to register. ""I've been waiting my whole life for this moment,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""It didn't disappoint."" When he casts the very first vote of his life, it will be for Joe Biden, the very person who penned the 1990s-era crime bill that eliminated funding for the college classes Antonne was trying to take in prison. It also codified the mandatory minimum sentences and no-early release policies that he says kept him incarcerated for as long as he was. Antonne can’t stand the “dog whistle” talk of law and order from the Trump administration, so he’s making what he calls a “utilitarian” choice. He’ll be looking to Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris, a former California prosecutor, to admit to mistakes in the tough-on-crime era. “I'm not asking you to relax mandatory minimums, I'm saying… realise [prisoners were] unjustly and unfairly targeted based on where they live, what their economic status was, race, class, creed and colour,” he says. When Jackie, 30, a nurse practitioner in emergency medicine, thinks back on all the patients she’s treated for Covid-19, the beginning is a bit of a blur. She travelled from her home in Madison, Wisconsin, to a hospital in New York City in late March, when case numbers were exploding. Hospitals were overwhelmed, and she says that at hers, there were only 60 beds for 100 patients. “I was going around and checking on patients sitting in a hallway chair who had been there for two days. They were sitting, on oxygen, without a place to lay down, without a place to get any rest. And I had to make sure they weren't dead,” she says. “I did that for two weeks.” Once things calmed a bit, there were moments of levity. She remembers one patient who, after three weeks on a ventilator, improved enough so that he could breathe and move around on his own. Jackie, who does circus acrobatics as a hobby, hoisted herself into a handstand, balancing on the hands of another nurse from Tennessee who just happened to also do circus acrobatics. Dressed in her scrubs, gown, face shield and mask, she did the splits high in the air in front of the patient’s room. “We did a couple of partners tricks just to be like, ‘Hooray, he survived!’” she says. Jackie says that the man’s doctors recommended he go to a long-term acute care hospital. But he was undocumented and, without access to Medicare, it wasn’t clear how he could afford it. She doesn’t know what happened to him. A Covid survivor who can’t pay for his own recovery is just one reason Jackie has found herself rejecting both candidates. She believes both parties value money more than people, and that neither will handle the pandemic any better than the other at this point. “Covid is here, it's not going away. It doesn't matter who we elect any more,” she says. She says that one of the rallying calls from both the Republicans and Democrats throughout the pandemic has been the need to keep the economy alive. But she says this has been “without what I consider to be due regard to what that cost is.” When Jackie received her ballot, she wrote in her candidate of choice: “General strike”.  The Wildcatter Saloon in Katy, Texas, has a colourful history. Before Justin Whitfield, 47, bought it, rumour has it, it was an outlaw biker bar and a brothel that got wiretapped by the FBI. Finally, it turned into a legitimate bar and music venue. Six months after Justin took it over, in August 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit, devastating parts of the Texas coastline. “I lost my apartment, my house, my bar, my travel trailer, three cars,” he says. Luckily, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent him a cheque for more than $20,000 (£15,400), and within three weeks, he was able to host a concert in the bar’s expansive backyard. While the increasing frequency of storms like Hurricane Harvey are thought to be the result of climate change, Justin is sceptical of how much of that is due to human activity, and so he has no problem with President Donald Trump’s rollback of environmental regulations. “He's a businessman, so obviously his policies are not going to be the most environmentally safe, or the best routes. He's thinking bottom line, jobs, people's incomes,” Justin says. “From what I read [without Trump], our energy costs right now would be two to three times more, possibly. So it's saving all Americans across the board.” Justin reckons Trump’s personality flaws are not nearly as important as keeping the economy humming - and clamping down on the property damage and looting that has occurred in multiple cities since the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests. His father-in-law is a retired Houston police officer, and the Wildcatter recently served as the end destination for a “Back the Blue” car parade with more than 300 vehicles. “Most business owners I know are not going to support rioters and looters. We are not going to support destroying local businesses. We know how hard it takes to get there,” he says.

"All payments made in error through Stormont's emergency Covid grant scheme will be recovered, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said. A Â£10,000 payment was sent automatically to any business in receipt of small business rates relief, but some were found to be ineligible. Mrs Dodds said of the 452 payments made incorrectly, 74 have been recouped by her department. Three Sinn FÃ©in offices each mistakenly received Â£10,000. They were repaid but the delay in returning the payments hasled to the resignations of four party members. Former Foyle MP and Irish senator Elisha McCallion and West Tyrone MLA Catherine Kelly were among those who stepped down. No Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politicians received the payment but a landlord who rents an office to DUP MP Paul Girvan received a grant, however this has now been repaid. Fourth Sinn FÃ©in resignation over Covid grant money Ex-Sinn FÃ©in MP resigns over Covid grant money Sinn FÃ©in received Covid business grant First Minister Arlene Foster has said she supports a call for police to investigate delays in repaying Covid support payments made in error. Mrs Foster told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme her party could not ""deal with a situation where tenants are taking responsibility for their landlords' actions"". ""It's not the fact that people received the money in error, it's the fact that the money hadn't been returned after seven months."" Arlene Foster said there were questions over how long it took Sinn FÃ©in to repay the money In a statement issued on Monday, Cinq Properties Ltd, which rents office space to Mr Girvan, confirmed it did ""receive an unsolicited Â£10,000 small business grant earlier this year"". ""However, it has now transpired that the company was not entitled to this grant,"" the firm said. ""Several attempts were made to repay the funds and the Â£10,000 was repaid to an account of the Department of Finance on Friday."" Last week, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the ""incorrect"" payments came to the attention of the party's leadership on Monday 26 and Tuesday 27 October and were repaid on those dates. On Friday, it emerged Gary Middleton from the DUP had asked police to carry out a criminal investigation into the delayed repayments. The PSNI said it wasconsidering whether a criminal investigation is required. ""I think Gary is right to report this to the police,"" Mrs Foster said on Monday. ""The money is not theirs, the money was received in error and therefore it should have been returned."" She added that public representatives have ""particular duty"" over public funds. ""It's up to the police, of course, whether they decide to instigate a criminal investigation but I absolutely support my party colleague in the complaint he has made."" Payments were also sent to52 wind turbine owners who were ineligible. Appearing in the assembly on Monday to face MLAs about the matter, Mrs Dodds defended her department's handling of the scheme. She said ineligible payments issued amounted to less than 2% of all grants approved by the Department of the Economy back in March. ""I am content my department took the necessary and swift action to support tens of thousands of businesses and jobs under threat caused by Covid-19,"" she added. ""My department is committed to undertaking a post-scheme evaluation and will put in a place a process."" Catherine Kelly was a signatory for an account into which a payment was made The small business rates relief grant scheme closed on 20 October. ""Payments made in error will be recovered and we will be writing to everyone that we identify as being ineligible for payment and asking them to return the money,"" insisted the minister. ""It is important that we have proper accountability for taxpayers' money and indeed particularly important at a time like this when so many businesses and individuals are suffering."" The controversy was first revealed by the BBC's Stephen Nolan Show last week. Following Ms Kelly's resignation, Sinn FÃ©in's leader said the party's examination of the matter was now complete. Meanwhile Sinn FÃ©in have seven days to replace Ms Kelly as MLA for West Tyrone once her resignation letter has been handed in.

"A new lockdown in England is due to come into effect on Thursday 5 November, lasting until at least 2 December. Here are some of your questions about what the regulations will mean for you. You can meet one other person from another householdin an outdoor public place,external- those places include parks, beaches, the countryside, public gardens and playgrounds, but not private gardens. Children under school age, as well as those who need round-the-clock-care, do not count towards the total. So yes, two adults with babies can meet in a park. Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies cannot be held under the new lockdown rules, due to be in place until 2 December, unfortunately. That's whether they are at a church or elsewhere. There are very limited exceptions to this rule and the government is due to outline what these are on Monday when the full regulations are published. Support bubbles,externalare still in place during the new lockdown. Anyone who lives alone can join up with one other household, which can be of any number of people. It's advised that you form a bubble with someone who lives nearby to avoid unnecessary travel. Bubbles can also be formed with another household if a single adult lives with children who were under the age of 18 on 12 June 2020. And if someone shares custody of their child or children with someone they do not live with, they can have a bubble with the child's other parent in addition to their chosen support bubble. So, as long as your neighbour lives alone or with children under 18 and is not already in a bubble, other than for shared custody purposes, the answer is yes. Places like hotels and hostels are only going to be open for people who have to travel for work purposes. There are going to be a ""limited number of other exemptions"" set in law, the government has said. Also if you were planning a holiday rather than a business trip, you should bear in mind that the new rules state ""you should avoid all non-essential travel by private or public transport"". The government has said that certain businesses will have to close during the lockdown, with only those offering what are deemed essential services staying open. Those having to shut include what it called ""personal care facilities"", which are places like hairdressers and barbers, beauty and nail salons and spas. That was also the case during the first lockdown, earlier this year. In addition, mixing of households indoors is only allowed for very limited purposes - like childcare or providing other care - which would mean a mobile hairdresser could not visit your home. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has said that people will still be able to move house,whether they are renting or buying.,externalRemoval firms and estate agents can also carry on working but must follow Covid safety guidance. Places of worship are to be closed apart from in limited circumstances. This is for funerals, individual prayer, for broadcasts of acts of worship, formal childcare, voluntary and public services like blood donation or food banks, or for some support groups. They won't be open for normal services. And all indoor and outdoor leisure facilities - including gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools - will have to shut. People are being encouraged to exercise outside during the lockdown, in places like local parks. The new rules come into force at 00:01 GMT Thursday. From that point, overnight stays and holidays away from primary residences won't be allowed - in the UK or abroad. If you own a second home, you cannot stay in it. There are some specific exemptions, including if you have to stay away for work purposes or for education. It does depend where you are going however as, for example, no one is allowed to travel into Wales during the nation's current ""firebreak"" restrictions. And quarantine measures are in place for many overseas countries. Anyone currently abroad does not have to return home immediately, however, the government has said. Mortgage payment holidays are being extendedfor homeowners financially affected by the pandemic. Borrowers who have not yet had a mortgage holiday can request from their lender a pause in repayments, and that can last up to six months. Those who have had their payments deferred already can extend their mortgage holiday until they reach the six-month limit.

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring?

The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed.

That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

"Boris Johnson is addressing MPs over his plan for a new four-week lockdown across England from Thursday The NHS could be overwhelmed if no action is taken, with medical staff having to choose who to treat, he warns Pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship will be affected by the lockdown England will return to the regional tier system on 2 December when the measures end Several senior Tory MPs oppose the move but Labour says it will back the new measures Leaders from across the UK say they will ""work togetherâ on a ""joint approach to the Christmas period"" after diverging over Covid restrictions in recent weeks Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford says two households can form a ""bubble"" when its firebreak lockdown ends on 9 November Scotland's five-level system of Covid restrictions has come into force Edited by Chris Clayton and Lauren Turner That's all from our live coverage today. If you're just catching up, here are the latest coronavirus headlines:  We're about to end our live coverage for today. You can readour main story on coronavirus in the UK here,and come back tomorrow for more live coverage. Our live page today was put together by: Lauren Turner, Chris Clayton, Cherry Wilson, Ella Wills, Kate Whannel and Francesca Gillett. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Conservative MP
Bob Seely voiced concerns about coronavirus data the government has been using
and asked Boris Johnson to âpublish in full, the four studies that have gone
into the work this weekendâ. At Saturdayâs
government briefing, as the case for the new England lockdown was being made, a
chart was used showing potential paths of the daily death count over the
coming months. The most
eye-catching showed a peak of just above 4,000 deaths a day (roughly four times
the figure during the worst days of the first wave). The rest
were lower but still peaked at roughly double the level seen earlier this year. These curves were
all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that
followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case
planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then,
England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the
epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. On the day the
chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the
previous week. That is far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most
pessimistic model. But it is only a
little better than the most optimistic of the models, which still described a
very high level of deaths through the winter. Models like these
describe possible futures, if certain assumptions turn out to be true â but
they do not predict the future. Mr Johnson went to the House of Commons to update MPs, after announcing a national lockdown on Saturday Boris Johnson went before MPs this afternoon to defend his decision to introduce four weeks of national lockdown in England. The question and answer session has just finished. This is what happened:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent âShould I stay or should I go?â. Thatâs the question for students as the lockdown in England approaches. Universities are saying students will have to stay in their university accommodation, but the National Union of Students says they should have the choice to go home to their family âsupport networksâ before the lockdown comes into force this week. Universities do not want a campus exodus - and say that the government guidelines mean students should stay put until the end of term and the Christmas holidays. But the same government guidelines, issued alongside the announcement of the new restrictions, also suggest more online teaching rather than face-to-face classes. ""Universities and adult education settings should consider moving to increased levels of online learning where possible,â say the rules of the new lockdown. This does not mean more studying from home, say the universities. They are still waiting for a decision from the government about what is going to happen about the Christmas holidays - and long-awaited guidelines for how 1.2 million students will be safely able to travel home without spreading the virus. And universities want students to wait where they are - rather than making their own decisions about heading home. Read more here.

The guidance says you must not meet socially indoors with anyone unless you live with them, or if they're part of your support bubble. A support bubble is when a single-adult household joins another household - they can still visit each other and stay overnight. So unless you live with your partner or they're in your chosen bubble, meeting up for sex is off the cards. But the rules differ depending on where in the UK you are. Read more on this storyhere: Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter I've spent a lot of time this year coveringthe human impact of viral coronavirus conspiracy theories. Most recently, I exclusivelyinterviewed Sebastian Shemirani. His mum is one of the leaders of Britain's conspiracy community â and he told me about the impact that that is having on public health - and their relationship. Reporting on conspiracy theories is not about clamping down on healthy political discussion or legitimate concerns about the impact of restrictions on the economy and mental health. And of course there are valid debates about the still-developing science. But the kinds of stories I hear about are something else entirely. They are tales of sinister plots - supposed plans to implant microchips in the world's population to kill or enslave billions. Or completely unscientific ideas - that the virus somehow doesn't exist and that health experts are all wrong. These ideas appear to be having an impact on families across the country. Sebastian's was one of thousands of messages I've received from people who fear they are losing loved ones down the rabbit hole of online conspiracy. How can you tackle conspiracy theories with loved ones? And why do I cover the human impact of misinformation? Iâve written more about thishere. Get in touch if you want to tell me about the impact coronavirus conspiracy theories have had on your life at Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk or follow @mariannaspring. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross asks the prime minister if the furlough scheme will be available to other nations of the UK ""if in future the science demands that lockdowns are required anywhere in the country"". ""If he can't give that commitment will he explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one,"" he says. Boris Johnson replies: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies, not just now but in the future."" SNP Pete Wishart asks the PM to confirm that ""if the Scottish government required furlough funds beyond 2 December that will be available to Scotland"". ""The furlough scheme will continued to be available wherever it is needed,"" Boris Johnson replies. Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy says a local mum has texted her and is terrified because she works in a supermarket and has only recently returned to work - after having shielded because she has a serious medical condition. She says that as lockdown has now returned, the woman is worried that if she stays at home again she will lose her job, but if she doesn't she will lose her life. Ms Creasy asks what employment protection the PM is going to offer those who are clinically vulnerable in jobs that cannot be furloughed, so that people don't have to choose between their lives and their livelihoods. The PM says he would like to study the case that she mentions ""because what we're saying to those who are clinically vulnerable is that they should work from home and I'd be grateful if she'd send me the details of that case, so we can establish what kind of help she would be entitled to"". ""She should be entitled to furlough,"" he says. Conservative Saqib Bhatti asks the PM to do everything he can ""to ensure we have a normal Christmas and that households are able to mix on 25 December"". Boris Johnson says there are many religious celebrations coming up in December including Diwali and Hanukkah. He says he wants ""people to have as normal a Christmas as possible"". ""That is why it is important for the country to follow the measures,"" he says.

He says that in 2018, one of his constituents, a consultant cardiologist, took his own life. ""He was at the cutting edge of medical treatment but alas could not cope with the pressure that he faced,"" says Gareth Johnson. He asks whether the PM agrees that it's vital to do as much as possible for clinicians' welfare. Boris Johnson says he is ""deeply sorry"" to hear of the death, and said: ""All I can say is that we're doing everything we can to support NHS, care for its staff, their wellbeing and their mental health ""I would urge anybody within the NHS who is aware of a colleague who is struggling with their mental health to come forward and seek help."" If you or someone you know is affected by mental health issues,these organisations may be able to help.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There's a significant row over the support given to people whose workplaces are closed because of lockdown. The UK government has extended its full furlough scheme - giving 80% of pay to people who can't work. But that is only in place until 2 December - when the lockdown in England is due to end. We've seen decisions taken at different points by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They have the powers to make health decisions, but don't have the financial ability to pay furlough because they can't borrow money. So they rely on the Treasury for the funding. There is now a coalition building in support of furlough being promised to all parts of the UK when they go into lockdown. The SNP Scottish Government has called for such an approach â as have the Scottish Tories. The Labour Welsh Government is angry the decision was made after Englandâs position changed â after being refused when Wales announced its circuit-break last month. At the moment, the Treasury won't commit to that. Boris Johnson has been ducking the substance of the questions asked in this debate so far. Some in Whitehall are nervous about writing a blank cheque when they will not have power over the decisions taken. But expect considerable pressure to come from the devolved governments. Reality Check On 31 October, coronavirus test capacity hit 525,282,according to government data,external. At the beginning of September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set a target to scale up testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. The figures show this has now been met. However, it is important to note that ""capacity"" means how many tests labs can process in theory. In reality, the number of tests actually processed is significantly lower. On 31 October, out of a lab capacity of 525,282, the number of tests processed was 292,573. This is low, but not quite as low as some dates in June when labs were processing just a third of what they had capacity to do. ""Why can't pubs sell takeaway beer to go with their takeaway food,"" asks Conservative Mark Pawsey, noting that the months in the run-up to Christmas are particularly important for some venues. Boris Johnson says a number of measures are needed to reduce the infection rate and adds ""when you start unpicking one bit a lot of the rest of it comes out"". He says that if the measures are properly enforced, the infection rate should come down and pubs will be able to do Christmas business. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures, which showed there had been 18,950 new positive tests and a further 136 deaths. Our graphs show the seven-day average number of cases and deaths. To find out how many cases there are in your area, head here. Conservative MP, and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says he ""strongly supports these painful measures"". He asks if the new lockdown in England will be accompanied by weekly testing of all NHS staff. ""We are rolling out testing of NHS staff as fast as we possibly can,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says the aim is to regularly test those in ""vulnerable institutions"" including hospitals, care homes, schools and universities. Tory MP Bob Blackman asks the prime minister to set out the criteria that he will use to ensure the new lockdown is lifted on 2 December. Boris Johnson says: ""The R is above 1 but it is not much above 1 and if we work hard between now and the 2 December I believe that we can get it below 1. ""But whatever happens these restrictions end on 2 December and any further 
measures will be a matter for this House of Commons."" Conservative MP (and former minister) Andrea Leadsom says she will ""very reluctantly"" be supporting the new lockdown measures but has concerns about the restrictions. She emphasises the impact on mental health including those in care homes who are missing family or business people ""seeing their life's efforts in ruins"". She urges the PM to ensure the next lockdown is ""a compassionate lockdown"". Boris Johnson replies that the government has put Â£12bn into supporting mental healthcare. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" Covid-19 deaths could be twice as high over the winter as they were in the first wave of the pandemic, PM Boris Johnson has told MPs. In a Commons statement he said there was ""no alternative"", as he seeks to win support for a planned four-week lockdown in England from Thursday. But Mr Johnson explained he was ""right to try every possible option"" before ordering people to stay at home. Labour has said it will back the lockdown but criticised the delay. Mr Johnson announced at a Downing Street news conference on Saturday that strict measures will include closing pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship. Live updates: PM to address MPs over England lockdown Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' Government resists calls to shut England's schools However, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick confirmed that moving house will still be allowed during the restrictions, adding that removal firms, estate agents and tradespeople can continue to work but must follow Covid safety guidelines. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK-wide furlough scheme, which had been due to end on 31 October, was extended until December ""to give businesses that ease at this difficult time"". He said it was his ""expectation and hope"" that the English lockdown would be ""sufficient"" to ""exit back into the tiered approach"" in a month's time. Business Secretary Alok Sharma defended the government's lockdown decision at the Confederation of British Industry Annual Conference on Monday, saying: ""The cost of inaction would be greater than the action."" This video can not be played The business secretary says a second lockdown is England is ""regrettable"". In his address to MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson was expected to say: ""Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave. ""Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level."" Religious groups in England criticise worship ban Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Mr Johnson was expected to acknowledge that some MPs believe ""we should have reached this decision earlier"", but will defend his earlier policy of trying to control the virus with ""strong local action and strong local leadership"". Prof Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the forecast death toll data provided to the government included a ""range of predictions"". ""From the multiple models they are all really showing unacceptable levels of death and the fact NHS services will be overwhelmed within weeks,"" he said. The prime minister was due to tell MPs that the government will ""seek to ease restrictions"" on 2 December and return to the current three-tier system. On Sunday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove saidthe lockdown could be extendedif it took longer to bring the transmission rate of the virus down. Those around the prime minister say he sees a moral and medical responsibility to act, in order to avert disaster. The thrust of Boris Johnson's argument in the Commons later will keep returning to the data presented to the country on Saturday night: the range of projections, all bleak, about the grim consequences of doing nothing. But he'll face sharp, and opposing, questions from behind him, on his backbenches, and opposite him, from Labour and others. Among the swirl of questions there is testing and tracing, the furlough scheme, the prospect of the English lockdown being extended and an exit strategy. Lives, liberties and livelihoods: the intensely difficult decisions, with a huge amount at stake, are not going away. Mr Johnson faces a rebellion from several senior Tory MPs, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, when they vote on the measures on Wednesday. Mr Brady told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour the ""repetitive cycle"" of lockdowns was damaging livelihoods, relationships and mental health. People will be told to stay at home except for specific reasons These include work which cannot be done from home, childcare or education, exercise outdoors, medical reasons, essential shopping, providing care for vulnerable people or for volunteering, and visiting members of yoursupport bubble Meeting indoors or in private gardens will not be allowed, but individuals can meet one other person from another household outside in a public place.

Ex-party leader Iain Duncan Smith said the lockdown decision was a ""body blow"" and accused the government of ""giving in"" to scientific advisers. The BBC's Political editor Laura Kuenssberg spoke to Tory MPs ahead of the PM's statement, who she says were ""angry, not just about the decision, but about how it's been handled, and No 10's attitude to those arguing for a different course"".

Downing Street has said that MPs will also get to vote on the ""way forward"" and what should replace the new lockdown regulations when they expire at 00:01 GMT on 2 December. But the prime minister will have the support of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said the measures were ""necessary"" while criticising the government for delaying them and ensuring what would be a longer, harder lockdown. On Sunday, the UK recorded 23,254 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""Now is the time to take action"" Covid-19 deaths could be twice as high over the winter as they were in the first wave of the pandemic, PM Boris Johnson has told MPs. In a Commons statement he said there was ""no alternative"", as he seeks to win support for a planned four-week lockdown in England from Thursday. But Mr Johnson explained he was ""right to try every possible option"" before ordering people to stay at home. Labour has said it will back the lockdown but criticised the delay. Mr Johnson announced at a Downing Street news conference on Saturday that strict measures will include closing pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship. Live updates: PM to address MPs over England lockdown Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' Government resists calls to shut England's schools However, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick confirmed that moving house will still be allowed during the restrictions, adding that removal firms, estate agents and tradespeople can continue to work but must follow Covid safety guidelines. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK-wide furlough scheme, which had been due to end on 31 October, was extended until December ""to give businesses that ease at this difficult time"". He said it was his ""expectation and hope"" that the English lockdown would be ""sufficient"" to ""exit back into the tiered approach"" in a month's time. Business Secretary Alok Sharma defended the government's lockdown decision at the Confederation of British Industry Annual Conference on Monday, saying: ""The cost of inaction would be greater than the action."" This video can not be played The business secretary says a second lockdown is England is ""regrettable"". In his address to MPs in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson was expected to say: ""Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave. ""Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level."" Religious groups in England criticise worship ban Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Mr Johnson was expected to acknowledge that some MPs believe ""we should have reached this decision earlier"", but will defend his earlier policy of trying to control the virus with ""strong local action and strong local leadership"". Prof Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the forecast death toll data provided to the government included a ""range of predictions"". ""From the multiple models they are all really showing unacceptable levels of death and the fact NHS services will be overwhelmed within weeks,"" he said. The prime minister was due to tell MPs that the government will ""seek to ease restrictions"" on 2 December and return to the current three-tier system. On Sunday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove saidthe lockdown could be extendedif it took longer to bring the transmission rate of the virus down. Those around the prime minister say he sees a moral and medical responsibility to act, in order to avert disaster. The thrust of Boris Johnson's argument in the Commons later will keep returning to the data presented to the country on Saturday night: the range of projections, all bleak, about the grim consequences of doing nothing. But he'll face sharp, and opposing, questions from behind him, on his backbenches, and opposite him, from Labour and others. Among the swirl of questions there is testing and tracing, the furlough scheme, the prospect of the English lockdown being extended and an exit strategy. Lives, liberties and livelihoods: the intensely difficult decisions, with a huge amount at stake, are not going away. Mr Johnson faces a rebellion from several senior Tory MPs, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, when they vote on the measures on Wednesday. Mr Brady told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour the ""repetitive cycle"" of lockdowns was damaging livelihoods, relationships and mental health. People will be told to stay at home except for specific reasons These include work which cannot be done from home, childcare or education, exercise outdoors, medical reasons, essential shopping, providing care for vulnerable people or for volunteering, and visiting members of yoursupport bubble Meeting indoors or in private gardens will not be allowed, but individuals can meet one other person from another household outside in a public place. Children under school age and those dependent on round-the-clock care who are with their parents do not count towards the two-person limit Non-essential retail will close, but can remain open for click-and-collect delivery Pubs, bars, restaurants will have to close, but can still provide takeaway and delivery, excluding takeaway of alcohol Indoor and outdoor leisure facilities, such as gyms and swimming pools, will also close, along with entertainment venues and personal care facilities such as beauty salons Places of worship will close, unless they are being used for funerals, to broadcast acts of worship, individual prayer, formal childcare, or essential services such as blood donation or food banks Construction sites and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies will not be able to take place except in exceptional circumstances, and funerals will be limited to a maximum of 30 people Children will still be able to move between homes if their parents are separated Clinically vulnerable people will be asked to be ""especially careful"" but people will not be asked to resume shielding Overnight stays, staying in a second home, and holidays will not be allowed - including in the UK and abroad - although there are exceptions, such as work trips People will be told to avoid all non-essential travel by private or public transport Former cabinet minister Esther McVey said she would vote against the restrictions, saying ""the world cannot be put on hold"" with the ""disastrous effects"" lockdown ""brings to our lives"". Ex-party leader Iain Duncan Smith said the lockdown decision was a ""body blow"" and accused the government of ""giving in"" to scientific advisers. The BBC's Political editor Laura Kuenssberg spoke to Tory MPs ahead of the PM's statement, who she says were ""angry, not just about the decision, but about how it's been handled, and No 10's attitude to those arguing for a different course"".

Downing Street has said that MPs will also get to vote on the ""way forward"" and what should replace the new lockdown regulations when they expire at 00:01 GMT on 2 December. But the prime minister will have the support of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said the measures were ""necessary"" while criticising the government for delaying them and ensuring what would be a longer, harder lockdown. On Sunday, the UK recorded 23,254 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

"Many of Wales' poorest areas have been hardest hit by the pandemic Wales is facing a ""rising tide of poverty"" which has been worsened by Covid, according to a new report. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) found low pay, unaffordable housing and a lack of childcare was trapping 700,000 people in poverty, including 180,000 children. It said the pandemic had hit low-paid workers in Wales particularly hard. The Welsh Government said it had invested a record Â£2bn in affordable housing. But according to the JRF, which works for social change, more needs to be done as households ""risk being pulled under from the economic fallout"" from Covid-19. Rashford welcomes extra free school meals in Wales Free childcare 'could help close poverty gap' 'We're all struggling' on disadvantaged estate Before coronavirus struck, almost a quarter of people in Wales were living in poverty, the Poverty in Wales report said. But since then many people have lost their jobs and by August the number of Universal Credit claimants had almost doubled from the start of the year. By June around 400,000 people in Wales had fallen behind on their bills, with 200,000 falling behind on rent or mortgage payments, the report said. And the situation is expected to worsen in Wales as the Covid recession gathers pace. Alexander Serpentem said having decent housing had helped motivate him Alexander Serpentem, 29, from Bridgend, has lived in social housing for ""as long as I can remember...since I was a young boy"". ""You need that support net... it's crucial for that group of people who are struggling,"" he said. He is now a tenant of Hafod housing association and said having quality housing has given him the ""motivation to want to get back into the community"". ""If I didn't have this I'd have nothing,"" he added. A government-funded childcare scheme has helped Jackie Williams pay her daughter's nursery costs so she could go to work and study part-time Mother Jackie Williams from Blaenavon, Torfaen, said the Welsh GovernmentChildcare Offer for Wales, which provides free care for three and four-year-olds of qualifying parents, had ""definitely helped"" financially. ""If the scheme had not been working I probably would not have been able to work,"" said the part-time nursery worker, whose partner works full time. She said using it to help care for her four-year-old daughter meant ""not having to worry about paying for the childcare out of my own wages"". ""And I'm not having to rely on family to look after her as well,"" said Ms Williams, who is also studying part-time, albeit via Zoom classes due to coronavirus restrictions. Some families are ""just about managing"", according to nursery manager Sue Driscoll Sue Driscoll, manager of Busy Bees Nursery in Blaenavon where Ms Williams works, said the free childcare offer had made a ""big difference"" to other families and ""helps with our sustainability"". ""Families who are just about managing, both parents working but still not managing to make ends meet, have just got a bit more disposable income that can come back into the economy,"" she said. The JRF has called on the Welsh Government to develop a new childcare offer for all children, guarantee social rents are affordable, build more homes available for social rent and create a ""Welsh Benefits System"". Peter Matejic, the foundation's deputy director of evidence and impact, said: ""Families up and down the country are struggling to keep up with rent and put food on the table - this is not the kind of society we want to be. ""Governments in both Cardiff and Westminster must now take decisive action to support those in need through the pandemic and beyond."" Dr Victoria Winckler, director of the Bevan Foundation think tank, said: ""It's not right that so many people are trapped in poverty in Wales today. ""Coronavirus has had a huge impact on all our lives but people on low incomes have been disproportionately affected."" The Welsh Government said: ""We have made a record investment of Â£2bn in affordable housing during this Senedd term and have seen a 12% increase on 2017-18 in the number of affordable homes delivered. ""This investment is having a significant impact on the delivery of housing that meets the needs of Welsh communities and we are on track to deliver our ambitious 20,000 affordable homes target this term despite the adverse impact the pandemic has had on the housebuilding sector."" On the issue of child care, a spokesman added: ""We have not received any concerns about capacity to deliver the childcare offer. ""Currently, two-thirds of registered childcare settings in Wales deliver the childcare offer which will allow for expansion into additional settings if capacity issues were experienced.""

"Robert Fisk was best known for his coverage of the Middle East, where he began reporting from in the 1970s Veteran foreign correspondent Robert Fisk has died of a suspected stroke at the age of 74. He had been admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin after falling ill at his home on Friday, and died shortly afterwards, the Irish Times reported. Fisk won numerous awards for his reporting on the Middle East, starting from the 1970s. But he also drew controversy for his sharp criticism of the US and Israel, and of Western foreign policy. Covering wars in the Balkans, Middle East and North Africa for UK newspapers over five decades, Fisk was described bythe New York Times,,externalin 2005, as ""probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain"". Listen to Robert Fisk on Desert Island Discs Born in Maidstone, Kent in 1946, he later took Irish citizenship and had a home in Dalkey outside the capital Dublin. Irish President Michael D Higgins has expressed his ""great sadness"" about Fisk's death on Sunday. ""With his passing the world of journalism and informed commentary on the Middle East has lost one of its finest commentators,""he said in a statement,external. Allow Twitter content?

After starting his career at the Sunday Express, Fisk moved to Belfast in 1972 to cover the Troubles as Northern Ireland correspondent for the Times. He became the paper's Middle East correspondent in 1976. Based in Beirut, he reported on the civil war in Lebanon, as well as the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq War. He resigned from the Times in 1989 after a dispute with the owner Rupert Murdoch and moved to the Independent, where he worked for the remainder of his career. In the 1990s he interviewed Osama Bin Laden three times for the paper. He described him as a ""shy man"" and looking ""every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend""in their first interview in 1993,external. Robert Fisk was brave and controversial. He was a brilliant writer, who did his best work in wars, transporting readers to his side in some burning village. He relished making enemies, especially if they defended US or Israeli activities in the Middle East. Fisk could be obsessive. He collected bits of shrapnel, often American made and fired by Israel, so he could use serial numbers to trace their origins. When I visited Beirut from Jerusalem in the 1990s he served me gin and tonics on his balcony overlooking the Mediterranean in a Yasser Arafat souvenir glass. Robert was old school. He poked fun at the flak jacket I brought to Lebanon from the former Yugoslavia, sniffing it to check for slivovitza plum brandy. Journalism can be a dog-eat-dog trade. Fisk's colleagues were not always kind about his work. I was an admirer, eating up his vivid reportage from Beirut when I was at school, and was awestruck when first I met him. I'll miss Robert, his guts and his appetite for the fight, even though usually he followed a warm hello with some crack about the evils of television news or the BBC. After the 11 September attacks plotted by Bin Laden, Fisk, an Arabic speaker, spent the next two decades covering conflicts throughout the Middle East, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. He was highly regarded for his knowledge of, and deep experience in, the region, and often dismissed journalists who sat behind desks instead of venturing out into the field. But he also drew criticism for his attacks on Western policy in the Middle East and was accused of being lenient towards the Syrian government in his reporting of the country's long and brutal civil war. Articles by Fisk about the US and Israel were often considered highly controversial. He said the Trump administration's acceptance in 2019 of Israel's annexation of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights showedIsrael had effectively annexed the US,external, and repeatedly accused Israel of committing war crimes against the Palestinians. In 2011 Fisk was forced to apologiseafter the Independent was successfully sued by the then-Saudi interior minister over a report that alleged the minister had ordered police to shoot and kill unarmed protesters, based on a document which turned out to be fake. Fisk married US journalist Lara Marlowe in 1994 but the pair divorced in 2006. He had no children.

"Nigel Farage has applied to change the Brexit Party's name to Reform UK, promising to focus on dealing with the government's ""woeful"" Covid response. He said renewed lockdown would ""result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save"" and argued that ""building immunity"" would be more effective. The party leader also said there should be ""focused protection"" from coronavirus for the vulnerable. But Boris Johnson will tell MPs later there is ""no alternative"" to lockdown. From Thursday, pubs, restaurants, gyms, non-essential shops and places of worship in England will close for four weeks, in an effort to stem the increase in infections. The House of Commons vote on the measures on Wednesday, with the prime minister outlining his plans to MPs on Monday. PM warns of virus deaths 'twice as bad' as spring Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' Several Conservatives are expected to oppose the lockdown, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, and former cabinet minister Esther McVey. Labour will back the government, although leader Sir Keir Starmer says it is bringing in the restrictions later than should have been the case. On Sunday, the UK recorded 23,254 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 162 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This isn't the first time Nigel Farage has raised the idea of rebranding the Brexit Party. Even before the results of last year's general election rolled in, he said his plan was to change its name into - guess what? - the Reform Party. He even claimed to have registered the new title. The idea was to change politics ""for good"", campaigning to overhaul the voting system and abolish the House of Lords. Now it seems Mr Farage is returning to the idea of a re-launch - this time with an anti-lockdown focus. Perhaps he sensed an opportunity to return to the political debate. It might cause some nerves in No 10. Mr Farage has posed a threat to mainstream parties - not least the Tories - in the past, espousing populist views which have at times shifted the national debate. Boris Johnson is attempting to find some middle ground between lockdown advocates and sceptics, with increasing push-back from the latter within his own party. There is a risk he ends up pleasing neither, and Mr Farage stands poised - as he has before - with an alternative view he'll have no qualms in expressing. Mr Farage set up the Brexit Party ahead of last year's European Parliament elections,winning 29 seats - the most of any UK party. In an email to supporters, he and party chairman Richard Tice said this had ""rescued Brexit and in so doing, restored some confidence in democracy in the UK"". While they were ""keeping a close eye"" on Mr Johnson ""to make sure he does not sell us down the river"" in any trade deal with the EU, they said it was time to ""apply our energy and resources to the other pressing issues facing the nation"". They applied last Friday to the Electoral Commission to rename the Brexit Party as Reform UK. Their email to supporters said: ""The government has dug itself into a hole [with coronavirus] and rather than admit its mistakes, it keeps on digging. ""The new national lockdown will result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save, as non-Covid patients with cancer, cardiac, lung and other illnesses have treatments delayed or cancelled again. Suicides are soaring. Businesses and jobs are being destroyed."" Mr Farage and Mr Tice said the UK shouldfollow the Great Barrington Declaration,which calls for ""focused protection"" for the elderly and other groups particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, while others continue to live relatively normally. Their email said: ""The rest of the population should, with simple hygiene measures and a dose of common sense, get on with life - this way we build immunity in the population. We must learn to live with the virus not hide in fear of it."" Treatments were ""getting better"" and survival rates were improving, they added. On Sunday, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the lockdown in England could be extended if it took longer than four weeks to bring the transmission rate of the virus down. The government has said schools will remain open, with Mr Johnson expected to tell the Commons later that he was ""right to try every possible option"" - including region-by-region restrictions - before moving on to a national measures. After an extension to the furlough scheme was announced for England, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross called for similar support to be available if the country needed to go into a full lockdown. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown will end on 9 November, as planned. Schools in Northern Ireland reopen on Monday after an extended half-term break, while other restrictions including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants continue until 13 November.

" By Jessica Lussenhop By Jessica Lussenhop By Jessica Lussenhop When Dr Ebun Ekunwe, 72, cast her ballot in 2016, she did so for Donald Trump. It was an act, she says, of “total rebellion” against the Democratic Party. “I fervently supported Bernie Sanders,” she says. “I felt that the nomination was actually stolen from him. So we revolted against our own party.” When Trump won, the retired doctor and pastor from Carrollton, Texas, hoped that he would rise to the occasion. Then, after white nationalists marched in Charlottesville in August 2017 and clashed violently with counter protesters, Trump made his now-infamous remark that “there were very fine people, on both sides”. “For the purpose of healing the country, a leader does not go out and say that,” she says. “He has made the country about himself. He is reading the Constitution as ‘me, the president’ instead of ‘we, the people’.” This year, even though she could vote by post, she wants to cast her ballot for Joe Biden in person. “I want my voice to count,” she says. But doing so is not without risks for her in the pandemic - Ebun has sickle cell anaemia. She is managing her condition, but it will be on her mind as she casts her vote. Ebun relies on Obamacare - another name for the 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. Without it, she says, she wouldn’t have been able to afford her cataract surgery The pandemic has meant she has been unable to visit her doctor, and while her medical background enables her to take care of herself, she worries about others with pre-existing conditions. “I don’t know how they live from day-to-day,” she sighs. “They might be quietly, desperately saying, ‘Let nothing happen to my health’.” Before two bullets sailed through the window of his Portland cafe in early October, John Jackson says he was on the fence over how to cast his vote. “I don’t follow party lines. I vote with my heart,” he says. John, 55, who served as a US Marine before a career in corporate America, now runs a small chain of restaurants in Oregon called Heroes American Cafe. The restaurants feature patriotic decor, and offer discounts to military veterans, police officers, firemen and teachers. He opened his most recent location in Portland during the pandemic, and well into the ongoing racial justice protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. According to John, his business partner received an ominous warning phone call at the restaurant a few days before the so-called “Day of Rage” anti-racism protest on 11 October. John had also heard rumours that his cafe was being called ""pro-police"" on social media. “First, we're pro-heroes,” he says. “That doesn't include things like policemen that kneel on people's necks and kill them. We call those zeros.” On the night of the protest, statues of Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were pulled down, and the entrance to the Oregon Historical Society was smashed. At around 22:00, John got a phone call from his building superintendent, telling him someone had shot through the windows of the cafe. “It was surreal,” he says. “You don’t expect people to escalate to that level.” When he heard President Trump’s comments criticising local officials over their handling of the protests, and suggesting use of federal law enforcement, he decided the president had earned another term. “I had an epiphany - we need strong leadership,” says John. ""I'm not saying that Trump is perfect leadership. [But] I'd heard him talk about Portland many times - how the violence needed to be squashed. And when I experienced it personally, it just connected. The violence couldn't go unchecked.” Nevertheless, he is dismayed to be labelled as being against Black Lives Matter. He is mixed-race - his father was black and his mother, German - and he says he has had his fair share of unpleasant interactions with police. “There is systematic racism, and Black Lives Matter is an important movement. It may be the match that ignites the change that we do need.” Earlier this year, 19-year-old Kayleah from San Diego, California, became something of a minor social media star. As the election began heating up, she started posting TikToks from her TRUMP 2020 flag-adorned bedroom, that not only praised the president, but mocked liberals like Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her account, kp.thepatriot, now has more than 32,000 followers. When she first joined TikTok, Kayleah quickly stumbled across conservative influencers whose views inspired her to learn more about Trump's policies. Kayleah has always leaned to the right - she's an avid hunter who is pro-life and pro-gun rights. But entering the political TikTok universe made her a far more ardent - and vocal - Trump supporter, and she started making political TikToks of her own. ""The more I made, the more and more I learned about politics,"" she says. In liberal San Diego, her views were not always appreciated by her classmates. She would get into arguments with them in the TikTok comments. But as her profile grew, she was garnering attention from all over the country. Things took a turn. “The beginning of this year was more scary than it was exciting,” she says. “I started getting death threats and rape threats, and whether or not they're credible or not, I don't know.” She deleted her Instagram account, where most of the threats were coming in, and took a month off of TikTok. Before returning to it, she went through some of her videos with her father. “He pointed out that when I would respond to people, I'd be kind of snarky, or I would not really pay much attention to what they were saying. I was too concerned with telling them what I believed,” she says. “He said, ‘You can't have an educated conversation with somebody if you're not educated on both sides of the political spectrum on that issue.’” She’s now softened her tone towards people who disagree with her. The rhetoric has calmed, and she’s made friends with people on both sides of the political spectrum. Her tagline now reads, ""The Tolerant Republican"". Jeanne Crumly, 68, describes her husband as, “Not political, very quiet, non-confrontational.” But when he heard that TC Energy, the company behind the Keystone XL Pipeline, was coming to their farm in Holt County, northeastern Nebraska, to do a “cultural study”, he marched to the edge of one of their fields - corn stalks ready for harvest towering overhead - with a gigantic “Biden-Harris” campaign sign. He staked it into the ground right along the proposed route of the pipeline. For 12 years, the Crumlys have been fighting the pipeline, which would carry tar sand oil from Canada through Nebraska towards refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. They see it as a threat to the long-term environmental health of the land where they and their son raise cattle, corn, soybeans and potatoes. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama rejected the plan for the pipeline. But shortly after taking office, Donald Trump signed an executive order resurrecting the project. “He reversed it with no rationale. And that's ended up in court cases for four years,” says Jeanne. “While that is personal to me, it's just an example of what the current administration has done in terms of getting whatever they want.” Jeanne also says that between Trump’s trade wars with China and disruptions in the food chain due to the pandemic, this administration has made life harder for farmers like her. She says they will not break even on this year’s harvest and that the cattle market has become so volatile in the pandemic, she has no idea what to expect when the time comes to sell in December. “Confidence makes a huge impact,” she says. “To function in an economy that is so erratic and so illogical brings anxiety no matter what the final dollar line is.” Mark Ondishin, 55, was working at his tyre and car repair shop in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, when he started experiencing chest pain. As the feeling radiated into his shoulder, he knew something very bad was happening. In hospital, it was confirmed he was having a heart attack. A year later, he credits the doctors, nurses and med-evac team for saving his life. He also credits his health insurance. “I’m a living example of why you need to have insurance,” he says. In 2016, Mark was worried about how he was going to continue providing health insurance for his employees. His premiums had shot through the roof, and he laid the blame squarely on Obamacare’s impact on the insurance market. When Trump won, he eagerly awaited the new administration's promised healthcare reforms. Four years later, those reforms have failed to materialise. His premiums are as high as ever, but he blames Congress for that, not Trump. “Did I see a real plan there? No, I didn't really see a plan, but at least I saw an attempt to try to fix it,” he says. Business has been booming, he says, and with the extra money he's been making, he can pay for the benefits. “Everybody’s making a living,” he says. And he thanks Trump for that. Even the pandemic hasn’t hurt Mark’s bottom line. He credits Trump for the Paycheck Protection Program, which sent the businessman $50,000 (£38,590) within 36 hours of submitting his application. He used it to give his shop a much-needed facelift. It was the mid-term elections of 2018 and Antonne Henshaw, a graduate student, was on the campus of Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey. He and a friend were approached by a small group of children carrying signs that said, “Did you vote today? Because I can’t.” “Excuse me, misters, did y’all vote today?” one of the boys asked them. Antonne and his friend looked blankly at one another. “Yeah,” they replied uneasily. “Yeah, we voted.” But it wasn't true. Antonne had just been released from prison and was prohibited by law from voting in New Jersey. When he was 18, he shot and killed another boy in a street fight. Thirty years in prison meant that he had never had the right to vote. Recalling the moment he was confronted by the children on campus, Antonne says: “I didn’t want to disappoint them and have to explain that I’m a convicted felon. I should never have to lie about something that should have never been taken away from me. It's a fundamental right.” This is the story Antonne told the New Jersey state legislature as he lobbied for a change in law that would allow formerly incarcerated men and women who are still on probation or parole to vote. At a ceremony in mid-March, he stood at a podium in a suit and tie, and filled out his voter registration form. He was the second parolee in the state to register. ""I've been waiting my whole life for this moment,"" he told a reporter at the time. ""It didn't disappoint."" When he casts the very first vote of his life, it will be for Joe Biden, the very person who penned the 1990s-era crime bill that eliminated funding for the college classes Antonne was trying to take in prison. It also codified the mandatory minimum sentences and no-early release policies that he says kept him incarcerated for as long as he was. Antonne can’t stand the “dog whistle” talk of law and order from the Trump administration, so he’s making what he calls a “utilitarian” choice. He’ll be looking to Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris, a former California prosecutor, to admit to mistakes in the tough-on-crime era. “I'm not asking you to relax mandatory minimums, I'm saying… realise [prisoners were] unjustly and unfairly targeted based on where they live, what their economic status was, race, class, creed and colour,” he says. When Jackie, 30, a nurse practitioner in emergency medicine, thinks back on all the patients she’s treated for Covid-19, the beginning is a bit of a blur. She travelled from her home in Madison, Wisconsin, to a hospital in New York City in late March, when case numbers were exploding. Hospitals were overwhelmed, and she says that at hers, there were only 60 beds for 100 patients. “I was going around and checking on patients sitting in a hallway chair who had been there for two days. They were sitting, on oxygen, without a place to lay down, without a place to get any rest. And I had to make sure they weren't dead,” she says. “I did that for two weeks.” Once things calmed a bit, there were moments of levity. She remembers one patient who, after three weeks on a ventilator, improved enough so that he could breathe and move around on his own. Jackie, who does circus acrobatics as a hobby, hoisted herself into a handstand, balancing on the hands of another nurse from Tennessee who just happened to also do circus acrobatics. Dressed in her scrubs, gown, face shield and mask, she did the splits high in the air in front of the patient’s room. “We did a couple of partners tricks just to be like, ‘Hooray, he survived!’” she says. Jackie says that the man’s doctors recommended he go to a long-term acute care hospital. But he was undocumented and, without access to Medicare, it wasn’t clear how he could afford it. She doesn’t know what happened to him. A Covid survivor who can’t pay for his own recovery is just one reason Jackie has found herself rejecting both candidates. She believes both parties value money more than people, and that neither will handle the pandemic any better than the other at this point. “Covid is here, it's not going away. It doesn't matter who we elect any more,” she says. She says that one of the rallying calls from both the Republicans and Democrats throughout the pandemic has been the need to keep the economy alive. But she says this has been “without what I consider to be due regard to what that cost is.” When Jackie received her ballot, she wrote in her candidate of choice: “General strike”.  The Wildcatter Saloon in Katy, Texas, has a colourful history. Before Justin Whitfield, 47, bought it, rumour has it, it was an outlaw biker bar and a brothel that got wiretapped by the FBI. Finally, it turned into a legitimate bar and music venue. Six months after Justin took it over, in August 2017, Hurricane Harvey hit, devastating parts of the Texas coastline. “I lost my apartment, my house, my bar, my travel trailer, three cars,” he says. Luckily, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent him a cheque for more than $20,000 (£15,400), and within three weeks, he was able to host a concert in the bar’s expansive backyard. While the increasing frequency of storms like Hurricane Harvey are thought to be the result of climate change, Justin is sceptical of how much of that is due to human activity, and so he has no problem with President Donald Trump’s rollback of environmental regulations. “He's a businessman, so obviously his policies are not going to be the most environmentally safe, or the best routes. He's thinking bottom line, jobs, people's incomes,” Justin says. “From what I read [without Trump], our energy costs right now would be two to three times more, possibly. So it's saving all Americans across the board.” Justin reckons Trump’s personality flaws are not nearly as important as keeping the economy humming - and clamping down on the property damage and looting that has occurred in multiple cities since the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests. His father-in-law is a retired Houston police officer, and the Wildcatter recently served as the end destination for a “Back the Blue” car parade with more than 300 vehicles. “Most business owners I know are not going to support rioters and looters. We are not going to support destroying local businesses. We know how hard it takes to get there,” he says.

"Officials held a special ceremony as the site reopened Machu Picchu, the ancient city high in the Andes mountains, has reopened after nearly eight months of closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. Peruvian authorities organised an Incan ritual to thank the gods on Sunday as the major tourist attraction once again allowed visitors. But numbers will be restricted to just 675 tourists a day for safety reasons, around 30% of previous capacity. The citadel was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1983. Rediscovered in 1911 by a US explorer, the site is the most recognisable ruin from the Inca Empire, which dominated the Andes from the 1430s until the 1530s. Archaeologists believe Machu Picchu, meaning old mountain in Quechua, was built as an estate in the 15th century for the Incan emperor Pachacuti. It was abandoned a century later when Spanish invaders conquered and colonised the region. People dressed in costumes for the ceremony Authorities also put on a special light show at the event Now it is a major draw for Peru's tourism industry. Tens of thousands of people in the mountainous Cusco region rely on visitors for their livelihoods and have suffered due to the coronavirus lockdown closure this year. How Peru locked down early but still got badly hit Struggling Peru lets Venezuelan medics go to work Reporters and tourists arrived for the ceremony on Sunday morning after a 90-minute trip from the Incan village of Ollantaytambo.

New health and safety protocols show they are opening ""with responsibility and great prudence"", he added. Tourists travelled to the site on Sunday for its reopening Only a limited number of tourists will be allowed in at once however, for safety reasons One traveller was however able to visit the site during its closure.

Bob Seely voiced concerns about coronavirus data the government has been using
and asked Boris Johnson to âpublish in full, the four studies that have gone
into the work this weekendâ. At Saturdayâs
government briefing, as the case for the new England lockdown was being made, a
chart was used showing potential paths of the daily death count over the
coming months. The most
eye-catching showed a peak of just above 4,000 deaths a day (roughly four times
the figure during the worst days of the first wave). The rest
were lower but still peaked at roughly double the level seen earlier this year. These curves were
all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that
followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case
planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then,
England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the
epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. On the day the
chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the
previous week. That is far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most
pessimistic model. But it is only a
little better than the most optimistic of the models, which still described a
very high level of deaths through the winter. Models like these
describe possible futures, if certain assumptions turn out to be true â but
they do not predict the future. Mr Johnson went to the House of Commons to update MPs, after announcing a national lockdown on Saturday Boris Johnson went before MPs this afternoon to defend his decision to introduce four weeks of national lockdown in England. The question and answer session has just finished. This is what happened:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent âShould I stay or should I go?â. Thatâs the question for students as the lockdown in England approaches. Universities are saying students will have to stay in their university accommodation, but the National Union of Students says they should have the choice to go home to their family âsupport networksâ before the lockdown comes into force this week. Universities do not want a campus exodus - and say that the government guidelines mean students should stay put until the end of term and the Christmas holidays. But the same government guidelines, issued alongside the announcement of the new restrictions, also suggest more online teaching rather than face-to-face classes. ""Universities and adult education settings should consider moving to increased levels of online learning where possible,â say the rules of the new lockdown. This does not mean more studying from home, say the universities. They are still waiting for a decision from the government about what is going to happen about the Christmas holidays - and long-awaited guidelines for how 1.2 million students will be safely able to travel home without spreading the virus. And universities want students to wait where they are - rather than making their own decisions about heading home. Read more here.

The guidance says you must not meet socially indoors with anyone unless you live with them, or if they're part of your support bubble. A support bubble is when a single-adult household joins another household - they can still visit each other and stay overnight. So unless you live with your partner or they're in your chosen bubble, meeting up for sex is off the cards. But the rules differ depending on where in the UK you are. Read more on this storyhere: Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter I've spent a lot of time this year coveringthe human impact of viral coronavirus conspiracy theories. Most recently, I exclusivelyinterviewed Sebastian Shemirani. His mum is one of the leaders of Britain's conspiracy community â and he told me about the impact that that is having on public health - and their relationship. Reporting on conspiracy theories is not about clamping down on healthy political discussion or legitimate concerns about the impact of restrictions on the economy and mental health. And of course there are valid debates about the still-developing science. But the kinds of stories I hear about are something else entirely. They are tales of sinister plots - supposed plans to implant microchips in the world's population to kill or enslave billions. Or completely unscientific ideas - that the virus somehow doesn't exist and that health experts are all wrong. These ideas appear to be having an impact on families across the country. Sebastian's was one of thousands of messages I've received from people who fear they are losing loved ones down the rabbit hole of online conspiracy. How can you tackle conspiracy theories with loved ones? And why do I cover the human impact of misinformation? Iâve written more about thishere. Get in touch if you want to tell me about the impact coronavirus conspiracy theories have had on your life at Marianna.spring@bbc.co.uk or follow @mariannaspring. The leader of the Scottish Conservatives Douglas Ross asks the prime minister if the furlough scheme will be available to other nations of the UK ""if in future the science demands that lockdowns are required anywhere in the country"". ""If he can't give that commitment will he explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one,"" he says. Boris Johnson replies: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies, not just now but in the future."" SNP Pete Wishart asks the PM to confirm that ""if the Scottish government required furlough funds beyond 2 December that will be available to Scotland"". ""The furlough scheme will continued to be available wherever it is needed,"" Boris Johnson replies. Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy says a local mum has texted her and is terrified because she works in a supermarket and has only recently returned to work - after having shielded because she has a serious medical condition. She says that as lockdown has now returned, the woman is worried that if she stays at home again she will lose her job, but if she doesn't she will lose her life. Ms Creasy asks what employment protection the PM is going to offer those who are clinically vulnerable in jobs that cannot be furloughed, so that people don't have to choose between their lives and their livelihoods. The PM says he would like to study the case that she mentions ""because what we're saying to those who are clinically vulnerable is that they should work from home and I'd be grateful if she'd send me the details of that case, so we can establish what kind of help she would be entitled to"". ""She should be entitled to furlough,"" he says. Conservative Saqib Bhatti asks the PM to do everything he can ""to ensure we have a normal Christmas and that households are able to mix on 25 December"". Boris Johnson says there are many religious celebrations coming up in December including Diwali and Hanukkah. He says he wants ""people to have as normal a Christmas as possible"". ""That is why it is important for the country to follow the measures,"" he says. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: 'This lockdown will be longer than it needed to be' Tory MP Gareth Johnson raises the issue of NHS staff's mental health Doctors are between two and five times more likely to take their lives than the general population, says the MP for Dartford, Gareth Johnson. He says that in 2018, one of his constituents, a consultant cardiologist, took his own life. ""He was at the cutting edge of medical treatment but alas could not cope with the pressure that he faced,"" says Gareth Johnson. He asks whether the PM agrees that it's vital to do as much as possible for clinicians' welfare. Boris Johnson says he is ""deeply sorry"" to hear of the death, and said: ""All I can say is that we're doing everything we can to support NHS, care for its staff, their wellbeing and their mental health ""I would urge anybody within the NHS who is aware of a colleague who is struggling with their mental health to come forward and seek help."" If you or someone you know is affected by mental health issues,these organisations may be able to help.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There's a significant row over the support given to people whose workplaces are closed because of lockdown. The UK government has extended its full furlough scheme - giving 80% of pay to people who can't work. But that is only in place until 2 December - when the lockdown in England is due to end. We've seen decisions taken at different points by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They have the powers to make health decisions, but don't have the financial ability to pay furlough because they can't borrow money. So they rely on the Treasury for the funding. There is now a coalition building in support of furlough being promised to all parts of the UK when they go into lockdown. The SNP Scottish Government has called for such an approach â as have the Scottish Tories. The Labour Welsh Government is angry the decision was made after Englandâs position changed â after being refused when Wales announced its circuit-break last month. At the moment, the Treasury won't commit to that. Boris Johnson has been ducking the substance of the questions asked in this debate so far. Some in Whitehall are nervous about writing a blank cheque when they will not have power over the decisions taken. But expect considerable pressure to come from the devolved governments. Reality Check On 31 October, coronavirus test capacity hit 525,282,according to government data,external. At the beginning of September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set a target to scale up testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. The figures show this has now been met. However, it is important to note that ""capacity"" means how many tests labs can process in theory. In reality, the number of tests actually processed is significantly lower. On 31 October, out of a lab capacity of 525,282, the number of tests processed was 292,573. This is low, but not quite as low as some dates in June when labs were processing just a third of what they had capacity to do. ""Why can't pubs sell takeaway beer to go with their takeaway food,"" asks Conservative Mark Pawsey, noting that the months in the run-up to Christmas are particularly important for some venues. Boris Johnson says a number of measures are needed to reduce the infection rate and adds ""when you start unpicking one bit a lot of the rest of it comes out"". He says that if the measures are properly enforced, the infection rate should come down and pubs will be able to do Christmas business. Earlier, the government released its daily coronavirus figures, which showed there had been 18,950 new positive tests and a further 136 deaths. Our graphs show the seven-day average number of cases and deaths. To find out how many cases there are in your area, head here. Conservative MP, and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt says he ""strongly supports these painful measures"". He asks if the new lockdown in England will be accompanied by weekly testing of all NHS staff. ""We are rolling out testing of NHS staff as fast as we possibly can,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says the aim is to regularly test those in ""vulnerable institutions"" including hospitals, care homes, schools and universities. Tory MP Bob Blackman asks the prime minister to set out the criteria that he will use to ensure the new lockdown is lifted on 2 December. Boris Johnson says: ""The R is above 1 but it is not much above 1 and if we work hard between now and the 2 December I believe that we can get it below 1. ""But whatever happens these restrictions end on 2 December and any further 
measures will be a matter for this House of Commons."" Conservative MP (and former minister) Andrea Leadsom says she will ""very reluctantly"" be supporting the new lockdown measures but has concerns about the restrictions. She emphasises the impact on mental health including those in care homes who are missing family or business people ""seeing their life's efforts in ruins"". She urges the PM to ensure the next lockdown is ""a compassionate lockdown"". Boris Johnson replies that the government has put Â£12bn into supporting mental healthcare. Â© 2025 BBC.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent There's a significant row over the support given to people whose workplaces are closed because of lockdown. The UK government has extended its full furlough scheme - giving 80% of pay to people who can't work. But that is only in place until 2 December - when the lockdown in England is due to end. We've seen decisions taken at different points by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They have the powers to make health decisions, but don't have the financial ability to pay furlough because they can't borrow money. So they rely on the Treasury for the funding. There is now a coalition building in support of furlough being promised to all parts of the UK when they go into lockdown. The SNP Scottish Government has called for such an approach â as have the Scottish Tories. The Labour Welsh Government is angry the decision was made after Englandâs position changed â after being refused when Wales announced its circuit-break last month. At the moment, the Treasury won't commit to that. Boris Johnson has been ducking the substance of the questions asked in this debate so far. Some in Whitehall are nervous about writing a blank cheque when they will not have power over the decisions taken. But expect considerable pressure to come from the devolved governments. Reality Check On 31 October, coronavirus test capacity hit 525,282,according to government data,external. At the beginning of September, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set a target to scale up testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October. The figures show this has now been met.

On 31 October, out of a lab capacity of 525,282, the number of tests processed was 292,573. This is low, but not quite as low as some dates in June when labs were processing just a third of what they had capacity to do.

Bob Seely voiced concerns about coronavirus data the government has been using
and asked Boris Johnson to âpublish in full, the four studies that have gone
into the work this weekendâ. At Saturdayâs
government briefing, as the case for the new England lockdown was being made, a
chart was used showing potential paths of the daily death count over the
coming months. The most
eye-catching showed a peak of just above 4,000 deaths a day (roughly four times
the figure during the worst days of the first wave). The rest
were lower but still peaked at roughly double the level seen earlier this year. These curves were
all produced at the start of October, just after the rapid rise in cases that
followed students returning to university. These were based on models for worst-case
planning that assumed no changes in policy or behaviour. But, since then,
England has introduced a three-tier system of stricter measures and the
epidemic has grown more slowly than the curves assumed it would. On the day the
chart was used, an average of 215 deaths had been reported each day in the
previous week. That is far below the 1,000 a day envisioned by the most
pessimistic model. But it is only a
little better than the most optimistic of the models, which still described a
very high level of deaths through the winter. Models like these
describe possible futures, if certain assumptions turn out to be true â but
they do not predict the future. Mr Johnson went to the House of Commons to update MPs, after announcing a national lockdown on Saturday Boris Johnson went before MPs this afternoon to defend his decision to introduce four weeks of national lockdown in England. The question and answer session has just finished. This is what happened:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent âShould I stay or should I go?â. Thatâs the question for students as the lockdown in England approaches. Universities are saying students will have to stay in their university accommodation, but the National Union of Students says they should have the choice to go home to their family âsupport networksâ before the lockdown comes into force this week. Universities do not want a campus exodus - and say that the government guidelines mean students should stay put until the end of term and the Christmas holidays. But the same government guidelines, issued alongside the announcement of the new restrictions, also suggest more online teaching rather than face-to-face classes. ""Universities and adult education settings should consider moving to increased levels of online learning where possible,â say the rules of the new lockdown. This does not mean more studying from home, say the universities. They are still waiting for a decision from the government about what is going to happen about the Christmas holidays - and long-awaited guidelines for how 1.2 million students will be safely able to travel home without spreading the virus. And universities want students to wait where they are - rather than making their own decisions about heading home. Read more here.

"Robert Fisk was best known for his coverage of the Middle East, where he began reporting from in the 1970s Veteran foreign correspondent Robert Fisk has died of a suspected stroke at the age of 74. He had been admitted to St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin after falling ill at his home on Friday, and died shortly afterwards, the Irish Times reported. Fisk won numerous awards for his reporting on the Middle East, starting from the 1970s. But he also drew controversy for his sharp criticism of the US and Israel, and of Western foreign policy. Covering wars in the Balkans, Middle East and North Africa for UK newspapers over five decades, Fisk was described bythe New York Times,,externalin 2005, as ""probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain"". Listen to Robert Fisk on Desert Island Discs Born in Maidstone, Kent in 1946, he later took Irish citizenship and had a home in Dalkey outside the capital Dublin. Irish President Michael D Higgins has expressed his ""great sadness"" about Fisk's death on Sunday. ""With his passing the world of journalism and informed commentary on the Middle East has lost one of its finest commentators,""he said in a statement,external. Allow Twitter content?

After starting his career at the Sunday Express, Fisk moved to Belfast in 1972 to cover the Troubles as Northern Ireland correspondent for the Times. He became the paper's Middle East correspondent in 1976. Based in Beirut, he reported on the civil war in Lebanon, as well as the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq War. He resigned from the Times in 1989 after a dispute with the owner Rupert Murdoch and moved to the Independent, where he worked for the remainder of his career. In the 1990s he interviewed Osama Bin Laden three times for the paper. He described him as a ""shy man"" and looking ""every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend""in their first interview in 1993,external. Robert Fisk was brave and controversial. He was a brilliant writer, who did his best work in wars, transporting readers to his side in some burning village. He relished making enemies, especially if they defended US or Israeli activities in the Middle East. Fisk could be obsessive. He collected bits of shrapnel, often American made and fired by Israel, so he could use serial numbers to trace their origins. When I visited Beirut from Jerusalem in the 1990s he served me gin and tonics on his balcony overlooking the Mediterranean in a Yasser Arafat souvenir glass. Robert was old school. He poked fun at the flak jacket I brought to Lebanon from the former Yugoslavia, sniffing it to check for slivovitza plum brandy. Journalism can be a dog-eat-dog trade. Fisk's colleagues were not always kind about his work. I was an admirer, eating up his vivid reportage from Beirut when I was at school, and was awestruck when first I met him. I'll miss Robert, his guts and his appetite for the fight, even though usually he followed a warm hello with some crack about the evils of television news or the BBC. After the 11 September attacks plotted by Bin Laden, Fisk, an Arabic speaker, spent the next two decades covering conflicts throughout the Middle East, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. He was highly regarded for his knowledge of, and deep experience in, the region, and often dismissed journalists who sat behind desks instead of venturing out into the field. But he also drew criticism for his attacks on Western policy in the Middle East and was accused of being lenient towards the Syrian government in his reporting of the country's long and brutal civil war. Articles by Fisk about the US and Israel were often considered highly controversial. He said the Trump administration's acceptance in 2019 of Israel's annexation of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights showedIsrael had effectively annexed the US,external, and repeatedly accused Israel of committing war crimes against the Palestinians. In 2011 Fisk was forced to apologiseafter the Independent was successfully sued by the then-Saudi interior minister over a report that alleged the minister had ordered police to shoot and kill unarmed protesters, based on a document which turned out to be fake. Fisk married US journalist Lara Marlowe in 1994 but the pair divorced in 2006. He had no children.

"This video can not be played 'Do not stretch new rules,' Drakeford urges People's behaviour during and after Wales' national firebreak lockdown will determine how successful it is in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The 17-day firebreak runs until 9 November and the Welsh Government will later outline what restrictions will be in place when it ends. People have been urged to stay at home while non-essential shops have shut. Mr Drakeford has already saidlocal area lockdowns will not return. He is due to reveal the new set of ""national rules"" across Wales during a news conference at 12:15 GMT after his cabinet met on Sunday. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the lifting of the restrictions must be ""slow and steady"", while ConservativeMSDarren Millar called for a ""more targeted approach to intervention"". Furlough backlash over rejected firebreak pleas English lockdown may last beyond 2 Dec, says Gove Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Mark Drakeford will set out a new set of national measures at a press conference on Monday Mr Drakeford will say the actions everyone takes during and after the firebreak are more important than the rules and regulations the government puts in place. ""We need to do everything we can to reduce our exposure to the virus by reducing the contacts we have with other people - at home, in work and when we go out,"" he is expected to say. ""We need to do the minimum - not the maximum, which the rules allow. ""The main thing I'm asking people to do in Wales is ask each time 'is what I'm doing genuinely necessary?' If it's not it should be avoided."" On Monday morning, he said the new set of Wales-wide rules will be ""simpler and clearer"" and would allow for ""something beyond what we've had during the firebreak period"". Mr Drakeford said non-essential retail, gyms, places of worship and schools - for Year 9 and above - would reopen from 9 November. He added: ""We will be asking people to work from home wherever possible, but on the 9 November the firebreak in Wales will be over and large parts of life will be able to resume as they were on 22 October."" He also said there would be a distinction between what people were allowed to do indoors and outdoors. People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak Mr Drakeford said it would be a ""couple of weeks"" before it was known if the firebreak lockdown has succeeded in suppressing the spread of the virus, but ""early indications"" from travel data suggested people were abiding by the rules. He has already said the current firebreak will end on 9 November regardless of thefour-week lockdown being introduced across England from Thursday. ""We made a bargain with the people in Wales that if they stuck to everything that we have asked them to do, and I say it's been an extraordinary national effort for 17 days, then we would be able to return to them some of the freedoms that have been denied to them,"" he said. ""I do not intend to step away from that bargain."" Most of the restrictions which were in place during the original lockdown are part of the firebreak On Monday morning, Mr Drakeford resisted calls to follow England in going into a lockdown until early December in order to have uniformity across the UK. He said: ""When Cobra last met - which is three weeks ago - I asked then for an urgent further Cobra to discuss the advice of Sage, that a firebreak or a circuit-break period will be the most effective way of bringing the R number down. ""But Cobra hasn't met ever since. ""While I'm absolutely signed up to better coordination, better information sharing and as I see it, better decision-making, the calling of those meetings is not in the hands of the devolved administrations, it lies in the hands of the UK government. ""Despite being asked to do so, three weeks have gone by and that meeting hasn't happened. In those circumstances there isn't any alternative but for the devolved governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to make the decisions that we think are the right ones for our local populations."" ""By doing everything we're doing and, provided we behave in the right way after the lockdown, we are confident we can get through to Christmas without having to go through this again."" Between 9 November and 2 December, England will be in lockdown and Wales will not Mr Drakeford said he was ""anxious"" people may travel from England to avoid lockdown rules there. He said: ""It's very important that Wales doesn't become an escape for people trying to get round the new tighter restrictions being introduced in England."" He said there were ""a number of details"" being discussed with colleagues in England: ""Public transport is one. Many many train journeys begin in England and end in Wales and vice-versa. It's not clear to us yet what the public transport regime in England will be. ""We are waiting to get some details on business support and whether there will be extra money for Welsh businesses."" ""Most importantly of all hospitality. We are having to meet this morning with representatives of the hospitality industry."" ""Think of Wrexham and Chester, literally a couple of miles apart. If pubs are completely closed as they will be in Chester, what impact will that have on people trying to travel into Wales to go to a pub."" However, a restriction on people coming from England will have a ""devastating"" effect on the hotel industry in Wales, one owner has said. Lynette Esposito, who owns the Elm Tree Hotel in Llandudno, Conwy, has been under local lockdown or firebreak restrictions since September and said the decision to impose a lockdown in England was a ""severe blow"" for Welsh hotels. She said: ""We would've been in a lockdown for nine weeks and most of the hotels in Wales rely almost 100% on business coming out of England, so for us it's a devastating blow. ""The restrictions announced today are going to be of interest, but not much relevance."" Conservative Mr Millar said he did not agree with the decision for Wales to enter a firebreak and called for ""more clarity"" on what the new rules would be. ""We've said all along, that we didn't think that a Wales-wide lockdown was the right thing to do. We felt that because the infection rates were so variable in different parts of Wales."" He said the Welsh Conservatives stood by their stance in Wales despite the decision by the UK government to lockdown England. ""The evidence that's been shared with the Welsh Conservatives by the Welsh Government has been insufficient in our view for a Wales-wide lockdown."" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru leader Mr Price said: ""We have learnt two key lessons from the response to the pandemic so far - going into lockdown too late increases the spread of the virus and coming out too early risks undoing any benefits gained. That is why the approach to the post firebreak period must be slow and steady. ""There should certainly be no lifting of the travel restrictions which have rightly prevented people coming into Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK."" Non-essential shops have been closed in Wales, as well as pubs, restaurants and hotels Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that the furlough scheme would be extended until 2 December. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme (JSS). The movesparked a war of words between the Welsh and UK governments. Mr Drakeford was unhappy that requests for extra funding during the firebreak were rebuffed by the Treasury, but then furlough was extended when the England lockdown was announced. He previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak, but his requests were turned down. Chancellor Rishi Sunak also declined a request for the JSS  - which would cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford said: ""We had asked the chancellor for some flexibility during our firebreak period, the chancellor said to me that it wasn't possible to do that. ""It turns out that it is possible now, but mostly I just welcome any extra support that businesses in Wales will get over the next period."" The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work?

"Officials held a special ceremony as the site reopened Machu Picchu, the ancient city high in the Andes mountains, has reopened after nearly eight months of closure due to the coronavirus pandemic. Peruvian authorities organised an Incan ritual to thank the gods on Sunday as the major tourist attraction once again allowed visitors. But numbers will be restricted to just 675 tourists a day for safety reasons, around 30% of previous capacity. The citadel was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1983. Rediscovered in 1911 by a US explorer, the site is the most recognisable ruin from the Inca Empire, which dominated the Andes from the 1430s until the 1530s. Archaeologists believe Machu Picchu, meaning old mountain in Quechua, was built as an estate in the 15th century for the Incan emperor Pachacuti. It was abandoned a century later when Spanish invaders conquered and colonised the region. People dressed in costumes for the ceremony Authorities also put on a special light show at the event Now it is a major draw for Peru's tourism industry. Tens of thousands of people in the mountainous Cusco region rely on visitors for their livelihoods and have suffered due to the coronavirus lockdown closure this year. How Peru locked down early but still got badly hit Struggling Peru lets Venezuelan medics go to work Reporters and tourists arrived for the ceremony on Sunday morning after a 90-minute trip from the Incan village of Ollantaytambo. ""Today, Machu Picchu reopens,"" Foreign Trade and Tourism Minister Rocio Barrios said in a speech. New health and safety protocols show they are opening ""with responsibility and great prudence"", he added. Tourists travelled to the site on Sunday for its reopening Only a limited number of tourists will be allowed in at once however, for safety reasons One traveller was however able to visit the site during its closure. Japanese tourist Jesse Katayama had travelled to Peru to see Machu Picchu in March but was stranded nearby when lockdown measures were imposed.

"Donald Trump and Joe Biden have been travelling across the nation as the US election race enters its final hours. Republican President Trump, 74, visited five battleground states while his 77-year-old Democratic challenger spoke at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, where the race also looks tight. Mr Biden, a former vice-president, has a healthy national lead in the latest polls ahead of Tuesday's election. But his advantage is narrower in key states which could decide the result. More than 96 million people have already cast their ballots in early voting, putting the country on course for its highest turnout in a century. Follow live updates with a day to go until voting US election 2020: A really simple guide In the US election, voters decide state-level contests rather than an overall single national one. To be elected US president, a candidate must win at least 270 votes in what's called the electoral college. Each US state gets a certain number of votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs. This system explains why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still lose the election. Tuesday's vote comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The US has recorded more cases and more deaths than any other country worldwide, reporting more than 81,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Top virus expert Anthony Fauci has sharply criticised the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic, drawing a rebuke from the White Houseon Sunday. President Trump had a punishing schedule on Sunday, holding rallies in Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia, and later in Florida. The president spoke amid snow flurries and close to freezing temperatures In Michigan, Mr Trump boasted his leadership the state's car manufacturing industry had been revived. ""The economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded,"" he claimed. The US economy saw record-breaking 33% growth in the third financial quarter of this year, following a record 31% contraction in the second. But economists warn the damage inflicted by the pandemic - the biggest decline in the US economy in more than 80 years - could still take years to overcome. The economy under Trump in six charts Fact-checking the closing days of the US election Trump is in the fight of his political life At a later rally in Iowa, Mr Trump promised secure borders and more conservative judges in the courts. Addressing Covid-19, he told supporters they had a choice between a ""deadly Biden lockdown"" or ""a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic"". This video can not be played How much is Covid-19 an election issue? Meanwhile, Mr Biden headed to Pennsylvania, his place of birth and another key state. At a rally in Philadelphia, Mr Biden addressed the city's black community, vowing to confront ""systemic racism"" in the US and attacking the president's handling of the pandemic - something which has disproportionately affected African Americans. Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate The women who hold the key to Trump's survival ""It's almost criminal the way he's handled it,"" he said. ""It's a mass casualty event in the black community and it's totally unnecessary."" Mr Biden held an outdoor rally in Philadelphia On Sunday Mr Biden courted Latino voters with a tweet in Spanish, speaking of the separation of migrant families at the border and Mr Trump's ""indifference"" to the suffering of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck in 2017. This video can not be played What Latino first-time voters want from the US election Mr Biden's campaign said he would ""fan out"" to ""all four corners"" of Pennsylvania on Monday, joined by the pop stars Lady Gaga and John Legend. The Democratic challenger will also go to Ohio. The great dividing line of US election Why racism is still a problem for the world's most powerful country Meanwhile, Mr Trump will hold more rallies in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It can take several days for every vote to be counted after any US presidential election, but it's usually pretty clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning. In 2016, Donald Trump took to the stage in New York at about 03:00 local time to give his victory speech in front of a crowd of jubilant supporters. What is the electoral college? How many Americans have voted early so far? But don't set your alarm clocks just yet. Officials are already warning that we may have to wait longer - possibly days, even weeks - for the result this year because of the expected surge in postal ballots.

"Donald Trump and Joe Biden have been travelling across the nation as the US election race enters its final hours. Republican President Trump, 74, visited five battleground states while his 77-year-old Democratic challenger spoke at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, where the race also looks tight. Mr Biden, a former vice-president, has a healthy national lead in the latest polls ahead of Tuesday's election. But his advantage is narrower in key states which could decide the result. More than 96 million people have already cast their ballots in early voting, putting the country on course for its highest turnout in a century. Follow live updates with a day to go until voting US election 2020: A really simple guide In the US election, voters decide state-level contests rather than an overall single national one. To be elected US president, a candidate must win at least 270 votes in what's called the electoral college. Each US state gets a certain number of votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs. This system explains why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still lose the election. Tuesday's vote comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The US has recorded more cases and more deaths than any other country worldwide, reporting more than 81,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Top virus expert Anthony Fauci has sharply criticised the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic, drawing a rebuke from the White Houseon Sunday. President Trump had a punishing schedule on Sunday, holding rallies in Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia, and later in Florida. The president spoke amid snow flurries and close to freezing temperatures In Michigan, Mr Trump boasted his leadership the state's car manufacturing industry had been revived. ""The economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded,"" he claimed. The US economy saw record-breaking 33% growth in the third financial quarter of this year, following a record 31% contraction in the second. But economists warn the damage inflicted by the pandemic - the biggest decline in the US economy in more than 80 years - could still take years to overcome. The economy under Trump in six charts Fact-checking the closing days of the US election Trump is in the fight of his political life At a later rally in Iowa, Mr Trump promised secure borders and more conservative judges in the courts. Addressing Covid-19, he told supporters they had a choice between a ""deadly Biden lockdown"" or ""a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic"". This video can not be played How much is Covid-19 an election issue? Meanwhile, Mr Biden headed to Pennsylvania, his place of birth and another key state. At a rally in Philadelphia, Mr Biden addressed the city's black community, vowing to confront ""systemic racism"" in the US and attacking the president's handling of the pandemic - something which has disproportionately affected African Americans. Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate The women who hold the key to Trump's survival ""It's almost criminal the way he's handled it,"" he said. ""It's a mass casualty event in the black community and it's totally unnecessary."" Mr Biden held an outdoor rally in Philadelphia On Sunday Mr Biden courted Latino voters with a tweet in Spanish, speaking of the separation of migrant families at the border and Mr Trump's ""indifference"" to the suffering of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck in 2017. This video can not be played What Latino first-time voters want from the US election Mr Biden's campaign said he would ""fan out"" to ""all four corners"" of Pennsylvania on Monday, joined by the pop stars Lady Gaga and John Legend. The Democratic challenger will also go to Ohio. The great dividing line of US election Why racism is still a problem for the world's most powerful country Meanwhile, Mr Trump will hold more rallies in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It can take several days for every vote to be counted after any US presidential election, but it's usually pretty clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning. In 2016, Donald Trump took to the stage in New York at about 03:00 local time to give his victory speech in front of a crowd of jubilant supporters. What is the electoral college? How many Americans have voted early so far? But don't set your alarm clocks just yet. Officials are already warning that we may have to wait longer - possibly days, even weeks - for the result this year because of the expected surge in postal ballots. The last time the result wasn't clear within a few hours was in 2000, when the winner wasn't confirmed until a Supreme Court ruling was made a month later.

"This video can not be played 'Do not stretch new rules,' Drakeford urges People's behaviour during and after Wales' national firebreak lockdown will determine how successful it is in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The 17-day firebreak runs until 9 November and the Welsh Government will later outline what restrictions will be in place when it ends. People have been urged to stay at home while non-essential shops have shut. Mr Drakeford has already saidlocal area lockdowns will not return. He is due to reveal the new set of ""national rules"" across Wales during a news conference at 12:15 GMT after his cabinet met on Sunday. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the lifting of the restrictions must be ""slow and steady"", while ConservativeMSDarren Millar called for a ""more targeted approach to intervention"". Furlough backlash over rejected firebreak pleas English lockdown may last beyond 2 Dec, says Gove Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? Mark Drakeford will set out a new set of national measures at a press conference on Monday Mr Drakeford will say the actions everyone takes during and after the firebreak are more important than the rules and regulations the government puts in place. ""We need to do everything we can to reduce our exposure to the virus by reducing the contacts we have with other people - at home, in work and when we go out,"" he is expected to say. ""We need to do the minimum - not the maximum, which the rules allow. ""The main thing I'm asking people to do in Wales is ask each time 'is what I'm doing genuinely necessary?' If it's not it should be avoided."" On Monday morning, he said the new set of Wales-wide rules will be ""simpler and clearer"" and would allow for ""something beyond what we've had during the firebreak period"". Mr Drakeford said non-essential retail, gyms, places of worship and schools - for Year 9 and above - would reopen from 9 November. He added: ""We will be asking people to work from home wherever possible, but on the 9 November the firebreak in Wales will be over and large parts of life will be able to resume as they were on 22 October."" He also said there would be a distinction between what people were allowed to do indoors and outdoors. People have been urged to stay at home and many shops and businesses have been closed in Wales' firebreak Mr Drakeford said it would be a ""couple of weeks"" before it was known if the firebreak lockdown has succeeded in suppressing the spread of the virus, but ""early indications"" from travel data suggested people were abiding by the rules. He has already said the current firebreak will end on 9 November regardless of thefour-week lockdown being introduced across England from Thursday. ""We made a bargain with the people in Wales that if they stuck to everything that we have asked them to do, and I say it's been an extraordinary national effort for 17 days, then we would be able to return to them some of the freedoms that have been denied to them,"" he said. ""I do not intend to step away from that bargain."" Most of the restrictions which were in place during the original lockdown are part of the firebreak On Monday morning, Mr Drakeford resisted calls to follow England in going into a lockdown until early December in order to have uniformity across the UK. He said: ""When Cobra last met - which is three weeks ago - I asked then for an urgent further Cobra to discuss the advice of Sage, that a firebreak or a circuit-break period will be the most effective way of bringing the R number down. ""But Cobra hasn't met ever since. ""While I'm absolutely signed up to better coordination, better information sharing and as I see it, better decision-making, the calling of those meetings is not in the hands of the devolved administrations, it lies in the hands of the UK government. ""Despite being asked to do so, three weeks have gone by and that meeting hasn't happened. In those circumstances there isn't any alternative but for the devolved governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to make the decisions that we think are the right ones for our local populations."" ""By doing everything we're doing and, provided we behave in the right way after the lockdown, we are confident we can get through to Christmas without having to go through this again."" Between 9 November and 2 December, England will be in lockdown and Wales will not Mr Drakeford said he was ""anxious"" people may travel from England to avoid lockdown rules there. He said: ""It's very important that Wales doesn't become an escape for people trying to get round the new tighter restrictions being introduced in England."" He said there were ""a number of details"" being discussed with colleagues in England: ""Public transport is one. Many many train journeys begin in England and end in Wales and vice-versa. It's not clear to us yet what the public transport regime in England will be. ""We are waiting to get some details on business support and whether there will be extra money for Welsh businesses."" ""Most importantly of all hospitality. We are having to meet this morning with representatives of the hospitality industry."" ""Think of Wrexham and Chester, literally a couple of miles apart. If pubs are completely closed as they will be in Chester, what impact will that have on people trying to travel into Wales to go to a pub."" However, a restriction on people coming from England will have a ""devastating"" effect on the hotel industry in Wales, one owner has said. Lynette Esposito, who owns the Elm Tree Hotel in Llandudno, Conwy, has been under local lockdown or firebreak restrictions since September and said the decision to impose a lockdown in England was a ""severe blow"" for Welsh hotels. She said: ""We would've been in a lockdown for nine weeks and most of the hotels in Wales rely almost 100% on business coming out of England, so for us it's a devastating blow. ""The restrictions announced today are going to be of interest, but not much relevance."" Conservative Mr Millar said he did not agree with the decision for Wales to enter a firebreak and called for ""more clarity"" on what the new rules would be. ""We've said all along, that we didn't think that a Wales-wide lockdown was the right thing to do. We felt that because the infection rates were so variable in different parts of Wales."" He said the Welsh Conservatives stood by their stance in Wales despite the decision by the UK government to lockdown England. ""The evidence that's been shared with the Welsh Conservatives by the Welsh Government has been insufficient in our view for a Wales-wide lockdown."" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru leader Mr Price said: ""We have learnt two key lessons from the response to the pandemic so far - going into lockdown too late increases the spread of the virus and coming out too early risks undoing any benefits gained. That is why the approach to the post firebreak period must be slow and steady. ""There should certainly be no lifting of the travel restrictions which have rightly prevented people coming into Wales from Covid hotspots elsewhere in the UK."" Non-essential shops have been closed in Wales, as well as pubs, restaurants and hotels Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced at the weekend that the furlough scheme would be extended until 2 December. It was due to end on Saturday and be replaced with the new, less generous Job Support Scheme (JSS). The movesparked a war of words between the Welsh and UK governments. Mr Drakeford was unhappy that requests for extra funding during the firebreak were rebuffed by the Treasury, but then furlough was extended when the England lockdown was announced. He previously asked the Treasury to extend furlough for one week to coincide with the Welsh firebreak, but his requests were turned down. Chancellor Rishi Sunak also declined a request for the JSS  - which would cover 67% of wages when it replaces furlough - to be brought forward. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford said: ""We had asked the chancellor for some flexibility during our firebreak period, the chancellor said to me that it wasn't possible to do that. ""It turns out that it is possible now, but mostly I just welcome any extra support that businesses in Wales will get over the next period."" The Welsh Government said it had offered to pay the cost for the difference between furlough and the JSS, which a minister estimated was Â£11m. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work?

"Businesses borrowing from banks will leap more than fivefold in 2020 compared to last year, according to analysis from the EY Item Club. The economic forecaster found that net borrowing from banks rose to Â£43.2bn between January and August from Â£8.8bn for 2019. Firms have been adding to their borrowing in order to survive the pandemic as many have seen sales slump. Government-backed loans led the expansion, the researchers found. It expects the total stock of loans from banks to businesses to increase 11% to Â£493bn by the end of the year. The figures excluded lending to other lenders and financial companies and included repayments. ""Financial Services Firms entered the pandemic in a position of capital strength and have supported the economy and business to unprecedented levels since March,"" Omar Ali, UK Financial Services Managing Partner at EY said. ""However, rising unemployment and the ongoing challenges faced by small businesses mean the outlook for the sector is testing."" The lending splurge peaked in March and net lending fell in the summer months as stronger businesses paid back money borrowed as a precaution, said the forecasters, who use a similar economic model to the Treasury. ""However, for the vast majority of firms the loans appear to have been critical, and it is forecast they won't start to repay debt, and reduce their borrowing, until 2022 or even later,"" the analysis said. The rise in lending to business contrasts with a dip in consumer borrowing, the analysis found. Consumer loans will probably fall about 6%, the biggest drop since 2011. It expects write-off rates on consumer credit to rise from 1.3% this year to 2.5% in 2021.
