"Theresa May has called for ""concrete measures"" to ensure girls in Commonwealth countries spend at least 12 years in education. The prime minister pledged Â£212m, which Downing Street said would allow almost one million more girls to go to school. Too often they were forced out by ""discrimination, poverty, or simply the expectations of society"", she said. It comes as Commonwealth leaders gather in London for their summit, which is held every two years. Landale: What next for the Commonwealth? May to meet leaders after Windrush apology Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain. Speaking to an audience including Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, Mrs May said international experts agreed young people need 12 years of quality education if they are to fulfil their potential. ""Across the Commonwealth, tens of millions of young people - usually, but not always, girls - are denied the education that would allow them to get on in life. ""All too often, young people receive only the most basic education before being forced out of school through discrimination, poverty or simply the expectations of society."" Announcing the Â£212m from the foreign aid budget, she urged Commonwealth nations to agree to the 12-year goal, calling for ""concrete measures that will allow it to become a reality"". She also focused on the fight against malaria, saying the Commonwealth has a ""particular duty"" to tackle the disease. ""We cannot, in good conscience, talk about the young people of the world, about securing a legacy for our children and grandchildren, without tackling a disease that, worldwide, kills one of them every two minutes,"" she said. The flags of Commonwealth nations are flying at Westminster ahead of the summit Mrs May also said the UK would support any Commonwealth nation seeking to reform ""outdated"" legislation which criminalised same-sex relationships or failed to protect women and girls. ""As a family of nations we must respect one another's cultures and traditions but we must do so in a manner consistent with our common value of equality - a value that is clearly stated in the Commonwealth Charter. ""Nobody should face discrimination or persecution because of who they are or who they love and the UK stands ready to help any Commonwealth member wanting to reform outdated legislation that makes such discrimination possible."" The prime minister also used her speech to urge the Commonwealth to work together to combat cyber threats to security. ""I look forward to all our members agreeing a new cyber declaration. A powerful statement of intent, it will ensure that the internet remains free and open across the Commonwealth. ""It will help protect our people and our businesses from ever more sophisticated digital threats. And it will do much to counter those who would abuse the freedom of the internet to undermine our values, our security, even our democracies.""

"This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media Russia has denied interfering with evidence at the site of the suspected Syrian chemical attack, which led to Western air strikes on Saturday. In an interview for BBC's Hardtalk, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: ""I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site."" The US raised concern at the international chemical weapons agency. International inspectors will be allowed to visit the site on Wednesday, the Russian military has announced. A nine-strong team from the agency, the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), has been waiting nearby in the Syrian capital Damascus for the green light. Douma was a rebel stronghold at the time of the attack on 7 April and is now under the control of the Syrian government and Russian military. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May has defended Britain's involvement in the air strikes, saying it was to prevent ""further human suffering"", as opposition parties said MPs should have been consulted in advance. Catch up on the aftermath of the air strikes: What was targeted? UK PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? The suspected attack, denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, reportedly killed dozens of people in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Two bombs filled with chemicals were reportedly dropped several hours apart on the town. Syrian medical sources say bodies were found foaming at the mouth, and with discoloured skin and cornea burns. US sources said they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent. What we know about the 'chemical attack' Why is there a war in Syria? Kenneth Ward, US envoy to the OPCW, said: ""It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site. The OPCW is gathering at its headquarters in The Hague ""We are concerned they may have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW Fact- Finding Mission to conduct an effective investigation."" Speaking to the BBC, the Russian foreign minister denied chemical weapons had been used in Douma. ""I cannot be impolite with the heads of other states, but you quoted the leaders of France and the UK and US and, frankly speaking, all the evidence they quoted was based on media reports and social media."" The event did not take place, he said. ""What did take place was the staged thing,"" he added. Mr Lavrov also questioned why the US, UK and France had carried out their retaliatory air strikes before OPCW inspectors were able to visit the site. Russia and the West, he added, were facing a situation worse than during the Cold War due to a lack of channels of communication. In other developments: The US says it is considering fresh economic sanctions against Russia ""in the near future"" EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg said they understood the air strikes had had ""the sole objective"" of preventing further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government OPCW emergency talks were held in The Hague on Monday. The UK's envoy to the OPCW, Peter Wilson, called for the inspectors to be given ""unfettered access"" to Douma and dismissed as ""ludicrous"" Russian suggestions that Britain had helped stage a fake attack. At the end of the day, the Russian embassy held a press conference at which Russian chemical and biological protection troops commander Maj-Gen Igor Kirillov announced that inspectors would visit Douma on Wednesday. A UN security team would first check the area on Tuesday, the general said. The OPCW itself has not  confirmed the plans. The US says 105 missiles were launched and it believes none were intercepted by Syrian defences. It says Syria's chemical weapons programme has been set back years. This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The Russians say 71 missiles were shot down by Syrian systems. One of the three sites hit was the Barzeh complex, which the US says was a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons, although Syria denies this. The other two were suspected chemical weapons facilities at Him Shinshar near Homs. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he had persuaded US President Donald Trump not to pull troops out of Syriaand instead commit ""for the long term"". The US has some 2,000 troops in eastern Syria, mainly supporting the fight against the Islamic State group. This video can not be played From chlorine to Novichok, chemical weapons have been used for more than a century But soon after Mr Macron's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said an early exit was still desirable. ""The US mission has not changed - the president has been clear that he wants US forces to come home as quickly as possible."" Mr Macron said later that France and the US shared the same aim in Syria: the defeat of the Islamic State group. ""The White House is right to recall that the military engagement is against Daesh [IS] and will finish the day that the war against Daesh has been completed,"" he said. ""France has the same position."" Addressing the French parliament, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Saturday's operation had not been the ""prelude to a war"".

"Sir Cliff Richard arriving at the High Court for the third day of the hearing Police felt ""forced"" into giving the BBC advanced notice of their 2014 raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home, a former detective has told the High Court. Ex-Det Supt Matthew Fenwick said South Yorkshire Police had wanted to delay a story about a historical sex abuse investigation into the singer until they could search his Berkshire flat. Sir Cliff, who is suing the BBC over privacy, was never charged. The BBC says its coverage was of ""legitimate public interest"". Lawyers for the singer, who had always denied wrongdoing, said the BBC took the decision to name him in its August 2014 report of the raid, causing ""profound and long-lasting damage"". BBC report shocking, says Cliff Richard Cliff Richard case 'likely to have huge impact' South Yorkshire Police has settled its own case with Sir Cliff by paying him Â£400,000 and argues that the BBC should pay a share of this because its actions were ""far more causative of the damage suffered"". The court has heard BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off that police were looking into a claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985. Giving evidence on the third day of the case, Mr Fenwick talked about a meeting he had with the journalist in July 2014. Mr Fenwick said he did not want a story about Sir Cliff to be run at that stage of the investigation because it could compromise their ongoing inquiry. He added: ""In particular publishing a story could cause problems with a search warrant which we were not ready to do yet."" Mr Fenwick recalled that the BBC journalist referred to Sir Cliff as a ""celebrity paedo"". Mr Fenwick said that, from those words, it was clear Mr Johnson ""clearly knew"" the nature of the allegation being investigated. ""He explained to us that he was ready to publish an exclusive story about the investigation and wanted a comment from us,"" Mr Fenwick told the court. He said: ""At the back of my mind I was thinking that it would not only compromise the investigation but could also compromise Sir Cliff Richard by exposing him to allegations, potentially giving him the opportunity to dispose of evidence."" He told the court Mr Johnson ""said he could and he would [run the story] and we came to an arrangement that he wouldn't publish it then but that we would notify him when we were ready to take further action"". The officer said the BBC was subsequently given information about the search the following month as a ""concession"". Asked by the BBC's barrister, Gavin Millar, whether his case was that Mr Johnson forced police to do a deal, Mr Fenwick said it was, adding: ""I felt that we didn't have many options - there was no option, other than to co-operate with him."" Mr Fenwick also said he had been ""angry"" at a BBC News website story containing an ""untrue"" suggestion that the broadcaster's presence at the raid was a deliberate attempt by the force to ""maximise publicity for the investigation"". He said: ""I made a number of telephone calls to Dan Johnson because I wanted him to ensure that it would be removed"". The BBC television report of the raid featured shots taken from a helicopter showing officers inside Sir Cliff's home in Sunningdale. Describing seeing the coverage, Sir Cliff broke down in the witness box on Friday, saying he felt ""smeared"" by the BBC. In Sir Cliff's written statement,which has been made available online,externalby his lawyers Simkins, he said:  ""It was shocking and upsetting."" He added: ""My health suffered, both mentally and physically."" He is suing the BBC for the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. Lawyers representing the BBC maintain it had a duty to report information about an investigation into a serious criminal offence. They say its journalists had respected Sir Cliff's rights as a ""suspect"" and the ""presumption of innocence"".

"Maxim Borodin had contacted a friend the day before he was found seriously injured beneath his fifth-floor flat A Russian investigative journalist who wrote about the deaths of mercenaries in Syria has died in hospital after falling from his fifth-floor flat. Maxim Borodin was found badly injured by neighbours in Yekaterinburg and taken to hospital, where he later died. Local officials said no suicide note was found but the incident was unlikely to be of a criminal nature. However, a friend revealed Borodin had said his flat had been surrounded by security men a day earlier. Vyacheslav Bashkov described Borodin as a ""principled, honest journalist"" and said Borodin had contacted him at five o'clock in the morning on 11 April saying there was ""someone with a weapon on his balcony and people in camouflage and masks on the staircase landing"". Borodin had been looking for a lawyer, he explained, although he later called him back saying he was wrong and that the security men had been taking part in some sort of exercise. After he was found badly injured at the foot of the building on Thursday, regional authorities said the door of his flat had been locked from the inside, indicating that no-one else had either entered or left the flat. The chief editor of Novy Den, where Borodin worked, said before he died that she could not rule out a crime, adding there was no reason for him to kill himself. Harlem DÃ©sir of the international monitoring organisation OSCE said the death was ""of serious concern"" and called for a thorough investigation. In recent weeks, the journalist had written about Russian mercenaries known as the ""Wagner Group"" who were reportedly killed in Syria on 7 February in a confrontation with US forces. Last week, the outgoing head of the CIA, Mike Pompeo, said that ""a couple hundred"" Russian mercenaries died in the clash in Deir al-Zour province. The mercenaries were apparently taking part in an attack by pro-Syrian government fighters on the headquarters of a US ally, the Syrian Democratic Forces. Russia admits heavy casualties in Syria clash Who are Russia's shadowy mercenaries fighting in Syria? Russian guns for hire dying in Syria Weeks later Russia admitted that several dozen Russian citizens had been either killed or wounded, but stressed they were not regular soldiers. Last month, Borodin had written that three of those killed had come from the Sverdlovsk region in the Urals, in which Yekaterinburg is the main city. Two of the men were from the towns of Asbest and one from Kedrovoye, he said. He had also investigated political scandals, including allegations made by a Belarusian escort known as Nastya Rybka in a video posted by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Journalists in Russia have often been harassed or attacked in recent years for their work. On the same day that Maxim Borodin was found fatally injured, the editor of an official regional newspaper was assaulted in Yekaterinburg, reports say.

"Harvey Weinstein fell from his position of power in Hollywood after a series of sexual harassment allegations The New York Times and New Yorker magazine have won a joint Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on sexual harassment allegations in Hollywood. The reports brought down film mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct and rape. He says all sexual encounters were consensual. The investigations sparked the #MeToo movement, a broad pushback against sexual harassment in many industries. Pulitzers are the most prestigious honour in American journalism. The Pulitzer Prize Board also awards prizes in other literary and artistic categories.This year, rapper Kendrick Lamar becomes the first non-classical or jazz artist to be given the prize for music. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse Is #MeToo changing Hollywood? The Washington Post won the investigative reporting prize for revealing decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct against Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama. The Republican former judge denied the accusations, butthey factored heavily in the special election that the Democratic candidate Doug Jones went on to win. The New York Times also shared a second prize with The Washington Post for coverage of Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The biggest prize winners revealed on Monday reflected a recent reckoning in the US  - and beyond - over the treatment of women by powerful men in the highest ranks of showbusiness, politics, technology and media. Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy said the New York Times' team, led by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, and The New Yorker's contributor Ronan Farrow produced ""explosive, impactful journalism that exposed wealthy and powerful sexual predators."" Their separate, original reporting in October of allegations of assault and harassment by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was followed by more than 100 women coming forward to share their experiences at the hands of the film producer. Reuters won a photography Pulitzer for its coverage of the Rohingya crisis Mr Weinstein - who was ousted from the company he founded - went on to apologise for his behaviour but denied any non-consensual sexual contact. The 66-year-old has been hit by a number of civil lawsuits and is being investigated by police in London, Los Angeles and New York. The exposÃ© led to the watershed #MeToo movement, with thousands of women across the world empowered to speak out about sexual harassment they have faced in their lives. Other Pulitzer winners included Reuters, which won the 2018 prize in international reporting for coverage of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. The news agency also won in the feature photography category for its coverage of the Rohingya crisis, which saw an exodus of 700,000 refugees from Myanmar into Bangladesh. The Pulitzers have been awarded since 1917. More than 2,400 entries were submitted for prizes in categories ranging from public service and breaking news to commentary, cartooning and photography.

"This video can not be played May: We have not done this because President Trump asked us to Theresa May has said it was ""legally and morally right"" for the UK to join air strikes against the Syrian regime to prevent ""further human suffering"". She told MPs there was ""clear evidence"" the Assad government was behind the Douma chemical weapons attack. The UK had ""explored every diplomatic channel"" in response but regrettably decided there was no alternative to ""limited, carefully targeted action"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the action was ""legally questionable"". Calling on Mrs May to publish the legal advice in full, Mr Corbyn said the government must be ""accountable to this Parliament and not to the whims of this US president"". He questioned who was responsible for the attack, saying that ""while much suspicion rightly points to the Assad government"", other groups had carried out similar attacks and weapons inspectors must continue their work. But some Labour MPs backed the decision to launch air strikes. Taking questions for more than three hours, Mrs May defended the decision not to seek Parliamentary approval for the intervention after criticism from opposition parties. MPs then held the first of two emergency debates on Syria which were approved by Speaker John Bercow, with the second to take place on Tuesday. Monday's debate ended with a vote, forced by the SNP, on whether the House had sufficiently debated the matter of Syria. The government won the motion by 314 to 36 votes, a majority of 278. Live: Rolling coverage of the Commons debate Were the Syria air strikes legal? Russia 'not tampering' with Syria site Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit on Saturday by the US, French and UK in response to the alleged chemical attack on Douma on 7 April. Both Syria, which denies any chemical use, and Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian government, have reacted angrily to the action. Briefing Parliament, Mrs May insisted it was in the UK's national interest to act - insisting that ""we have not done this because President Trump asked us to but because it was the right thing to do"". She said the use of chemical weapons could not be ""normalised"" in either Syria or elsewhere, insisting the attack was a ""stain on humanity"" and fitted the pattern of the regime's previous use of such weapons. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM accountable to Parliament not the whims of US president ""No other group could have carried out this attack,"" she told MPs, adding that the Syrian authorities had reportedly attempted to ""conceal the facts... supported by the Russians"". The military response, she insisted, was aimed squarely at degrading the regime's capacity to carry out further ""indiscriminate"" attacks, rather than to try and topple the regime. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg MPs will talk again tomorrow. There are, after all, hugely important principles for them to talk about. They will not, however, have votes that make a difference to anything other than the political atmosphere at Westminster, unless something very unexpected happens. Labour will lead a debate on Tuesday about Parliament's right to approve military action, or not. But the RAF pilots who flew sorties from Cyprus in the early hours of Saturday won't be told by Parliament through a vote that their actions are considered by MPs to be right or wrong. Read the rest of Laura's blog Addressing calls for Parliament to have been given a vote, she said much of the intelligence on which the action was based could not have been shared with MPs and a speedy response was needed to protect the integrity of the operation and prevent further suffering. ""We have always been clear that the government has the right to act quickly in the national interest,"" she said. ""I am absolutely clear that it is Parliament's responsibility to hold me to account for such decisions but it is my responsibility as prime minister to make these decisions."" The Stop the War Coalition protested outside Parliament as MPs debated Returning to the United Nations to try to secure a Security Council resolution would have been futile, she said, and effectively given Russia a ""veto over British foreign policy"". Mr Corbyn called for a new War Powers Act, saying the convention that Parliament should be consulted before military action was ""broken"" and had to be replaced by a ""legal obligation"" to get the backing of MPs. Contrary to what Mrs May claimed, he said it was evident all ""non-military means had not been exhausted"". ""There is no more serious issue then the life and death matters of military action. It is right that Parliament has the power to support or stop the government from taking planned military action."" This video can not be played Amateur footage shows strikes on a military research facility in Damascus, while state TV shows the damage The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said for Parliament to be consulted about military action ""after the event"" was simply not good enough. ""When we are talking about military action in a third country, that is a decision that Parliament should be taking and not government itself,"" he told BBC News. ""That is what democracy is all about."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said the decision had been taken ""behind closed doors"" and much more scrutiny was needed of the objectives behind it. While the situation in Syria was ""very serious"", she said there was not the same ""acute urgency"" for military intervention on humanitarian grounds as there had been in Libya in 2011. Will West's attack sway Syria's Assad? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Downing Street publishedits legal case for its part in the strikes, stating that the action was legally justified on humanitarian grounds. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. There has been no confirmation of any civilian casualties. The MoD has stated the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"". The UK and US have said the strikes were successful, withPresident Trump warning the US is ""locked and loaded"" for further actionif there are more chemical attacks. On Saturday, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia, while all Nato allies have given the military action their full support.

"The Windrush generation began arriving in the UK in 1948 The home secretary has apologised for the treatment of the Windrush generation, saying it was ""wrong"" and ""appalling"" that some face deportation. Many immigrants who arrived from the Commonwealth decades ago as children have been told they are here illegally. Amber Rudd said they would be helped to attain required documents for free and added she was concerned her department ""sometimes loses sight"" of individuals. Labour's David Lammy said it was a ""day of national shame"". The Tottenham MP said it was ""inhumane and cruel"" that it had taken the government so long to act. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""This is a day of national shame"" Thousands of people arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration 70 years ago. They are known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the ship, the Empire Windrush, that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. Changes to immigration law in 2012, which requires people to have documentation to work, rent a property or access benefits, including healthcare, has highlighted the issue and left people fearful about their status. Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Windrush peers attack Home Office Michael Braithwaite, who moved to the UK from Barbados when he was nine, was let go from his 15-year job as a special needs teaching assistant after his employers ruled he was an illegal immigrant. He said: ""I fell to pieces inside. I didn't actually show it externally until I came home and I sat and I cried. ""My whole life sunk right down to my feet. I was distraught."" This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite Home Secretary Ms Rudd confirmed new measures to the House of Commons to help the Windrush generation. These include: A new taskforce dedicated to helping those affected Plans to work with departments across government to gather evidence on behalf of immigrants - documentation for every year is usually expected, such as bank statements or payslips A pledge that all cases will be resolved in two weeks All fees for new documentation waived so people are not ""out of pocket"" - normally Â£229 A new website will be set up with information and a direct contact point Ms Rudd also said she was ""concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes lose sight of the individual"", but it was why she decided to act. When asked how many of the Windrush generation had been deported as a result of this issue, Ms Rudd said she was ""not aware of any person being removed"" and would have to speak to High Commissioners of different Commonwealth countries to find out. This video can not be played Immigration minister Caroline Nokes: ""We have made some mistakes, which we cannot continue to make"" Earlier, immigration minister Caroline Nokes wasasked by ITV News,externalif any people had been deported. She said: ""There have been some horrendous situations, which as a minister have appalled me."" Told by the reporter ""that's a yes"", and asked how many, she said: ""No, I don't know the numbers, but what I'm determined to do going forward is we'll have no more of this."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government should consider compensation for anyone who had been wrongly deported. This video can not be played Trevor Phillips: ""The government thought this was a group of people who really didn't matter"" A Home Office spokeswoman said that any people who believe they or a family member have been wrongly deported should get in contact so their case can be reviewed. The prime minister reversed her decision not to meet Commonwealth leaders to discuss the issue after the letter from Mr Lammy and MPs across the house. A meeting is now set for Tuesday. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he welcomed Mrs May's decision to meet other leaders, but added: ""She must now go further and make an immediate commitment to recognise and secure the rights of Commonwealth citizens."" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent When a home secretary describes her own department's treatment of people as ""appalling"" and criticises it for ""losing sight of the individual"", it's clear something has gone very wrong. Amber Rudd's admission in the House of Commons that she could not say whether any of the Windrush immigrants had been wrongly deported only made things worse. More than one MP harked back to the department's previous leadership under Theresa May. Her intention to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had led to what David Lammy called a ""day of shame"" for the government. A steady stream of stories about mishandling of cases, a minister appearing unsure about deportations and an apparent U-turn from Number 10 on a meeting with Caribbean leaders have all fuelled criticism of the government. The secretary of state promised to sort things out, a special task force would handle cases ""sensitively"" and apologies were given all round. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents. The Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury Docks with 482 Jamaicans on board Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British. TheGuardian newspaper has highlighted a number of cases,externalof such people being threatened with deportation.

"Scientists have improved a naturally occurring enzyme which can digest some of our most commonly polluting plastics. PET, the strong plastic commonly used in bottles, takes hundreds of years to break down in the environment. The modified enzyme, known as PETase, can start breaking down the same material in just a few days. This could revolutionise the recycling process, allowing plastics to be re-used more effectively. UK consumers use around 13 billion plastic drinks bottles a year but more than three billion are not recycled. Five ways to break up with plastic Could plant-based plastics help tackle pollution? Ocean plastic could triple within a decade Originally discovered in Japan, the enzyme is produced by a bacterium which ""eats"" PET. Ideonella sakaiensisuses the plastic as its major energy source. Researchersreported in 2016,externalthat they had found the strain living in sediments at a bottle recycling site in the port city of Sakai. PET is commonly used to make plastic bottles ""[PET] has only been around in vast quantities over the last 50 years, so it's actually not a very long timescale for a bacteria to have evolved to eat something so man-made,"" commented Prof John McGeehan, who was involved in the current study. Polyesters, the group of plastics that PET (also called polyethylene terephthalate) belongs to, do occur in nature. ""They protect plant leaves,"" explained the University of Portsmouth researcher. ""Bacteria have been evolving for millions of years to eat that."" The switch to PET was nevertheless ""quite unexpected"" and an international team of scientists set out to determine how the PETase enzyme had evolved. A high definition 3D model of the enzyme was created, using the powerful x-ray beamline at Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire. Once they understood its structure, the team noted that they could improve the performance of PETase by adjusting a few residues on its surface. The detailed model of PETase allowed researchers to see how the enzyme could be improved This suggests that the natural enzyme isn't fully optimized yet and there is the potential to engineer it. PETase was also tested on PEF plastic, a proposed plant-based alternative to PET that is similarly slow to degrade in nature. ""We were absolutely stunned when we did that experiment because it actually works better on PEF than PET,"" Prof McGeehan told BBC News. by David Shukman, Science Editor The team behind the research at Portsmouth University includes PhD students and even undergraduates, and when I visited their lab their excitement was infectious. They know that it took clever chemistry to design the PET polymer used in so many billions of bottles and they are delighted to have helped find a way to unpick it. They have grown up with the scourge of plastic pollution and feel highly motivated about trying to tackle it. Yet big challenges lie ahead in turning an ingenious discovery into a real-world application. Developing a technique for producing the enzyme cheaply will be one key hurdle; another will be to harness its power on an industrial scale. But this is an example of accelerated science. A type of bacteria evolved to live off plastic in the last few decades. The enzyme it uses to digest PET was only recently identified. Now we have details of the newly engineered and more efficient version of that enzyme. In the search for scientific solutions to the plastic pollution crisis, momentum like this is vital. Polyesters, industrially produced from petroleum, are widely used in plastic bottles and clothing. Current recycling processes mean that polyester materials follow a downward quality spiral, losing some of their properties each time they go through the cycle. Bottles become fleeces, then carpets, after which they often end up in landfill. PETase reverses the manufacturing process, reducing polyesters to their building blocks, ready to be used again. This video can not be played Engineered PETase was shown to begin breaking down polyesters within a few days ""They could be used to make more plastic and that would avoid using any more oil...Then basically we'd close the loop. We'd actually have proper recycling,"" explained Prof McGeehan. The enzyme is a number of years away from being deployed on a widespread scale. It will need to degrade PET faster than its current time of a few days before becoming economically viable as part of the recycling landscape. Prof McGeehan is hopeful that this marks the beginning of a shift in the management of plastics. ""There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill and the environment, and I think if we can adopt these technologies we actually have a potential solution in the future to doing that"" he added.

"Women from European descent are twice as likely to be naturally blonde as men, according to new research. The largest ever genetic study on pigmentation looked at nearly 300,000 people of European descent. It found 124 new genes that play a major role in determining human hair colour variation. The report's authors say they are not sure why there are so many more blonde women than men, calling it an ""intriguing mystery"". The study which is published inNature Genetics,,externalbuilds on previous genetic studies that had only identified a dozen or so hair colour genes. The data was supplied by the UK Biobank, American DNA testing company 23andMe and the International Visible Trait Genetics Consortium and their study partners in the Netherlands, Australia and Italy. They chose people of European descent because of their variety in hair colours. They found men were three times as likely as women to have black hair. Prof Tim Spector, joint lead author, from Kings College London, told the BBC they were not expecting to find so many more blonde women than men. ""It's a mystery and it's intriguing because it wasn't what we were looking for. We thought it was a bias but it wouldn't go away and it's found in every sub-group of every population we saw,"" he said. ""It's a curious mystery because it's a very big effect - to see two and threefold effects both in a whole variety of American populations and European ones was quite amazing."" The researchers say it opens up a whole new area of research to discover why, but Prof Spector has some theories. ""We thought it might have something to do with the attraction of women for darker skinned men and vice versa - but we don't think the genes are any different.  We think the genes are being expressed differently - so for some reason the blonde genes that may be there at birth are persisting in females and disappearing in males."" So blonde women are just as likely to give birth to blonde boys as blonde girls, but the boys are not keeping their genetically blonde hair when they grow up. The changing of the expression of genes - switching them off and on - is known as epigenetics. Prof Spector said it could be other genes that are affecting the process and there are examples of this in mice studies where chemicals, stress and hormones were found to affect the way some of the pigment genes work. ""But some of it could be for evolutionary reasons because blonde women are more likely to be successful with men and men are more likely to be more successful with women if they're dark-haired rather than light-haired. ""A lot of this is speculation - but it opens up a whole new area of research to try and work out why genes might be expressed differently in men and women and what the motive is - and whether this is a recent cultural change."" The discovery of 124 genes connected to hair colour also revealed some links to cancers such as skin, testicular, prostate and ovarian. Other pigment genes they found affected the chances of having Crohn's disease and other forms of bowel disease. The researchers, who include experts at Erasmus MC University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, hope their discoveries will help improve the understanding of these diseases and help develop new drugs to target these genes. The genes also make it easier and more accurate to predict hair colour from DNA, which could help in forensic science for solving crimes, they add.

The alert details methods used to compromise the networking equipment used to move traffic across the net. This could be used to mount a future offensive, it warned. In a press conference about the alert, White House cyber-security co-ordinator Rob Joyce said the US and its allies had ""high confidence"" that Russia was behind the ""broad campaign"". Intelligence gathered by the US and UK suggested that millions of machines directing data around the net were being targeted, he said. Compromised devices were used to look at data passing through them, added Mr Joyce. Attackers also sought to undermine the firewalls and intrusion detection systems organisations used to spot malicious traffic before it reached users. It is possible that Russian intrusions may be increasing. But it is too early to know for sure if this is the case, since it takes time to spot this - if it is spotted at all - and to be sure it is Russian. The crucial thing is whether Russia actually employs its offensive capability to actually do something destructive. So far, there has been relatively little sign of this in the US or UK, although Russia is accused of launching destructive attacks against Ukraine. It is worth saying that Britain and the US will be carrying out almost identical activities in Russia, pre-positioning in Russian networks to be able to respond. What no-one is quite sure of is whether this creates a deterrent a bit like mutually assured nuclear destruction in the Cold War. Read Gordon's full blog In addition, Mr Joyce said, many different organisations had come under attack for months at a time in a bid to scoop up valuable intellectual property, business information or to get at their customers. ""When we see malicious cyber-activity, whether Kremlin or other nation state actors, we are going to push back,"" said Mr Joyce. Ciaran Martin, head of the UK's NCSC, said the issuing of the alert marked a ""significant moment"" as the two powers had never before given joint advice on how to deal with attacks. ""Many of the techniques used by Russia exploit basic weaknesses in network systems,"" said Mr Martin. The principal targets of the global campaign were internet service providers, firms running critical infrastructure, government departments and large companies, the alert stated. And it contained detailed information about attack methods, the signs left when hardware has been compromised, and how networks change when they have been breached. The advice given to firms has included ways to configure their systems correctly and how to apply patches to address hardware vulnerabilities. Mr Martin said GCHQ, NCSC's parent organisation, had tracked the threat posed by Russian cyber-gangs for more than 20 years. Further intelligence about the attacks had been added by ""multiple"" cyber-security organisations and companies, he added. The UK was working with America, its other allies and the technology industry to ""expose Russia's unacceptable cyber-behaviour, so they are held accountable for their actions"", said Mr Martin.

"The warning is set to impact ZTE's efforts to sell 5G infrastructure and devices The UK's cyber-defence watchdog has confirmed it has blacklisted one of China's leading state-owned companies. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has written to UK telecoms providers warning them that the use of ZTE's equipment and services could pose a national security risk. The move coincides with a US government ban preventing American businesses from selling components to the Shenzhen-based company. ZTE has yet to respond. ""It is entirely appropriate and part of NCSC's duty to highlight potential risks to the UK's national security and provide advice based on our technical expertise,"" said a statement from Dr Ian Levy,the organisation's technical director,external. ""NCSC assess that the national security risks arising from the use of ZTE equipment or services within the context of the existing UK telecommunications infrastructure cannot be mitigated."" BTformed a research and development partnership,externalwith ZTE in 2011, and has also distributed modems manufactured by the Chinese firm. ""ZTE is just one of many research partners with which BT is engaged,"" a spokeswoman for the British firm told the BBC. ""Such projects focus on the future uses of networks and technologies and do not necessarily result in the commercial deployment of the research partner's kit in our network. She added that BT had ""a robust testing regime in place"" to ensure its network remained secure. In 2012, the US House Intelligence Committee warned that both ZTE and another Chinese firm, Huawei, posed a security threat. Dr Levy also referenced ZTE's rival in a letter sent to the UK telecoms sector, accordingto the Financial Times,external. ZTE also sells handsets and other computing equipment to consumers ""The UK telecommunications network already contains a significant amount of equipment supplied by Huawei, also a Chinese equipment manufacturer,"" he wrote. ""Adding in new equipment and services from another Chinese supplier would render our existing mitigations ineffective."" The NCSC's parent organisation, GCHQ, already carries out its own checks on Huawei's equipment. A spokesman for Huawei declined to comment. ""What you're seeing here is that the UK government has finite resources,"" commented Alan Woodward, a former consultant to GCHQ. ""We could end up in a situation where the checks and balances needed to protect our security are insufficient, and effectively overwhelmed. ""Using yet more equipment sourced from China could mean that we open ourselves up to an unacceptable risk."" The US's action against ZTE stems from the fact the firm sold on US hardware and software to an Iranian telecoms carrier, in breach of sanctions imposed by Washington. ZTE pleaded guilty to the offence last year and paid a $890m (Â£621m) penalty. At the time the firm also promised to dismiss four senior workers and discipline 35 others. But it acknowledged in March that while it had fired the four managers, it had failed to keep the second part of its promise. ""We can't trust what they are telling us is truthful,"" an unnamed US official told the Reuters news agency. ""And in international commerce, truth is pretty important."" The Verge highlighted that theban on US companies selling ZTE further components,externalmeans the Chinese firm will be unable to continue using Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors in its smartphones for up to seven years.

"This video can not be played Comey assesses Trump in new memoir Former FBI director James Comey has said Donald Trump is ""morally unfit to be president"" and treats women like ""pieces of meat"". Mr Comey was giving his first major television interview since he was fired by President Trump last year. He told ABC News that Mr Trump lies constantly and may have obstructed justice. Hours before the interview aired, the president went on the offensive, accusing Mr Comey of ""many lies"". Mr Comey told ABC's 20/20 programme on Sunday night: ""I don't buy this stuff about him being mentally incompetent or early stages of dementia."" ""I don't think he's medically unfit to be president. I think he's morally unfit to be president. ""Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country. The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that,"" Mr Comey said. James Comey may be 'slimy', but he's not a liar Six claims about Trump in Comey book Trump's allies trash 'lyin' FBI memoir How Twitter saw Comey vs Trump row After the interview aired, Mr Trump's party - via the Republican National Committee - released a statement saying Mr Comey's publicity tour for his new book showed ""his true higher loyalty is to himself"".

""The only thing worse than Comey's history of misconduct is his willingness to say anything to sell books,"" it said. It is the latest development in a long-standing feud between the two men, further fuelled by the upcoming publication of Mr Comey's memoir A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership. The ex-FBI chief is on a publicity blitz for the book. President Trump has said the ""badly reviewed book"" raises ""big questions"". He also suggested Mr Comey should be imprisoned, and in recent days began referring to him as a ""slime ball"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The story dates back to the 2016 presidential election, when Mr Comey was FBI director, and the investigation into Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails on a private server while Secretary of State. In July 2016, he said that she had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of the emails, but the FBI would not press charges. However, in October, days before the vote, he sent a letter to Congress telling them the FBI wasreopening an investigationafter finding more emails.  The letter went public - andMrs Clinton says it handed Donald Trump the election. On 6 November, the FBI said it had completed its review into the new trove of emails and there would, again, be no charges. Once Mr Trump became president, Mr Comey says he tried to extract a pledge of personal loyalty from him - something the president fiercely denies. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year In March 2017, when alleged links between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia were being investigated by the FBI, Mr Trump allegedly pressured Mr Comey to publicly declare that the president was not personally being investigated - something the then director says he declined to do. Some Democrats blamed Mr Comey for costing Mrs Clinton the election, while Trump supporters felt he was targeting the president with the Russia investigation. Before revealing the new Clinton investigation, one staff member asked Mr Comey: ""Should you consider that what you're about do to may help elect Donald Trump president?"" Mr Comey said he responded: ""Down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent force."" On the Clinton probe more generally, he said: ""The FBI drove this investigation and we did it in a competent and independent way. I would bet my life on that."" He was fired by President Trump in May and found out about his dismissal by watching TV news. FBI boss who went from 'respect' to 'nut' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words ABC News has released a full 42,000-word transcript of the interview,externalbetween Mr Comey and chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. A chunk of the interview deals with the sacking of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on 13 February 2017 for lying about contacts with the Russian ambassador. A day later, Mr Comey is sitting in the Oval Office with Mr Trump alone - the vice-president and the attorney-general have been asked to leave. The former FBI head asserts in the interview that Mr Trump tried to pressure him into dropping any investigation into Mr Flynn. ""I took it as a direction,"" he told Mr Stephanopoulos. ""He's - his words were, though, 'I hope you can let it go'."" Mr Comey says he let the comment pass, but concedes he should perhaps have suggested to the president that it would amount to obstruction of justice. ""It's certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend - and I'm just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor, it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent."" Mr Trump strongly denies Mr Comey's account. Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher James Comey thinks Donald Trump is a serial liar who degrades women and is ""morally unfit"" to be president. He says it's ""possible"" but ""unlikely"" that Russia has compromised the president, and that he may have obstructed the collusion investigation. He also believes the American people can't do anything about it until the November 2020 presidential election. That's just one of the contradictions that emerged in Mr Comey's interview. He said he strove to make non-political decisions about the highly political 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign. He spoke of integrity and honour, but confessed that he may not have had the ""guts"" to confront the president. The former director gave a complex interview reflecting a man challenged to draw meaning from his place at the centre of the biggest political stories of a lifetime. It made for gripping television. Now Trump loyalists will pick apart his remarks and return fire. ""Nobody gets out alive,"" Mr Comey quipped in the early days of the Clinton investigation. It wasn't really a joke then. And it certainly isn't now. Six explosive new claims by James Comey In the primetime TV interview, Mr Comey suggested that the president had surrounded himself with people loyal to him -  he compared Mr Trump to mob bosses he had investigated as a prosecutor. ""The loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant centre of everything, it's all about how do you serve the boss, what's in the boss' interests,"" he said. Asked if those around the president were ""enabling bad behaviour"", Mr Comey said: ""The challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him."" Mr Obama during Mr Comey's swearing in ceremony at the FBI in 2013 Mr Comey, however, said he did not believe President Trump should be impeached. ""I hope not because I think impeaching and removing Donald Trump from office would let the American people off the hook,"" he said. Instead, he said, it was something the American people were ""duty-bound to do directly"" at the voting booth. During the extensive interview, Mr Comey also said: ""A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they're pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it - that person's not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds"" Talking about himself in connection with the Clinton investigation, Mr Comey described himself as ""a deeply flawed human surrounded by other flawed humans trying to make decisions with an eye, not on politics, but on those higher values"" Readers of his book ""may still walk out of this thinking I'm an idiot, but I'm an honest idiot"" Three takeaways from James Comey's memoir.

She told MPs there was ""clear evidence"" the Assad government was behind the Douma chemical weapons attack.

But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the action was ""legally questionable"".

"This video can not be played JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin says his chain of pubs will no longer be on social media Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has used Twitter to tell its 44,000 followers that it is quitting social media. The firm's head office and 900 pubs will quit the micro-blogging site, and also Instagram and Facebook, with immediate effect, it said. The pub chain linked the move to bad publicity surrounding social media including the ""trolling"" of MPs. Chairman Tim Martin told the BBC that society would be better off if people cut the amount of social media use. The firm said its decision had also been influenced by concerns regarding the ""misuse of personal data"" and ""the addictive nature of social media"". Allow Twitter content?

""We are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business,"" said Mr Martin. He told the BBC he had always thought the idea that social media was essential for advertising was untrue. ""We were also concerned that pub managers were being side-tracked from the real job of serving customers,"" he said. ""I don't believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever."" The chairman said that it had consulted its pub managers before making the move, and ""90-to-95% felt using social media was not helping the business"". Wetherspoon on Twitter: The best bits Wetherspoon surviving the 'trendy types' Mr Martin told BBC Radio 5 Live that he thinks coming off social media would be good for society in general. He said that if people ""limited their social media to half an hour a day, they'd be mentally and physically better off"". He added: ""I find most people I know waste their time on it. A lot of them say they know they waste their time on it, but they struggle to get off it."" It has become received wisdom that a social media presence, used for everything from customer support to promoting the brand, is now a vital tool in the marketing strategy of any business big or small. So why does JD Wetherspoon feel it can do without one? The pub chain has certainly put plenty of effort into it until now, with hundreds of different Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. But the truth is that none had won much of a mass following - and those who ran the accounts were not doing a very good job. A tweet pushing fish and chips on Good Friday got just three re-tweets. Managing an effective social media strategy and making sure staff running so many accounts stick to company policy is a very time consuming and expensive business. Perhaps for Wetherspoons all of this effort has become more trouble than it is worth. The chairman reassured its followers that it would ""still be as vocal as ever"", but would instead use its magazine and website as well as the press for news updates. He said customers could also get in touch with them by speaking with their local pub manager. ""It's becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion,"" Mr Martin added. 'I was a teacher for 17 years - but I couldn't read' 'The most significant development since the safety belt' Velodrome 'track of champions' for sale The pub chain has more than 100,000 Facebook followers and more than 6,000 on Instagram - both relatively small totals. Asked whether Wetherspoon's move could start a business trend, Mr Martin said he hoped not. ""Currently we've got a massive commercial advantage because everyone else is wasting hours of their time,"" he said. The move comes amid a wider corporate backlash against social media. In February, consumer goods giantUnilever threatened to pull all ads from online platforms like Facebook and Googleif they did not do enough to police extremist and illegal content. And following the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Tesla bossElon Musk had the official Facebook pages for his Tesla and SpaceX companies deleted.

"Activist Pu Chunmei (left) was one of several Sina Weibo users who protested against the ban Chinese social media network Sina Weibo has backtracked from a controversial gay content ban after a massive outcry. Last Friday the microblogging platform said that posts related to homosexuality would be taken down. It prompted a deluge of posts from outraged netizens protesting against the decision. On Monday, Sina Weibo said it would reverse the ban. Often described as China's answer to Twitter, Sina Weibo is one of the most popular social networks in the country. Last Friday Sina Weibo made a surprise announcement that it was launching a ""clean-up campaign"". It said that for the next three months, the platform would remove content including images, videos, text and cartoons that were related to pornography, violence, or homosexuality. ""This is to further ensure a clear and harmonious society and environment,"" the network said in its statement, adding that it had already scrubbed more than 50,000 posts by then. Sina Weibo said it was initiating the clean-up because of stricter internet laws put in place last year, but it did not explain why it was only acting now. Chinese authorities have embarked on a campaign in recent years aimed at purging internet content that it deems inappropriate. By early Monday morning, the most censored search term on Weibo was ""homosexuality"", according to censorship tracker FreeWeibo. Over the weekend many in the LGBT community took to the network to protest against the decision, using hashtags such as #IAmGay# and #ScumbagSinaHelloIAmGay#. Some tried testing the ban and uploaded pictures of themselves with partners or gay friends or relatives. Among them was LGBT rights activist Pu Chunmei, whose impassioned post accompanied with pictures of her with her gay son quickly went viral. Ms Pu posted this picture with the caption: ""Be yourself, don't hide."" ""My son and I love our country... we are proud to be Chinese!"" she said. ""But today I saw the announcement by Sina Weibo...as a source of news, it is discriminating and attacking minorities, and this is violence!"" Another widely-shared post was of an undated video showing a social experiment where gay volunteers stood in the street inviting passers-by to hug them. The poster claimed the original video had been taken down, and said ""today I couldn't help myself but post this again"". As of early Monday morning many such posts were still online, as censors appeared to struggle to keep up with the deluge. Then Sina Weibo made another announcement: it said its clean-up would ""no longer apply to homosexual content"". ""We thank everyone for their discussion and suggestions,"" the company added. Netizens cheered the reversal. ""There is absolutely nothing wrong with being homosexual...we hope that Weibo will not perpetrate such discrimination in the future,"" said one user. Homosexuality was decriminalised more than two decades ago. Conservative attitudes still prevail in many parts of the country, but that has not stopped the LGBT community and activists from having a strong and vibrant presence. Though gay marriage is officially not allowed, some gay couples have held ceremonial celebrations to raise awareness But in recent months, some began to fear that this presence was starting to be curtailed by conservative forces. Some saw the Sina Weibo ban as part of a larger trend of sidelining the LGBT community, including a move last year by an official media watchdog that deemed homosexual content as ""pornographic and vulgar"". Why gay people in China pledged not to enter sham marriages An Asian gay icon lives on 15 years after his death China 'gay conversion': Accounts of shocks and pills The official Chinese government response has always been ""neither supportive nor against"" homosexuality, where it ""does not promote"" LGBT rights, activist Li Tingting told BBC Chinese.

"This video can not be played Moving cars, lorries, boats and planes - seen from an altitude of 505km A British spacecraft is now routinely making movies of the Earthâs surface. Carbonite-2 was built bySurrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL),externalin Guildford and launched in January. It is the forerunner of a network of spacecraft that will be sent up in the years ahead to be operated byEarth-i,external, an analytics firm also of Guildford. Carbonite's short clips are the first high-definition, full-colour videos to be delivered from orbit by a commercial satellite on a regular basis. The sequences have a resolution of one metre, which means the movement of cars, lorries, boats and planes is easily discerned. To mark the end of the satellite's commissioning phase, SSTL has released a number of videos that have been prepared with Earth-i. These include views of Dubai Airport, Buenos Aires, Puerto Antofagasta, Rio de Janeiro, Diego Garcia and Mumbai Airport. UK firm plans space video network 'Suitcase space radar' returns image NZ rocket launch heralds new wave Andrew Cawthorne, the director of Earth observation at SSTL, told BBC News: ""We've made now coming up to 500 videos. We have an automated chain, which we had to fine-tune during commissioning, but now the files come down off the spacecraft and pop out a few minutes later. ""The way this satellite works is that it has to point at a target and hold its gaze, even though it's flying overhead at several km per second. The longest video we've made so far is 60 seconds, and I think the accuracy of the pointing speaks for itself."" Earth observation has long made use of great swathes of still imagery, and at much higher resolution than Carbonite can provide. But video brings some additional capabilities. For example, seeing movement within a scene helps with interpretation. If there are transient clouds crossing the target, having video increases the chances of getting a clear view. Analytics experts can also use the multiple frames in the sequence to make 3D models of the ground, or to ""stack"" those frames, one on top of the other, to synthesise a more resolved image, down to 60cm in Carbonite's case. Carbonite was conceived as a model for a quick-build, ultra-low-cost satellite The satellite was designed by SSTL to be small (100kg), low cost and quick to assemble. To that end, it incorporates the sorts of components one would normally find in high-volume consumer electronics. This puts Carbonite-2 at the centre of the emerging trend that is dubbed ""new space"". A growing number of start-ups, many with their roots in the IT sector, are exploiting the cheaper technologies to challenge ""old"" practices in the established space sector. One key innovation they are promoting is high-repeat imagery. That is, acquiring views of the same scene several times a day. This makes detecting ""change"", and the causes of change, in an Earth scene much more straightforward. But achieving this requires flying a whole train of satellites, and Earth-i plans to loft at least 15 Carbonites into a constellation it will call Vivid-i. The first five of these platforms have been contracted from SSTL and should be ready for launch at the end of 2019. A video's multiple frames enable 3D models of the surface to be constructed ""[Carbonite-2] is delivering the world's first commercially available colour video from space. This is a big thing for the UK,"" said Richard Blain, CEO of Earth-i. ""People might say, 'well, so what?' But this is a new paradigm in space data. One very simple, easy-to-understand example: if you take a still image of a wind farm, you can't tell if the blades are turning. If you take a video, you will know not only which turbines are turning but how fast. At that point, you can start to calculate outputs, and that kind of information is of interest to energy traders."" Earth-i describes some of the analysis that can be done using videoin this explainer,external. Many of the new-space constellations that are coming online are American. Earth-i will be a prominent European challenger, as will Iceye, a Finnish start-up that launched the first of its network of radar imagers on the very same rocket that orbited Carbonite-2. Space officials on this side of the Atlantic are keen to help these companies mature and grow their markets. Josef Aschbacher is the director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency. He told BBC News: ""Earth-i don't need us to build their satellites; they have their own supplier in SSTL for that. But Esa can help them get their data well understood, calibrated and 'certified' as being of good quality, and then introduce them into a large market. ""Esa has access to a lot of users of Earth observation data [within the European Union's Copernicus Earth observation user community], and many of them will be interested in the movies because they're an added new type of information."" This video can not be played Josef Aschbacher: It's not all Silicon Valley; Europe has its ""new space"" companies as well Another major potential customer for future Vivid-i products is the British military. It is now working with Carbonite-2's still and moving pictures to assess how they could be best used by the armed forces. The MoD has a future vision of video being beamed directly into the cockpit of fighter jets, to help improve the situational awareness of UK pilots. Air Vice Marshal ""Rocky"" Rochelle, Chief of Staff (Capability) for the Royal Air Force, said: âIâm delighted to see how Carbonite-2 has progressed through commissioning; the images and video captures have been of high quality and will be of great utility to defence. ""We are excited to see what this capability demonstrator will teach us about how we can use small satellites, as a single platform and as a future constellation.""

"Women from European descent are twice as likely to be naturally blonde as men, according to new research. The largest ever genetic study on pigmentation looked at nearly 300,000 people of European descent. It found 124 new genes that play a major role in determining human hair colour variation. The report's authors say they are not sure why there are so many more blonde women than men, calling it an ""intriguing mystery"". The study which is published inNature Genetics,,externalbuilds on previous genetic studies that had only identified a dozen or so hair colour genes. The data was supplied by the UK Biobank, American DNA testing company 23andMe and the International Visible Trait Genetics Consortium and their study partners in the Netherlands, Australia and Italy. They chose people of European descent because of their variety in hair colours. They found men were three times as likely as women to have black hair. Prof Tim Spector, joint lead author, from Kings College London, told the BBC they were not expecting to find so many more blonde women than men. ""It's a mystery and it's intriguing because it wasn't what we were looking for. We thought it was a bias but it wouldn't go away and it's found in every sub-group of every population we saw,"" he said. ""It's a curious mystery because it's a very big effect - to see two and threefold effects both in a whole variety of American populations and European ones was quite amazing."" The researchers say it opens up a whole new area of research to discover why, but Prof Spector has some theories. ""We thought it might have something to do with the attraction of women for darker skinned men and vice versa - but we don't think the genes are any different.  We think the genes are being expressed differently - so for some reason the blonde genes that may be there at birth are persisting in females and disappearing in males."" So blonde women are just as likely to give birth to blonde boys as blonde girls, but the boys are not keeping their genetically blonde hair when they grow up. The changing of the expression of genes - switching them off and on - is known as epigenetics. Prof Spector said it could be other genes that are affecting the process and there are examples of this in mice studies where chemicals, stress and hormones were found to affect the way some of the pigment genes work. ""But some of it could be for evolutionary reasons because blonde women are more likely to be successful with men and men are more likely to be more successful with women if they're dark-haired rather than light-haired. ""A lot of this is speculation - but it opens up a whole new area of research to try and work out why genes might be expressed differently in men and women and what the motive is - and whether this is a recent cultural change."" The discovery of 124 genes connected to hair colour also revealed some links to cancers such as skin, testicular, prostate and ovarian. Other pigment genes they found affected the chances of having Crohn's disease and other forms of bowel disease. The researchers, who include experts at Erasmus MC University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, hope their discoveries will help improve the understanding of these diseases and help develop new drugs to target these genes. The genes also make it easier and more accurate to predict hair colour from DNA, which could help in forensic science for solving crimes, they add.

"Activist Pu Chunmei (left) was one of several Sina Weibo users who protested against the ban Chinese social media network Sina Weibo has backtracked from a controversial gay content ban after a massive outcry. Last Friday the microblogging platform said that posts related to homosexuality would be taken down. It prompted a deluge of posts from outraged netizens protesting against the decision. On Monday, Sina Weibo said it would reverse the ban. Often described as China's answer to Twitter, Sina Weibo is one of the most popular social networks in the country. Last Friday Sina Weibo made a surprise announcement that it was launching a ""clean-up campaign"". It said that for the next three months, the platform would remove content including images, videos, text and cartoons that were related to pornography, violence, or homosexuality. ""This is to further ensure a clear and harmonious society and environment,"" the network said in its statement, adding that it had already scrubbed more than 50,000 posts by then. Sina Weibo said it was initiating the clean-up because of stricter internet laws put in place last year, but it did not explain why it was only acting now. Chinese authorities have embarked on a campaign in recent years aimed at purging internet content that it deems inappropriate. By early Monday morning, the most censored search term on Weibo was ""homosexuality"", according to censorship tracker FreeWeibo. Over the weekend many in the LGBT community took to the network to protest against the decision, using hashtags such as #IAmGay# and #ScumbagSinaHelloIAmGay#. Some tried testing the ban and uploaded pictures of themselves with partners or gay friends or relatives. Among them was LGBT rights activist Pu Chunmei, whose impassioned post accompanied with pictures of her with her gay son quickly went viral. Ms Pu posted this picture with the caption: ""Be yourself, don't hide."" ""My son and I love our country... we are proud to be Chinese!"" she said. ""But today I saw the announcement by Sina Weibo...as a source of news, it is discriminating and attacking minorities, and this is violence!"" Another widely-shared post was of an undated video showing a social experiment where gay volunteers stood in the street inviting passers-by to hug them. The poster claimed the original video had been taken down, and said ""today I couldn't help myself but post this again"". As of early Monday morning many such posts were still online, as censors appeared to struggle to keep up with the deluge. Then Sina Weibo made another announcement: it said its clean-up would ""no longer apply to homosexual content"". ""We thank everyone for their discussion and suggestions,"" the company added.

"Forensics teams attended the scene in Brixton on Sunday evening Two people have been stabbed to death in London in separate attacks within 40 minutes of one another. A 26-year-old man died in hospital after being attacked in Colindale, north-west London, whilea woman in her 30s died at the scene of a stabbing in Brixton, south London. An 18-year-old man is in a critical condition after a third separate stabbing three hours later, on Sunday. More than 35 people have been stabbed to death in the capital so far in 2018. A woman, 34, was arrested on suspicion of murder at the scene of the Colindale attack. Police said they were called at 17:58 BST on Sunday to Zenith Close and found a man with stab wounds. He died in hospital later that evening. Police said the victim and suspect were known to one another. A crime scene is in place and inquiries continue. 'Murders are becoming harder to solve' No easy answers to London's gun and knife crime A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of murder over the Brixton death.

"This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister says the only evidence of a chemical attack came from the media Russia has denied interfering with evidence at the site of the suspected Syrian chemical attack, which led to Western air strikes on Saturday. In an interview for BBC's Hardtalk, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: ""I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site."" The US raised concern at the international chemical weapons agency. International inspectors will be allowed to visit the site on Wednesday, the Russian military has announced. A nine-strong team from the agency, the OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), has been waiting nearby in the Syrian capital Damascus for the green light. Douma was a rebel stronghold at the time of the attack on 7 April and is now under the control of the Syrian government and Russian military. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" UK Prime Minister Theresa May has defended Britain's involvement in the air strikes, saying it was to prevent ""further human suffering"", as opposition parties said MPs should have been consulted in advance. Catch up on the aftermath of the air strikes: What was targeted? UK PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? The suspected attack, denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, reportedly killed dozens of people in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. Two bombs filled with chemicals were reportedly dropped several hours apart on the town. Syrian medical sources say bodies were found foaming at the mouth, and with discoloured skin and cornea burns. US sources said they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent. What we know about the 'chemical attack' Why is there a war in Syria? Kenneth Ward, US envoy to the OPCW, said: ""It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site. The OPCW is gathering at its headquarters in The Hague ""We are concerned they may have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW Fact- Finding Mission to conduct an effective investigation."" Speaking to the BBC, the Russian foreign minister denied chemical weapons had been used in Douma. ""I cannot be impolite with the heads of other states, but you quoted the leaders of France and the UK and US and, frankly speaking, all the evidence they quoted was based on media reports and social media."" The event did not take place, he said. ""What did take place was the staged thing,"" he added. Mr Lavrov also questioned why the US, UK and France had carried out their retaliatory air strikes before OPCW inspectors were able to visit the site. Russia and the West, he added, were facing a situation worse than during the Cold War due to a lack of channels of communication. In other developments: The US says it is considering fresh economic sanctions against Russia ""in the near future"" EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg said they understood the air strikes had had ""the sole objective"" of preventing further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government OPCW emergency talks were held in The Hague on Monday. The UK's envoy to the OPCW, Peter Wilson, called for the inspectors to be given ""unfettered access"" to Douma and dismissed as ""ludicrous"" Russian suggestions that Britain had helped stage a fake attack. At the end of the day, the Russian embassy held a press conference at which Russian chemical and biological protection troops commander Maj-Gen Igor Kirillov announced that inspectors would visit Douma on Wednesday. A UN security team would first check the area on Tuesday, the general said. The OPCW itself has not  confirmed the plans. The US says 105 missiles were launched and it believes none were intercepted by Syrian defences. It says Syria's chemical weapons programme has been set back years. This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded The Russians say 71 missiles were shot down by Syrian systems. One of the three sites hit was the Barzeh complex, which the US says was a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons, although Syria denies this. The other two were suspected chemical weapons facilities at Him Shinshar near Homs. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he had persuaded US President Donald Trump not to pull troops out of Syriaand instead commit ""for the long term"". The US has some 2,000 troops in eastern Syria, mainly supporting the fight against the Islamic State group. This video can not be played From chlorine to Novichok, chemical weapons have been used for more than a century But soon after Mr Macron's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said an early exit was still desirable. ""The US mission has not changed - the president has been clear that he wants US forces to come home as quickly as possible."" Mr Macron said later that France and the US shared the same aim in Syria: the defeat of the Islamic State group. ""The White House is right to recall that the military engagement is against Daesh [IS] and will finish the day that the war against Daesh has been completed,"" he said.

"This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Windrush Day has been held on 22 June since 2018, to celebrate the contribution Caribbean migrants and their families have made to the UK. HMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury, Essex, in 1948, bringing hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. In 2018, it emerged that the government had not properly recorded the details of people granted permission to stay in the UK, and many were wrongly mistreated. HMT Empire Windrush became a symbol of a wider mass-migration movement. People in the Caribbean were invited to the UK to help rebuild post-war Britain. According to the National Archives,which holds the ship's passenger list,,externalthere were 1,027 people on board. More than 800 gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Several hundred passengers were Jamaican, but others arrived from islands including Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. These travellers - and those on other ships which came to the UK until 1971 - became known as the Windrush generation. Many had served in the British armed forces in World War Two. In 1948, the British Nationality Act gave people from colonies the right to live and work in Britain. The government needed workers to help fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild the economy. Caribbean countries were also struggling economically, and job vacancies in the UK offered an opportunity. Many of those who came became manual workers, drivers, cleaners, and nurses in the newly established NHS. In Pictures: The Windrush generation Rare Windrush images on display in art trail This video can not be played What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants? Commemoration events have been held on 22 June every year since 2018. In 2023, the 75th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Windrush was marked witha series of concerts, exhibitions and seminars across the country.,external King Charles, who held a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary, hailed the Windrush generation's ""profound and permanent contribution to British life"". 'We have come a long way': Windrush generation on 75th anniversary New 50p coin to mark Windrush anniversary released Poet Benjamin Zephaniah to get posthumous honour on Windrush Day It is unclear how many people from the Windrush generation are still in the UK, but the number is thought to be in the thousands. They are among more than 500,000 UK residents who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971, according to University of Oxford estimates. The 1971 Immigration Act gave Commonwealth citizens living in the UK indefinite leave to remain - the permanent right to live and work in the UK. This included the Windrush generation, but also people from other former British colonies in South Asia and Africa. This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite However, in April 2018, it emerged that the UK Home Office had kept no records of those granted permission to stay, and had not issued the paperwork they needed to confirm their status. It had also destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants, in 2010. Those affected were unable to prove they were in the country legally and were prevented from accessing healthcare, work and housing. Manywere also threatened with deportation. A review of historical cases also found that at least 83 people who had arrived before 1973 had been wrongly deported.

Home Office asks Windrush man's son for DNA test This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders In April 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa Mayapologised for their treatment.An inquiry was announced and a compensation scheme established. The inquiry, whichreported in March 2020,,externalsaid that the scandal was both ""foreseeable and avoidable"", and criticised ""a culture of disbelief and carelessness"" in the Home Office. The inquiry made 30 recommendations, including: a full Home Office review of the UK's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy appointing a migrants' commissioner establishing a race advisory board Inquiry author Wendy Williamswarned there was a ""grave risk""of similar problems happening again without government action. Then-Home Secretary Priti Patel accepted the recommendations in full. Then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced plans to scrap three recommendations from Wendy Williams's review But in January 2023, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced the Home office wasdropping three of the commitments: to appoint a migrants' commissioner responsible for ""speaking up for migrants and those affected by the system directly or indirectly"" to give the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration new powers to hold events with people affected to ""listen and reflect on their stories"" Ms Williams criticised the decision, saying the proposals would have raised the ""confidence of the Windrush community"". TheWindrush Compensation Scheme,externalwas established in April 2019, and about 15,000 people were thought to be eligible. But the scheme has been consistently criticised for processing delays, low offers, and unfair rejections reversed on appeal. In 2021, the Home Affairs Committee of MPsfound the scheme had itself become a further trauma for those eligible.It said many of those affected were ""still too fearful of the Home Office to apply"". In April 2023, Human Rights Watchsaid the scheme was ""failing"" victims,and repeated calls for it to be removed from the Home Office's control. In response, the Home Office said it was ""committed to righting the wrongs of Windrush"". The government insisted it would ensure ""similar injustices can never be repeated and [was] creating a Home Office worthy of every community it serves"".

"The Windrush generation began arriving in the UK in 1948 The home secretary has apologised for the treatment of the Windrush generation, saying it was ""wrong"" and ""appalling"" that some face deportation. Many immigrants who arrived from the Commonwealth decades ago as children have been told they are here illegally. Amber Rudd said they would be helped to attain required documents for free and added she was concerned her department ""sometimes loses sight"" of individuals. Labour's David Lammy said it was a ""day of national shame"". The Tottenham MP said it was ""inhumane and cruel"" that it had taken the government so long to act. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""This is a day of national shame"" Thousands of people arrived in the UK as children in the first wave of Commonwealth immigration 70 years ago. They are known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the ship, the Empire Windrush, that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Under the 1971 Immigration Act, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. However, the Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it, meaning it is difficult for the individuals to now prove they are in the UK legally. Changes to immigration law in 2012, which requires people to have documentation to work, rent a property or access benefits, including healthcare, has highlighted the issue and left people fearful about their status.

London mayor Sadiq Khan said he welcomed Mrs May's decision to meet other leaders, but added: ""She must now go further and make an immediate commitment to recognise and secure the rights of Commonwealth citizens."" By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent When a home secretary describes her own department's treatment of people as ""appalling"" and criticises it for ""losing sight of the individual"", it's clear something has gone very wrong. Amber Rudd's admission in the House of Commons that she could not say whether any of the Windrush immigrants had been wrongly deported only made things worse. More than one MP harked back to the department's previous leadership under Theresa May. Her intention to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had led to what David Lammy called a ""day of shame"" for the government. A steady stream of stories about mishandling of cases, a minister appearing unsure about deportations and an apparent U-turn from Number 10 on a meeting with Caribbean leaders have all fuelled criticism of the government. The secretary of state promised to sort things out, a special task force would handle cases ""sensitively"" and apologies were given all round. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents.

"Actor R Lee Ermey, known for his role as foul-mouthed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Vietnam War film Full Metal Jacket, has died aged 74. The former US Marine turned award-winning actor played a host of military men during his career. Ermey's manager, posting to the actor's Twitter account, said he died from ""complications of pneumonia"". ""He will be greatly missed by all of us,"" the message read. ""Semper Fi, Gunny. Godspeed."" Born in 1944 in Kansas, Ermey was a staff sergeant in the marine corps in the 1960s and early 1970s, serving tours in Japan and Vietnam. He also served as a real-life drill instructor. Ermey later drew on his military experience for his breakout role in Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, winning a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of a hardened drill instructor putting young marine corps recruits through basic training. One popular story about Ermey is that he was initially hired as a technical advisor, but Kubrick was so impressed with his demonstration of a drill instructor's role that he was offered the part. Ermey's Full Metal Jacket co-stars Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio were among those to pay tribute to the actor. Modine used the motto of the US Marine Corps 'Semper Fidelis' - meaning always faithful or always loyal - in his Twitter tribute. He also quoted lines from Dylan Thomas' poem Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Actor R Lee Ermey, known for his role as foul-mouthed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Vietnam War film Full Metal Jacket, has died aged 74. The former US Marine turned award-winning actor played a host of military men during his career. Ermey's manager, posting to the actor's Twitter account, said he died from ""complications of pneumonia"". ""He will be greatly missed by all of us,"" the message read. ""Semper Fi, Gunny. Godspeed."" Born in 1944 in Kansas, Ermey was a staff sergeant in the marine corps in the 1960s and early 1970s, serving tours in Japan and Vietnam. He also served as a real-life drill instructor. Ermey later drew on his military experience for his breakout role in Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, winning a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of a hardened drill instructor putting young marine corps recruits through basic training. One popular story about Ermey is that he was initially hired as a technical advisor, but Kubrick was so impressed with his demonstration of a drill instructor's role that he was offered the part. Ermey's Full Metal Jacket co-stars Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio were among those to pay tribute to the actor. Modine used the motto of the US Marine Corps 'Semper Fidelis' - meaning always faithful or always loyal - in his Twitter tribute. He also quoted lines from Dylan Thomas' poem Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Govia Thameslink worst for station skipping On average, 160 trains per day in Britain miss scheduled stops at stations, the BBC has learned. More than 52,500 services out of a planned six million had one or more ""failure to stop"" (FTS) events between 1 April 2017 and 23 February 2018. Govia Thameslink (GTR) - which runs Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern - accounted for 16,000 of those. A spokesman said skipping stops was a ""last resort when a train running late would otherwise prolong disruption"". This commuter had his stop missed, adding more than an hour on to his journey From April 2017 to February 2018, 17 in every 1,000 planned GTR trains, or about 50 per day, missed one or more stops. This is more than double the national average for train operators. The GTR spokesman said: ""We operate the country's most congested rail network and with a train departing every 27 seconds on average, even a minor delay to one train can cause a widespread and long-lasting knock-on effect to many other services and passengers across many routes."" The franchise has come under fire in recent years over an ongoingdispute with the RMTunion andthe worst disruption to services in the UK. Commuters awaiting a Southern train at Redhill The Network Rail data, obtained through a BBC Freedom of Information request, compares 22 operators across four years. Over that period an average of 14 in every 1,000 GTR services missed stations. Close behind were South Western Railway, which averaged 11, and Southeastern with 10. Nationally there were 10,000 more FTS events in the ten months to February than in the whole of 2014-15. The best performing operators were Heathrow Express, Chiltern, and Virgin Trains East Coast with, on average, fewer than one in every 1,000 of their trains failing to stop over the same period. Nationally the numbers of FTS events has risen year-on-year. In 2014-15 around 116 trains per day missed a stop. Train firm pays up after bailiff threat Rail franchise 'not giving value for money' Rail revamp aims to tackle train delays However, according to independent regulator the Office of Road and Rail, on average only three in 10 of all types of delay are caused by the affected operator. Network Rail is responsible for six in 10 - usually due to infrastructure works, signalling issues or a fatality on the line. One in 10 is caused by another train company. A spokesman for Network Rail said the firm was ""continuing to invest significant amounts to improve the reliability of our network"". Jacqueline Starr, head of customer experience for the Rail Delivery Group, which brings together train companies and Network Rail, said it was ""frustrating"" for passengers. She added: ""While the number of incidents causing delays and cancellations is going down, each incident is having a bigger impact due to congestion on the network and this is something that we are working hard together to get right."" A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""Across the network, fewer than 1% of stops are skipped per day. ""While any inconvenience caused by stop-skipping to passengers is regrettable, it helps restore the timetable, benefitting many more people across the wider network.""

"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron has said he convinced US President Donald Trump not to withdraw troops from Syria and instead commit ""for the long term"". Earlier this month, Mr Trump declared that the US would ""be coming out of Syria very soon"". On Saturday, joint US, UK and French strikes targeted Syrian government sites in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack. Mr Macron said he also persuaded Mr Trump to keep the strikes limited. The pair, who are reported to have a friendly relationship, spoke several times in the days before the military action was taken. Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are in Syria to inspect the site of the alleged chemical attack, but British diplomats said Syria and Russia had not yet allowed the inspectors to visit the site. After Mr Macron's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""The US mission has not changed - the president has been clear that he wants US forces to come home as quickly as possible"". But she added that the US was ""determined to completely crush"" the Islamic State group and prevent its return. Announcing the strikes in an address to the nationon Friday evening in Washington, Mr Trump insisted: ""America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria - under no circumstances."" The US has about 2,000 personnel on the ground in eastern Syria supporting an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? UK PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Can Trump walk away? Speaking in a live TV interview, during which he was grilled on several subjects, Mr Macron said: ""Ten days ago, President Trump was saying 'the United States should withdraw from Syria'. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the long term."" Emmanuel Macron defended the strikes in a lengthy TV interview In telephone calls with Mr Trump, he also said he ""persuaded him that we needed to limit the strikes to chemical weapons [sites], after things got a little carried away over tweets"". A tweet from Mr Trump last week about US missile strikes on Syria had read: ""Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart'. You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"" The French president appears to have struck up a strong relationship with his US counterpart and this month will be afforded the first formal White House state visit of the Trump presidency. Emmanuel Macron has developed a strong relationship with Donald Trump An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born Mr Macron insisted the Western allies had ""complete international legitimacy to act"" in Syria. He said the allies had clear proof there had been a chemical attack in the town of Douma near Damascus on 7 April and that the Syrian government was responsible. Syria vehemently denies this. Mr Macron said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin directly that Russia - which backs the Syrian government militarily - was complicit. ""They have not used chlorine themselves but they have methodically built the international community's inability to act through diplomatic channels to stop the use of chemical weapons,"" he said. By Hugh Schofield, Paris correspondent for BBC News No-one in France can remember watching a presidential interview quite like this.  Out went deference, journalistic fawning and the patsy questions. In came two attack hounds of the press, Jean-Jacques Bourdin and Edwy Plenel - both men bent, it seemed, on a proper slug-out with the head of state. A sign of the style: not once did the journalists call Emmanuel Macron ""Monsieur le President,"" which would be the norm on such occasions. Every time they wanted to address him, they said simply: ""Emmanuel Macron."" The irony is that far from inconveniencing Mr Macron, this new aggression suits him down to the ground. In the heat of debate, he performs well. He knows his stuff. And on Syria, he made the strongest case yet for his policy - much-criticised - of sticking close to Donald Trump. If it was indeed Emmanuel Macron who talked Trump into ""re-engaging"" with Syria after the suspected chemical attack,  then that is an enormous success for France. And the first dividend from a most unlikely presidential friendship. The wave of strikes had represented the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. Mr Macron said he still wanted dialogue with all parties, including Russia, to try to find a political solution and would go ahead with a planned trip to Moscow next month. The French parliament will be holding an urgent debate on the country's military action at 17:00 local time (15:00 GMT). MPs in the UK parliament are also due to question PM Theresa May on the air strikes.The opposition believes Mrs May should have consulted parliament before launching them. Inspectors from the independent OPCW are now in the country. UK publishes legal case for Syria action Syria 'chemical attack': What we know What Trump said But according to British diplomats at an urgent meeting in the OPCW headquarters in The Hague, the organisation's director says his experts are still waiting for Syria and Russia to grant them access to the alleged attack site in Douma. At the meeting, UK ambassador to the Netherlands Peter Wilson accused Russia of trying to undermine all OPCW investigations into alleged chemical weapons use by Syrian government troops. Russia in turn blamed other parties of trying to block their efforts to make a create a new way of investigating such chemical weapons claims. Western allies believe the claimed attack killed dozens of people with the use of chlorine gas and possibly Sarin. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" The Russians say there is no trace of any chemicals and questioned why the allies carried out strikes before the inspectors had reported. Russia says the attack in Douma was staged, accusing the UK of orchestrating it. The OPCW will not seek to establish, or publicly announce, who was responsible for the attack. Speaking on TV, US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley said new sanctions would be announced on Monday against Russian companies with links to President Assad. This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Will they work? This would be the second tranche of sanctions against Russian firms in a month, partly related to Russia's support for Syria. Ms Haley also ruled out any direct talks with Mr Assad. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said no further strikes were planned, but that this would be reassessed if more chemical attacks took place. President Putin spoke to Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani by phone on Sunday, telling him that any new Western strikes on Syria would spark ""international chaos"". Syria is also high on the agenda of an EU foreign ministers' meeting taking place in Luxembourg. The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad?

"This video can not be played May: We have not done this because President Trump asked us to Theresa May has said it was ""legally and morally right"" for the UK to join air strikes against the Syrian regime to prevent ""further human suffering"". She told MPs there was ""clear evidence"" the Assad government was behind the Douma chemical weapons attack. The UK had ""explored every diplomatic channel"" in response but regrettably decided there was no alternative to ""limited, carefully targeted action"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the action was ""legally questionable"". Calling on Mrs May to publish the legal advice in full, Mr Corbyn said the government must be ""accountable to this Parliament and not to the whims of this US president"". He questioned who was responsible for the attack, saying that ""while much suspicion rightly points to the Assad government"", other groups had carried out similar attacks and weapons inspectors must continue their work. But some Labour MPs backed the decision to launch air strikes. Taking questions for more than three hours, Mrs May defended the decision not to seek Parliamentary approval for the intervention after criticism from opposition parties. MPs then held the first of two emergency debates on Syria which were approved by Speaker John Bercow, with the second to take place on Tuesday. Monday's debate ended with a vote, forced by the SNP, on whether the House had sufficiently debated the matter of Syria. The government won the motion by 314 to 36 votes, a majority of 278. Live: Rolling coverage of the Commons debate Were the Syria air strikes legal? Russia 'not tampering' with Syria site Reality Check: Does Russia always use a veto on Syria? Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit on Saturday by the US, French and UK in response to the alleged chemical attack on Douma on 7 April. Both Syria, which denies any chemical use, and Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian government, have reacted angrily to the action. Briefing Parliament, Mrs May insisted it was in the UK's national interest to act - insisting that ""we have not done this because President Trump asked us to but because it was the right thing to do"". She said the use of chemical weapons could not be ""normalised"" in either Syria or elsewhere, insisting the attack was a ""stain on humanity"" and fitted the pattern of the regime's previous use of such weapons. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM accountable to Parliament not the whims of US president ""No other group could have carried out this attack,"" she told MPs, adding that the Syrian authorities had reportedly attempted to ""conceal the facts... supported by the Russians"". The military response, she insisted, was aimed squarely at degrading the regime's capacity to carry out further ""indiscriminate"" attacks, rather than to try and topple the regime. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg MPs will talk again tomorrow. There are, after all, hugely important principles for them to talk about. They will not, however, have votes that make a difference to anything other than the political atmosphere at Westminster, unless something very unexpected happens. Labour will lead a debate on Tuesday about Parliament's right to approve military action, or not. But the RAF pilots who flew sorties from Cyprus in the early hours of Saturday won't be told by Parliament through a vote that their actions are considered by MPs to be right or wrong. Read the rest of Laura's blog Addressing calls for Parliament to have been given a vote, she said much of the intelligence on which the action was based could not have been shared with MPs and a speedy response was needed to protect the integrity of the operation and prevent further suffering. ""We have always been clear that the government has the right to act quickly in the national interest,"" she said. ""I am absolutely clear that it is Parliament's responsibility to hold me to account for such decisions but it is my responsibility as prime minister to make these decisions."" The Stop the War Coalition protested outside Parliament as MPs debated Returning to the United Nations to try to secure a Security Council resolution would have been futile, she said, and effectively given Russia a ""veto over British foreign policy"". Mr Corbyn called for a new War Powers Act, saying the convention that Parliament should be consulted before military action was ""broken"" and had to be replaced by a ""legal obligation"" to get the backing of MPs. Contrary to what Mrs May claimed, he said it was evident all ""non-military means had not been exhausted"". ""There is no more serious issue then the life and death matters of military action. It is right that Parliament has the power to support or stop the government from taking planned military action."" This video can not be played Amateur footage shows strikes on a military research facility in Damascus, while state TV shows the damage The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said for Parliament to be consulted about military action ""after the event"" was simply not good enough. ""When we are talking about military action in a third country, that is a decision that Parliament should be taking and not government itself,"" he told BBC News. ""That is what democracy is all about."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said the decision had been taken ""behind closed doors"" and much more scrutiny was needed of the objectives behind it. While the situation in Syria was ""very serious"", she said there was not the same ""acute urgency"" for military intervention on humanitarian grounds as there had been in Libya in 2011. Will West's attack sway Syria's Assad? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Downing Street publishedits legal case for its part in the strikes, stating that the action was legally justified on humanitarian grounds. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. There has been no confirmation of any civilian casualties. The MoD has stated the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"". The UK and US have said the strikes were successful, withPresident Trump warning the US is ""locked and loaded"" for further actionif there are more chemical attacks. On Saturday, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia, while all Nato allies have given the military action their full support.

"Ant McPartlin arrived half an hour before the case was due to start TV presenter Ant McPartlin has arrived at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court ahead of his court appearance.

"Maxim Borodin had contacted a friend the day before he was found seriously injured beneath his fifth-floor flat A Russian investigative journalist who wrote about the deaths of mercenaries in Syria has died in hospital after falling from his fifth-floor flat. Maxim Borodin was found badly injured by neighbours in Yekaterinburg and taken to hospital, where he later died. Local officials said no suicide note was found but the incident was unlikely to be of a criminal nature. However, a friend revealed Borodin had said his flat had been surrounded by security men a day earlier.

"Victoria has seen a spike in recent cases of the Buruli ulcer Doctors in Australia have called for urgent research into why a flesh-eating ulcer has become a ""worsening epidemic"" in the state of Victoria. Local cases of Buruli ulcer, a skin disease most commonly found in Africa, have surged by 400% in the last four years, experts say. Infections have also become more severe and spread to new areas. Doctors do not know how to prevent the disease, which is caused by bacteria that breaks down tissue. A record 275 new infections were recorded the state last year, marking a 51% increase on 2016. Infectious diseases expert Dr Daniel O'Brien said cases ofthe Buruli ulcer, or Mycobacterium ulcerans disease,external, had become ""frighteningly more common and also more severe"" in the region. It was unclear why the ulcer, typically found in tropical areas, had emerged in the temperate climate of Victoria, he said. A skin disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The bacteria emits toxins that destroy skin cells, small blood vessels and the fat under the skin, leading to ulcers forming and skin loss. The ulcer gets bigger with time and can lead to permanent disfigurement or disability. Usually affects limbs but can also be found on the face and body. Doctors do not know how the disease is transmitted to humans but it's believed to arise from the environment and soil. There are also theories that mosquitoes can carry the bacteria. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia,external, doctors have called for government funding to research the disease and its causes. ""No one understands what's happening and what's driving this epidemic,"" Dr O'Brien, a co-author, told the BBC. ""We can offer clues but not definitive advice. It's a mystery."" He said some theories involved factors such as rainfall, soil type and wildlife. Last year, authorities found traces of the bacteria in local possum faeces. The Buruli ulcer attacking a patient's knee ""The problem is, we don't have the time to sit around and pontificate about it - the epidemic has reached frightening proportions,"" he said. The ulcers are difficult to treat and patients often experience a recovery period of between six and 12 months. Many people also have to undergo reconstructive surgery, Dr O'Brien added. Schoolgirl recounts gruelling ulcer recovery Victorian health authorities say they have spent more than A$1m (Â£550,000; $780,000) on researching the disease, and have started education campaigns to raise awareness about it. Until a few years ago, infections were more commonly reported from tropical regions in Queensland with occasional cases in other states. The disease is more commonly found in rural West Africa, Central Africa, New Guinea, Latin America and tropical regions of Asia. In the developing world, the disease is associated with wetlands and stagnant water, however in Australia cases have largely been reported from coastal regions.

"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron has said he convinced US President Donald Trump not to withdraw troops from Syria and instead commit ""for the long term"". Earlier this month, Mr Trump declared that the US would ""be coming out of Syria very soon"". On Saturday, joint US, UK and French strikes targeted Syrian government sites in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack. Mr Macron said he also persuaded Mr Trump to keep the strikes limited. The pair, who are reported to have a friendly relationship, spoke several times in the days before the military action was taken. Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are in Syria to inspect the site of the alleged chemical attack, but British diplomats said Syria and Russia had not yet allowed the inspectors to visit the site. After Mr Macron's comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""The US mission has not changed - the president has been clear that he wants US forces to come home as quickly as possible"". But she added that the US was ""determined to completely crush"" the Islamic State group and prevent its return. Announcing the strikes in an address to the nationon Friday evening in Washington, Mr Trump insisted: ""America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria - under no circumstances."" The US has about 2,000 personnel on the ground in eastern Syria supporting an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? UK PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes Were the Syria air strikes legal? Can Trump walk away? Speaking in a live TV interview, during which he was grilled on several subjects, Mr Macron said: ""Ten days ago, President Trump was saying 'the United States should withdraw from Syria'. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the long term."" Emmanuel Macron defended the strikes in a lengthy TV interview In telephone calls with Mr Trump, he also said he ""persuaded him that we needed to limit the strikes to chemical weapons [sites], after things got a little carried away over tweets"". A tweet from Mr Trump last week about US missile strikes on Syria had read: ""Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart'. You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"" The French president appears to have struck up a strong relationship with his US counterpart and this month will be afforded the first formal White House state visit of the Trump presidency. Emmanuel Macron has developed a strong relationship with Donald Trump An unlikely (and calculated) friendship is born Mr Macron insisted the Western allies had ""complete international legitimacy to act"" in Syria. He said the allies had clear proof there had been a chemical attack in the town of Douma near Damascus on 7 April and that the Syrian government was responsible. Syria vehemently denies this. Mr Macron said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin directly that Russia - which backs the Syrian government militarily - was complicit. ""They have not used chlorine themselves but they have methodically built the international community's inability to act through diplomatic channels to stop the use of chemical weapons,"" he said. By Hugh Schofield, Paris correspondent for BBC News No-one in France can remember watching a presidential interview quite like this.  Out went deference, journalistic fawning and the patsy questions. In came two attack hounds of the press, Jean-Jacques Bourdin and Edwy Plenel - both men bent, it seemed, on a proper slug-out with the head of state. A sign of the style: not once did the journalists call Emmanuel Macron ""Monsieur le President,"" which would be the norm on such occasions. Every time they wanted to address him, they said simply: ""Emmanuel Macron."" The irony is that far from inconveniencing Mr Macron, this new aggression suits him down to the ground. In the heat of debate, he performs well. He knows his stuff. And on Syria, he made the strongest case yet for his policy - much-criticised - of sticking close to Donald Trump. If it was indeed Emmanuel Macron who talked Trump into ""re-engaging"" with Syria after the suspected chemical attack,  then that is an enormous success for France. And the first dividend from a most unlikely presidential friendship. The wave of strikes had represented the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. Mr Macron said he still wanted dialogue with all parties, including Russia, to try to find a political solution and would go ahead with a planned trip to Moscow next month. The French parliament will be holding an urgent debate on the country's military action at 17:00 local time (15:00 GMT). MPs in the UK parliament are also due to question PM Theresa May on the air strikes.The opposition believes Mrs May should have consulted parliament before launching them. Inspectors from the independent OPCW are now in the country. UK publishes legal case for Syria action Syria 'chemical attack': What we know What Trump said But according to British diplomats at an urgent meeting in the OPCW headquarters in The Hague, the organisation's director says his experts are still waiting for Syria and Russia to grant them access to the alleged attack site in Douma. At the meeting, UK ambassador to the Netherlands Peter Wilson accused Russia of trying to undermine all OPCW investigations into alleged chemical weapons use by Syrian government troops. Russia in turn blamed other parties of trying to block their efforts to make a create a new way of investigating such chemical weapons claims. Western allies believe the claimed attack killed dozens of people with the use of chlorine gas and possibly Sarin. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" The Russians say there is no trace of any chemicals and questioned why the allies carried out strikes before the inspectors had reported. Russia says the attack in Douma was staged, accusing the UK of orchestrating it. The OPCW will not seek to establish, or publicly announce, who was responsible for the attack. Speaking on TV, US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley said new sanctions would be announced on Monday against Russian companies with links to President Assad. This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Will they work? This would be the second tranche of sanctions against Russian firms in a month, partly related to Russia's support for Syria. Ms Haley also ruled out any direct talks with Mr Assad. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said no further strikes were planned, but that this would be reassessed if more chemical attacks took place. President Putin spoke to Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani by phone on Sunday, telling him that any new Western strikes on Syria would spark ""international chaos"". Syria is also high on the agenda of an EU foreign ministers' meeting taking place in Luxembourg. The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad?

The bacteria emits toxins that destroy skin cells, small blood vessels and the fat under the skin, leading to ulcers forming and skin loss. The ulcer gets bigger with time and can lead to permanent disfigurement or disability. Usually affects limbs but can also be found on the face and body. Doctors do not know how the disease is transmitted to humans but it's believed to arise from the environment and soil. There are also theories that mosquitoes can carry the bacteria. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia,external, doctors have called for government funding to research the disease and its causes. ""No one understands what's happening and what's driving this epidemic,"" Dr O'Brien, a co-author, told the BBC. ""We can offer clues but not definitive advice. It's a mystery."" He said some theories involved factors such as rainfall, soil type and wildlife. Last year, authorities found traces of the bacteria in local possum faeces. The Buruli ulcer attacking a patient's knee ""The problem is, we don't have the time to sit around and pontificate about it - the epidemic has reached frightening proportions,"" he said. The ulcers are difficult to treat and patients often experience a recovery period of between six and 12 months. Many people also have to undergo reconstructive surgery, Dr O'Brien added. Schoolgirl recounts gruelling ulcer recovery Victorian health authorities say they have spent more than A$1m (Â£550,000; $780,000) on researching the disease, and have started education campaigns to raise awareness about it. Until a few years ago, infections were more commonly reported from tropical regions in Queensland with occasional cases in other states. The disease is more commonly found in rural West Africa, Central Africa, New Guinea, Latin America and tropical regions of Asia. In the developing world, the disease is associated with wetlands and stagnant water, however in Australia cases have largely been reported from coastal regions.

By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent When a home secretary describes her own department's treatment of people as ""appalling"" and criticises it for ""losing sight of the individual"", it's clear something has gone very wrong. Amber Rudd's admission in the House of Commons that she could not say whether any of the Windrush immigrants had been wrongly deported only made things worse. More than one MP harked back to the department's previous leadership under Theresa May. Her intention to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had led to what David Lammy called a ""day of shame"" for the government. A steady stream of stories about mishandling of cases, a minister appearing unsure about deportations and an apparent U-turn from Number 10 on a meeting with Caribbean leaders have all fuelled criticism of the government. The secretary of state promised to sort things out, a special task force would handle cases ""sensitively"" and apologies were given all round. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents. The Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury Docks with 482 Jamaicans on board Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British.

"Ketamine has ""shown promise"" in the rapid treatment of major depression and suicidal thoughts, a US study says. Ketamine has a reputation as a party drug but is licensed as an anaesthetic. The study found use of the drug via a nasal spray led to ""significant"" improvements in depressive symptoms in the first 24 hours. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it was a ""significant"" study that brought the drug ""a step closer to being prescribed on the NHS"". The report by researchers from Janssen Research and Development, a Johnson and Johnson company, and Yale School of Medicine, is the first study into ketamine as a treatment for depression that has been done by a drug company. It is being published in theAmerican Journal of Psychiatry,external. The trial looked at 68 people at imminent risk of suicide. All patients were treated with a stay in hospital and anti-depressants. In addition, half were given ketamine in the form of esketamine (part of the ketamine molecule) in a nasal spray and half were given a placebo. The study found those using esketamine had a much greater improvement in depression symptoms at all points over the first four weeks of treatment. However, at 25 days the effects had levelled out. The study's authors suggest it could offer an effective rapid treatment for people severely depressed and at imminent risk of suicide and could help in the initial stages of treatment, as most anti-depressants take four to six weeks to become fully effective. The nasal spray is now undergoing phase three trials before it can be licensed for treatment. There were no reports of esketamine dependence or misuse in the trial but the authors warn that more research is needed on the potential for abuse of ketamine and say these should be looked at during subsequent trials. Scientists in the UK are also studying ketamine as a treatment for depression taken intravenously. Dr James Stone, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, told the BBC the ""interesting"" US study confirmed the findings from successful studies into intravenous ketamine. ""The main reason for its significance is because this is being developed by a drug company and it's potentially quite likely that this medication might become available as a treatment available on the NHS for depression."" He said because it was being given as a nasal spray it was ""much easier to administer"" than intravenous ketamine and was ""potentially quicker to give, so it means more people can be dosed at the same time"" and you need less equipment. Dr Stone said if it did go on to be prescribed on the NHS it would be aimed at people with severe depression as a second or third line of treatment if other drugs haven't worked and could be used for people instead ofelectroconvulsive therapy,external. Prof Mitul Mehta from King's College told the BBC it was an ""exciting"" study. ""All the studies to date have been looking at intravenous use - there are some people who have explored oral ketamine but that doesn't appear to be as successful as intravenous so intranasal seems to be a really good halfway-house. ""It enters the body relatively quickly - it's not as fast as going straight into your bloodstream but not as slow as via the stomach and it's reasonably easy to control how much you give to a person. In that respect this is a really important study."" But he said far bigger studies are needed to look out for any rare side-effects. 'The most significant development since the safety belt' Genes found for deadly heart condition Magic mushrooms 'reset' depressed brain Because ketamine is licensed to be used by doctors as an aneasthetic it can be prescribed off licence for depression. This is happening in private clinics in the US and the UK. But to be prescribed on the NHS, it would need to be licensed to be used as a treatment for depression. In the UK, doctors have been trialling ketamine to treat depression since 2011. Dr Rupert McShane, who has led a trial in Oxford, says ketaminecan work on patients with depression ""where nothing has helped before"". Last yearhe called for the use of ketamine to treat depression to be rolled out. However, he called for a national registry to monitor its use.

"Actor R Lee Ermey, known for his role as foul-mouthed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Vietnam War film Full Metal Jacket, has died aged 74. The former US Marine turned award-winning actor played a host of military men during his career. Ermey's manager, posting to the actor's Twitter account, said he died from ""complications of pneumonia"". ""He will be greatly missed by all of us,"" the message read. ""Semper Fi, Gunny. Godspeed."" Born in 1944 in Kansas, Ermey was a staff sergeant in the marine corps in the 1960s and early 1970s, serving tours in Japan and Vietnam. He also served as a real-life drill instructor. Ermey later drew on his military experience for his breakout role in Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket, winning a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of a hardened drill instructor putting young marine corps recruits through basic training. One popular story about Ermey is that he was initially hired as a technical advisor, but Kubrick was so impressed with his demonstration of a drill instructor's role that he was offered the part. Ermey's Full Metal Jacket co-stars Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio were among those to pay tribute to the actor. Modine used the motto of the US Marine Corps 'Semper Fidelis' - meaning always faithful or always loyal - in his Twitter tribute. He also quoted lines from Dylan Thomas' poem Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Three people were hit by a car outside a nightclub in Talbot Road, Blackpool A teenager has been charged with injuring three women who were hit by a car in Blackpool. The pedestrians were struck by a Skoda estate in Talbot Road at about 23:50 BST on Saturday, leaving a woman in her 80s with a broken collarbone. A woman in her 70s suffered a sprained ankle and a third, aged in her 30s, had a broken tooth and leg injuries. Jake Hartley, 19, from Todmorden, appeared before Blackpool magistrates charged with attempted wounding. He was also charged with three offences of assault, dangerous driving, driving with more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood, driving without insurance and possession of a weapon. Mr Hartley, of Rochdale Road, was remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court on 16 May. Armed police attended the scene and a car was recovered outside Norbreck Castle Hotel. All three women have been discharged from hospital but officers believe other people may have suffered minor injuries and have urged them to get in touch.

"Annual car insurance prices have fallen for the first time in three years, a survey suggests, owing to a reaction to government policy. Reforms to the law on whiplash and a review into how compensation is paid for long-term injuries were thought to be behind the drop. The research, for comparison website Confused.com, suggests prices have dropped by 2%, or Â£13, in a year. Separate figures show the number of female car owners has risen sharply. The number of cars registered to women has risen by 21% since 2007 to 11.8 million, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. This compares with a 10% rise in the number of cars registered to men, to 17.8 million. 'The most significant development since the safety belt' RAC apologises after breaking insurance rules Crackdown on false holiday illness claims Insurers warn of travel premium rise Insurers are forbidden by law to set different car insurance premiums solely based on gender. However, women pay a lower cost in general owing to the fact that, on average, they drive smaller, less expensive cars than men and have fewer high-value accident claims. The average insurance price difference between male and female drivers is Â£95, according to the Confused.com research. Changes to government policy on the so-called discount rate had led insurers to ""soften"" their prices, the price comparison website said. This was the first full year of fall year of falling average premiums for three years, it said. The discount - or Ogden - rate is designed to compensate insurers for the cost of long-term injury claims. It was reduced by the government last April, costing insurance firms large amounts of money. However, in September the Ministry of Justice said it would revise the scheme. Meanwhile, the government wants its proposals designed to reduce false whiplash claims to be in place by April 2019, potentially cutting costs for insurers. However, Andrew Twambley, spokesman for Access to Justice (A2J), which is campaigning against the reforms, said: ""Insurers are acting prematurely if they are reducing prices to account for whiplash reforms, because the Bill to bring the reforms in has only just been introduced to Parliament. ""The reforms are controversial and are opposed by MPs from all sides of the house, including some MPs on the government benches, so there is no guarantee that the proposals will become law."" Amanda Stretton, from Confused.com - which makes its money, in part, from drivers switching insurers - said: ""Finally drivers have had some good news with the end of rising car insurance costs in sight. ""However, it is clear that many motorists are not seeing these savings reflected in their renewal letters, so it is more important than ever to shop around if they want to get a better deal.""

Her intention to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had led to what David Lammy called a ""day of shame"" for the government. A steady stream of stories about mishandling of cases, a minister appearing unsure about deportations and an apparent U-turn from Number 10 on a meeting with Caribbean leaders have all fuelled criticism of the government. The secretary of state promised to sort things out, a special task force would handle cases ""sensitively"" and apologies were given all round. The Migration Observatory at Oxford University estimates there are 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971. People born in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries are thought to be more affected than those from other Commonwealth nations, as they were more likely to arrive on their parents' passports without their own ID documents. The Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury Docks with 482 Jamaicans on board Many have never applied for a passport in their own name or had their immigration status formalised, as they regarded themselves as British. TheGuardian newspaper has highlighted a number of cases,externalof such people being threatened with deportation.

"Annual car insurance prices have fallen for the first time in three years, a survey suggests, owing to a reaction to government policy. Reforms to the law on whiplash and a review into how compensation is paid for long-term injuries were thought to be behind the drop. The research, for comparison website Confused.com, suggests prices have dropped by 2%, or Â£13, in a year. Separate figures show the number of female car owners has risen sharply. The number of cars registered to women has risen by 21% since 2007 to 11.8 million, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. This compares with a 10% rise in the number of cars registered to men, to 17.8 million. 'The most significant development since the safety belt' RAC apologises after breaking insurance rules Crackdown on false holiday illness claims Insurers warn of travel premium rise Insurers are forbidden by law to set different car insurance premiums solely based on gender. However, women pay a lower cost in general owing to the fact that, on average, they drive smaller, less expensive cars than men and have fewer high-value accident claims. The average insurance price difference between male and female drivers is Â£95, according to the Confused.com research. Changes to government policy on the so-called discount rate had led insurers to ""soften"" their prices, the price comparison website said. This was the first full year of fall year of falling average premiums for three years, it said. The discount - or Ogden - rate is designed to compensate insurers for the cost of long-term injury claims. It was reduced by the government last April, costing insurance firms large amounts of money. However, in September the Ministry of Justice said it would revise the scheme. Meanwhile, the government wants its proposals designed to reduce false whiplash claims to be in place by April 2019, potentially cutting costs for insurers. However, Andrew Twambley, spokesman for Access to Justice (A2J), which is campaigning against the reforms, said: ""Insurers are acting prematurely if they are reducing prices to account for whiplash reforms, because the Bill to bring the reforms in has only just been introduced to Parliament. ""The reforms are controversial and are opposed by MPs from all sides of the house, including some MPs on the government benches, so there is no guarantee that the proposals will become law."" Amanda Stretton, from Confused.com - which makes its money, in part, from drivers switching insurers - said: ""Finally drivers have had some good news with the end of rising car insurance costs in sight. ""However, it is clear that many motorists are not seeing these savings reflected in their renewal letters, so it is more important than ever to shop around if they want to get a better deal.""

"The inmates climbed on to the safety netting of E Wing and refused to come down Inmates ""threw paint and smashed fire alarms"" during a disturbance at a young offenders institution. The Prison Service said four prison officers suffered minor injuries in the trouble at HMYOI Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Inmates ""trashed"" E Wing in protest over a lack of showers and time out of their cells, the BBC was told. The Prison Service said: ""Offenders who behave in this way will be punished and may face extra time behind bars."" The young offenders institution houses young males with the longest sentences in England A woman whose partner is an inmate told the BBC some of the men had leapt on to the wing's safety netting and refused to come down. The source said her partner was not involved and went back to his cell. Another prisoner sent pictures of the disturbance from a banned mobile phone. ""There's a new regime and they aren't allowed any association during the week,"" she said. ""So they can shower and exercise but then have been locked up all week. They had one shower on Monday and nothing since. ""On Saturday they weren't allowed the weekend association where they can play pool, etc. This morning, they were allowed another shower but, when they were told they were going to be locked up again, with no explanation, lots of them refused to go back."" The inmates then ""trashed the wing"", the source said, adding ""they've thrown paint, smashed fire alarms and broken cameras"". Prisoners refused to go back to their cells on Sunday morning E Wing houses more than 70 young men aged up to 21 in the jail on Bierton Road. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Prison staff at HMYOI Aylesbury have successfully resolved a brief period of indiscipline today involving a small number of offenders on one wing."" They said the trouble was ""confined to one area of the prison"" and the rest of the site remained secure. Four prison officers were taken to hospital with minor injuries and have since returned to duty. Last July,seven prison officers and one inmate were injured in a ""brawl""at Aylesbury.

"This video can not be played Primary purpose of Syria air strikes was ""to say no to the use of barbaric weapons"", says Boris Johnson Air strikes in Syria were about saying ""enough is enough"" over the use of chemical weapons, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the action by the US, UK and France would not ""turn the tide"" of the conflict and was not about regime change. But he said he hoped it would act as a deterrent to more ""barbaric"" chemical attacks. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has questioned the legality of the action. He called for new legislation to ensure MPs get a vote before future military action is taken, and said he would only back intervention in Syria if the United Nations backed it. Conservatives said this would never happen due to Russia using its veto at the UN. Trump defends 'mission accomplished' claim As it happened: Western powers strike Syria targets Theresa May: Syria statement in full Syria air strikes: Were they legal? Downing Street has publishedits legal case for its part in the strikes, which targeted military bases. Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit in response to an alleged chemical attack on the town of Douma on 7 April. This video can not be played Masa, survivor of suspected chemical attack: ""Instead of breathing air, we breathed the smell of blood"" Both Syria and Russia - which provides military support to the Syrian government - have reacted angrily to the action. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson stressed the ""limits"" of the intervention were to stop an apparent erosion of the ""taboo"" of chemical weapons. ""The rest of the Syrian war must proceed as it will,"" he said, adding that the ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Mr Johnson said he did not know how Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would respond, adding that if there was a repeat chemical attack, ""clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were"". This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded Opposition parties have criticised the lack of a parliamentary vote before the air strikes. Mr Johnson promised MPs would ""have their say"" when Theresa May makes a Commons statement on Monday. Mr Corbyn told the Marr show Mrs May ""could easily"" have recalled Parliament or delayed her decision until MPs returned on Monday. The Barzah Research and Development Centre before the air strike The Barzah Research and Development Centre after the air strike He also called for a War Powers Act, ""so governments do get held accountable to Parliament for what they do in our name"". He added that Labour would continue to push for a debate and a vote on the intervention, describing it as ""policy made up by Twitter"", in a reference to the US president's tweets ahead of the air strikes. Mr Corbyn said he would only ""countenance"" getting involved in the Syrian conflict with the backing of the United Nations. This video can not be played Corbyn: Trump should pick up the phone to Putin The UN has so far failed to agree a unified response, with the US and Russia blocking each other's proposals last week. Pushed on whether he would authorise the use of force if he was prime minister, the Labour leader said ""no-one would ever say never"", adding: ""If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. ""That surely would save a lot of lives."" Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis accused Mr Corbyn of failing to ""recognise what has actually been happening"". ""He knows full well Russia veto at UN,"" he tweeted. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were grilled about the Syria conflict on the Andrew Marr show Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the legal basis for the intervention as ""thin"". ""Air strikes may make Western leaders feel that they're doing something,"" she said. ""In this case it feels as if it's more to do with a macho strongman stand-off between Trump and Putin than it is to do with really delivering peace in Syria. That should not be the criteria against which decisions about UK military action is taken."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told Sky News he was not ""quibbling about the legality"" of the UK's action in Syria, but added: ""My questioning of the government is to the wisdom of proceeding the way it did without building up a consensus and a case in this country."" The UK believes the Assad regime was responsible forthe attack on civilians in Douma, while the US and France say they have proof. But Syria has always denied any chemical use and says the attack was fabricated by rebels. On Saturday, the Ministry of Defence said eight Storm Shadow missiles had been launched by four RAF Tornados at a former missile base, 15 miles west of Homs. It is thought President Bashar al-Assad's regime had been stockpiling materials used to make chemical weapons there, it said. A spokesperson added the facility was located ""some distance"" from ""concentrations of civilian habitation"", and the risk of contamination to the surrounding area had been minimised. More than 100 missiles were fired at the three sites The UK and US have said the strikes were successful, withPresident Trump warning of further actionif there are more chemical attacks. On Saturday, the UN Security Council rejected a resolution drafted by Russia while all Nato allies have given the military action their full support.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of firefighters tackle the blaze in Sydney A large bushfire that has threatened homes in Sydney is likely to have been deliberately lit, Australian authorities say. The blaze, which began on Saturday, has burnt through 2,500 hectares of land in the city's southern suburbs. Some residents had been warned of immediate danger to their lives, but firefighters say the threat has eased. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) described the blaze as ""highly suspicious"". ""How dare anyone - if they are deliberately involved in lighting fires - endanger our firefighters and also [put] all these communities in harm's way,"" said Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. The bushfire forced some locals to evacuate their homes at the weekend, while others were told it was too dangerous to leave. Recent weather in south-eastern Australia has been unseasonably hot, with strong winds fanning bushfires. Firefighters use helicopters to dump water on the blaze Authorities said wind speeds were not as severe on Monday, making it easier to battle the blaze. Mr Fitzsimmons said flames travelled ""right up to the back fences"" of houses, but no properties had been lost. ""While the threat has eased, it is still a fairly vigilant fire ground and we want people to remain vigilant,"" he said. ""There is a lot of work still to be done today and maybe into tonight before we can call the fire contained."" How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay The deadly threat of hot weather and bushfires Police have declared the fire a crime scene. Mr Fitzsimmons said it was possible that winds could strengthen again and elevate the fire danger. At the weekend, residents hosed down their houses and lawns to prevent embers sparking new blazes ahead of the advancing fire front. Smoke seen from a football field in the suburb of Barden Ridge Major roads separating bushland and residences were cut off in some areas, and fire services used helicopters to dump water over key points. Pictures on social media showed firefighters and residents taking care of local wildlife affected by the blaze. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played How the Western attacks on Syria's suspected chemical weapons sites unfolded President Donald Trump has warned Syria's government the US is ""locked and loaded"" to strike again if it carries out chemical attacks. The warning came after the US, UK and France struck three Syrian sites in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack in the town of Douma a week ago. Syria denies any chemical use and says that attack was fabricated by rebels. A UN Security Council vote brought by Syria's ally, Russia, to condemn the US-led strikes was rejected. The wave of strikes represents the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war. While Western powers have supported rebels from early on in the war, they have not intervened directly against Syrian government forces. Catch up on the strikes: What was targeted? PM faces 'almighty row' over strikes UK publishes legal case for Syria action What Trump said After the failure of the Russian motion, the US, UK and France circulated a new draft resolution to UN Security Council members, calling for an independent investigation into Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons, AFP news agency reported. Similar previous plans have been vetoed by Russia. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has blamed Russian obstruction for the need to launch military strikes, saying they left ""no practicable alternative"". This video can not be played Syria air strikes: Do they work? Inspectors from the independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had already been dispatched to Damascus and they are expected to visit Douma this weekend. But the OPCW will not seek to establish - and publicly announce - who was responsible for the attack, which is what the UK, US and France want to see. The new, Western-drafted resolution calls for the OPCW to release their report within 30 days. Syria's Assistant Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan told the BBC his government welcomed the OPCW delegation. ""The work of the mission is in the interest of the Syrian state as it will uncover the lies, hypocrisy and the misinformation of the sides which had promoted the alleged use of chemical weapons,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC the strikes in Syria were meant to signal that ""enough is enough""and their ""primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons"". Russia has said it believes the attack in Douma was staged. An emergency meeting was held by the UN Security Council on Saturday, leading to some bitter exchanges. Russia sought to secure a collective condemnation of the early morning air strikes. However, out of the 15-member council, only China and Bolivia voted in favour of the Russian resolution. Russia's UN envoy, Vasily Nebenzia, read out a quote from President Vladimir Putin accusing the US, UK and France of ""cynical disdain"" in acting without waiting for the OPCW's findings. US envoy Nikki Haley said she had spoken to President Trump: ""And he said: 'If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded.'"" She added: ""We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm and allow use of chemical weapons to go unanswered."" Syrian envoy Bashar Jaafari called the US, UK and France ""liars, spoilers and hypocrites"" who exploited the UN ""to pursue... [their] policy of interference and colonialism"". The future of the Syrian war: Can Trump move on? Will the West's attack sway Assad? CBS News reporter Seth Doane visited one of the targets in Damascus on Saturday afternoon, and found it to be a smouldering pile of rubble. The Barzeh complex appears to be totally destroyed The Barzeh complex is, according to the US, a centre for development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons. Syria denies this. Elsewhere, the Syrian army announced on Saturday that the Eastern Ghouta region, where Douma is situated, had been cleared of the last rebel fighters and was fully retaken. He tweeted early on Saturday, hailing the strikes as ""perfectly executed"". He also thanked the UK and France. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The following Iraqi insurgency questioned the validity of the statement. Were the Syria air strikes legal? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Fall of Eastern Ghouta - a pivotal moment for Assad At a Pentagon briefing on Saturday, Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie listed the three targets that had been struck, saying the attacks had ""set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back years"". This video can not be played Gen Kenneth McKenzie: ""We deployed 105 weapons"" Gen McKenzie said about 40 Syrian defence missiles were fired, mostly after the targets were hit, and none successfully engaged planes or missiles. The Pentagon briefing contradicted information given at a Russian defence ministry briefing, which said 103 cruise missiles had been launched and 71 were shot down by Syrian systems. Both the Russians and the US said there were no reported casualties. Syria says three people were hurt near Homs. The US said it had communicated with Russia ahead of the strikes through the normal procedures of their ""deconfliction"" hotline, but no details of the attacks were given. There had been concerns that if the allied strikes had hit Russian military personnel, it would have further escalated tension.

"This video can not be played Neville Lawrence: ""I forgive them all for the murder of my son"" The father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence says he has forgiven his son's killers, nearly 25 years after the attack. Dr Neville Lawrence said the decision had been ""one of the hardest things"", but he still wanted justice. The murder ""opened the country's eyes"" to racism, he added. Stephen, 18, was stabbed in an attack by five white youths on 22 April 1993, at a bus stop in south-east London. Two menwere jailed for life in 2012. Last week the Metropolitan Police said that, despite rigorous efforts, its inquiry was""unlikely to progress"". Police had previously apologised for failures in the investigation. A timeline of the Stephen Lawrence case 'I Don't take no for an answer' Speaking to the BBC, Dr Lawrence said he still felt the pain of his first child being ""murdered for senseless reasons"". But he said that while he wanted all the killers to face justice, he had forgiven them. Dr Lawrence, who now supports families of other murdered young people, said: ""It was one of the hardest things for me to say to myself, 'I forgive you for the murder of my son'."" He said forgiveness had made his life ""a long way better now"", and ""maybe if I had done it earlier it would have been better for me as well"". Stephen Lawrence was murdered on 22 April 1993 Gary Dobson was jailed for a minimum of 15 years and two months, and David Norris for 14 years and three months in January 2012. The pair were convicted after microscopic samples of Stephen Lawrence's DNA were found on the clothes they had been wearing in the attack. Three others were publicly named as suspects but police have said fresh prosecutions are unlikely unless new evidence is found. Dr Lawrence said the killers ""made my son into a legend"" and the impact the death had on British society was ""amazing"". He said: ""It has helped me because in a sense it is helping others. ""Although I've lost Stephen I've gained something else in that my son is not going to be forgotten."" Gary Dobson and David Norris received life sentences almost 20 years after they murdered Stephen Lawrence Mr Lawrence said it was not the legacy he would have wanted for his son: ""He wanted be an architect. ""I thought I would see quite a few buildings if he had qualified and I thought that was the way I was going to remember him, but unfortunately that is not the way."" The Met Police said it has reviewed the investigation but ""without new information [it] is unlikely to progress further"". Chris Le Pere, the senior investigator, said it was ""never too late"" for someone to ""do the right thing"" and come forward with information. Dr Lawrence said he accepted the police's decision but he did not want to see the case closed completely. He said: ""My son is in the ground in Jamaica. ""[The killers] have walked around, some of them for 25 years, the only time I was able to see anything of my son was going to his grave. ""You do something, you should pay for it."" Dr Lawrence has said he remains hopeful that - with the publicity around the 25th anniversary of his son's death and aBBC documentary to air this week- someone will come forward with information.

"Actor Sir Patrick Stewart addressed the crowd during the launch MPs, celebrities and business leaders have launched a campaign calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. The People's Vote - which held a rally in Camden, north London, on Sunday - aims to unite anti-Brexit groups. Organisers said some 1,200 people were at the event, including MPs from all leading parties. Pro-Brexit campaigners also gathered outside. Both the Conservatives and Labour have ruled out a second referendum. Actor Sir Patrick Stewart, who played Charles Xavier in the X-Men films based on the comic books, said the famous character would have voted Remain. He told the rally: ""Unity, common cause, wellbeing of society and debate were paramount to the belief of this fictional character. ""Our country's future is at stake and we will not stand idly by. ""That is why I support a people's vote on the final deal."" This video can not be played Sir Patrick motivated by ""history and emotion"" to want to stay in the EU Britain voted to leave the EU by 51.9% to 48.1% in June 2016. The UK will formally cease to be an EU member in March 2019, and the two sides hope to reach a final deal on the terms of its exit by October - in time for it to be ratified by UK and European parliaments. Brexit: All you need to know Edinburgh march for vote on Brexit deal Speaking to the BBC at the event, Labour peer Lord Adonis said: ""People want a say... it was a vote in the dark two years ago. ""No-one had any idea what the consequences of Brexit were going to be."" And Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told attendees that Brexit was ""not inevitable"", adding: ""We'll do everything we can in Parliament for a people's vote. This issue is far too important to leave to the politicians."" Organisers said some 1,200 people were at the event Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Caroline Lucas are among the MPs supporting the campaign Conservative MP Anna Soubry told the crowd the UK was about to embark on a course that would ""make you and your grandchildren... less prosperous than you are now"". ""I think the best and right thing to do is to put it back to the people and say you can have a vote on this deal,"" she said. Chuka Umunna, MP for Streatham, said: ""We need more Conservative members of Parliament to be as brave as Anna and many others who defied the whip and put their country before their party."" Lib Dem Layla Moran said: ""Whether you voted to Leave or Remain... there is nothing more democratic than allowing the people to accept or reject a deal that will affect our country for decades to come."" Meanwhile, pro-Brexit demonstrators also turned up at the launch, and Conservative MP Nadine Dorries argued there was no public appetite for a second referendum. Appearing alongside Mr Umunna on ITV's Peston on Sunday, she said: ""A second referendum, Chukka, which is what you're really campaigning for, is never going to happen. The public don't want it."" Pro-Brexit campaigners gathered outside the event in London Earlier, actor Sir Patrick told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the ""terms and conditions"" of Brexit were ""quite unlike"" how they were presented during the run up to the 2016 referendum. Sir Patrick also said he was motivated by ""history and emotion"" to want to stay in the EU. ""I'm a war baby and growing up a lot of the world was not good. So the day we joined was one of the most exciting days of my adulthood,"" he added. Also speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson responded to the campaign, noting that the people's vote had already taken place: ""They voted with a substantial majority to leave the EU. We're now trying to deliver on that mandate from the people."" Mr Johnson addressed the remarks made by Sir Patrick, who also played the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. ""I think we'll get a great result and we'll be able to have, not only a gigantic free trade deal with our friends and partners across the Channel, but we'll be able to boldly go to areas we perhaps neglected over the past five years.""

"This video can not be played Comey assesses Trump in new memoir Former FBI director James Comey has said Donald Trump is ""morally unfit to be president"" and treats women like ""pieces of meat"". Mr Comey was giving his first major television interview since he was fired by President Trump last year. He told ABC News that Mr Trump lies constantly and may have obstructed justice. Hours before the interview aired, the president went on the offensive, accusing Mr Comey of ""many lies"". Mr Comey told ABC's 20/20 programme on Sunday night: ""I don't buy this stuff about him being mentally incompetent or early stages of dementia."" ""I don't think he's medically unfit to be president. I think he's morally unfit to be president. ""Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country. The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that,"" Mr Comey said. James Comey may be 'slimy', but he's not a liar Six claims about Trump in Comey book Trump's allies trash 'lyin' FBI memoir How Twitter saw Comey vs Trump row After the interview aired, Mr Trump's party - via the Republican National Committee - released a statement saying Mr Comey's publicity tour for his new book showed ""his true higher loyalty is to himself"".

""The only thing worse than Comey's history of misconduct is his willingness to say anything to sell books,"" it said. It is the latest development in a long-standing feud between the two men, further fuelled by the upcoming publication of Mr Comey's memoir A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership. The ex-FBI chief is on a publicity blitz for the book. President Trump has said the ""badly reviewed book"" raises ""big questions"". He also suggested Mr Comey should be imprisoned, and in recent days began referring to him as a ""slime ball"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The story dates back to the 2016 presidential election, when Mr Comey was FBI director, and the investigation into Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton's handling of classified emails on a private server while Secretary of State. In July 2016, he said that she had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of the emails, but the FBI would not press charges. However, in October, days before the vote, he sent a letter to Congress telling them the FBI wasreopening an investigationafter finding more emails.  The letter went public - andMrs Clinton says it handed Donald Trump the election. On 6 November, the FBI said it had completed its review into the new trove of emails and there would, again, be no charges. Once Mr Trump became president, Mr Comey says he tried to extract a pledge of personal loyalty from him - something the president fiercely denies. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year In March 2017, when alleged links between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia were being investigated by the FBI, Mr Trump allegedly pressured Mr Comey to publicly declare that the president was not personally being investigated - something the then director says he declined to do. Some Democrats blamed Mr Comey for costing Mrs Clinton the election, while Trump supporters felt he was targeting the president with the Russia investigation. Before revealing the new Clinton investigation, one staff member asked Mr Comey: ""Should you consider that what you're about do to may help elect Donald Trump president?"" Mr Comey said he responded: ""Down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent force."" On the Clinton probe more generally, he said: ""The FBI drove this investigation and we did it in a competent and independent way. I would bet my life on that."" He was fired by President Trump in May and found out about his dismissal by watching TV news. FBI boss who went from 'respect' to 'nut' The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words ABC News has released a full 42,000-word transcript of the interview,externalbetween Mr Comey and chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. A chunk of the interview deals with the sacking of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on 13 February 2017 for lying about contacts with the Russian ambassador. A day later, Mr Comey is sitting in the Oval Office with Mr Trump alone - the vice-president and the attorney-general have been asked to leave. The former FBI head asserts in the interview that Mr Trump tried to pressure him into dropping any investigation into Mr Flynn. ""I took it as a direction,"" he told Mr Stephanopoulos. ""He's - his words were, though, 'I hope you can let it go'."" Mr Comey says he let the comment pass, but concedes he should perhaps have suggested to the president that it would amount to obstruction of justice. ""It's certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend - and I'm just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor, it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent."" Mr Trump strongly denies Mr Comey's account. Analysis by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher James Comey thinks Donald Trump is a serial liar who degrades women and is ""morally unfit"" to be president. He says it's ""possible"" but ""unlikely"" that Russia has compromised the president, and that he may have obstructed the collusion investigation. He also believes the American people can't do anything about it until the November 2020 presidential election. That's just one of the contradictions that emerged in Mr Comey's interview. He said he strove to make non-political decisions about the highly political 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign. He spoke of integrity and honour, but confessed that he may not have had the ""guts"" to confront the president. The former director gave a complex interview reflecting a man challenged to draw meaning from his place at the centre of the biggest political stories of a lifetime. It made for gripping television. Now Trump loyalists will pick apart his remarks and return fire. ""Nobody gets out alive,"" Mr Comey quipped in the early days of the Clinton investigation. It wasn't really a joke then. And it certainly isn't now. Six explosive new claims by James Comey In the primetime TV interview, Mr Comey suggested that the president had surrounded himself with people loyal to him -  he compared Mr Trump to mob bosses he had investigated as a prosecutor. ""The loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant centre of everything, it's all about how do you serve the boss, what's in the boss' interests,"" he said. Asked if those around the president were ""enabling bad behaviour"", Mr Comey said: ""The challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him."" Mr Obama during Mr Comey's swearing in ceremony at the FBI in 2013 Mr Comey, however, said he did not believe President Trump should be impeached. ""I hope not because I think impeaching and removing Donald Trump from office would let the American people off the hook,"" he said. Instead, he said, it was something the American people were ""duty-bound to do directly"" at the voting booth. During the extensive interview, Mr Comey also said: ""A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they're pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it - that person's not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds"" Talking about himself in connection with the Clinton investigation, Mr Comey described himself as ""a deeply flawed human surrounded by other flawed humans trying to make decisions with an eye, not on politics, but on those higher values"" Readers of his book ""may still walk out of this thinking I'm an idiot, but I'm an honest idiot"" Three takeaways from James Comey's memoir.

"Demonstrations took place outside the Starbucks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Sunday Coffee chain Starbucks has apologised after two black men were arrested while waiting for a friend at one of their shops in the US city of Philadelphia. Amateur video shows police placing the pair, who were accused by shop staff of trespassing, in handcuffs. The footage has been widely shared since it was posted on Twitter and has led to accusations of racial profiling. Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson said the video was ""hard to watch"" and that the actions taken were ""wrong"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the incident, which took place on Thursday evening, the two men were approached by the store manager and asked to leave after they requested the use of the toilet without making a purchase, police said. In response, the men told staff that they were waiting for a friend and refused to leave. Philadelphia police commissioner Richard Ross said his officers were right to carry out the arrest after staff told them the pair were causing a disturbance and trespassing. ""If a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, they [the officers] now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties,"" Mr Ross said. In a statement released on Saturday,Mr Johnson expressed ""our deepest apologies"" to the two men involved in the incident,externaland said Starbucks would do ""whatever we can to make things right"". ""The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values,"" Mr Johnson said. He added that the call to the Philadelphia police department should not have been made on the ""basis"" of the events which took place beforehand. Black women wrongly accused of 'dine and dash' Does profiling make sense? However the footage of the incident, which has received nearly nine million views so far, sparked criticism and calls for a boycott of the Starbucks coffee store. On Sunday, people gathered outside the shop in protest. The company now plans to investigate its practices in order to ""prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again"", Mr Johnson said.

"Three people were hit by a car outside a nightclub in Talbot Road, Blackpool A teenager has been charged with injuring three women who were hit by a car in Blackpool. The pedestrians were struck by a Skoda estate in Talbot Road at about 23:50 BST on Saturday, leaving a woman in her 80s with a broken collarbone. A woman in her 70s suffered a sprained ankle and a third, aged in her 30s, had a broken tooth and leg injuries. Jake Hartley, 19, from Todmorden, appeared before Blackpool magistrates charged with attempted wounding. He was also charged with three offences of assault, dangerous driving, driving with more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood, driving without insurance and possession of a weapon. Mr Hartley, of Rochdale Road, was remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court on 16 May. Armed police attended the scene and a car was recovered outside Norbreck Castle Hotel. All three women have been discharged from hospital but officers believe other people may have suffered minor injuries and have urged them to get in touch.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of firefighters tackle the blaze in Sydney A large bushfire that has threatened homes in Sydney is likely to have been deliberately lit, Australian authorities say. The blaze, which began on Saturday, has burnt through 2,500 hectares of land in the city's southern suburbs. Some residents had been warned of immediate danger to their lives, but firefighters say the threat has eased. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) described the blaze as ""highly suspicious"". ""How dare anyone - if they are deliberately involved in lighting fires - endanger our firefighters and also [put] all these communities in harm's way,"" said Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. The bushfire forced some locals to evacuate their homes at the weekend, while others were told it was too dangerous to leave. Recent weather in south-eastern Australia has been unseasonably hot, with strong winds fanning bushfires. Firefighters use helicopters to dump water on the blaze Authorities said wind speeds were not as severe on Monday, making it easier to battle the blaze. Mr Fitzsimmons said flames travelled ""right up to the back fences"" of houses, but no properties had been lost. ""While the threat has eased, it is still a fairly vigilant fire ground and we want people to remain vigilant,"" he said. ""There is a lot of work still to be done today and maybe into tonight before we can call the fire contained."" How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay The deadly threat of hot weather and bushfires Police have declared the fire a crime scene. Mr Fitzsimmons said it was possible that winds could strengthen again and elevate the fire danger. At the weekend, residents hosed down their houses and lawns to prevent embers sparking new blazes ahead of the advancing fire front. Smoke seen from a football field in the suburb of Barden Ridge Major roads separating bushland and residences were cut off in some areas, and fire services used helicopters to dump water over key points. Pictures on social media showed firefighters and residents taking care of local wildlife affected by the blaze. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Maryna Kavaliauske with husband Giedrius A husband has paid tribute to his wife after she was found dead in a house along with another man. Formal identification is yet to take place but Sussex Police said the woman is believed to be Maryna Kavaliauske. Her husband of 15 years, Giedrius, said the 35-year-old was a wonderful mother to their children. A murder investigation was launched after Mrs Kavaliauske was found dead with a man believed to be Viasia Chernoff in South Farm Road, Worthing. Officers were called to the house in the early hours of Friday A spokesman for Sussex Police said a post-mortem examination on Saturday established she died from ligature compression to the neck. Mr Chernoff, known sometimes as Alex, was 43 and died from hanging, the force said. Mr Kavaliauske said the couple and their children, aged nine and 12, were a very happy family. The deceased were known to each other but not related, police said Det Supt Adam Hibbert said: ""At the present time we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation and our inquiries are continuing to establish the full circumstances of the deaths.

"Forensics teams were outside the address in Sudbourne Road on Sunday evening A man in his 20s has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death in Brixton, south London on Sunday evening. Police were called by the ambulance service to an address in Sudbourne Road, where a woman believed to be in her 30s was found with stab wounds. Despite the efforts of paramedics, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Police say the woman's next of kin are aware and it is believed the victim and suspect knew each other. The Metropolitan Police say this appears to be a domestic incident, rather than part of a ""knife-crime epidemic"". The arrested man is in custody at a south London police station. London's Air Ambulance also attended the scene and the Homicide and Major Crime Command have been informed.
